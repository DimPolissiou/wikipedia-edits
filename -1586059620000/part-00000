The network currently consists of three passenger routes, the [[Dulwich Hill Line|L1 Dulwich Hill]], [[Randwick and Kingsford Lines|L2 Randwick]] and [[Randwick and Kingsford Lines|L3 Kingsford]] lines. A separate light rail network serving Western Sydney called [[Parramatta Light Rail]] is also under construction as of 2020, and is scheduled for completion in 2023.\n\nThe network is controlled by [[Transport for NSW]], with day-to-day operation contracted to [[Transdev Australasia#Transdev Sydney|Transdev]]. In the year ended June 2019, 11.1&nbsp;million passenger journeys were made on the network, which only consisted of L1 at the time.\n\n==History==\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sydney developed an [[Trams in Sydney|extensive tram network]], which grew to be the second largest in the Southern Hemisphere and second largest in the [[Commonwealth]] after [[Trams in London|London]]. The increasing rate of private car ownership, perception that trams contributed to traffic congestion and the general rundown conditions of the network due the lack of funding after [[World War II]] led to the progressive replacement of tram services with buses, with the final section of the tram network closing on 25 February 1961.\n\n[[File:Fish Market light rail stop 1997 (4731800705).jpg|thumb|left|A Sydney Light Rail service in 1997 at the then-new [[Dulwich Hill Line#Fish Market|Fish Market station]]]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the inner city areas of [[Darling Harbour]] and [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] were the subject of an urban renewal program. In 1988 the [[Sydney Monorail]] opened, connecting Darling Harbour to the [[Sydney central business district|central business district]]. With poor integration between the monorail and other transport modes, and the increasing redevelopment of the Pyrmont peninsula \u2013 including the establishment of [[The Star, Sydney|Sydney's first legal casino]] \u2013 it was decided to convert a disused section of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] into a light rail line. A section of track between Pyrmont and [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]] was upgraded and a new on-street section was built to link the line to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]]. The line was set up as a [[public-private partnership]]. It opened in August 1997, running between Central station and [[Wentworth Park]], Pyrmont.\n\nThe private owner soon made proposals for a western extension continuing along the disused goods line, plus a new line through the central business district from Central to [[Circular Quay]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nominated Loan Council Allocations For 1998\u201399|url=http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/1998/047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|website=The Australian Treasury Website|accessdate=12 December 2015|date=7 May 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406195711/http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F1998%2F047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The western extension opened in 2000, terminating at [[Lilyfield]], but the company was unsuccessful in its attempts to develop a CBD line, which saw development of light rail stagnate for the remainder of the decade.\n\nBy contrast, the 2010s have seen major expansion and reform of light rail in Sydney including the announcement and delivery of multiple new infrastructure projects, integration of ticketing with the city's other transport modes, the introduction of new trams and the transfer of the network to full public ownership. The extensions announced during the decade total almost {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}}.

Opal is also valid on bus, train and ferry services but separate fares apply for these modes. Opal's light rail fares are the same as those for buses but the fares are not combined when interchanging between the two modes. This is due to change once the CBD and South East Light Rail opens; all light rail passengers interchanging with buses will only pay one fare, calculated from the start of their trip on one mode to the end of their trip on the other.<ref>{{cite web|title=Opal to go live on light rail months ahead of schedule|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|publisher=Transport for NSW|date=24 November 2014|access-date=24 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201221153/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|archive-date=1 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page Opal rollout extends to light rail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071610/http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page |date= 6 October 2014 }} Transport Info NSW 25 November 2014</ref> Light rail stops feature Opal top-up machines that also sell Opal single trip tickets.

No two stops on the existing line are located more than eight kilometres from each other using this method, so the 8&nbsp;km+ band doesn't apply to light rail services.\n\nWhen it first opened, the Inner West Light Rail used its own paper-based ticketing system. Paper tickets were originally sold from ticket machines on stop platforms but were later issued by conductors on board. During the 2010s this system gradually merged with the broader Sydney ticketing system, culminating in the introduction of Opal and the withdrawal of all other tickets.

The network currently consists of three passenger routes, the [[Dulwich Hill Line|L1 Dulwich Hill]], [[CBD and South East Light Rail|L2 Randwick]] and [[CBD and South East Light Rail|L3 Kingsford]] lines. A separate light rail network serving Western Sydney called [[Parramatta Light Rail]] is also under construction as of 2020, and is scheduled for completion in 2023.\n\nThe network is controlled by [[Transport for NSW]], with day-to-day operation contracted to [[Transdev Australasia#Transdev Sydney|Transdev]]. In the year ended June 2019, 11.1&nbsp;million passenger journeys were made on the network, which only consisted of L1 at the time.\n\n==History==\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sydney developed an [[Trams in Sydney|extensive tram network]], which grew to be the second largest in the Southern Hemisphere and second largest in the [[Commonwealth]] after [[Trams in London|London]]. The increasing rate of private car ownership, perception that trams contributed to traffic congestion and the general rundown conditions of the network due the lack of funding after [[World War II]] led to the progressive replacement of tram services with buses, with the final section of the tram network closing on 25 February 1961.\n\n[[File:Fish Market light rail stop 1997 (4731800705).jpg|thumb|left|A Sydney Light Rail service in 1997 at the then-new [[Dulwich Hill Line#Fish Market|Fish Market station]]]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the inner city areas of [[Darling Harbour]] and [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] were the subject of an urban renewal program. In 1988 the [[Sydney Monorail]] opened, connecting Darling Harbour to the [[Sydney central business district|central business district]]. With poor integration between the monorail and other transport modes, and the increasing redevelopment of the Pyrmont peninsula \u2013 including the establishment of [[The Star, Sydney|Sydney's first legal casino]] \u2013 it was decided to convert a disused section of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] into a light rail line. A section of track between Pyrmont and [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]] was upgraded and a new on-street section was built to link the line to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]]. The line was set up as a [[public-private partnership]]. It opened in August 1997, running between Central station and [[Wentworth Park]], Pyrmont.\n\nThe private owner soon made proposals for a western extension continuing along the disused goods line, plus a new line through the central business district from Central to [[Circular Quay]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nominated Loan Council Allocations For 1998\u201399|url=http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/1998/047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|website=The Australian Treasury Website|accessdate=12 December 2015|date=7 May 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406195711/http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F1998%2F047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The western extension opened in 2000, terminating at [[Lilyfield]], but the company was unsuccessful in its attempts to develop a CBD line, which saw development of light rail stagnate for the remainder of the decade.\n\nBy contrast, the 2010s have seen major expansion and reform of light rail in Sydney including the announcement and delivery of multiple new infrastructure projects, integration of ticketing with the city's other transport modes, the introduction of new trams and the transfer of the network to full public ownership.

Opal is also valid on bus, train and ferry services but separate fares apply for these modes. Opal's light rail fares are the same as those for buses but the fares are not combined when interchanging between the two modes. This is due to change once the CBD and South East Light Rail opens; all light rail passengers interchanging with buses will only pay one fare, calculated from the start of their trip on one mode to the end of their trip on the other.<ref>{{cite web|title=Opal to go live on light rail months ahead of schedule|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|publisher=Transport for NSW|date=24 November 2014|access-date=24 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201221153/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|archive-date=1 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page Opal rollout extends to light rail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071610/http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page |date= 6 October 2014 }} Transport Info NSW 25 November 2014</ref> Light rail stops feature Opal top-up machines that also sell Opal single trip tickets.

No two stops on the existing line are located more than eight kilometres from each other using this method, so the 8&nbsp;km+ band doesn't apply to light rail services.\n\nWhen it first opened, the Inner West Light Rail used its own paper-based ticketing system. Paper tickets were originally sold from ticket machines on stop platforms but were later issued by conductors on board. During the 2010s this system gradually merged with the broader Sydney ticketing system, culminating in the introduction of Opal and the withdrawal of all other tickets. This process was completed on 1 August 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=The last paper tickets to be wrapped up on August 1|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/last-paper-tickets-be-wrapped-august-1|publisher=Transport for NSW|date=4 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706072443/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/last-paper-tickets-be-wrapped-august-1|archivedate=6 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Potential extensions==\nSeveral transport corridors have significant potential to allow for the growth of the network beyond its current route structure.\n\n===Anzac Parade===\n[[File:Anzac Parade through Kingsford and Maroubra from the air.jpg|thumb|The southern section of Anzac Parade retains the wide median used by the former tram network.]]\nThe New South Wales Government's 2012 policy document entitled ''Sydney's Light Rail Future'' proposed investigating an extension of the CBD and South East Light Rail along the southern [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] corridor.<ref name=TransportNSW13Dec12>{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/publications/sydneys-light-rail-future.pdf|title=Sydney's Light Rail Future|publisher=[[Transport for NSW]]|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=17 March 2017|pages=20}}</ref>\n\nBy 2014 an initial investigation had commenced.

It orbits outside of the habitable zone of its star at a distance of 1.9 [[astronomical unit|AU]]. The exoplanet was found by using the [[Doppler spectroscopy|radial velocity method]], from [[radial velocity|radial-velocity]] measurements via observation of [[Doppler shift]]s in the [[spectrum]] of the [[planet|planet's]] parent star. The planet has a mildly eccentric orbit.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n===Mass, radius and temperature===\nHD 240237 b is a \"[[super-Jupiter]]\", an exoplanet that has a radius and mass larger than that of the gas giants [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. It has a temperature of {{convert|781|K|C F}}, around that of the surface temperature of [[Venus]].<ref name=PHL>http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/hec_plots/hec_orbit/hec_orbit_HD_240237_b.png</ref> It has an estimated mass of around 5.3 {{Jupiter mass}} and a potential radius of around 9% larger than Jupiter (1.11 {{Jupiter radius}}, or 12.2 {{Earth radius}}) based on its mass, since it is more massive than the jovian planet.\n\n===Host star===\nThe planet orbits a ([[Stellar classification#Class K|K-type]]) [[giant star]] named [[HD 240237]]. It has exhausted the [[hydrogen]] supply in its core and is currently fusing helium. The star has a mass of 1.69 {{Solar mass}} and a radius of around 32 {{Solar radius}}. It has a surface temperature of 4361[[Kelvin|K]] and is likely 2&nbsp;billion years old based on its mass and evolution.

The lower receiver holds the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]] assembly including the [[Hammer (firearms)|hammer]], and is the attachment point for the [[buttstock]]. The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires removal of these pins. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a [[hinge]].<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe upper receiver contains the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier assembly, and is attached to the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] assembly. [[Sight (device)|Sights]] will be attached to the upper receiver or to the barrel assembly. A handguard usually encloses the barrel and a [[gas-operated reloading]] device using burnt powder gas vented from a hole (or port) in the barrel near the forward end of the handguard. The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel.<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the butt stock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting un-burned [[smokeless powder]] residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions. A more recent alternative design has a metal operating rod pushing against the bolt carrier from a gas piston under the hand guard near the barrel port. This piston keeps the receiver cleaner by exhausting under the hand guard.<ref name=max>{{cite web |url=https://modernfirearms.net/en/civilian-rifles/u-s-a-civilian-rifles/vintovki-tipa-ar-15-eng/ |title=Ar-15-type rifles |last=Popenker |first=Maxim |website=Modern Firearms |publisher= |accessdate=27 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226030606/http://modernfirearms.net/en/civilian-rifles/u-s-a-civilian-rifles/vintovki-tipa-ar-15-eng/ |archive-date=26 February 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> While both the DGI and piston systems produce semi-automatic fire, an alternative un-ported barrel assembly includes a sliding hand guard connected to a rod moving the bolt by a [[pump action]] and eliminating semi-automatic fire.<ref name=nra>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2015/9/3/review-troy-223-national-sporting-pump-action-rifle/ |title=Review: Troy 223 National Sporting Pump-Action Rifle |last=Horman |first=B.

The primary distinction between civilian semi-automatic rifles and military assault rifles is [[select fire]]. Military models were produced with firing modes, [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic fire]] and either fully [[Automatic firearm|automatic fire]] mode or [[Burst mode (weapons)|burst fire]] mode, in which the rifle fires several rounds in succession when the trigger is depressed.

Parts changed include the lower receiver, bolt carrier, hammer, trigger, disconnector, and safety/mode selector. The semi-automatic bolt carrier has a longer lightening slot to prevent the bolt's engagement with an automatic sear. Due to a decrease in mass the buffer spring is heavier. On the select fire version, the hammer has an extra spur which interacts with the additional auto-sear that holds it back until the bolt carrier group is fully in battery, when automatic fire is selected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hanks|first1=D.

These carbines have become popular for police use in confined urban spaces, and the collapsible buttstock compensates for the additional thickness of [[body armor]]. The shorter barrel reduced bullet velocity by about five percent, and bullet energy by about ten percent. The shorter barrel required moving the gas port closer to the chamber exposing the self-loading system to higher pressures and temperatures which increase stress on moving parts like the bolt lugs and extractor. Although Colt offered a heavier 20-inch barrel for improved accuracy beginning in 1986, increased barrel weight may impair [[ergonomic]] balance; so shorter barrels have dominated recent rifle production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knupp |first=Jeremiah |year=2019 |title=This Is My Rifle: The Case For The 20\"-Barreled AR-15 |journal=American Rifleman |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201345 & 70\u201372 |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver (M4 variant) which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/> While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled.<ref name=\"Sweeney2016bm\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing the AR-15, the Bench Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88WdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 August 2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4660-9|pages=7\u20139}}</ref> From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Makes the AR-15 So Appealing to Mass Shooters? |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/ar-15-mass-murderer-link/ |first=Meghan |last=O\u2019Dea |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 15, 2018 |quote=While Colt alone makes the official AR-15, variants and knock-offs are made by a huge number of gun manufactures, including Bushmaster, Les Baer, Remington, Smith & Wesson (swhc, +0.00%), and Sturm & Ruger (rgr, -2.04%), just to name a few.

Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a [[hinge]].<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe upper receiver contains the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier assembly, and is attached to the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] assembly.

The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel.<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the butt stock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting un-burned [[smokeless powder]] residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions. A more recent alternative design has a metal operating rod pushing against the bolt carrier from a gas piston under the hand guard near the barrel port.

Military models were produced with firing modes, [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic fire]] and either fully [[Automatic firearm|automatic fire]] mode or [[Burst mode (weapons)|burst fire]] mode, in which the rifle fires several rounds in succession when the trigger is depressed.

The semi-automatic bolt carrier has a longer lightening slot to prevent the bolt's engagement with an automatic sear. Due to a decrease in mass the buffer spring is heavier. On the select fire version, the hammer has an extra spur which interacts with the additional auto-sear that holds it back until the bolt carrier group is fully in battery, when automatic fire is selected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hanks|first1=D.

These carbines have become popular for police use in confined urban spaces, and the collapsible buttstock compensates for the additional thickness of [[body armor]]. The shorter barrel reduced bullet velocity by about five percent, and bullet energy by about ten percent. The shorter barrel required moving the gas port closer to the chamber exposing the self-loading system to higher pressures and temperatures which increase stress on moving parts like the bolt lugs and extractor. Although Colt offered a heavier 20-inch barrel for improved accuracy beginning in 1986, increased barrel weight may impair [[ergonomic]] balance; so shorter barrels have dominated recent rifle production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knupp |first=Jeremiah |year=2019 |title=This Is My Rifle: The Case For The 20\"-Barreled AR-15 |journal=American Rifleman |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201345 & 70\u201372 |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver (M4 variant) which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/> While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled.<ref name=\"Sweeney2016bm\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing the AR-15, the Bench Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88WdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 August 2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4660-9|pages=7\u20139}}</ref> From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Makes the AR-15 So Appealing to Mass Shooters? |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/ar-15-mass-murderer-link/ |first=Meghan |last=O\u2019Dea |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 15, 2018 |quote=While Colt alone makes the official AR-15, variants and knock-offs are made by a huge number of gun manufactures, including Bushmaster, Les Baer, Remington, Smith & Wesson (swhc, +0.00%), and Sturm & Ruger (rgr, -2.04%), just to name a few.

When the barrier is inadvertently dispelled, Maleficent attacks Ben's coronation and transforms into a [[dragon]].  With Ben encouraging her to make her own choice, Mal decides to be good. She and her friends rebuke Maleficent, turning her into a small [[lizard]], from which state she can recover if she fills her heart with love. The people of Auradon celebrate.\n\n===''Descendants 2'' (2017)===\n{{main|Descendants 2}}\n''Descendants 2'' was announced on August 15, 2015, at the D23 Expo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/s/descendants-sequel-ordered-disney-channel-200158025.html|title=Descendants Sequel Ordered at Disney Channel|website=www.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> The film premiered on July 21, 2017, and was simulcast on six channels: [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Disney Channel]], [[Disney XD]], [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]], and [[Lifetime Movies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/scene/vpage/descendants-2-premiere-dove-cameron-disney-channel-1202493764/|title=\u2018Descendants 2\u2019 Cast Talks \u2018Bigger\u2019 Sets and Musical Numbers at Disney Channel Premiere|last=Saval|first=Malina|last2=Saval|first2=Malina|date=2017-07-12|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> The movie was watched by 5.3 million viewers on Disney Channel and 8.9 million through all six networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/more-tv-news/descendants-2-is-bigger-but-also-smaller-than-its-predecessor/|title=\u2018Descendants 2\u2019 is bigger (but also smaller) than its predecessor [Updated]|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=2017-07-24|website=TV By The Numbers|language=en|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\nMal struggles with her new celebrity life as King Ben's girlfriend, secretly using magic to maintain a lifestyle she feels is a fa\u00e7ade.  Mal decides she does not belong in Auradon; she returns to the Isle, where gang leadership has fallen to her old rival, pirate captain Uma ([[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]]'s daughter), and her first and second mates, respectively, Harry ([[Captain Hook]]'s son) and Gil ([[Gaston (Beauty and the Beast)|Gaston]]'s son). Evie, Jay, and Carlos agree to help Ben find her, but Mal rejects Ben, believing it best for him and Auradon. Uma captures Ben and demands the Fairy Godmother's wand in exchange for his life. Uma resents not being chosen to live in Auradon; Ben respects her as a leader and invites her to Auradon, but she vows to make her own way there instead. Using a [[3D printing|3D-printed]] decoy wand, Mal's group rescues Ben. At the shipboard Royal Cotillion, Uma appears as Ben's date and he announces he will destroy the barrier; Mal realizes Uma has cast a spell on Ben. When Mal discovers Ben commissioned a portrait that depicts her as she was before she changed herself with magic, she accepts the emotion of love and kisses Ben, breaking the spell. Uma and Mal battle, transforming into an [[octopus]] and a [[dragon]], respectively. Ben tries to negotiate with Uma, but she leaves, unreconciled. Evie asks to bring more children from the Isle to Auradon and Ben agrees.\n\n===''Descendants 3'' (2019)===\n{{main|Descendants 3}}\n\nDisney Channel ordered the third film of the franchise on February 16, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/disney-announces-descendants-3-1202703195/|title=Disney Announces 'Descendants 3' for 2019|work=Variety|author=Ariana Brockington|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=2018-02-17}}</ref> The film premiered on August 2, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1036123/hades-is-pretty-mad-in-first-look-at-cheyenne-jackson-s-new-descendants-3-villain|title=Hades Is Pretty Mad in First Look at Cheyenne Jackson's New Descendants 3 Villain|website=EOnline.com|author=Lauren Piester|date=April 27, 2019|accessdate=April 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Descendants 3 Gets August Premiere Date, New Music Video \u2014 Watch|url=https://tvline.com/2019/05/31/descendants-3-premiere-date-watch-good-to-be-bad-music-video/|work=[[TVLine]]|date=May 31, 2019}}</ref> The movie received 4.6 million viewers on its premiere night.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-8-2-2019.html|title=UPDATED: SHOWBUZZDAILY\u2019s Top 150 Friday Cable Originals\u00a0& Network Finals: 8.2.2019 {{!}} Showbuzz Daily|website=www.showbuzzdaily.com|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Ben proposes to Mal, making her the future queen of Auradon.

Iloilo}}; {{lang-krj|Kapuoran kang Iloilo}}) is a [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] located in the [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] of [[Western Visayas]] in the [[Philippines]]. Iloilo occupies a major southeast portion of the [[Visayas|Visayan island]] of [[Panay]] and is bordered by the province of [[Antique (province)|Antique]] to the west, [[Capiz]] to the north, the [[Jintotolo Channel]] to the northeast, the [[Guimaras Strait]] to the east, and the [[Iloilo Strait]] and [[Panay Gulf]] to the southwest.\n\nJust off Iloilo's southeast coast is the island province of [[Guimaras]], once part of Iloilo but now an independent province. Across the Panay Gulf and Guimaras Strait is [[Negros Occidental]], occupying the northwestern half of the larger [[Negros (Philippines)|island of Negros]]. [[Iloilo City]], its capital, ''\"the Queen City of the South,\"'' is geographically located in the province but remains politically independent from the provincial government. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of the province (excluding Iloilo City) is {{PH wikidata|population_total}}. If Iloilo City is included, the population is 2,361,042 in total.\n\n==History==\n{{See also | Maragtas | Kedatuan of Madja-as\n | Philippines#Early_historic_coastal_city-states_and_polities| label 3 = Early historic coastal city-states and polities of Philippines | Indian cultural influences in early Philippine polities | Greater India | Indosphere}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Spanish Empire|Imperial Spanish conquest]], writing was a new import and the use of organic medium such as leaf and bamboo, and no pre-Hispanic written accounts of Iloilo exist today. Oral history, in the form of recited epics, has survived to a small degree, with a few recordings made from the last known surviving [[binukot]]s. But from these oral history and from writings from other sources, one can still glean Iloilo's ancient pre-colonial past.\n\nThe controversial origins of the people of Iloilo is said{{by whom|date=May 2014}} to be from the state of [[Pannai]], a nation occupying Sumatra. Pannai was a militant nation allied under the empire-mandala of the [[Srivijaya]] that defended the conflict-ridden [[Strait of Malacca]]. The small kingdom repulsed any unlicensed Chinese, Indian or Arab navies that often warred in or pirated the straits of Malacca and for a small nation, they were adept at taking down armadas larger than itself. They were successful in policing and defending the straights of Malacca for the Srivijaya until the [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]] occurred, where in a surprise attack from behind, originating from the occupied capital, rendered the militant-state of [[Pannai]] vulnerable from an unprotected assault from the back flank. The Chola invaders eventually destroyed the state of Pannai and its surviving soldiers, royals and scholars were said to have been secreted-out eastwards. The high-borne scholars, soldiers and nobles of Pannai, \"fled to other islands.\" <ref>Francisco Colin, S.J.; Madrid, published in 1663 , from his Labor evang\u00e9lica</ref>\n\nAt this juncture, Iloilo came into prominence, when the local settlement called Irong-Irong and was founded by Datu Paiburong, who presumably fled the fallen Srivijaya Empire after he and his fellows within the new mandala of [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]], bought the island of [[Panay]] (Which they presumably named after the state of [[Pannai]] or the shortening of the Ati word, Ananipay) from Marikudo, the chieftain of the [[Ati people]]. The Kedatuan of Madja-as eventually grew a powerful and strong naval presence that it rivaled the nearby states of the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]], the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] when it came to wealth and prestige.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align        = left\n| width    = 160\n| image1   = Visayans_3.png\n| alt1     = \n| caption1 = \n| image2   = Visayans_4.png\n| alt2     = \n| caption2 = \n| footer   = '''Left to right''': Images from the [[Boxer Codex]] illustrating an ancient ''kadatuan'' or [[tumao]] of the [[Visayan]]s of Panay wearing the distinctive colors of their social status: ['''1'''] a [[Nobility|noble]] couple and ['''2'''] a [[Royal family|royal]] couple. The wealth and prestige of these Visayans from Panay are clearly demonstrated vis-a-vis their [[loincloth]]-wearing Cebuano neighbors which the Spaniards called \"Pintados\" or \"Tattooed Ones\"\n| footer_align = left\n}}\n\nBy 1512, this state had grown so powerful militarily and economically, their naval power regularly threatened Chinese imperial shipping. So much so, that the Chuan-chou gazeeter specifically reported that the Pi-she-yah (Bisaya) (Another term for people from Iloilo) consistently made devastating raids against the Empire's commerce<ref>Chuan-chou Fu-chi (Ch.10) Year 1512</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Spain eventually succeeded on conquering of the island of [[Panay]] when Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] moved his headquarters from the island of [[Cebu]] and creating the first Spanish settlement in the island in [[Oton|Ogtong]] in 1566. This is mainly due in part to the rivalries between the [[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]] and the [[Moro people|Moro]], of which the former found an ally in Spanish against the latter. The Bisaya accepted alliances with Spain, to defend themselves against the enslaving Moros. To this end, Iloilo contributed troops in the [[Castille War]] against the [[Sultanate of Brunei]]. In 1581, the encomienda in Ogtong was moved to [[Arevalo, Iloilo City|La Villa Rica de Arevalo]], because of frequent coastal raids by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] privateers. Furthermore, an attack in the year 1600 (Part of the [[Spanish\u2013Moro conflict]]) where there was a large Muslim armada to destroy Iloilo City, led by two [[Moro people|Moro]]s named Sirungan and Salikala who lead the Muslim force of 70 ships and 4,000 warriors that had raided and attacked several Visayan islands in order to abduct slaves to sell to their allies in the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and the [[Sultanate of Malacca]], eventually caused the move of the city center further on to the mouth of the Irong-Irong river founding what is now [[Iloilo City]] and constructing Fort San Pedro to defend it in 1616.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009183141/http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-2.html |archivedate=2014-10-09 }}</ref> Nevertheless, when the 4,000 Moros led by Sirungan and Salikala tried to attack Iloilo City they were repulsed with heavy losses in the town of Arevalo by a force of 1,000 [[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynon]] warriors and 70 Mexican arquebusiers under the command of Juan Garc\u00eda de Sierra, the Spanish officer who died in the battle.<ref>''Philippines: A Unique Nation'' By Dr. Sonia  M.

As a result, it received Chinese immigrants from the west (that worked for its trades) and [[Latinos]] from the ports of Mexico in the east (to man its military installations). And over time Iloilo grew to be the most important province outside Manila. The City of Iloilo by virtue of a Royal Decree of 1896 was given the honor of having a coat of arms with the Inscription: \"''La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad de Iloilo'' (The Most Loyal and Noble City) in reward for its loyalty to Spain during the Philippine uprising.\n\nDuring the American period, Iloilo then became a home to many firsts: including the first department stores and cinema theaters in the nation. Nevertheless, Iloilo experienced a fall from grace after undergoing severe devastation during [[World War II]], followed by a decline during the 1950s to the 1990s. In part due to the great Iloilo fire which ruined the provincial economy and the slow death of the sugar and textile industries that eventually some prominent families (Iloilo then, had the highest concentration of millionaires outside Manila), as well as the provincial bourgeoisie, abandoned the city to go to other areas such as [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Cebu]], [[Mindanao]] and [[Metro Manila]]. Still, the large middle-class populace of Iloilo and its agri-business sector has managed to maintain both province and city, despite the exodus of some of its prominent families.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ph fil iloilo.png|thumb|upright=0.75]]\n\nThe province covers a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} occupying the central and eastern section of [[Panay]] island in the [[Western Visayas]] region. If Iloilo City is included for geographical purposes, Iloilo has an area of {{Convert|5079.17|km2}}. The province is bordered by [[Antique (province)|province of Antique]] to the west, [[Capiz]] to the north, the [[Jintotolo Channel]] to the northeast, the [[Visayan Sea]] and [[Guimaras Strait]] to the east, and the [[Iloilo Strait]] and [[Panay Gulf]] to the southwest.\n\nThe province is divided into two distinct geographic regions; the highlands of the [[Central Panay Mountain Range]] on the western border and the lowland plains which account for a larger portion of the province. Small islands east of its northernmost tip also dot the [[Visayan Sea]] - of these, [[Pan de Azucar Island (Iloilo)|Pan de Azucar]] and [[Sicogon Island|Sicogon]] are well-known. [[Mount Baloy]] is the highest mountain in Iloilo with an elevation of {{Convert|6261|ft}} above sea level, located on the triple border of Iloilo, Capiz, and Antique. Other peaks are [[Mount Llorente]] 4,409&nbsp;ft. (1,344m), [[Mount Sansanan]] 4,219&nbsp;ft. (1,286m), [[Mount Napulak]] 4,095&nbsp;ft. (1,248 m), [[Mount Balabag]] 3,728&nbsp;ft. (1,136m).\n\nExpansive fishponds and mangrove wetlands are found along the coasts and rivers of [[Iloilo City]] and the towns of [[Oton]], [[Leganes]], [[Zarraga]], [[Dumangas]], [[Anilao, Iloilo|Anilao]], [[Banate]], [[Barotac Viejo]], [[Barotac Nuevo]], [[Ajuy, Iloilo|Ajuy]], [[Balasan]] and [[Carles, Iloilo|Carles]].\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe Province of Iloilo consists of 42 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] (one [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|component]] and one [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|highly urbanized]]).\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#BFF5FF|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and highly urbanized city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

If the highly urbanized [[Iloilo City|city of Iloilo]] is included for statistical purposes, the province's total population is 2,361,042 people, with a density of {{Pop density|2361042|5079.17|km2|mi2|prec=0}}.\n\nPeople from Iloilo are called [[Ilonggo people|Ilonggos]]. There are three local languages used in the province: [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon (Ilonggo)]], [[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a]] and [[Capiznon language|Capiznon]]. Hiligaynon and dialects/variants of it are spoken in [[Iloilo City]] and in some towns of the province, especially to the northeast. Spanish is strictly a local language, at least in a historical way with the number of natural Spanish speakers strongly declining after WWII, and due to this, there are today many Ilonggos who do not consider it a local language.\n\n===Language===\n[[File:The Ten Commandments in Hiligaynon at Molo Church, Iloilo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|The Ten Commandments in [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], the predominant language of [[Panay]]]]\n\n{{bar box\n| title    = Languages Spoken (2000)<ref>[https://www.census.gov.ph/content/over-one-and-half-million-persons-iloilo Table 5.

It is also spoken in the neighboring provinces, such as [[Capiz]], [[Antique (province)|Antique]], [[Aklan]], [[Masbate]], [[Palawan]] and [[Romblon]] as well as in some parts of [[Maguindanao]]. It is also spoken as a second language by [[Cebuano language|Cebuano speakers]] in [[Negros Oriental]], [[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a speakers]] in [[Antique (province)|Antique]], [[Aklanon language|Aklanon/Malaynon speakers]] in [[Aklan]], and [[Capiznon language|Capiznon speakers]] in [[Capiz]].\n\nThe language is referred to as ''Ilonggo'' in Iloilo and [[Negros Occidental]]. More precisely, Ilonggo is an ethno-linguistic group referring to the people living in southeastern [[Panay]] and its associated culture. The boundaries of the language called Ilonggo and that called Hiligaynon are unclear. The disagreement of which name is correct extends to [[Philippine languages|Philippine language]] specialists and native laypeople.\n\n===Religion===\nIloilo is Catholic predominated province comprising about 60%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population. Protestant churches also exist such as members of [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]] or Aglipayan Church with 35%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population, Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Adventist, and other Evangelical Christians; There are also non Protestant and other Christian sects such as Iglesia Ni Cristo, Church of Christ of Latter day Saints (Mormon) and Jehovah's Witnesses while non Christians are usually represented by Muslims, and to a lesser extent, Buddhists and Hindus.\n\n==Culture==\nSpanish architecture can be seen in old buildings in downtown Iloilo. Ancient [[Indonesians]], [[Malaysians]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], and later the [[People of India|Indian]], [[Arab people|Arab]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] merchants were already trading with the Ilonggos, long before the arrival of the Mexicans, Spaniards and other Europeans. The ruling Spanish government encouraged these foreign merchants to trade in Iloilo but they were not given privileges like ownership of land. Foreign merchants and Spaniards intermarried with the locals, and the Mestizo class was eventually born from their union.  The Mestizo offspring of the local nobilities later emerged as the ruling class of the Ilonggos (see [[Principal\u00eda]]).\n\nThe town's fiesta is one of the most important events for Ilonggos. Almost every town (municipality) in Iloilo has a fiesta and festival celebrated annually.\n\nIloilo is also home to two of the nation's cultural minorities the Sulod-Bukidnon and the Ati.\n\n==Government==\n* [[Governor of Iloilo |Governor]]: [[Arthur Defensor Jr. |Arthur R.

Iloilo occupies a major southeast portion of the [[Visayas|Visayan island]] of [[Panay]] and is bordered by the province of [[Antique (province)|Antique]] to the west, [[Capiz]] to the north, the [[Jintotolo Channel]] to the northeast, the [[Guimaras Strait]] to the east, and the [[Iloilo Strait]] and [[Panay Gulf]] to the southwest.\n\nJust off Iloilo's southeast coast is the island province of [[Guimaras]], once part of Iloilo but now an independent province. Across the Panay Gulf and Guimaras Strait is [[Negros Occidental]], occupying the northwestern half of the larger [[Negros (Philippines)|island of Negros]]. [[Iloilo City]], its capital, ''\"the Queen City of the South'' is geographically located in the province but remains politically independent from the provincial government. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of the province (excluding Iloilo City) is {{PH wikidata|population_total}}. If Iloilo City is included, the population is 2,361,042 in total.\n\n==History==\n{{See also | Maragtas | Kedatuan of Madja-as\n | Philippines#Early_historic_coastal_city-states_and_polities| label 3 = Early historic coastal city-states and polities of Philippines | Indian cultural influences in early Philippine polities | Greater India | Indosphere}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Spanish Empire|Imperial Spanish conquest]], writing was a new import and the use of organic medium such as leaf and bamboo, and no pre-Hispanic written accounts of Iloilo exist today. Oral history, in the form of recited epics, has survived to a small degree, with a few recordings made from the last known surviving [[binukot]]s. But from these oral history and from writings from other sources, one can still glean Iloilo's ancient pre-colonial past.\n\nThe controversial origins of the people of Iloilo is said{{by whom|date=May 2014}} to be from the state of [[Pannai]], a nation occupying Sumatra. Pannai was a militant nation allied under the empire-mandala of the [[Srivijaya]] that defended the conflict-ridden [[Strait of Malacca]]. The small kingdom repulsed any unlicensed Chinese, Indian or Arab navies that often warred in or pirated the straits of Malacca and for a small nation, they were adept at taking down armadas larger than itself. They were successful in policing and defending the straights of Malacca for the Srivijaya until the [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]] occurred, where in a surprise attack from behind, originating from the occupied capital, rendered the militant-state of [[Pannai]] vulnerable from an unprotected assault from the back flank. The Chola invaders eventually destroyed the state of Pannai and its surviving soldiers, royals and scholars were said to have been secreted-out eastwards. The high-borne scholars, soldiers and nobles of Pannai, \"fled to other islands.\" <ref>Francisco Colin, S.J.; Madrid, published in 1663 , from his Labor evang\u00e9lica</ref>\n\nAt this juncture, Iloilo came into prominence, when the local settlement called Irong-Irong and was founded by Datu Paiburong, who presumably fled the fallen Srivijaya Empire after he and his fellows within the new mandala of [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]], bought the island of [[Panay]] (Which they presumably named after the state of [[Pannai]] or the shortening of the Ati word, Ananipay) from Marikudo, the chieftain of the [[Ati people]]. The Kedatuan of Madja-as eventually grew a powerful and strong naval presence that it rivaled the nearby states of the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]], the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] when it came to wealth and prestige.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align        = left\n| width    = 160\n| image1   = Visayans_3.png\n| alt1     = \n| caption1 = \n| image2   = Visayans_4.png\n| alt2     = \n| caption2 = \n| footer   = '''Left to right''': Images from the [[Boxer Codex]] illustrating an ancient ''kadatuan'' or [[tumao]] of the [[Visayan]]s of Panay wearing the distinctive colors of their social status: ['''1'''] a [[Nobility|noble]] couple and ['''2'''] a [[Royal family|royal]] couple. The wealth and prestige of these Visayans from Panay are clearly demonstrated vis-a-vis their [[loincloth]]-wearing Cebuano neighbors which the Spaniards called \"Pintados\" or \"Tattooed Ones\"\n| footer_align = left\n}}\n\nBy 1512, this state had grown so powerful militarily and economically, their naval power regularly threatened Chinese imperial shipping. So much so, that the Chuan-chou gazeeter specifically reported that the Pi-she-yah (Bisaya) (Another term for people from Iloilo) consistently made devastating raids against the Empire's commerce<ref>Chuan-chou Fu-chi (Ch.10) Year 1512</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Spain eventually succeeded on conquering of the island of [[Panay]] when Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] moved his headquarters from the island of [[Cebu]] and creating the first Spanish settlement in the island in [[Oton|Ogtong]] in 1566. This is mainly due in part to the rivalries between the [[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]] and the [[Moro people|Moro]], of which the former found an ally in Spanish against the latter. The Bisaya accepted alliances with Spain, to defend themselves against the enslaving Moros. To this end, Iloilo contributed troops in the [[Castille War]] against the [[Sultanate of Brunei]]. In 1581, the encomienda in Ogtong was moved to [[Arevalo, Iloilo City|La Villa Rica de Arevalo]], because of frequent coastal raids by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] privateers. Furthermore, an attack in the year 1600 (Part of the [[Spanish\u2013Moro conflict]]) where there was a large Muslim armada to destroy Iloilo City, led by two [[Moro people|Moro]]s named Sirungan and Salikala who lead the Muslim force of 70 ships and 4,000 warriors that had raided and attacked several Visayan islands in order to abduct slaves to sell to their allies in the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and the [[Sultanate of Malacca]], eventually caused the move of the city center further on to the mouth of the Irong-Irong river founding what is now [[Iloilo City]] and constructing Fort San Pedro to defend it in 1616.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009183141/http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-2.html |archivedate=2014-10-09 }}</ref> Nevertheless, when the 4,000 Moros led by Sirungan and Salikala tried to attack Iloilo City they were repulsed with heavy losses in the town of Arevalo by a force of 1,000 [[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynon]] warriors and 70 Mexican arquebusiers under the command of Juan Garc\u00eda de Sierra, the Spanish officer who died in the battle.<ref>''Philippines: A Unique Nation'' By Dr. Sonia  M.

As a result, it received Chinese immigrants from the west (that worked for its trades) and [[Latinos]] from the ports of Mexico in the east (to man its military installations). And over time Iloilo grew to be the most important province outside Manila. The City of Iloilo by virtue of a Royal Decree of 1896 was given the honor of having a coat of arms with the Inscription: \"''La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad de Iloilo'' (The Most Loyal and Noble City) in reward for its loyalty to Spain during the Philippine uprising.\n\nDuring the American period, Iloilo then became a home to many firsts: including the first department stores and cinema theaters in the nation. Nevertheless, Iloilo experienced a fall from grace after undergoing severe devastation during [[World War II]], followed by a decline during the 1950s to the 1990s. In part due to the great Iloilo fire which ruined the provincial economy and the slow death of the sugar and textile industries that eventually some prominent families (Iloilo then, had the highest concentration of millionaires outside Manila), as well as the provincial bourgeoisie, abandoned the city to go to other areas such as [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], [[Cebu]], [[Mindanao]] and [[Metro Manila]]. Still, the large middle-class populace of Iloilo and its agri-business sector has managed to maintain both province and city, despite the exodus of some of its prominent families.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ph fil iloilo.png|thumb|upright=0.75]]\n\nThe province covers a total area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|nscb}} occupying the central and eastern section of [[Panay]] island in the [[Western Visayas]] region. If Iloilo City is included for geographical purposes, Iloilo has an area of {{Convert|5079.17|km2}}. The province is bordered by [[Antique (province)|province of Antique]] to the west, [[Capiz]] to the north, the [[Jintotolo Channel]] to the northeast, the [[Visayan Sea]] and [[Guimaras Strait]] to the east, and the [[Iloilo Strait]] and [[Panay Gulf]] to the southwest.\n\nThe province is divided into two distinct geographic regions; the highlands of the [[Central Panay Mountain Range]] on the western border and the lowland plains which account for a larger portion of the province. Small islands east of its northernmost tip also dot the [[Visayan Sea]] - of these, [[Pan de Azucar Island (Iloilo)|Pan de Azucar]] and [[Sicogon Island|Sicogon]] are well-known. [[Mount Baloy]] is the highest mountain in Iloilo with an elevation of {{Convert|6261|ft}} above sea level, located on the triple border of Iloilo, Capiz, and Antique. Other peaks are [[Mount Llorente]] 4,409&nbsp;ft. (1,344m), [[Mount Sansanan]] 4,219&nbsp;ft. (1,286m), [[Mount Napulak]] 4,095&nbsp;ft. (1,248 m), [[Mount Balabag]] 3,728&nbsp;ft. (1,136m).\n\nExpansive fishponds and mangrove wetlands are found along the coasts and rivers of [[Iloilo City]] and the towns of [[Oton]], [[Leganes]], [[Zarraga]], [[Dumangas]], [[Anilao, Iloilo|Anilao]], [[Banate]], [[Barotac Viejo]], [[Barotac Nuevo]], [[Ajuy, Iloilo|Ajuy]], [[Balasan]] and [[Carles, Iloilo|Carles]].\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe Province of Iloilo consists of 42 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] (one [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|component]] and one [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|highly urbanized]]).\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#BFF5FF|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and highly urbanized city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

If the highly urbanized [[Iloilo City|city of Iloilo]] is included for statistical purposes, the province's total population is 2,361,042 people, with a density of {{Pop density|2361042|5079.17|km2|mi2|prec=0}}.\n\nPeople from Iloilo are called [[Ilonggo people|Ilonggos]]. There are three local languages used in the province: [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon (Ilonggo)]], [[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a]] and [[Capiznon language|Capiznon]]. Hiligaynon and dialects/variants of it are spoken in [[Iloilo City]] and in some towns of the province, especially to the northeast. Spanish is strictly a local language, at least in a historical way with the number of natural Spanish speakers strongly declining after WWII, and due to this, there are today many Ilonggos who do not consider it a local language.\n\n===Language===\n[[File:The Ten Commandments in Hiligaynon at Molo Church, Iloilo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|The Ten Commandments in [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], the predominant language of [[Panay]]]]\n\n{{bar box\n| title    = Languages Spoken (2000)<ref>[https://www.census.gov.ph/content/over-one-and-half-million-persons-iloilo Table 5.

It is also spoken in the neighboring provinces, such as [[Capiz]], [[Antique (province)|Antique]], [[Aklan]], [[Masbate]], [[Palawan]] and [[Romblon]] as well as in some parts of [[Maguindanao]]. It is also spoken as a second language by [[Cebuano language|Cebuano speakers]] in [[Negros Oriental]], [[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a speakers]] in [[Antique (province)|Antique]], [[Aklanon language|Aklanon/Malaynon speakers]] in [[Aklan]], and [[Capiznon language|Capiznon speakers]] in [[Capiz]].\n\nThe language is referred to as ''Ilonggo'' in Iloilo and [[Negros Occidental]]. More precisely, Ilonggo is an ethno-linguistic group referring to the people living in southeastern [[Panay]] and its associated culture. The boundaries of the language called Ilonggo and that called Hiligaynon are unclear. The disagreement of which name is correct extends to [[Philippine languages|Philippine language]] specialists and native laypeople.\n\n===Religion===\nIloilo is Catholic predominated province comprising about 60%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population. Protestant churches also exist such as members of [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]] or Aglipayan Church with 35%{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} of the population, Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, Adventist, and other Evangelical Christians; There are also non Protestant and other Christian sects such as Iglesia Ni Cristo, Church of Christ of Latter day Saints (Mormon) and Jehovah's Witnesses while non Christians are usually represented by Muslims, and to a lesser extent, Buddhists and Hindus.\n\n==Culture==\nSpanish architecture can be seen in old buildings in downtown Iloilo. Ancient [[Indonesians]], [[Malaysians]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], and later the [[People of India|Indian]], [[Arab people|Arab]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] merchants were already trading with the Ilonggos, long before the arrival of the Mexicans, Spaniards and other Europeans. The ruling Spanish government encouraged these foreign merchants to trade in Iloilo but they were not given privileges like ownership of land. Foreign merchants and Spaniards intermarried with the locals, and the Mestizo class was eventually born from their union.  The Mestizo offspring of the local nobilities later emerged as the ruling class of the Ilonggos (see [[Principal\u00eda]]).\n\nThe town's fiesta is one of the most important events for Ilonggos. Almost every town (municipality) in Iloilo has a fiesta and festival celebrated annually.\n\nIloilo is also home to two of the nation's cultural minorities the Sulod-Bukidnon and the Ati.\n\n==Government==\n* [[Governor of Iloilo |Governor]]: [[Arthur Defensor Jr. |Arthur R.

Tupas\n\n==Economy==\nIloilo's economy is vibrant, because of good political will and the cooperation of the Ilonggos. Iloilo's \"economic boom\" made thousands of jobs, and made the province one of the most competitive in the country. Iloilo City is the center for real estate, accommodation, medical centers, education, shopping centers, business centers, IT/BPO centers and many more. Iloilo's northern part consists of a strong fishing industry and a booming tourism industry. It is near the [[Visayan Sea]], which makes that part of province one of the leading areas in fisheries in the nation. The central part is an agri-industrial center producing a wide array of agricultural products such as corn, rice, bananas, pineapples and sugar among others as well as high-end crops in the [[Bucari Area]] in Leon and in the highlands of [[Alimodian]], as well as inland resorts and trekking sites. The sugar industries is centered in Passi City and its neighboring towns like Lambunao, Duenas, San Enrique and Bingawan. Southern Iloilo's economy is mostly based on tourism because of the century-old churches and colonial buildings and its beaches and marine reserves especially in Guimbal, Miagao and San Joaquin towns.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Iloilo International Airport===\n{{main|Iloilo International Airport}}\n\nThe airport serves the Province of Iloilo, including its capital city, Iloilo City, the regional center of the Western Visayas region in the Philippines. It opened its doors to commercial traffic on June 14, 2007 after a decade of planning and construction located at Cabatuan, Iloilo, replacing [[Mandurriao Airport]] in Mandurriao, Iloilo City and inherited its IATA and ICAO airport codes from its predecessor. The fourth-busiest airport in the Philippines, it is the first airport in both Western Visayas and the island of Panay to be built to international standards, and one of the four airports in the region planned to be an international gateway. It is one of the 2 international airports in Western Visayas, the other one being [[Kalibo International Airport]].\n\n===Iloilo Port Complex===\n{{main|Port of Iloilo}}\n\nThe Port of Iloilo, considered the leader of trade and a commercial hub for Western Visayas is also one of the safest natural seaports in the Philippines. The Iloilo Commercial Port Complex is located on 20.8 hectares of reclaimed land. It includes 11,400 sq. meters of open space for operations, supplemented by an area of 97,000 sq. meters, a crane, rails of 348 lineal meters; roll-on-roll-off support; a 7,800 container freight stations; and a 720 sq. meter passenger shed. The port complex is ideal for ships plying international routes having a berth length of 400 meters, a width of 26.26 meters and a berthing depth of 10.50 meters.\n\nA number of shipping companies use the Port of Iloilo, including Lorenzo Shipping Corporation, 2GO, Amigo Shipping Company, New Panay Shipping Company, Sulpicio Lines, and Trans-Asia Shipping Lines Inc. Fast ferries serve Iloilo-Bacolod routes eight times daily. 2GO inter-island, overnight ferries serve longer routes, going to Manila, Bacolod, Cebu, Zamboanga and Cagayan de Oro City. Pumpboat ferries cross the Iloilo Strait to Guimaras constantly during the day and on special trips at night.\n\nRoll-on/roll-off ferry service, known as RO-RO, is available between Iloilo City and Guimaras, but the ro-ro to Negros is available from Dumangas, Iloilo including ro-ro from Iloilo to Palawan.\n\nIt is ranked third in terms of ship calls at 11,853, fourth in cargo throughout at 491,719 million metric tons and fourth in passenger traffic at 2.4 million annually.\n\n==Accessibility==\nIloilo is one of the most accessible provinces in the Philippines. Iloilo can be reached by plane on regular commercial international flights from Hong Kong and Singapore to the Iloilo International Airport. Direct domestic flights connect Iloilo to major cities in the Philippines including Manila, Cebu, Davao, General Santos, Puerto Princesa, Zamboanga and Cagayan de Oro. Direct ferry routes and roll-on roll-off connections on the Philippines\u2019 nautical highway are also available between Iloilo and all major cities in the country.\n\nBy plane, travel time to the Iloilo takes around 1 hour from Manila, 30 minutes from Cebu, 2 hours and 30 minutes from Hong Kong, and 3 hours and 30 minutes from Singapore. By direct ferry, Iloilo is approximately 1.5 hours away from Bacolod, and 15 minutes away from Guimaras. By land, Iloilo is around 4\u20135 hours away from Boracay, 3 hours away from Kalibo, and 2 hours away from Roxas City.\n\n===Iloilo transportation gateways===\n\nIloilo International Airport \u2013 The Iloilo International Airport is the primary gateway to Iloilo. It serves regularly scheduled direct domestic flights to Iloilo from major Philippine airlines including Manila, Cebu, Davao, General Santos, Puerto Princesa, and Cagayan de Oro. The airport also serves international flights from Iloilo to Hong Kong and Singapore. Flights to Iloilo are served by Cebu Pacific, Philippine Airlines, PAL Express, and TigerAir. The Iloilo Airport is located approximately 19 kilometers or 20 minutes away by taxi from Iloilo City.\n\nIloilo Seaports \u2013 Ferries in Iloilo depart and arrive at various seaports in Iloilo City and Iloilo Province depending on the route and vessel type. (1) Ferry terminals along the Iloilo River in Lapuz district, Iloilo City serves fastcraft ferries to and from Bacolod, RORO ferries to and from Guimaras, and ferries to and from Palawan. (2) The Iloilo Domestic Port in Fort San Pedro, Iloilo City Proper serves shipping companies with routes to and from Manila, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, and Zamboanga.<ref>http://www.exploreiloilo.com/guide/iloilo-transportation/</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Miag-ao Church 2010.jpg|thumb|The Miag-ao Church is one of the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines]].]]\nAs a leading province during the Spanish Colonial Era, the province of Iloilo is widely known for its beautiful old world architecture similar to that of Latin American Countries.

The place is known for its numerous caves, white sand beaches, emerald-like shores and lagoon, and rock formations.\n\n'''[[Santa Barbara Church, Santa Barbara, Iloilo|Santa Barbara Church]]'''. The Santa Barbara Parish Church and Convent is considered to be the \"Cradle of Independence\" in Panay and in the Visayas. In 1991, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines declared Santa Barbara Church and Convent as a National Landmark. The church was the site where General Martin Delgado of the Visayan Revolutionary Government started the junta that resulted to the first Cry of Revolution against the Spaniards outside Luzon. It was also used as the general headquarters and military hospital of the revolutionary forces.\n\n'''Calle Real Heritage District'''. Calle Real, or the J.M. Basa Street in Iloilo City, is once the main commercial center of the city during the Imperial Spanish and American periods. It houses numerous old colonial buildings.\n\n'''Iloilo River Esplanade'''. The Esplanade is Iloilo City's newest hub for dining, leisure and recreation.

In atmosphere, the electronics can cool convectively, but operation in vacuum requires cooling via conduction and hence an improved conductive path. Additionally, a small aperture made of [[tungsten]] was attached to the front of the detector to reduce the likelihood of photon saturation and limit the field of view to \u00b14\u00ba. Finally, an additional [[beryllium]] filter was mounted in front of the detector to reduce the number of [[photoelectrons]] reaching the detector.\n\nThere are two secondary science instruments: the X-ray Photometer (XP) and the Sun Position Sensor (SPS). XP is a single [[photodiode]] with a beryllium filter in front of it of nearly identical thickness to the sum of the two beryllium filters in front of the X123. The purpose of XP is provide an on-orbit cross-calibration for the X123: the sum of the X123 spectrum should be approximately equal to the XP measurement. SPS is a fine sun sensor with 2.4 [[arcsecond|arcsec]] precision that consists of a planar quad-diode observing visible light, whose purpose is to provide fine knowledge of the solar position with respect to the X123 and XP optical axes to correct for any off-axis signal attenuation.\n\nAll instruments were calibrated at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s [[SURF III Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility|Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF III)]].<ref name=\"Caspi2015\" /><ref name=\"Moore2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Christopher S.|last2=Woods|first2=Thomas N.|last3=Caspi|first3=Amir|last4=Mason|first4=James P.|title=The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSats: spectrometer characterization techniques, spectrometer capabilities, and solar science objectives|journal=Proc.

Typically, 10-20 students will be involved in each of the concurrent projects. CSSWE and MinXSS heavily leveraged professionals at the [[Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics]]. As of 2018 March 8, 40 graduate, 5 undergraduate, and two high school students have worked on the project. Roughly 40 professionals have contributed with varying levels of involvement, from providing feedback at design reviews to writing flight software.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n*[https://www.facebook.com/minxsscubesat/ MinXSS Facebook]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA4id5vAJRQ Photos of deployment from the International Space Station (courtesy [[Tim Peake]]) compiled into a movie]\n*[http://bluecanyontech.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DataSheet_ADCS_08_F.pdf XACT Data Sheet]\n\n{{Sun spacecraft}}\n{{Orbital launches in 2015}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[Category:Student satellites]]\n[[Category:CubeSats]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 2015]]\n[[Category:Satellites deployed from the International Space Station]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft decommissioned in 2017]]\n", "name_user": "Netoholic", "label": "safe", "comment": "post-move link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_X-ray_Solar_Spectrometer_CubeSat"}

The Commission came into existence on July 12, 1974 when the [[National Research Act]] (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law.<ref>Department of Health, E. (2014). \"The Belmont Report. Ethical principles and guidelines for the protection of human subjects of research.\" ''The Journal of the American College of Dentists'', 81(3), 4.</ref> After four years of monthly deliberations, the Commission met in February 1976 for four days at the Smithsonian Institution's Belmont Conference Center which resulted in a statement of three basic ethical principles: autonomy, beneficence, and justice, for biomedical and behavioural research. Second, in the book entitled ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics'' (1979), [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James Childress]], stated that the following four ''prima facie'' principles lie at the core of moral reasoning in health care: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. In the opinion of Beauchamp and Childress, these four principles are part of a \"common morality\"; an approach that \"takes its basic premises directly from the morality shared by the members of society \u2013 that is, unphilosophical common sense and tradition\".<ref>Beauchamp, T.

(1994) ''Principles of Medical Ethics'', New York: Oxford University Press, page 100</ref> \n[[File:Georgetown campus picture.jpg|thumb|Georgetown campus picture]]\nThe four principles are sometimes referred to as the 'Georgetown Principles' or the 'Georgetown mantra', so-called because both Beauchamp and Childress were based at Georgetown University when the first edition of Principles of Biomedical Ethics was published.\n\nThe principlist approach is derived from normative ethical theories, but it is not aligned to any one single theory. Whilst Beauchamp and Childress<ref name=\"auto\">Beauchamp, T. L. and Childress, J. F. (2001) ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics'', 5th ed., New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> claim that these principles are commonly understood and accepted within society, and thus have a broad degree of support, they also assert that they are drawn from two normative ethical traditions: the duty-based moral philosophy (deontological approach) of [[Immanuel Kant]] and the outcome-based (consequentialist) ethics of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].\n\n==The four principles==\nThese ethical principles can be elucidated in slightly different ways, but the explanations provided by Beauchamp and Childress<ref name=\"auto\" /> can be summarised as follows:\n\n'''Respect for autonomy'''\nThis principle refers to the capacity of an individual to be self-determining and to make decisions for themselves without undue pressure, coercion or other forms of persuasion. It is contrasted with the notion of paternalism which occurs when actions of a health care practitioner override or do not seek to respect the wishes of the patient, believing that they are better able to decide what is in the patient's best interests. Whether or not the doctor knows best, s/he has no right to make important decisions on behalf of competent patients, as a general principle. Even where the doctor acts in the patient's interests, it is important that the patient's own choices and wishes be respected.\n\nRespect for autonomy is operationalised through the requirement for [[informed consent]] whereby people who have the capacity for self-determination must be fully informed before being asked for their consent.\n\n'''Beneficence'''\nThis principle describes an obligation to act for the benefit of others. Acting in this way might involve preventing or removing harm, or it might involve the active promotion of some good (health, for example). The aim of beneficent action is to produce the \"best\" one can out of a range of possibilities. It can involve cost/benefit analysis such that the \"best\" here will be the possible action in which the benefits produced maximally outweigh the costs or the risks. Put simply, it is to act always in the best interests of the patient.\n\n'''Non-maleficence'''\nDuties of non-maleficence require us to refrain from causing deliberate harm or intentional avoidance of actions that might be expected to cause harm. Generally, obligations of non-maleficence are more stringent than obligations of beneficence, but again a cost/benefit analysis may need to be undertaken to identify the best possible action. In some situations harm may be unavoidable and then we must be sure that the benefits outweigh the harm.\n\n'''Justice'''\nThe principle of justice requires that we do what we can to ensure that costs and benefits are fairly distributed. It is possible to obey the principle of non-maleficence and the\nprinciple of beneficence, yet still not behave in an ethical manner, for these two principles say nothing about how benefits should be apportioned. In a given case it may well be that we can only procure a major benefit for some people by slightly harming the interests of others. The principle of beneficence may say we should go ahead, but then the benefits and costs would be unfairly distributed.\n\n==Principlism as a practical approach==\n\nPrinciplism has evolved into a practical approach for ethical decision-making that focuses on the common ground moral principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The practicality of this approach is that principlism can be derived from, is consistent with, or at the very least is not in conflict with a multitude of ethical, theological, and social approaches towards moral decision-making. This pluralistic approach is essential when making moral decisions institutionally, pedagogically, and in the community as pluralistic interdisciplinary groups by definition cannot agree on particular moral theories or their epistemic justifications. However, pluralistic interdisciplinary groups can and do agree on intersubjective principles. In the development of a principlistic moral framework it is not a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] that the epistemic origins and justifications of these principles be established. Rather the sufficient condition is that most individuals and societies, would agree that both prescriptively and descriptively there is wide agreement with the existence and acceptance of the general values of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.\n\n== Principlism as a matter of debate ==\nPrinciplism has been subjected to challenges since first introduced by Beauchamp and Childress in 1979. The term \"principlism\" itself was first presented, not by Beauchamp and Childress, but by two of the most vocal critics, Danner Clouser and [[Bernard Gert]]. Clouser and Gert assert that the principled approach lacks theoretical unity; the principles lack any systematic relationship because they are drawn from conflicting moral theories, and hence often lead to conflicting conclusions.<ref>Clouser, K. D. and Gert, B. (1990) \"A critique of principlism\", ''Journal of Medicine and Philosophy'', 15(2), 219\u2013236. Clouser, K. D. and Gert, B. (1994) Morality vs. principlism, New York: John Wiley and Sons.</ref><br />\nThe apparent \"pick and mix\" selection of certain theories and principles, without an underlying theoretical basis, is a cause of great concern for Clouser who states:\n<blockquote>It is a kind of relativism espoused (perhaps unwittingly) by many books (usually anthologies) of bioethics. They parade before the reader a variety of \"theories\" of ethics\u2014Kantianism, deontology, utilitarianism, other forms of consequentialism, and the like\u2014and say, in effect, choose whichever of the competing theories, maxims, principles, or rules suits you for any particular case. Just take your choice! They each have flaws\u2014which are always pointed out\u2014but on balance, the authors seem to be saying, they are probably all equally good!<ref>Clouser, K. D. (1995) \"Common Morality as an Alternative to Principlism\", ''Kennedy. Inst. Ethics J.'', 5(3), 219\u2013236, p 224.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOthers have objected to the choice or limitations of the particular principles, such as Herissone-Kelly <ref>Herissone-Kelly, P. (2003) \"The principlist approach to bioethics and its stormy journey overseas\", in H\u00e4yry, M. and Takala, T. eds. ''Scratching the surface of bioethics'', New York: Rodopi, 65\u201377.</ref> who questions the argument that Beauchamp and Childress present in support of their global applicability, and Walker <ref>Walker, T. (2009) \"What principlism misses\", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 35(4), 229\u2013231.</ref>, who believes that more principles need to be added if they are truly to represent a common sense morality. Additionally, it has been suggested, that application of a principlist approach serves to exclude the moral agent, who performs the act, from the moral judgements; in order to see what is good and not merely what are the rights involved, we must consider the virtue and intentions of the person acting.<ref>MacIntyre, A. (1988) ''After Virtue'', 1984., ''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'', Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press.</ref> For example, H\u00e4yry, in his scrutiny of the objection that the \"Georgetown principles\" are not truly representative of European values (being more aligned with Americam liberalism), points to the lack of representation of virtue ethics within their chosen principles: \"By ignoring moral (and religious) virtues, and thereby all deliberations about the ideal nature of a good, virtuous human being, Beauchamp and Childress left their views wide open to accusations of short-sighted hedonism; excessive individualism and sneaking nihilism.\"<ref>H\u00e4yry, M. (2003) \"European values in bioethics: why, what, and how to be used?\", ''Theoretical Medicine And Bioethics'', 24(3), 199\u2013214, p.201.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there are also staunch supporters of principlism such as [[Raanan Gillon]] who has claimed that the four principles can explain and justify all the substantive moral claims in medical ethics. According to Gillon, these principles provide a transcultural, transnational, transreligious, and transphilosophical framework for ethical analysis.<ref>Gillon, R. (1994) ''Principles of Health Care Ethics'', New-Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell.</ref><ref>Gillon, R. (1998) \"Bioethics overview\", ''Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics'', 1, 305\u2013317.</ref><ref>Gillon, R.

Principlism is by far the most dominant approach to ethical analysis in healthcare and the book Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress remains the most influential book in modern bioethics.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bioethics]]\n[[Category:Medical ethics]]\n[[Category:Autonomy]]\n[[Category:Ethical theories]]\n[[Category:Meta-ethics]]\n[[Category:Professional ethics]]\n", "text_old": "'''Principlism''' is an [[applied ethics]] approach to the examination of moral dilemmas that is based upon the application of certain ethical principles.

Ultimately a failure, the invasion attempts are of [[Macrohistory|macro-historical]] importance because they set a limit on Mongol expansion. The invasions are referred to in many works of fiction and are the earliest events for which the word ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'' (\"divine wind\") is widely used, originating in reference to the two [[typhoon]]s faced by the Mongol fleets.\n\nThe invasions were one of the earliest cases of gunpowder warfare outside of China.

However, the emissaries returned empty-handed. The second set of emissaries were sent in 1268, returning empty-handed like the first. Both sets of emissaries met with the [[Chinzei Bugy\u014d]], or Defense Commissioner for the West, who passed on the message to [[Shikken]], [[H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune]], Japan's ruler in Kamakura and to the [[Emperor of Japan]] in [[Kyoto]]. After discussing the letters with his inner circle, there was much debate, but the Shikken had his mind made up; he had the emissaries sent back with no answer. The Mongols continued to send demands, some through [[Koreans|Korean emissaries]] and some through Mongol ambassadors on March 7, 1269; September 17, 1269; September 1271; and May 1272. However, each time, the bearers were not permitted to land in Kyushu. \n\nThe Imperial Court suggested compromise,<ref>Smith, Bradley ''Japan: A History in Art'' 1979 p.107</ref> but really had little effect in the matter, due to political marginalization after the [[J\u014dky\u016b War]]. The uncompromising shogunate ordered all those who held fiefs in Ky\u016bsh\u016b, the area closest to the [[Korean Peninsula]] and thus most likely to be attacked, to return to their lands and forces in Ky\u016bsh\u016b moved west, further securing the most likely landing points. After acknowledging its importance, the Imperial Court led great prayer services to calm local residents, and much government business was put off to deal with this crisis.\n\n==First invasion preparations==\n[[File:Genko Borui Nishijin Fukuoka 02.jpg|thumb|250px|A stone defense wall, ([[Genko Borui]]), in [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]], now [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]]]]\n\nThe invasion fleet was scheduled to depart in the seventh lunar month of 1274 but was delayed for three months. Kublai planned for the fleet to first attack [[Tsushima Island]] and [[Iki Island]] before making landfall in [[Hakata Bay]]. The Japanese plan of defense was simply to contest them at every point with [[gokenin]]. Both Yuan and Japanese sources exaggerate the opposing side's numbers, with the ''[[History of Yuan]]'' putting the Japanese at 102,000, and the Japanese claiming they were outnumbered at least ten to one. In reality there are no reliable records of the size of Japanese forces but estimates put their total numbers at around 4,000 to 6,000. The Yuan invasion force composed of 15,000 [[Mongols|Mongol]], [[Han Chinese]], and [[Jurchens|Jurchen]] soldiers, and 6,000 to 8,000 [[Koreans|Korean]] troops as well as 7,000 Korean sailors.{{sfn|Twitchett|1994|p=437-442}}{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=32}}\n\n== First invasion (1274) ==\n[[File:Kikuchi Yoosai - Mongol Invasion (m\u014dko sh\u016brai) - Tokyo National Museum.jpg|thumb|The Mongol fleet destroyed in a typhoon, ink and water on paper, by [[Kikuchi Y\u014dsai]], 1847]]\n\nThe Yuan invasion force set off from Korea on 2 November 1274. Two days later they landed on Komodahama beach on [[Tsushima Island]]. [[S\u014d clan|S\u014d]] Sukekuni, the governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but was overwhelmed and killed. The Yuan fleet departed Tsushima on 13 November and attacked [[Iki Island]]. Like Sukekuni, Taira Kageetaka, the governor of Iki, gave a spirited defense before falling back to his castle by nightfall. The next morning, Yuan forces had surrounded the castle. Kagetaka made a final failed sortie before committing suicide with his family.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=37}}\n\nThe Yuan fleet crossed the sea and land in [[Hakata Bay]] on 19 November, a short distance from [[Dazaifu, Fukuoka|Dazaifu]], the ancient administrative capital of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. The following day brought the [[Battle of Bun'ei]] (\u6587\u6c38\u306e\u5f79), also known as the \"First Battle of Hakata Bay\". Conlan argues that the ''History of Yuan'''s account of the battle suggests that both the Japanese and Yuan forces were of similar size. Conlan estimated that both armies numbered around 3,000 each (not including the Yuan sailors) during this battle.<ref name=\"Conlan, p. 264\">Conlan, p. 264</ref> The Japanese forces inexperienced with non-Japanese tactics found the Mongol army perplexing. The Yuan forces disembarked and advanced in a dense body protected by a screen of shields. They wielded their polearms in a tightly packed fashioin with no space between them. As they advanced they also threw paper and iron casing bombs on occasion, frightening the Japanese horses and making them uncontrollable in battle. When the grandson of a Japanese commander shot an arrow to announce the beginning of battle, the Mongols burst out laughing. By nightfall, the Japanese had been driven several kilometres inland.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=49}}\n\n{{quotation|The commanding general kept his position on high ground, and directed the various detachments as need be with signals from hand-drums. But whenever the (Mongol) soldiers took to flight, they sent iron bomb-shells (tetsuho) flying against us, which made our side dizzy and confused. Our soldiers were frightened out of their wits by the thundering explosions; their eyes were blinded, their ears deafened, so that they could hardly distinguish east from west. According to our manner of fighting, we must first call out by name someone from the enemy ranks, and then attack in single combat. But they (the Mongols) took no notice at all of such conventions; they rushed forward all together in a mass, grappling with any individuals they could catch and killing them.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=178}}|''Hachiman Gudoukun}}\n\nDespite the invasion's success in pushing back Japanese forces, a senior Yuan commander, Liu Fuxiang, had been seriously injured in battle. The Mongol and Korean ship captains were also concerned with their small numbers and the possibility of facing a larger Japanese army, so they decided to retreat and set sail for Korea. For the ships at that time the navigation to north, i.e. from Hakata to Korea's south-eastern shores, was risky, if not in daytime and under south wind. However, they pressed ahead the retreating action at night and encountered severe storms. Some accounts offer casualty reports that suggest 200 ships were lost. Of the 30,000 strong invasion force, 13,500 did not return.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=49-50}}\n\nA story widely known in Japan is that back in Kamakura, Tokimune was overcome with fear when the invasion finally came, and wanting to overcome his cowardice, he asked [[Mugaku Sogen]], his [[Zen master]] also known as Bukko, for advice. Bukko replied he had to sit in meditation to find the source of his cowardice in himself.

In addition to better organizing the samurai of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, they ordered the construction of forts and a large stone wall (\u77f3\u5841, Sekirui), and other defensive structures at many potential landing points, including Hakata Bay, where a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|spell=in|sp=us}} high wall was constructed in 1276.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/16694|title=\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02\u4eca\u6d25\u5143\u5bc7\u9632\u5841\u767a\u6398\u8abf\u67fb\u6982\u5831|last=\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02\u6559\u80b2\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a|first=|date=1969|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref>\n\nReligious services increased and the [[Hakozaki Shrine]], having been destroyed by the Yuan forces, was rebuilt. A coastal watch was instituted and rewards were given to some 120 valiant samurai. There was even a plan for a raid on Goryeo (modern-day [[Korea]]) to be carried out by Sh\u014dni Tsunesuke, a general from Ky\u016bsh\u016b, though this was never executed.\n\nKublai Khan sent five Yuan emissaries in September 1275 to Ky\u016bsh\u016b, who refused to leave without a reply.

The major difference between the first and second invasion was that the Yuan dynasty had finished conquering the Song dynasty in 1279 and was able to launch a two-pronged attack. The invading force was drawn from a number of sources including criminals with commuted death sentence and even those in mourning for their parents (a serious affair in contemporary China). More than 1,000 ships were requisitioned for the invasion: 600 from Southern China, 900 from Korea. Reportedly 40,000 troops were amassed in Korea and 100,000 in Southern China. These numbers are likely an exaggeration but the addition of Southern Chinese resources probably meant the second invasion force was still several times larger than the first invasion. Nothing is known about the size of the Japanese forces.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=55-57}}\n\n==Second invasion (1281)==\n[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|thumb|350px|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding Yuan ships in 1281.]]\n\nOrders for the second invasion came in the first lunar month of 1281. Two fleets were prepared, a force of 900 ships in Korea and 3,500 ships in Southern China with a combined force of 142,000 soldiers and sailors.<ref name=\"Conlan, p. 264\"/> The Mongol general Arakhan was named supreme commander of the operation and was to travel with the Southern Route fleet, which was under the command of Fan Wenhu, and delayed due to supply difficulties.<ref name=\"Elements, p. 14\">Winters, Harold ''et al.''

According to the ''History of Yuan'', the Japanese commander Shoni Suketoki and Ryuzoji Suetoki led forces in the tens of thousands against the invasion force. The expeditionary forces discharged their firearms and the Japanese were routed with Suketoki killed in the process. More than 300 islanders were killed. The soldiers sought out the children and killed them as well.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=58}}\n\nThe Eastern Route army was supposed to wait for the Southern Route army at Iki but disobeyed orders and set out to invade mainland Japan by themselves. They departed on 23 June, a full week ahead of the expected arrival of the Southern Route army on 2 July. The Eastern Route army split their forces in half to simultaneously attack Hakata Bay and Nagato Province. Three hundred ships attacked Nagato on 25 June but were driven off and forced to return to Iki. Meanwhile, the rest of the Eastern Route army attacked Hakata Bay, which was heavily fortified with a defensive wall. Some Mongol ships came ashore but were driven off by volleys of arrows from the defensive wall. Unable to land, the Mongol invasion force occupied the islands of Shiga and Noko from which they planned to launch raids against Hakata. Instead the Japanese launched raids against them at night on board small ships. The ''Hachiman Gudokun'' credit Kusano Jiro with boarding a Mongol ship, setting fire to it, and taking 21 heads. The next day, Kawano Michiari led a daytime raid with just two boats. His uncle Michitoki was immediately killed by an arrow and Michiari was wounded both in the shoulder and the left arm. However upon boarding the enemy ship, he slew a large Mongol warrior, for which he was made a hero and richly rewarded. The Mongols were eventually driven from Shiga island and withdrew to Iki on 18 July. The Japanese defense of Hakata Bay is known as the [[Battle of K\u014dan]].{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=69}}\n\nAfter the Southern Route fleet arrived at Iki, the two fleets took some time rearranging themselves before advancing on Taka island. On 12 August, the Japanese repeated their small raids on the invasion fleet. The Mongols responded by fastening their ships together with chains and planks to provide defensive platforms. There are no accounts of the raids from the Japanese side in this incident unlike at the defense of Hakata Bay. According to the ''History of Yuan'', the Japanese ships were small and were all beaten off. It was at this point that a great typhoon, known in Japanese as ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'', struck the fleet at anchor and devastated it. Sensing the oncoming typhoon, Korean and south Chinese mariners retreated and unsuccessfully docked in Imari Bay where they were destroyed by the storm.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/divinewindhistor00eman|url-access=registration|quote=mongol invasion of japan.|title=Divine Wind: The History and Science of Hurricanes|first1=Kerry|last1=Emanuel|first2=Professor Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences Program in Atmospheres Oceans and Climate Kerry|last2=Emanuel|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|accessdate=30 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Thousands of soldiers were left drifting on pieces of wood or washed ashore. The Japanese defenders killed all they found except for the Southern Chinese, who they felt had been coerced into joining the attack on Japan. According to a Chinese survivor, after the typhoon, Commander Fan Wenhu picked the best remaining ships and sailed away, leaving more than 100,000 troops to die. After being stranded for three days on Taka island, the Japanese attacked, capturing tens of thousands. They were moved to Hakata where the Japanese killed all the Mongols, Koreans, and Northern Chinese. The Southern Chinese were spared but made slaves. According to a Korean source, of the 26,989 Koreans who set out with the Eastern Route fleet, 7,592 did not return.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=69-76}}\n\n===Size of the invasion===\nMany modern historians believe the figures for the invasion force to be exaggerated, as was common in medieval chronicles. Professor Thomas Conlan states that they were likely exaggerated by an order of magnitude (implying 14,000 soldiers and sailors), expressing skepticism that a medieval kingdom managed an invasion on the scale of [[D-Day]] during World War II across over ten times the distance, and questions if even 10,000 soldiers attacked Japan in 1281.<ref name=\"Conlan, p. 264\"/> Morris Rossabi states that Conlan was correct in his assertion that the invasion force was much smaller than traditionally believed, but argues that the expenditures lavished on the mission confirm that the fighting force was sizable and much larger than 10,000 soldiers and 4,000 sailors. He puts forward the alternative figure of 70,000 soldiers and sailors, half of what is spoken of in the Yuanshi and later Japanese claims.<ref>Rossabi, Morris. \"Khubilai Khan: His Life and Times.\" 1988. Page xiii.</ref> Turnbull thinks that 140,000+ is an exaggeration, but does not offer his own precise estimate for the size of the army. Rather, he only states that given the contributions of the Southern Song, the second invasion should have been around three times larger than the first. As he earlier listed the common figure of 23,000 for the first invasion uncritically, unlike the estimate of 140,000+ for the second, that would imply an invasion force of ~70,000, on par with Rossabbi's estimate.<ref>Turbull 2013, p. 57</ref>\n\n==Military significance==\n[[File:M\u014dko Sh\u016brai Ekotoba e2.jpg|thumb|Kagesuke Shoni and his forces in Akasaka]]\n[[Kublai Khan]]'s invasions of Japan were the first of only three instances when the samurai fought foreign troops rather than amongst themselves; the others being [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]] and the Japanese [[invasion of Ryukyu]] (1609). The invasions exposed the Japanese to an alien fighting style which, lacking the [[single combat]] that characterized traditional samurai combat, they saw as inferior. The Mongol method of advances and withdrawals based on signal sounds from bells, drums and war cries was also unknown in Japan at that time, as was the technique of shooting arrows ''en masse'' into the air rather than long-ranged one-on-one combat. \n\nThe Mongol invasions of Japan facilitated a change in the designs of Japanese swords. Thin [[tachi]] and [[Chokut\u014d|chokuto]] style blades were often unable to cut through the boiled leather armor of the Mongols, with the blades often chipping or breaking off.<ref>Sat\u014d, Kanzan. Kodansha International. 1983. Page 104</ref> Tachi blades were shortened and thickened, with the katana eventually being introduced as a result.\n\nThe Mongols and the Ashikaga shogunate of Japan made peace in the late 14th century during the reign of [[Toghon Tem\u00fcr]], the last Yuan emperor in Khanbaliq. Long before the peace agreement, there was stable trade in [[East Asia]] under the dominance of the Mongols and Japan.\n\nAs a consequence of the destruction of the Mongol fleets, Japan's independence was guaranteed. Simultaneously, a power struggle within Japan led to the dominance of military governments and diminishing Imperial power.<ref>Davis, Paul K.

One of the most notable technological innovations during the war was the use of explosive bombs.<ref name=\"Turnbull2013\"/> The bombs are known in Chinese as \"thunder crash bombs\" and were fired from catapults, inflicting damage on enemy soldiers. An illustration of a bomb is depicted in the Japanese Mongol Invasion scrolls, but Thomas Conlan has shown that the illustration of the projectiles was added to the scrolls in the eighteenth century and should not be considered to be an eyewitness representation of their use.<ref>Conlan, Thomas. \"Myth, Memory and the Scrolls of the Mongol Invasions of Japan\". in Lillehoj, Elizabeth ed. ''Archaism and Antiquarianism in Korean and Japanese Art'' (Chicago: Center for the Art of East Asia, University of Chicago and Art Media Resources, 2013), pp. 54-73.</ref> Archaeological evidence of the use of gunpowder was finally confirmed when multiple shells of the explosive bombs were discovered in an underwater shipwreck off the shore of Japan by the Kyushu Okinawa Society for Underwater Archaeology.

The ''[[Taiheiki]]'' mentions a weapon shaped like a bell that made a noise like thunder-clap and shot out thousands of iron balls.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=295}}{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=109}}\n[[File:M\u014dko Sh\u016brai Ekotoba4.JPG|center|thumb|upright=3.5|Suenaga and escaping Mongolians]]\n\n==Cultural influence==\nThe Zen Buddhism of Hojo Tokimune and his Zen master Bukko gained credibility beyond national boundaries, and the first mass followings of Zen teachings among samurai began to flourish.\n\nThe failed invasions also mark the first use of the word ''kamikaze'' (\"Divine Wind\").  The fact that the typhoon that helped Japan defeat the Mongol Navy in the first invasion occurred in late November, well after the normal Pacific typhoon season (May to October), perpetuated the Japanese belief that they would never be defeated or successfully invaded, which remained an important aspect of Japanese foreign policy until the very end of [[World War II]].

Ultimately a failure, the invasion attempts are of [[Macrohistory|macro-historical]] importance because they set a limit on Mongol expansion. The invasions are referred to in many works of fiction and are the earliest events for which the word ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'' (\"divine wind\") is widely used, originating in reference to the two [[typhoon]]s faced by the Mongol fleets.\n\nThe invasions were one of the earliest cases of gunpowder warfare outside of China. One of the most notable technological innovations during the war was the use of explosive, hand-thrown bombs.<ref name=\"Turnbull2013\">{{cite book|author=Stephen Turnbull|title=The Mongol Invasions of Japan 1274 and 1281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qo4amAg_ygIC&pg=PT41|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=19 February 2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0045-9|pages=41\u201342}}</ref>\n\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\nAfter a series of [[Mongol invasions of Korea]] between 1231 and 1281, Goryeo signed a treaty in favor of the [[Mongols]] and became a [[vassal state]]. Kublai was declared [[Khagan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1260 (although this was not widely recognized by the Mongols in the west) and established his capital at [[Khanbaliq]] (within modern [[Beijing]]) in 1264.\n\nJapan at the time was ruled by the [[Shikken]] (shogunate regents) of the [[H\u014dj\u014d clan]], who had intermarried with and wrested control from [[Minamoto no Yoriie]], ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' of the [[Kamakura shogunate]], after his death in 1203. The inner circle of the H\u014dj\u014d clan had become so preeminent that they no longer consulted the council of the shogunate ({{nihongo||\u8a55\u5b9a|Hy\u014dj\u014d}}), the Imperial Court of [[Kyoto]], or their [[gokenin]] vassals, and made their decisions at private meetings in their residences ({{nihongo||\u5bc4\u5408|yoriai}}).\n\nThe Mongols also [[Mongol invasions of Sakhalin|made attempts to subjugate]] the native peoples of [[Sakhalin]]\u2014the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Orok people|Orok]], and [[Nivkh people]]s\u2014from 1260 to 1308.<ref>''The conquest of Ainu lands: ecology and culture in Japanese expansion, 1590\u20131800'' By Brett L.

However, the emissaries returned empty-handed. The second set of emissaries were sent in 1268, returning empty-handed like the first. Both sets of emissaries met with the [[Chinzei Bugy\u014d]], or Defense Commissioner for the West, who passed on the message to [[Shikken]], [[H\u014dj\u014d Tokimune]], Japan's ruler in Kamakura and to the [[Emperor of Japan]] in [[Kyoto]]. After discussing the letters with his inner circle, there was much debate, but the Shikken had his mind made up; he had the emissaries sent back with no answer. The Mongols continued to send demands, some through [[Koreans|Korean emissaries]] and some through Mongol ambassadors on March 7, 1269; September 17, 1269; September 1271; and May 1272. However, each time, the bearers were not permitted to land in Kyushu. \n\nThe Imperial Court suggested compromise,<ref>Smith, Bradley ''Japan: A History in Art'' 1979 p.107</ref> but really had little effect in the matter, due to political marginalization after the [[J\u014dky\u016b War]]. The uncompromising shogunate ordered all those who held fiefs in Ky\u016bsh\u016b, the area closest to the [[Korean Peninsula]] and thus most likely to be attacked, to return to their lands and forces in Ky\u016bsh\u016b moved west, further securing the most likely landing points. After acknowledging its importance, the Imperial Court led great prayer services to calm local residents, and much government business was put off to deal with this crisis.\n\n==First invasion preparations==\n[[File:Genko Borui Nishijin Fukuoka 02.jpg|thumb|250px|A stone defense wall, ([[Genko Borui]]), in [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]], now [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]]]]\n\nThe invasion fleet was scheduled to depart in the seventh lunar month of 1274 but was delayed for three months. Kublai planned for the fleet to first attack [[Tsushima Island]] and [[Iki Island]] before making landfall in [[Hakata Bay]]. The Japanese plan of defense was simply to contest them at every point with [[gokenin]]. Both Yuan and Japanese sources exaggerate the opposing side's numbers, with the ''[[History of Yuan]]'' putting the Japanese at 102,000, and the Japanese claiming they were outnumbered at least ten to one. In reality there are no reliable records of the size of Japanese forces but estimates put their total numbers at around 4,000 to 6,000. The Yuan invasion force composed of 15,000 [[Mongols|Mongol]], [[Han Chinese]], and [[Jurchens|Jurchen]] soldiers, and 6,000 to 8,000 [[Koreans|Korean]] troops as well as 7,000 Korean sailors.{{sfn|Twitchett|1994|p=437-442}}{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=32}}\n\n== First invasion (1274) ==\n[[File:Kikuchi Yoosai - Mongol Invasion (m\u014dko sh\u016brai) - Tokyo National Museum.jpg|thumb|The Mongol fleet destroyed in a typhoon, ink and water on paper, by [[Kikuchi Y\u014dsai]], 1847]]\n\nThe Yuan invasion force set off from Korea on 2 November 1274. Two days later they landed on Komodahama beach on [[Tsushima Island]]. [[S\u014d clan|S\u014d]] Sukekuni, the governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but was overwhelmed and killed. The Yuan fleet departed Tsushima on 13 November and attacked [[Iki Island]]. Like Sukekuni, Taira Kageetaka, the governor of Iki, gave a spirited defense before falling back to his castle by nightfall. The next morning, Yuan forces had surrounded the castle. Kagetaka made a final failed sortie before committing suicide with his family.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=37}}\n\nThe Yuan fleet crossed the sea and land in [[Hakata Bay]] on 19 November, a short distance from [[Dazaifu, Fukuoka|Dazaifu]], the ancient administrative capital of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. The following day brought the [[Battle of Bun'ei]] (\u6587\u6c38\u306e\u5f79), also known as the \"First Battle of Hakata Bay\". Conlan argues that the ''History of Yuan'''s account of the battle suggests that both the Japanese and Yuan forces were of similar size. Conlan estimated that both armies numbered around 3,000 each (not including the Yuan sailors) during this battle.<ref name=\"Conlan, p. 264\">Conlan, p. 264</ref> The Japanese forces inexperienced with non-Japanese tactics found the Mongol army perplexing. The Yuan forces disembarked and advanced in a dense body protected by a screen of shields. They wielded their polearms in a tightly packed fashioin with no space between them. As they advanced they also threw paper and iron casing bombs on occasion, frightening the Japanese horses and making them uncontrollable in battle. When the grandson of a Japanese commander shot an arrow to announce the beginning of battle, the Mongols burst out laughing. By nightfall, the Japanese had been driven several kilometres inland.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=49}}\n\n{{quotation|The commanding general kept his position on high ground, and directed the various detachments as need be with signals from hand-drums. But whenever the (Mongol) soldiers took to flight, they sent iron bomb-shells (tetsuho) flying against us, which made our side dizzy and confused. Our soldiers were frightened out of their wits by the thundering explosions; their eyes were blinded, their ears deafened, so that they could hardly distinguish east from west. According to our manner of fighting, we must first call out by name someone from the enemy ranks, and then attack in single combat. But they (the Mongols) took no notice at all of such conventions; they rushed forward all together in a mass, grappling with any individuals they could catch and killing them.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=178}}|''Hachiman Gudoukun}}\n\nDespite the invasion's success in pushing back Japanese forces, a senior Yuan commander, Liu Fuxiang, had been seriously injured in battle. The Mongol and Korean ship captains were also concerned with their small numbers and the possibility of facing a larger Japanese army, so they decided to retreat and set sail for Korea. For the ships at that time the navigation to north, i.e. from Hakata to Korea's south-eastern shores, was risky, if not in daytime and under south wind. However, they pressed ahead the retreating action at night and encountered severe storms. Some accounts offer casualty reports that suggest 200 ships were lost. Of the 30,000 strong invasion force, 13,500 did not return.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=49-50}}\n\nA story widely known in Japan is that back in Kamakura, Tokimune was overcome with fear when the invasion finally came, and wanting to overcome his cowardice, he asked [[Mugaku Sogen]], his [[Zen master]] also known as Bukko, for advice. Bukko replied he had to sit in meditation to find the source of his cowardice in himself. Tokimune went to Bukko and said, \"Finally there is the greatest happening of my life.\" Bukko asked, \"How do you plan to face it?\" Tokimune screamed, \"''Katsu!''\" (\"Victory!\") as if he wanted to scare all the enemies in front of him.

The major difference between the first and second invasion was that the Yuan dynasty had finished conquering the Song dynasty in 1279 and was able to launch a two-pronged attack. The invading force was drawn from a number of sources including criminals with commuted death sentence and even those in mourning for their parents (a serious affair in contemporary China). More than 1,000 ships were requisitioned for the invasion: 600 from Southern China, 900 from Korea. Reportedly 40,000 troops were amassed in Korea and 100,000 in Southern China. These numbers are likely an exaggeration but the addition of Southern Chinese resources probably meant the second invasion force was still several times larger than the first invasion. Nothing is known about the size of the Japanese forces.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=55-57}}\n\n==Second invasion (1281)==\n[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|thumb|350px|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding Yuan ships in 1281.]]\n\nOrders for the second invasion came in the first lunar month of 1281.

According to the ''History of Yuan'', the Japanese commander Shoni Suketoki and Ryuzoji Suetoki led forces in the tens of thousands against the invasion force. The expeditionary forces discharged their firearms and the Japanese were routed with Suketoki killed in the process. More than 300 islanders were killed. The soldiers sought out the children and killed them as well.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=58}}\n\nThe Eastern Route army was supposed to wait for the Southern Route army at Iki but disobeyed orders and set out to invade mainland Japan by themselves. They departed on 23 June, a full week ahead of the expected arrival of the Southern Route army on 2 July. The Eastern Route army split their forces in half to simultaneously attack Hakata Bay and Nagato Province. Three hundred ships attacked Nagato on 25 June but were driven off and forced to return to Iki. Meanwhile, the rest of the Eastern Route army attacked Hakata Bay, which was heavily fortified with a defensive wall. Some Mongol ships came ashore but were driven off by volleys of arrows from the defensive wall. Unable to land, the Mongol invasion force occupied the islands of Shiga and Noko from which they planned to launch raids against Hakata. Instead the Japanese launched raids against them at night on board small ships. The ''Hachiman Gudokun'' credit Kusano Jiro with boarding a Mongol ship, setting fire to it, and taking 21 heads. The next day, Kawano Michiari led a daytime raid with just two boats. His uncle Michitoki was immediately killed by an arrow and Michiari was wounded both in the shoulder and the left arm. However upon boarding the enemy ship, he slew a large Mongol warrior, for which he was made a hero and richly rewarded. The Mongols were eventually driven from Shiga island and withdrew to Iki on 18 July. The Japanese defense of Hakata Bay is known as the [[Battle of K\u014dan]].{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=69}}\n\nAfter the Southern Route fleet arrived at Iki, the two fleets took some time rearranging themselves before advancing on Taka island. On 12 August, the Japanese repeated their small raids on the invasion fleet. The Mongols responded by fastening their ships together with chains and planks to provide defensive platforms. There are no accounts of the raids from the Japanese side in this incident unlike at the defense of Hakata Bay. According to the ''History of Yuan'', the Japanese ships were small and were all beaten off. It was at this point that a great typhoon, known in Japanese as ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'', struck the fleet at anchor and devastated it. Sensing the oncoming typhoon, Korean and south Chinese mariners retreated and unsuccessfully docked in Imari Bay where they were destroyed by the storm.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/divinewindhistor00eman|url-access=registration|quote=mongol invasion of japan.|title=Divine Wind: The History and Science of Hurricanes|first1=Kerry|last1=Emanuel|first2=Professor Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences Program in Atmospheres Oceans and Climate Kerry|last2=Emanuel|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|accessdate=30 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Thousands of soldiers were left drifting on pieces of wood or washed ashore. The Japanese defenders killed all they found except for the Southern Chinese, who they felt had been coerced into joining the attack on Japan. According to a Chinese survivor, after the typhoon, Commander Fan Wenhu picked the best remaining ships and sailed away, leaving more than 100,000 troops to die. After being stranded for three days on Taka island, the Japanese attacked, capturing tens of thousands. They were moved to Hakata where the Japanese killed all the Mongols, Koreans, and Northern Chinese. The Southern Chinese were spared but made slaves. According to a Korean source, of the 26,989 Koreans who set out with the Eastern Route fleet, 7,592 did not return.{{sfn|Turnbull|2010|p=69-76}}\n\n===Size of the invasion===\nMany modern historians believe the figures for the invasion force to be exaggerated, as was common in medieval chronicles. Professor Thomas Conlan states that they were likely exaggerated by an order of magnitude (implying 14,000 soldiers and sailors), expressing skepticism that a medieval kingdom managed an invasion on the scale of [[D-Day]] during World War II across over ten times the distance, and questions if even 10,000 soldiers attacked Japan in 1281.<ref name=\"Conlan, p. 264\"/> Morris Rossabbi states that Conlan was correct in his assertion that the invasion force was much smaller than traditionally believed, but argues that the expenditures lavished on the mission confirm that the fighting force was sizable and much larger than 10,000 soldiers and 4,000 sailors. He puts forward the alternative figure of 70,000 soldiers and sailors, half of what is spoken of in the Yuanshi and later Japanese claims.<ref>Rossabi, Morris. \"Khubilai Khan: His Life and Times.\" 1988. Page xiii.</ref> Turnbull thinks that 140,000+ is an exaggeration, but does not offer his own precise estimate for the size of the army. Rather, he only states that given the contributions of the Southern Song, the second invasion should have been around three times larger than the first. As he earlier listed the common figure of 23,000 for the first invasion uncritically, unlike the estimate of 140,000+ for the second, that would imply an invasion force of ~70,000, on par with Rossabbi's estimate.<ref>Turbull 2013, p. 57</ref>\n\n==Military significance==\n[[File:M\u014dko Sh\u016brai Ekotoba e2.jpg|thumb|Kagesuke Shoni and his forces in Akasaka]]\n[[Kublai Khan]]'s invasions of Japan were the first of only three instances when the samurai fought foreign troops rather than amongst themselves; the others being [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]] and the Japanese [[invasion of Ryukyu]] (1609). The invasions exposed the Japanese to an alien fighting style which, lacking the [[single combat]] that characterized traditional samurai combat, they saw as inferior. The Mongol method of advances and withdrawals based on signal sounds from bells, drums and war cries was also unknown in Japan at that time, as was the technique of shooting arrows ''en masse'' into the air rather than long-ranged one-on-one combat. \n\nThe Mongol invasions of Japan facilitated a change in the designs of Japanese swords. Thin [[tachi]] and [[Chokut\u014d|chokuto]] style blades were often unable to cut through the boiled leather armor of the Mongols, with the blades often chipping or breaking off.<ref>Sat\u014d, Kanzan. Kodansha International. 1983. Page 104</ref> Tachi blades were shortened and thickened, with the katana eventually being introduced as a result.\n\nThe Mongols and the Ashikaga shogunate of Japan made peace in the late 14th century during the reign of [[Toghon Tem\u00fcr]], the last Yuan emperor in Khanbaliq. Long before the peace agreement, there was stable trade in [[East Asia]] under the dominance of the Mongols and Japan.\n\nAs a consequence of the destruction of the Mongol fleets, Japan's independence was guaranteed. Simultaneously, a power struggle within Japan led to the dominance of military governments and diminishing Imperial power.<ref>Davis, Paul K. (2001). {{Google books|nv73QlQs9ocC|''100 decisive battles: from ancient times to the present,'' p. 146.|page=146}}</ref>\n===Bombs and cannons===\n[[File:\u3066\u3064\u306f\u3046\uff08\u9707\u5929\u96f7\uff09.JPG|thumb|Stoneware bombs, known in Japanese as ''Tetsuhau'' (iron bomb), or in Chinese as ''Zhentianlei'' (literally, heaven-shaking thunder), excavated from Takashima shipwreck, October 2011.]]\n\nThe Mongol invasions are an early example of gunpowder warfare. One of the most notable technological innovations during the war was the use of explosive bombs.<ref name=\"Turnbull2013\"/> The bombs are known in Chinese as \"thunder crash bombs\" and were fired from catapults, inflicting damage on enemy soldiers. An illustration of a bomb is depicted in the Japanese Mongol Invasion scrolls, but Thomas Conlan has shown that the illustration of the projectiles was added to the scrolls in the eighteenth century and should not be considered to be an eyewitness representation of their use.<ref>Conlan, Thomas. \"Myth, Memory and the Scrolls of the Mongol Invasions of Japan\". in Lillehoj, Elizabeth ed. ''Archaism and Antiquarianism in Korean and Japanese Art'' (Chicago: Center for the Art of East Asia, University of Chicago and Art Media Resources, 2013), pp. 54-73.</ref> Archaeological evidence of the use of gunpowder was finally confirmed when multiple shells of the explosive bombs were discovered in an underwater shipwreck off the shore of Japan by the Kyushu Okinawa Society for Underwater Archaeology. X-rays by Japanese scientists of the excavated shells provided proof that they contained gunpowder.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Delgado|first=James|title=Relics of the Kamikaze|journal=Archaeology|date=February 2003|volume=56|issue=1|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0301/etc/kamikaze.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229155139/http://archive.archaeology.org/0301/etc/kamikaze.html|archivedate=2013-12-29}}</ref>\n\nThe Yuan forces may have also used cannons during the invasion. The ''[[Taiheiki]]'' mentions a weapon shaped like a bell that made a noise like thunder-clap and shot out thousands of iron balls.{{sfn|Needham|1986|p=295}}{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=109}}\n[[File:M\u014dko Sh\u016brai Ekotoba4.JPG|center|thumb|upright=3.5|Suenaga and escaping Mongolians]]\n\n==Cultural influence==\nThe Zen Buddhism of Hojo Tokimune and his Zen master Bukko gained credibility beyond national boundaries, and the first mass followings of Zen teachings among samurai began to flourish.\n\nThe failed invasions also mark the first use of the word ''kamikaze'' (\"Divine Wind\").  The fact that the typhoon that helped Japan defeat the Mongol Navy in the first invasion occurred in late November, well after the normal Pacific typhoon season (May to October), perpetuated the Japanese belief that they would never be defeated or successfully invaded, which remained an important aspect of Japanese foreign policy until the very end of [[World War II]].

This prefigured the period 1983\u20131987 when Owen and Steel were Leaders of the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] and tension grew over whether their deal was a prelude to a merger of the parties or merely a temporary electoral pact.\n\nDuring the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 election campaign]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Francis Pym]] was asked by an A-level student named Andy Davis about the implications of the Conservatives winning the election with a landslide victory. He began by casting doubt on the likelihood of this happening and then observed \"I think landslides on the whole don't produce successful governments\". Margaret Thatcher later wrote that the remark \"struck a wrong note\": \"people drew the inference that he did not want us to win a large majority\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Thatcher |first=Margaret |title=The Downing Street Years |url=https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that |url-access=registration |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that/page/n329 294] |ISBN=0002550490}}</ref> After the election (won by the Conservatives on a landslide) she sacked him as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], partly because of his [[gaffe]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Thatcher |first=Margaret |title=The Downing Street Years |url=https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that |url-access=registration |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that/page/n341 306] |ISBN=0002550490}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1984 edition, [[Alan Clark]], a junior government Minister at the time, was openly critical of a government decision to buy a foreign-made missile system, prompting guest host [[Sue Lawley]] to ask the audience, \"Is there anyone here who wishes to defend the government on this, because its Minister doesn't?\"\n\nA 1994 edition was notable for a confrontation between [[Jeffrey Archer]] and the historian [[David Starkey]] over the age of homosexual consent. After arguing that 18 should be the age of consent, Archer was attacked by Starkey who told him: \"Englishmen like you enjoy sitting on the fence so much because you enjoy the sensation.\"<ref>{{Citation | last = Havard | first = Ed | title = Question Time defined by 'epic' battles | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/9366830.stm | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | date = 20 January 2011 | accessdate = 16 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe programme broadcast on 13 September 2001, which was devoted to the political implications of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]], featured many contributions from members of the audience who were anti-American, expressing the view that \"the United States had it coming\". The BBC received more than 2,000 complaints and later apologised to viewers for causing offence, stating that the edition should not have been broadcast live, but rather should have been recorded and edited.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1544897.stm BBC chief apologises for terror debate], BBC News, 15 September 2001</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the editor of ''[[Private Eye]]'', [[Ian Hislop]], made an open attack on Jeffrey Archer, who had been imprisoned for [[perjury]], when his wife [[Mary Archer]] was a fellow panellist. She was noticeably angry that the issue had been raised and criticised Hislop after the recording had finished.\n\nIn March 2007, an Iraq Special was broadcast, featuring [[Tony Benn]], [[Benazir Bhutto]], [[Des Browne]], [[Liam Fox]], [[Charles Kennedy]] and, via [[video link]] from [[Washington D.C.]], [[John R. Bolton]]. The episode is particularly memorable for the clashes between Benn and Bolton.\n\nOn 11 October 2007, former editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper [[Kelvin MacKenzie]] appeared on the programme in [[Cheltenham]] and launched an attack on Scotland. During a debate about tax, MacKenzie claimed that \"Scotland believes not in entrepreneurialism like London and the south east... Scots enjoy spending it (money) but they don't enjoy creating it, which is the opposite to down south.\" The comments came as part of an attack on [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] who MacKenzie said could not be trusted to manage the British economy because he was \"a Scot\" and a \"socialist\", and insisting that this was relevant to the debate. Fellow panellist [[Chuka Umunna]] from the [[think tank]] Compass called his comments \"absolutely disgraceful\", and booing and jeering were heard from the Cheltenham studio audience. The BBC received 350 complaints and MacKenzie's comments drew widespread criticism in both Scotland and England. On 3 July 2008, it was reported that the BBC Trust's editorial complaints unit had cleared the programme of any wrongdoing. ''Question Time'' then proceeded to broadcast the following question from Nick Hartley as part of the programme on the same evening: \"After the media coverage of [Andy] Murray's rise and fall, are we now to infer that the English resent the Scots more than the Scots resent the English?\" MacKenzie reappeared on the programme in [[Cardiff]] on 17 May 2012.\n\nAfter he was elected to the European Parliament, [[Nick Griffin]] the leader of the [[British National Party]] was invited onto ''Question Time'' for the first time, to appear on 22 October 2009.

This prefigured the period 1983\u20131987 when Owen and Steel were Leaders of the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] and tension grew over whether their deal was a prelude to a merger of the parties or merely a temporary electoral pact.\n\nDuring the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 election campaign]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Francis Pym]] was asked by an A-level student named Andy Davis about the implications of the Conservatives winning the election with a landslide victory. He began by casting doubt on the likelihood of this happening and then observed \"I think landslides on the whole don't produce successful governments\". Margaret Thatcher later wrote that the remark \"struck a wrong note\": \"people drew the inference that he did not want us to win a large majority\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Thatcher |first=Margaret |title=The Downing Street Years |url=https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that |url-access=registration |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that/page/n329 294] |ISBN=0002550490}}</ref> After the election (won by the Conservatives on a landslide) she sacked him as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], partly because of his [[gaffe]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Thatcher |first=Margaret |title=The Downing Street Years |url=https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that |url-access=registration |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that/page/n341 306] |ISBN=0002550490}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1984 edition, [[Alan Clark]], a junior government Minister at the time, was openly critical of a government decision to buy a foreign-made missile system, prompting guest host [[Sue Lawley]] to ask the audience, \"Is there anyone here who wishes to defend the government on this, because its Minister doesn't?\"\n\nA 1994 edition was notable for a confrontation between [[Jeffrey Archer]] and the historian [[David Starkey]] over the age of homosexual consent. After arguing that 18 should be the age of consent, Archer was attacked by Starkey who told him: \"Englishmen like you enjoy sitting on the fence so much because you enjoy the sensation.\"<ref>{{Citation | last = Havard | first = Ed | title = Question Time defined by 'epic' battles | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/9366830.stm | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | date = 20 January 2011 | accessdate = 16 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe programme broadcast on 13 September 2001, which was devoted to the political implications of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]], featured many contributions from members of the audience who were anti-American, expressing the view that \"the United States had it coming\". The BBC received more than 2,000 complaints and later apologised to viewers for causing offence, stating that the edition should not have been broadcast live, but rather should have been recorded and edited.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1544897.stm BBC chief apologises for terror debate], BBC News, 15 September 2001</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the editor of ''[[Private Eye]]'', [[Ian Hislop]], made an open attack on Jeffrey Archer, who had been imprisoned for [[perjury]], when his wife [[Mary Archer]] was a fellow panellist. She was noticeably angry that the issue had been raised and criticised Hislop after the recording had finished.\n\nIn March 2007, an Iraq Special was broadcast, featuring [[Tony Benn]], [[Benazir Bhutto]], [[Des Browne]], [[Liam Fox]], [[Charles Kennedy]] and, via [[video link]] from [[Washington D.C.]], [[John R. Bolton]]. The episode is particularly memorable for the clashes between Benn and Bolton.\n\nOn 11 October 2007, former editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper [[Kelvin MacKenzie]] appeared on the programme in [[Cheltenham]] and launched an attack on Scotland. During a debate about tax, MacKenzie claimed that \"Scotland believes not in entrepreneurialism like London and the south east... Scots enjoy spending it (money) but they don't enjoy creating it, which is the opposite to down south.\" The comments came as part of an attack on [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] who MacKenzie said could not be trusted to manage the British economy because he was \"a Scot\" and a \"socialist\", and insisting that this was relevant to the debate. Fellow panellist [[Chuka Umunna]] from the [[think tank]] Compass called his comments \"absolutely disgraceful\", and booing and jeering were heard from the Cheltenham studio audience. The BBC received 350 complaints and MacKenzie's comments drew widespread criticism in both Scotland and England. On 3 July 2008, it was reported that the BBC Trust's editorial complaints unit had cleared the programme of any wrongdoing. ''Question Time'' then proceeded to broadcast the following question from Nick Hartley as part of the programme on the same evening: \"After the media coverage of [Andy] Murray's rise and fall, are we now to infer that the English resent the Scots more than the Scots resent the English?\" MacKenzie reappeared on the programme in [[Cardiff]] on 17 May 2012.\n\nAfter he was elected to the European Parliament, [[Nick Griffin]] the leader of the [[British National Party]] was invited onto ''Question Time'' for the first time, to appear on 22 October 2009. The decision led to [[Question Time British National Party controversy|controversy and political debate]].
