For example, all of the elements \u2014 goods of economic value, open access to contribute and consume, interaction and exchange, purposeful yet loosely coordinated work \u2014 are present in an open source software project, in Wikipedia, or in a user forum or community.

Open-source licensed software is mostly available [[freeware|free]] of charge, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Licenses which only permit [[non-commercial]] redistribution or modification of the source code for personal use only are generally not considered as open-source licenses. However, open-source licenses may have some restrictions, particularly regarding the expression of respect to the origin of software, such as a requirement to preserve the name of the authors and a copyright statement within the code, or a requirement to redistribute the licensed software only under the same license (as in a [[copyleft]] license). One popular set of [[open-source software]] licenses are those approved by the [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) based on their [[Open Source Definition]] (OSD).\n\n=== Open-source software code ===\n{{main|Open-source software}}\n\nGenerally, open source refers to a [[computer program]] in which the [[source code]] is available to the general public for use for any (including commercial) purpose, or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a [[software license]]. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.\n\n=== \"Open\" versus \"free\" versus \"free and open\" ===\n\n[[Free and open-source software]] (FOSS) or [[Free and open-source software#Overview|Free/libre and open-source software]] (FLOSS) is openly shared source code that is licensed without any restrictions on usage, modification, or distribution.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Confusion persists about this completely unrestricted definition because the \"Free\", also known as \"Libre\", refers to the freedom or the product not the price, expense, cost, or charge. For example, \"being free to speak\" is not the same as \"free beer\".<ref name=\"rmsdissent\" />\n\nConversely, Richard Stallman argues the ''obvious meaning'' of term \"open source\" is that the source code is public/accessible for inspection, without necessarily any other rights granted, although the proponents of the term say the conditions in the [[Open Source Definition]] must be fulfilled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html|author=Richard Stallman|authorlink=Richard Stallman|title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free

Open-source licensed software is mostly available [[freeware|free]] of charge, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Licenses which only permit [[non-commercial]] redistribution or modification of the source code for personal use only are generally not considered as open-source licenses. However, open-source licenses may have some restrictions, particularly regarding the expression of respect to the origin of software, such as a requirement to preserve the name of the authors and a copyright statement within the code, or a requirement to redistribute the licensed software only under the same license (as in a [[copyleft]] license). One popular set of [[open-source software]] licenses are those approved by the [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) based on their [[Open Source Definition]] (OSD).\n\n=== Open-source software code ===\n{{main|Open-source software}}\n\nGenerally, open source refers to a [[computer program]] in which the [[source code]] is available to the general public for use for any (including commercial) purpose, or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a [[software license]]. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.\n\n=== \"Open\" versus \"free\" versus \"free and open\" ===\n\n[[Free and open-source software]] (FOSS) or [[Free and open-source software#Overview|Free/libre and open-source software]] (FLOSS) is openly shared source code that is licensed without any restrictions on usage, modification, or distribution.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Confusion persists about this completely unrestricted definition because the \"Free\", also known as \"Libre\", refers to the freedom or the product not the price, expense, cost, or charge. For example, \"being free to speak\" is not the same as \"free beer\".<ref name=\"rmsdissent\" />\n\nConversely, Richard Stallman argues the ''obvious meaning'' of term \"open source\" is that the
