As part of its recovery program the university has established partnerships with four foreign universities, including [[Purdue University]] and the [[University of Arizona]]. Furthermore, the Information Technology Center was founded in 2002 with the cooperation of [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) and [[Technical University of Berlin]]. The number of students in higher education had increased across the country from 22,717 in 2002 to 56,451 in 2008.

Its programming is also simulcasted on [[Broadcast_relay_station#United_States|FM Translator]] W224DT, licensed to [[Port Huron, Michigan]] at 92.7&nbsp;mHz, with an [[effective radiated power]] of 125 watts.\n\nThe station currently broadcasts an [[Adult album alternative]]/[[Americana (music)|Americana]] format branded as ''92.7 WHLX The Hills''.\n\n==History==\nThe station started as '''WSDC''' in 1951, then '''WDOG''' and later became '''WSMA''' with [[country music]].\n\n===Early years===\nWHLX went on the air on December 10, 1951 with the call letters WSDC, operating from its transmitter facility at 5300 Marine City Highway, on the outskirts of Marine City.  Doing business as Radio St. Clair, Inc., Jerry Coughlin served as the station's first president and general manager.\n\nBy 1954, Coughlin had turned the duties of general manager to sales director John Bell and renamed the station WDOG.  Fred Cale assumed sales and management duties by 1960.\n\n===First sale===\nIn February 1967, Coughlin sold WDOG to Sommerville Broadcasting Company, owned by Richard S. Sommerville.  He renamed the station WSMA, and adopted a country music format. It maintained this format and call sign for the next 26 years.\n\nA disadvantage that the station had for much of its history was its geographic separation from more profitable markets.  Located about 12 miles from any kind of urban sprawl, it had difficulty attaching itself to another community for more profit potential, as retail business in tiny Marine City was unable to provide a steady source of revenue, even during AM's halcyon years.  For a time, WSMA maintained a small sales office in Port Huron, across the street from competitors WHLS and WSAQ.  Despite the challenges, WSMA produced a modest profit during its early years.\n\nThe Port Huron office closed when the station began to fail in the late 1980s, not long after coming under the control of a new owner.\n\nThose failures arose out of an overall lack of dependability of the station, often shutting down operations at sunset (even after being granted nighttime power authorization), and sometimes not going on air at all during holidays and some weekends.\n\n===Second sale===\nOn May 17, 1987, Richard S. Sommerville, who by this time owned [[WCEN]]-AM/FM in Mount Pleasant, sold WSMA to Frink, Inc., under a land contract agreement to pay for the station in monthly installments of $1,845.  However, in a letter to the FCC dated November 7, 1990, Washington attorney Earl Stanley stated that Sommerville resumed control of WSMA after Frink Inc. failed to meet its financial obligations, prompting a foreclosure civil action in the Circuit Court of St. Clair County.\n\nFrink Inc. was declared in default on May 7, 1990, and was given 180 days to bring its monetary obligations to Sommerville from that date.  Frink was required to pay more than $30,000 in unpaid promissory note payments and real estate taxes, according to court papers, putting its total amount owed to more than $150,000.  The debts were not satisfied, and as of November 3, 1990, the 181st day of the notice, Sommerville recaptured the license, and assumed the role of trustee.\n\n===Reborn: WIFN-AM===\n[[Image:WIFN towers.jpg|thumb|WIFN's two directional antenna broadcast towers, located at 5300 Marine City Highway in Marine City, in 1996. The unused WIFN station remote van sits next to the right tower.]]\nHoping to restore WSMA to its former glory, broadcasters David Barr and Rick Schremp formed Barr/Schremp Communications in 1993 and took control of WSMA that year.  Coincidentally, Barr's father William was the former owner of WATC AM 900 & WZXM FM 95.3 (now 101.5 [[WMJZ]]) in Gaylord, 220 miles north of Detroit, before selling it in 1986.\n\nBarr/Schremp Communications changed the station's call letters to WIFN, and began a gradual phase-out of the country music format in favor of personality talk.  Under the new format, the station bore such talents such as G. Gordon Liddy, Larry King, Chuck Harder and Sports Byline USA. [[Ken Hawk]] and [[Dave Haze]] handled news duties, with Marty Simmonds serving as sports director.  The station experienced an increase in revenue under the new format and owners.\n\nBarr and Schremp dissolved their partnership two years after taking control of WIFN, with Schremp pursuing other interests.  In 1997 Barr sold the station to Hanson Communications, then-licensee of [[WPHM]]-AM and [[WBTI-FM]] in Port Huron, one of WIFN's longtime competitors.  Given multiple job offers after the sale, Barr then moved north to Traverse City, where he assumed a promotions and marketing role with country music powerhouse [[WTCM-FM|WTCM]].\n\n===\"Real Country\"===\nFollowing completion of the sale in late 1997, country music returned with \"Real Country\" via satellite from the ABC/SMN radio network, after a brief period of simulcasting with [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]]/[[Hot AC]] sister station [[WBTI]] 96.9 FM. WIFN became '''WHYT''' (picking up the calls dumped by Detroit's 96.3 FM, now [[WDVD]]) under the \"Real Country\" format.  Hanson Communications also moved the station's on-air operations from its longtime location at 5300 Marine City Highway to its main base of operations at 2379 Military Street in Port Huron.\n\nMost administrative functions were handled by the existing staff of Hanson Communications, and Hanson's sales force dedicated their same aggression to selling WHYT as they did their two other properties.\n\nBy 2000, Hanson Communications sold 1590 WHYT to Liggett Communications (now [[Radio First]]).  Liggett, who was also in the process of acquiring Hanson's competitor, [[WHLS]]-AM and [[WSAQ]]-FM, decided to co-locate all five stations at 808 Huron Street, which was the main base of operations for WHLS and WSAQ, and had enough space for expansion, unlike the Military Street facility.\n\n===WHLS simulcast===\nRecognizing the opportunity to extend WHLS's signal to the southern [[the thumb|Thumb area of Michigan]], Liggett Communications abandoned the \"Real Country\" format and moniker, and simulcast WHLS's programming. WHYT changed its call letters to WHLX, to more closely match that of its sister station.  The move allowed WHLS to be heard as far south as [[Warren, Michigan]] in Macomb County and as far north as [[Sandusky, Michigan]] in Sanilac County. Its directional covers most of Macomb County, eastern Lapeer County, and most of Lambton County Ontario.\n\nThe station very briefly simulcasted WPHM Port Huron in late December 2017 but had reverted to the WHLS simulcast by mid-January 2018\n\n===WBTI simulcast===\nOn August 31, 2018, WHLX started simulcasting WBTI. With WBTI simulcasting on WHLX, Liggett Communications has a WBTI on 3 frequencies as WHLX now has the translator W224DT transmitting on 92.7 in Port Huron. This has extended WBTI's reach from northern Lexington area down to Marine City/Algonac.\n\n===92.7 The Gift===\nOn November 11, 2018, WHLX started airing a Christmas music format, branded as 92.7 The Gift, Port Huron's Christmas Station.\n\n===92.7 WHLX The Hills===\nOn March 1, 2019, WHLX launched an adult album alternative/Americana format, branded as \"92.7 The Hills\".<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/174860/the-hills-are-alive-in-port-huron/ The Hills Are Alive in Port Huron] Radioinsight - March 1, 2019</ref>\n\n==Technical==\nWHLX covers the southern portion of St. Clair County and much of [[Macomb County, Michigan]]. WHLX broadcasts with 1,000 watts during the day and 102 watts after sunset to protect other larger AM radio stations. WHLX has a two-tower directional pattern pointed towards the north from a transmitter site located along Marine City Highway.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.michiguide.com/dials/rad-g/whlx.html Michiguide.com - WHLX history]\n*[http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1952/101-200%20Broadcasting%20Yearbook%201952-2.pdf 1952 Broadcasting Yearbook]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1953/101-200%20Broadcasting%20Yearbook%201953-2.pdf 1953 Broadcasting Yearbook]{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1960/B%201%20Radio%20Yearbook%201960.pdf 1960 Broadcasting Yearbook]{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110313195147/http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1965/B1%201965%20YB%20All-11.pdf 1965 Broadcasting Yearbook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101008175447/http://davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1978/301-400%20YB%201978.pdf 1978 Broadcasting Yearbook]\n{{AM station data|WHLX}}\n*{{FMQ|W224DT}}\n*{{FXL|W224DT}}\n\n{{Thumb Radio}}\n\n{{coord|42|43|42|N|82|31|15|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Detroit|HLX]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Americana radio stations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox radio station\n | name             = WHLX\n | image            = WHLXLogo.png\n | image_size       = \n | city             = [[Marine City, Michigan]]\n | area             = [[Port Huron, Michigan]]\n | branding         = ''92.7 WHLX The Hills''\n | slogan           = \n | frequency        = 1590 [[kHz]]\n | translator       = 92.7 W224DT (Port Huron)\n | airdate          = December 10, 1951 (as WSDC)\n | format           = [[Adult album alternative|AAA]]/[[Americana (music)|Americana]]\n | power            = 1,000 [[watt]]s (daytime)<BR>102 [[watt]]s (nighttime)\n | class            = D\n | facility_id      = 56266\n | callsign_meaning = Disambiguation of [[WHLS]]\n | former_callsigns = WHYT (11/17/97-9/19/00)<br>WIFN (6/2/93-11/17/97)<br>WSMA (1967-6/2/93)<br>WDOG (1954-67)<br>WSDC (1950-54)\n | affiliations     =\n | owner            = [[Radio First]]\n | sister_stations  =\n | webcast          = [http://player.listenlive.co/61861 Listen Live]\n | website          = [https://www.927whlx.com 927whlx.com]\n}}\n\n \t\n'''WHLX''' is an [[United States|American]] radio station, licensed to [[Marine City, Michigan]] at 1590&nbsp;kHz, with a power output of 1,000 watts day, 102 watts night.

Doing business as Radio St. Clair, Inc., Jerry Coughlin served as the station's first president and general manager.\n\nBy 1954, Coughlin had turned the duties of general manager to sales director John Bell and renamed the station WDOG.  Fred Cale assumed sales and management duties by 1960.\n\n===First sale===\nIn February 1967, Coughlin sold WDOG to Sommerville Broadcasting Company, owned by Richard S. Sommerville.

The female mosquito lands on the velour strip to lay eggs and receives a lethal dose of pesticide.]]\nA '''lethal ovitrap''' is a device which attracts gravid female container-breeding mosquitoes and kills them. The traps halt the insect's life cycle by killing adult insects and stopping reproduction. The original use of [[ovitrap]]s was to monitor the spread and density of ''[[Aedes]]'' and other container-breeding mosquito populations by collecting eggs which could be counted, or hatched to identify the types of insects. Since its conception, researchers found that adding lethal substances to the ovitraps could control the populations of these targeted species. These traps are called lethal ovitraps. They primarily target ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' and ''[[Aedes albopictus]]'' mosquitoes, which are the main vectors of [[dengue fever]], [[Zika virus]], [[west Nile virus]], [[yellow fever]], and [[chikungunya]].\n\nLethal ovitraps can either contain substances that kills larvae that hatch from eggs laid in the traps (larvicidal ovitraps), or substances that kill the adult mosquito when she enters, along with any larva that may hatch (adulticidal ovitraps). While larvicidal ovitraps only reduce larval growth, they do not kill the adult mosquitoes that may carry diseases. Adulticidal ovitraps act to kill the viremic (disease-carrying) female mosquitoes and act to directly stop disease transmission.\n\nLethal ovitraps use tiny amounts of pesticides, usually 99.9% less chemicals than applied using traditional spraying or \u201cfogging\u201d. They provide isolated spaces where mosquitoes, not humans and other wildlife, will find these pesticides, instead of broadcasting them into the environment. Harsher pesticides with less mosquito resistance can be used in these traps because the spaces are so isolated. This allows for better mosquito control with less pesticide use.\n\n== How it works ==\nThese dark, water-filled containers mimic the breeding site of container-breeding mosquitoes including the ''Aedes'' species. They prefer to lay their eggs in small man-made containers that hold standing water including rain buckets, flower pots, old tires, gutters, the leaf axils of plants, and even discarded bottles, cans, and other trash. These mosquitoes may visit on average 12 or more sites per egg-laying cycle<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4269/ajtmh.1995.52.177 |pmid=7872449 |title=Short Report: Dispersal of Aedes aegypti in an Urban Area after Blood Feeding as Demonstrated by Rubidium-Marked Eggs |journal=[[The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene]] |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=177\u2013179 |year=1995 |last1=Reiter |first1=Paul |last2=Clark |first2=Gary G. |last3=Anderson |first3=Robert A. |last4=Amador |first4=Manuel A. }}</ref> in an act called \"skip-oviposition\". This ensures as many eggs as possible will survive if the breeding sites are damaged or dried up.

The female mosquito lands on the velour strip to lay eggs and receives a lethal dose of pesticide.]]\nA '''lethal ovitrap''' is a device which attracts gravid female container-breeding mosquitoes and kills them. The traps halt the insect's life cycle by killing adult insects and stopping reproduction. The original use of [[ovitrap]]s was to monitor the spread and density of ''[[Aedes]]'' and other container-breeding mosquito populations by collecting eggs which could be counted, or hatched to identify the types of insects. Since its conception, researchers found that adding lethal substances to the ovitraps could control the populations of these targeted species. These traps are called lethal ovitraps. They primarily target ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' and ''[[Aedes albopictus]]'' mosquitoes, which are the main vectors of [[dengue fever]], [[Zika virus]], [[west Nile virus]], [[yellow fever]], and [[chikungunya]].\n\nLethal ovitraps can either contain substances that kills larvae that hatch from eggs laid in the traps (larvicidal ovitraps), or substances that kill the adult mosquito when she enters, along with any larva that may hatch (adulticidal ovitraps). While larvicidal ovitraps only reduce larval growth, they do not kill the adult mosquitoes that may carry diseases. Adulticidal ovitraps act to kill the viremic (disease-carrying) female mosquitoes and act to directly stop disease transmission.\n\nLethal ovitraps use tiny amounts of pesticides, usually 99.9% less chemicals than applied using traditional spraying or \u201cfogging\u201d. They provide isolated spaces where mosquitoes, not humans and other wildlife, will find these pesticides, instead of broadcasting them into the environment. Harsher pesticides with less mosquito resistance can be used in these traps because the spaces are so isolated. This allows for better mosquito control with less pesticide use.\n\n== How it works ==\nThese dark, water-filled containers mimic the breeding site of container-breeding mosquitoes including the ''Aedes'' species. They prefer to lay their eggs in small man-made containers that hold standing water including rain buckets, flower pots, old tires, gutters, the leaf axils of plants, and even discarded bottles, cans, and other trash. These mosquitoes may visit on average 12 or more sites per egg-laying cycle<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4269/ajtmh.1995.52.177 |pmid=7872449 |title=Short Report: Dispersal of Aedes aegypti in an Urban Area after Blood Feeding as Demonstrated by Rubidium-Marked Eggs |journal=[[The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene]] |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=177\u2013179 |year=1995 |last1=Reiter |first1=Paul |last2=Clark |first2=Gary G. |last3=Anderson |first3=Robert A. |last4=Amador |first4=Manuel A. }}</ref> in an act called \"skip-oviposition\".
