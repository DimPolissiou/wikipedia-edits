Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride. [[Wuhan Tong]] cardholders will receive a 20 percent discount on single ride fares.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u8f7b\u8f68\u7968\u4ef7\u4e0b\u8c03 |url=http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2011-03/03/content_22188105.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref> On April 9, Line 1 welcomed its 100,000,000th customer, who was awarded a one-year pass to the Metro.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u8f7b\u8f68\u5ba2\u6d41\u91cf\u4eca\u65e5\u7a81\u78341\u4ebf |url=http://news.cnxianzai.com/2011/04/324488.html |language=Chinese}}</ref> On September 9, preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 2 ([[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] segment) was approved by HDRC.\n\nOn February 17, 2012, the NDRC accepted a feasibility report on line 3, phase 1, the fourth line in Wuhan Metro's grid and the first to cross the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han River]], connecting the boroughs of [[Hankou]] and [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]]. A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor. Construction began in June 2013 and was completed in December 2017.\n\n===Timeline of service expansion===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Segment description\n!Date opened\n!Station(s)\n!# of new stations\n!Length (km)\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 1\n|{{date|2004-7-28}}\n|Zongguan \u2014 Huangpu Road\n|10{{NoteTag|in which Taipingyang Station was postponed to open on {{date|2006-4-8}}.}}\n|9.769\n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 1\n|{{date|2010-7-29}}\n| Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Zongguan;<br> Huangpu Road \u2014 Dijiao\n|16{{NoteTag|in which Zhuyehai Station was postponed to open on {{date|2014-9-17}}.<ref>[http://qzgh.qiaokou.gov.cn/qkxw/bmdt/201409/t20140917_139172.shtml \u8f7b\u8f68\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9\u5b9c\u5bb6\u8054\u5eca\u6865\u6295\u5165\u4f7f\u7528 (Zhuyehai station opened)]</ref>}}\n|18.494\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 2\n|{{date|2012-12-28}}\n| Jinyintan \u2014 Optics Valley Square\n|21\n|27.152\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 4<ref>[http://cjweek.cjn.cn/html/2013-12/27/content_5269051.htm Section one of Metro Line 4 opens]</ref>\n|{{date|2013-12-28}}\n| Wuchang Railway Station \u2014 Wuhan Railway Station\n|15\n|17.974\n|-\n|Hankou North extension of Line 1\n|{{date|2014-5-28}}\n|  Dijiao \u2014 Hankou North\n|3\n|5.555 \n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 4\n|{{date|2014-12-28}}\n| Huangjinkou \u2014 Wuchang Railway Station\n|13\n|15.429\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 3<ref name=\"Line 3\">{{cite news|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u5373\u5c06\u5730\u94c1\u6210\u73af \"\u73af\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3\"\u91cd\u6784\u5546\u4e1a\u5730\u7406  |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/house/wh/2015-12/24/c_1117562445.htm |work=\u957f\u6c5f\u65e5\u62a5 |language=Chinese |date=2015-12-24 |accessdate=2015-12-24 }}</ref>\n|{{date|2015-12-28}}\n|Zhuanyang Boulevard \u2014 Hongtu Boulevard\t\n|24\n|29.660\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 6\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2016-12-28}}<ref name=\"\u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\">[http://tech.cnr.cn/techgd/20161228/t20161228_523405232.shtml  \u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6]</ref>\n|Jinyinhu Park \u2014 Dongfeng Motor Corporation\t\n|27\n|35.512\n|-\n|Northern extension of Line 2{{NoteTag|also known as Airport Line }}\n|Tianhe International Airport \u2014 Jinyintan\t\n|7\n|19.957\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 8\n| rowspan=\"3\"|{{date|2017-12-26}}\n|Jintan Road \u2014 Liyuan\t\n|12\n|16.204\n|-\n|Yangluo Line\n|Houhu Boulevard \u2014 Jintai\n|16\n|34.575\n|-\n|Jinghe extension of Line 1\n|Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Jinghe\n|3\n|4.118\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 7\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2018-10-1}}<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20181001/003195.htm#p=1|website=www.xinhuanet.com|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u957f\u6c5f\u516c\u94c1\u96a7\u9053\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a 7\u53f7\u7ebf\u300111\u53f7\u7ebf\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|access-date=2017-12-26}}</ref>\n|Garden Expo North \u2014 Yezhihu\n|19\n|30.413\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 11\n|Optics Valley Railway Station \u2014 Zuoling\n|13\n|18.744\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 7\n|{{date|2018-12-28}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Qinglongshan Ditiexiaozhen\n|7\n|16.550\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 2\n|{{date|2019-2-19}}\n|Optics Valley Square \u2014 Fozuling\n|10\n|13.195\n|-\n|Wsetern extension of Line 4<ref name=cjn201909>{{cite web|url=http://news.cjn.cn/sywh/201909/t3460424.htm|title=\u5b9a\u4e86\uff01\u5730\u94c1\u8521\u7538\u7ebf25\u65e5\u4e0a\u53489\u65f6\u5f00\u901a|date=2019-09-23}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-9-25}}\n|Bailin \u2014 Huangjinkou\n|9\n|16.288\n|-\n|Phase \u2162 of Line 8<ref name=Wuhan8-3>{{cite web|url=https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3LnB6Rl_lBp71IWU5fBITA|title=\u660e\u65e59\u70b9\uff0c\u6b66\u6c49\u8f68\u9053\u4ea4\u901a8\u53f7\u7ebf\u4e09\u671f\u5de5\u7a0b\u5f00\u901a\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|work=Wuhan Metro Operation|date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-11-6}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Military Athletes' Village\n|3\n|4.832\n|}\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==Lines==\n{{center|[[File:Wuhan Metro System Map.svg|750px]]}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;text-align:center\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"100\" style=\"width:450px; \"|Current system\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"text\"|Line Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\"|Termini\n!

It is usually homogeneous and highly porous and is traversed by vertical capillaries that permit the sediment to fracture and form vertical bluffs.\n\nThe word ''loess'', with connotations of origin by wind-deposited accumulation, came into English from [[German language|German]] ''L\u00f6ss'', which can be traced back to [[Alemannic German|Swiss German]] and is [[cognate]] with the English word ''loose'' and the German word ''los''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=loess|title=loess |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> It was first applied to Rhine River valley loess about 1821.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346022/loess |title=loess (sedimentary deposit) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwds.de/?qu=L%C3%B6ss&submit_button=Suche&view=1 |title=DWDS &#124; Suchergebnisse |publisher=Dwds.de |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n[[File:Loess landscape china.jpg|thumb|left|Loess near [[Hunyuan]], [[Datong]], [[Shanxi]] province, [[China]].]]\nLoess is [[wikt:homogeneous|homogeneous]], [[porous]], [[friable]], pale yellow or [[buff (color)|buff]], slightly [[wikt:coherent|coherent]], typically non-[[stratum|stratified]] and often [[calcareous]].  Loess grains are [[Rounding (sediment)|angular]] with little polishing or rounding and composed of crystals of [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[mica]] and other [[mineral]]s. Loess can be described as a rich, dust-like soil.<ref>Pearson Prentice Hall - World Studies - Europe and Russia</ref>\n\nLoess deposits may become very thick, more than a hundred meters in areas of China and tens of meters in parts of the Midwestern United States. It generally occurs as a blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick.\n\nLoess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.<ref>Neuendorf, K.E.K., J.P. Mehl Jr., and J.A. Jackson, 2005, ''Glossary of Geology.'' [[Springer-Verlag]], [[New York City]], 779 pp., {{ISBN|3-540-27951-2}}</ref> Because the grains are angular, loess will often stand in banks for many years without [[Slump (geology)|slump]]ing. This soil has a characteristic called vertical cleavage which makes it easily excavated to form cave dwellings, a popular method of making [[yaodong|human habitations]] in some parts of China. Loess will erode very readily.\n\nIn several areas of the world, loess [[ridge]]s have formed that are aligned with the [[prevailing wind]]s during the last [[glacial maximum]].  These are called \"[[paha (landform)|paha]] ridges\" in America and \"greda ridges\" in [[Europe]].  The form of these loess [[dune]]s has been explained by a combination of wind and [[tundra]] conditions.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Loess'' comes from the German ''L\u00f6ss'' or ''L\u00f6\u00df'', and ultimately from [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] ''l\u00f6sch'' meaning ''drop'' as named by [[peasants]] and [[masonry|mason]]s along the [[Rhine|Rhine Valley]].{{clarify|reason=does not agree with referenced material in lead|date=December 2018}}\n\n==History of research==\nThe term \"L\u00f6\u00df\" was first described in Central Europe by [[Karl C\u00e4sar von Leonhard]] (1823\u20131824)<ref>Leonhard K.

During the autumn and winter, when melting of the icesheets and icecaps ceased, the flow of meltwater down these rivers either ceased or was greatly reduced. As a consequence, large parts of the formerly submerged and unvegetated floodplains of these braided rivers dried out and were exposed to the wind. Because these floodplains consist of sediment containing a high content of glacially ground flour-like [[silt]] and [[clay]], they were highly susceptible to winnowing of their silts and [[clay]]s by the wind. Once entrained by the wind, particles were then deposited downwind. The loess deposits found along both sides of the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi River Alluvial Valley]] are a classic example of periglacial loess.<ref name=\"MuhsOthers2003a\">{{cite journal|last1=Bettis|first1=E.A.|last2=Muhs|first2=D.R.|last3=Roberts|first3=H.M.|last4=Wintle|first4=A.G.|title=Last Glacial loess in the conterminous USA|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|date=2003|volume=22|issue=18\u201319|pages=1907\u20131946|doi=10.1016/S0277-3791(03)00169-0|bibcode=2003QSRv...22.1907A}}</ref><ref name=\"esp.cr.usgs.gov\">{{cite journal|last1=Muhs|first1= D.R.|first2=E.A. |last2=Bettis, III|date=2003|url=http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/eolian/MuhsBettis2003GSAsp370.pdf |title=Quaternary loess-paleosol sequences as examples of climate-driven sedimentary extremes|journal=GSA Special Papers|volume=370|pages= 53\u201374|doi=10.1130/0-8137-2370-1.53|isbn= 9780813723709}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Quaternary]], loess and loess-like sediments were formed in periglacial environments on mid-continental [[Shield (geology)|shield]] areas in Europe and Siberia, on the margins of high mountain ranges like in [[Tajikistan]] and on semi-arid margins of some lowland deserts like in China.<ref name=\"Frechen 2011\"/>\n\nIn England, periglacial loess is also known as [[brickearth]].\n\n===Non-glacial===\nNon-glacial loess can originate from [[desert]]s, [[dune field]]s, [[playa lake]]s, and [[volcanic ash]].\n\nSome types of nonglacial loess are:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Iriondo | first1 = M.H. | last2 = Krohling | first2 = D.M. | year = 2007 | title = Non-classical types of loess | journal = [[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]] | volume = 202 | issue = 3| pages = 352\u2013368 | bibcode=2007SedG..202..352I | doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2007.03.012}}</ref>\n* [[Desert]] loess produced by aeolian attrition of quartz grains <ref>Whalley, W.B., Marshall, J.R., Smith, B.J. 1982, Origin of desert loess from some experimental observations, Nature, 300, 433-435.</ref> \n* [[Volcanic]] loess in Ecuador and Argentina;\n* [[Tropical]] loess in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay;\n* [[Gypsum]] loess in Spain;\n* [[Trade wind]] loess in Venezuela and Brazil;\n* [[Anticyclonic]] loess in Argentina.\n\nThe thick Chinese loess deposits are non-glacial loess having been blown in from deserts in northern China.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ding | first1 = Z. | last2 = Sun | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Changes in Sand Content of Loess Deposits along a North\u2013South Transect of the Chinese Loess Plateau and the Implications for Desert Variations. | url = | journal = [[Quaternary Research]] | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 56\u201362 | doi=10.1006/qres.1999.2045| bibcode = 1999QuRes..52...56D }}</ref> The loess covering the [[Great Plains]] of [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], and [[Colorado]] is considered to be non-glacial desert loess.<ref name=\"MuhsOthers2003a\"/> Non-glacial desert loess is also found in Australia<ref>{{cite journal|last=Haberlah|first=D|year=2007|title=A call for Australian loess|journal=Area |volume=39 |issue=2|pages= 224\u2013229|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4762.2007.00730.x}}</ref> and Africa.<ref name=\"esp.cr.usgs.gov\"/>\n\n==Fertility==\nLoess tends to develop into very rich soils.

The fine grains [[weathering|weather]] rapidly due to their large surface area, making soils derived from loess rich.  One theory states that the fertility of loess soils is due largely to [[cation exchange capacity]] (the ability of plants to absorb nutrients from the soil) and [[porosity]] (the air-filled space in the soil). The fertility of loess is not due to organic matter content, which tends to be rather low, unlike tropical soils which derive their fertility almost wholly from organic matter.\n\nEven well managed loess [[arable land|farmland]] can experience dramatic [[erosion]] of well over 2.5&nbsp;kg /m<sup>2</sup> per year. In China the [[Loess Plateau|loess deposits]] which give the [[Yellow River]] its color have been farmed and have produced phenomenal yields for over one thousand years. Winds pick up loess particles, contributing to the [[Asian Dust]] pollution problem. The largest deposit of loess in the United States, the [[Loess Hills]] along the border of [[Iowa]] and Nebraska, has survived intensive farming and [[Land degradation|poor farming practices]]. For almost 150 years, this loess deposit was farmed with [[mouldboard plough]]s and fall tilled, both intensely erosive. At times it suffered erosion rates of over 10 kilograms per square meter per year.

Loess grains are [[Rounding (sediment)|angular]] with little polishing or rounding and composed of crystals of [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[mica]] and other [[mineral]]s. Loess can be described as a rich, dust-like soil.<ref>Pearson Prentice Hall - World Studies - Europe and Russia</ref>\n\nLoess deposits may become very thick, more than a hundred meters in areas of China and tens of meters in parts of the Midwestern United States. It generally occurs as a blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick.\n\nLoess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.<ref>Neuendorf, K.E.K., J.P. Mehl Jr., and J.A. Jackson, 2005, ''Glossary of Geology.'' [[Springer-Verlag]], [[New York City]], 779 pp., {{ISBN|3-540-27951-2}}</ref> Because the grains are angular, loess will often stand in banks for many years without [[Slump (geology)|slump]]ing. This soil has a characteristic called vertical cleavage which makes it easily excavated to form cave dwellings, a popular method of making [[yaodong|human habitations]] in some parts of China. Loess will erode very readily.\n\nIn several areas of the world, loess [[ridge]]s have formed that are aligned with the [[prevailing wind]]s during the last [[glacial maximum]].  These are called \"[[paha (landform)|paha]] ridges\" in America and \"greda ridges\" in [[Europe]].  The form of these loess [[dune]]s has been explained by a combination of wind and [[tundra]] conditions.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Loess'' comes from the German ''L\u00f6ss'' or ''L\u00f6\u00df'', and ultimately from [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] ''l\u00f6sch'' meaning ''drop'' as named by [[peasants]] and [[masonry|mason]]s along the [[Rhine|Rhine Valley]].{{clarify|reason=does not agree with referenced material in lead|date=December 2018}}\n\n==History of research==\nThe term \"L\u00f6\u00df\" was first described in Central Europe by [[Karl C\u00e4sar von Leonhard]] (1823\u20131824)<ref>Leonhard K.

During the autumn and winter, when melting of the icesheets and icecaps ceased, the flow of meltwater down these rivers either ceased or was greatly reduced. As a consequence, large parts of the formerly submerged and unvegetated floodplains of these braided rivers dried out and were exposed to the wind. Because these floodplains consist of sediment containing a high content of glacially ground flour-like [[silt]] and [[clay]], they were highly susceptible to winnowing of their silts and [[clay]]s by the wind. Once entrained by the wind, particles were then deposited downwind.

The fine grains [[weathering|weather]] rapidly due to their large surface area, making soils derived from loess rich.  One theory states that the fertility of loess soils is due largely to [[cation exchange capacity]] (the ability of plants to absorb nutrients from the soil) and [[porosity]] (the air-filled space in the soil). The fertility of loess is not due to organic matter content, which tends to be rather low, unlike tropical soils which derive their fertility almost wholly from organic matter.\n\nEven well managed loess [[arable land|farmland]] can experience dramatic [[erosion]] of well over 2.5&nbsp;kg /m<sup>2</sup> per year. In China the [[Loess Plateau|loess deposits]] which give the [[Yellow River]] its color have been farmed and have produced phenomenal yields for over one thousand years. Winds pick up loess particles, contributing to the [[Asian Dust]] pollution problem. The largest deposit of loess in the United States, the [[Loess Hills]] along the border of [[Iowa]] and Nebraska, has survived intensive farming and [[Land degradation|poor farming practices]]. For almost 150 years, this loess deposit was farmed with [[mouldboard plough]]s and fall tilled, both intensely erosive. At times it suffered erosion rates of over 10 kilograms per square meter per year. Today this loess deposit is worked as low till or [[no till]] in all areas and is aggressively [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Large areas of loess deposits and soils==\n===Argentina===\n[[File:ArgentinaLoess.JPG|right|thumb|An [[outcrop]] of loess in [[Patagonia]]]]\nMuch of Argentina is covered by loess.

Kennedy|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|35th]] [[President of the United States]], and ended on November 22, 1963, upon his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]], a span of {{age in days|Jan 20, 1961|Nov 22, 1963}} days. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Massachusetts]], he took office following the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], in which he narrowly defeated [[Richard Nixon]], the then\u2013[[incumbent]] Vice President. He was succeeded by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].\n\nKennedy's time in office was marked by [[Cold War]] tensions with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. In Cuba, a failed attempt was made in April 1961 at the [[Bay of Pigs]] to overthrow the government of [[Fidel Castro]]. In October 1962, the Kennedy administration learned that Soviet [[ballistic missiles]] had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] nearly resulted in [[nuclear war]], but ended when the Soviets withdrew the missiles. To contain Communist expansion in Asia, Kennedy increased the number of American military advisers in [[South Vietnam]] by a factor of 18; a further escalation of the American role in the [[Vietnam War]] would take place after Kennedy's death. In [[Latin America]], Kennedy's [[Alliance for Progress]] aimed to promote human rights and foster economic development.\n\nIn domestic politics, Kennedy made bold proposals in his [[New Frontier]] agenda, but many of his initiatives were blocked by the [[conservative coalition]] of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats. The failed initiatives include federal aid education, medical care for the aged, and aid to economically depressed areas. Though initially reluctant to pursue civil rights legislation, in 1963 Kennedy proposed a major civil rights bill that ultimately became the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The economy experienced steady growth, low inflation and a drop in unemployment rates during Kennedy's tenure. Kennedy adopted [[Keynesian economics]] and proposed a tax cut bill that was passed into law as the [[Revenue Act of 1964]]. Kennedy also established the [[Peace Corps]] and promised to land an American on the moon, thereby intensifying the [[Space Race]] with the Soviet Union.\n\nKennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on November 22, 1963 while visiting [[Dallas]], Texas. The [[Warren Commission]] concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] acted alone in assassinating Kennedy, but the assassination gave rise to [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|a wide array of conspiracy theories]]. Kennedy was the first [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] elected president, as well as the youngest candidate ever to win a U.S. presidential election. Historians and political scientists tend to [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|rank]] Kennedy as an above-average president.\n\n==1960 election==\n{{main|1960 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1960.svg|thumb|upright=1.05|1960 electoral vote results]]\n\nKennedy, who represented [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States Senate]] from 1953 to 1960, had finished second on the vice presidential ballot of the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]]. After Republican President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] defeated [[Adlai Stevenson II]] in the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]], Kennedy began to prepare a bid for the presidency in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=12\u201313}} In January 1960, Kennedy formally announced his candidacy in that year's presidential election. Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] of Minnesota emerged as Kennedy's primary challenger in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1960|1960 Democratic primaries]],{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=16\u201317}} but Kennedy's victory in the heavily-[[Protestant]] state of West Virginia prompted Humphrey's withdrawal from the race.<ref name=JFK-CE/> At the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], Kennedy fended off challenges from Stevenson and Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of Texas to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot of the convention.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=16\u201317}} Kennedy chose Johnson to be his vice-presidential running mate, despite opposition from many liberal delegates and Kennedy's own staff, including his brother [[Robert F.

Kennedy administration}}\n\n===The Cold War and flexible response===\n{{main|Flexible response}}\n\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the [[Soviet Union]], manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the [[Cold War]]. Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of [[containment]], which sought to stop the spread of Communism.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=704\u2013705}} President Eisenhower's [[New Look (policy)|New Look]] policy had emphasized the use of nuclear weapons to [[Deterrence theory|deter]] the threat of Soviet aggression. Fearful of the possibility of a global nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as [[flexible response]]. This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals. As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the [[United States special operations forces]], elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts. Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the U.S. to counter Soviet influence without resorting to war.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=76\u201377}} At the same time, he ordered a massive build-up of the nuclear arsenal to establish superiority over the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=704\u2013705}} \n\nIn pursuing this military build-up, Kennedy shifted away from Eisenhower's deep concern for budget deficits caused by military spending.{{sfn|Patterson|1996|pp=489\u2013490}} In contrast to Eisenhower\u2019s warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them. The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424. He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles. Meanwhile, he called on cities to prepare fallout shelters for nuclear war.<ref> Stephen G Rabe, \u201cJohn F.

The summit would cover several topics, but both leaders knew that the most contentious issue would be that of [[Berlin]], which had been divided into two cities with the start of the Cold War. The enclave of [[West Berlin]] lay within Soviet-allied [[East Germany]], but was supported by the U.S. and other Western powers. The Soviets wanted to reunify Berlin under the control of East Germany, partly due to the large number of East Germans who had fled to West Berlin.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=74, 77\u201378}} Khrushchev had clashed with Eisenhower over the issue but had tabled it after the [[1960 U-2 incident]]; with the inauguration of a new U.S. president, Khrushchev was once again determined to bring the status of West Berlin to the fore. Kennedy's handling of the Bay of Pigs crisis convinced him that Kennedy would wither under pressure. Kennedy, meanwhile, wanted to meet with Khrushchev as soon as possible in order to reduce tensions and minimize the risk of nuclear war. Prior to summit, Harriman advised Kennedy, \"[Khrushchev's] style will be to attack you and see if he can get away with it. Laugh about it, don't get into a fight. Rise above it. Have some fun.\"{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=72\u201373, 76}}\n\nOn June 4, 1961, the president [[Vienna summit|met with Khrushchev in Vienna]], where he made it clear that any treaty between [[East Berlin]] and the Soviet Union that interfered with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=161\u2013175}} The two leaders also discussed the situation in Laos, the [[Congo Crisis]], China's [[China and weapons of mass destruction|fledgling nuclear program]], a potential nuclear test ban treaty, and other issues.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=78\u201379}} Shortly after Kennedy returned home, the Soviet Union announced its intention to sign a treaty with East Berlin that would threaten Western access to West Berlin. Kennedy, depressed and angry, assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=161\u2013175}}\n\nIn the weeks immediately after the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the USSR. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where Dean Acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=185}} In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25&nbsp;billion to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=201}} Meanwhile, the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking further passage of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to the [[Berlin Wall]].{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=213}} Kennedy acquiesced to the wall, though he sent Vice President Johnson to West Berlin to reaffirm U.S. commitment to the enclave's defense. In the following months, in a sign of rising Cold War tensions, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union ended a moratorium on nuclear weapon testing.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\n{{main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs and invasion Cuban and Soviet leaders feared that the United States was planning another invasion of Cuba, and Khrushchev increased economic and military assistance to the island.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=203\u2013205}} The Kennedy administration viewed the growing [[Cuba\u2013Soviet Union relations|Cuba-Soviet alliance]] with alarm, fearing that it could eventually pose a threat to the United States.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=113\u2013114}} Kennedy did not believe that the Soviet Union would risk placing nuclear weapons in Cuba, but he dispatched CIA [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy planes to determine the extent of the Soviet military build-up.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=113\u2013114}} On October 14, 1962, the spy planes took photographs of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites being built in Cuba by the Soviets. The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16, and a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=345}}\n\nFollowing the Vienna Summit, Khrushchev came to believe that Kennedy would not respond effectively to provocations. He saw the deployment of the missiles in Cuba as a way to close the \"[[missile gap]]\" and provide for the defense of Cuba. By late 1962, both the United States and the Soviet Union possessed [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) capable of delivering nuclear payloads, but the U.S. maintained well over 100 ICBMs, as well as over 100 [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBMs). By contrast, the Soviet Union did not possess SLBMs, and had less than 25 ICBMs. The placement of missiles in Cuba thus threatened to significantly enhance the Soviet Union's [[first strike capability]] and even the nuclear imbalance.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=205\u2013208}} Kennedy himself did not believe that the deployment of missiles to Cuba fundamentally altered the strategic balance of the nuclear forces; more significant for him was the political and psychological implications of allowing the Soviet Union to maintain nuclear weapons in Cuba.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=211}}\n\n{{listen | filename = John F Kennedy Address on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba.ogg | title = Address on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba | description = Kennedy addressing the nation on October 22, 1962, about the buildup of arms on Cuba}}\n\nKennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the U.S.S.R., but if the U.S. did nothing, it would appear weak. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=245}} To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad hoc body of key advisers, later known as [[EXCOMM]], that met secretly between October 16 and October 28.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=207\u2013208}} The members of EXCOMM agreed that the missiles must be removed from Cuba, but differed as to the best method. Some favored an airstrike, possibly followed by an invasion of Cuba, but Robert Kennedy and others argued that a surprise airstrike would be immoral and would invite Soviet reprisals.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=211\u2013212}} The other major option that emerged was a naval blockade, designed to prevent further arms shipments to Cuba. Though he had initially favored an immediate air strike, the president quickly came to favor the naval blockade the first method of response, while retaining the option of an airstrike at a later date.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=210, 212\u2013213}} EXCOMM voted 11-to-6 in favor of the naval blockade, which was also supported by British ambassador [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|David Ormsby-Gore]] and Eisenhower, both of whom were consulted privately.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=215\u2013217}} On October 22, after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of Congress about the situation, Kennedy announced on national television that the U.S. had discovered evidence of the Soviet deployment of missiles to Cuba. He called for the immediate withdrawal of the missiles, as well as the convening of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the Organization of American States (OAS). Finally, he announced that the U.S. would begin a naval blockade of Cuba in order to intercept arms shipments.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=217\u2013218}}\n\nOn October 23, in a unanimous vote, the OAS approved a resolution that endorsed the blockade and called for the removal of the Soviet nuclear weapons from Cuba. That same day, Stevenson presented the U.S. case to the UN Security Council, though the Soviet Union's [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]] precluded the possibility of passing a Security Council resolution.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=219}} On the morning of October 24, over 150 U.S. ships were deployed to enforce the blockade against Cuba. Several Soviet ships approached the blockade line, but they stopped or reverse course to avoid the blockade.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=220}} On October 25, Khrushchev offered to remove the missiles if the U.S. promised not to invade Cuba. The next day, he sent a second message in which he also demanded the removal of [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] from [[Turkey]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=721\u2013722}} EXCOMM settled on what has been termed the \"[[Trollope ploy]];\" the U.S. would respond to the Khrushchev's first message and ignore the second. On October 27, Kennedy sent a letter to Khrushchev calling for the removal of the Cuban missiles in return for an end to the blockade and an American promise to refrain from invading Cuba. At the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed the Soviet ambassador that the U.S. would remove the missiles from Turkey after the end of the crisis.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=225\u2013226}} Few members of EXCOMM expected Khrushchev to agree to the offer, but on October 28 Khrushchev publicly announced that he would withdraw the missiles from Cuba.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=225\u2013226}} Negotiations over the details of the withdrawal continued, but the U.S. ended the naval blockade on November 20, and most Soviet soldiers left Cuba by early 1963.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=228}}\n\nThe U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its missiles in Italy and Turkey; the missiles were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missiles.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|pp=184\u2013186}} In the aftermath of the crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union established a [[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|hotline]] to ensure clear communications between the leaders of the two countries.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=723}} The Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since. In the end, \"the humanity\" of the two men prevailed.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=189}} The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=425}} Kennedy's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis has received wide praise from many scholars, although some critics fault the Kennedy administration for precipitating the crisis with its efforts to remove Castro.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=124\u2013126}}{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=722\u2013723}} Khrushchev, meanwhile, was widely mocked for his performance, and was removed from power in October 1964.{{sfn|Patterson|1996|p=506}}\n\n====Nuclear Test Ban Treaty====\n{{main|Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty}}\n{{further|American University speech}}\n[[File:President Kennedy American University Commencement Address June 10, 1963.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.95|Kennedy delivers the [[commencement speech]] at [[American University]], June 10, 1963.]]\n\nTroubled by the long-term dangers of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]], Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=552}} In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy had reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but further negotiations were derailed by the resumption of nuclear testing.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=227}} Soviet-American relations improved after the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the powers resumed negotiations over a test ban treaty.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=230\u2013231}}\n\n{{Listen\n| filename = Jfk American University 4654 06-10-63.ogg\n| title = ''World Peace'' Speech\n| description = Speech from [[American University]] by John F.

Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a test-ban treaty with the Soviets.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=542}} Each party sought a comprehensive test ban treaty, but a dispute over the number of on-site inspections allowed in each year prevented a total ban on testing.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=230\u2013231}} Ultimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union agreed to a limited treaty that prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=550}} The treaty represented an important deescalation of Cold War tensions, but both countries continued to build their respective nuclear stockpiles.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=232\u2013234}} The U.S. and the Soviet Union also reached an agreement whereby the U.S. sold millions of bushels of wheat to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=230}}\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:John F.

Eisenhower considered [[Laos]] to be \"the cork in the bottle;\" if it fell to Communism, Eisenhower believed other Southeast Asian would, as well.{{sfn|Parmet|1983|pp=133-37}} The Joint Chiefs proposed sending 60,000 American  soldiers to uphold the friendly government, but Kennedy rejected this strategy in the aftermath of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. He instead sought a negotiated solution between the government and the left-wing insurgents, who were backed by [[North Vietnam]] and the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=708}} Kennedy was unwilling to send more than a token force to neighboring [[Thailand]], a key American ally. By the end of the year, Harriman had helped arrange the [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos]], which temporarily brought an end to the crisis, but the [[Laotian Civil War]] continued.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=96\u201398}} Though he was unwilling to commit U.S. forces to a major military intervention in Laos, Kennedy did approve [[CIA activities in Laos]] designed to defeat Communist insurgents through bombing raids and the recruitment of the [[Hmong people]].{{sfn|Patterson|1996|p=498}}\n\n====Vietnam====\n{{see also|Role of the United States in the Vietnam War}}\n\nDuring his presidency, Kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the [[South Vietnam]]ese government.{{sfn|Dunnigan|Nofi|1999|p=257}} Vietnam had been divided into a communist North Vietnam and a non-Communist South Vietnam after the [[1954 Geneva Conference]], but North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] established the [[Viet Cong]] in 1960 to foment support for unification in South Vietnam. The president of South Vietnam, [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], had alienated many of his constituents by avoiding land reforms, refusing to hold free elections, and staging an anti-Communist purge. Kennedy escalated American involvement in Vietnam in 1961 by financing the South Vietnam army, increasing the number of U.S. military advisers above the levels of the Eisenhower administration, and authorizing U.S. helicopter units to provide support to South Vietnamese forces.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=256\u2013261}}\n\nThough Kennedy provided support for South Vietnam throughout his tenure, Vietnam remained a secondary issue for the Kennedy administration until 1963.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=256\u2013257}} Kennedy increasingly soured on Diem, whose violent [[Buddhist crisis|crackdown on Buddhist practices]] further galvanized opposition to his leadership. In August 1963, [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] replaced [[Frederick Nolting]] as the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam. Days after his arrival in South Vietnam, Lodge reported that several South Vietnamese generals sought the assent of the U.S. government to their plan of removing Diem from power. The Kennedy administration was split regarding not just the removal of Diem, but also their assessment of the military situation in South Vietnam and the proper U.S. role in the country. Without the full support of the U.S., General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] (known as \"Big Minh\") called off the potential coup in South Vietnam. Big Minh again approached the U.S. about a coup, and administration official informed him that the U.S. would neither support or oppose the toppling of Diem. In November 1963, a junta of senior military officers [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|executed Diem]] and his influential brother, [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=262\u2013268}}\n\nBy November 1963, there were 16,000 American military personnel in South Vietnam, up from Eisenhower's 900 advisors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm |title=Vietnam War |publisher=Swarthmore College Peace Collection |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803124531/http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm |archivedate=3 August 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the aftermath of the aborted coup in September 1963, the Kennedy administration reevaluated its policies in South Vietnam.

The United Kingdom\u2014which had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19, and whose economy was heavily dependent on Kuwaiti oil\u2014responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Kennedy dispatched a U.S. Navy task force to [[Bahrain]], and the U.K. (at the urging of the Kennedy administration) brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The situation was resolved in October, when the British troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong [[Arab League]] force.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=36}}\n\nIn December 1961, Qasim's government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the British- and American-owned [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC)'s [[Concession (contract)|concessionary holding]] to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession. U.S. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as UN member state, which they believed to be connected. Senior National Security Council adviser [[Robert Komer]] worried that if the IPC ceased production in response, Qasim might \"grab Kuwait\" (thus achieving a \"stranglehold\" on Middle Eastern oil production), or \"throw himself into Russian arms.\" Komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against Qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to \"get Iraq back on [a] more neutral keel.\"{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=37, 40-42}}\n\nThe anti-imperialist and anti-communist [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Iraqi Ba'ath Party]] [[Ramadan Revolution|overthrew and executed Qasim in a violent coup]] on February 8, 1963.

Kennedy shaking hands in Miami, Florida (10998767613).jpg|thumb|upright=.95|Kennedy in [[Miami]], Florida, November 18, 1963]]\n\nKennedy called his domestic program the \"[[New Frontier]]\"; it included initiatives such as medical care for the elderly, federal aid to education, and the creation of a department of housing and urban development.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=63\u201365}} His New Frontier program was strongly influenced by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1944 \"[[Second Bill of Rights]]\" address, as well as Harry Truman's [[Fair Deal]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=99}} Kennedy also called for a large tax cut as an economic stimulus measure. However, many of his programs were blocked by the [[conservative coalition]] of Republicans and southern Democrats.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=63\u201365}} The conservative coalition, which controlled key [[United States congressional committee|congressional committees]] and made up a majority of both houses of Congress during Kennedy's presidency, had prevented the implementation of progressive reforms since the late 1930s.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=39}} Kennedy's small margin of victory in the 1960 election, his lack of deep connections to influential members of Congress, and his administration's focus on foreign policy also hindered the passage of New Frontier policies.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=40\u201341, 100}} Passage of the New Frontier was made even more difficult after the death of Speaker of the House [[Sam Rayburn]]; new Speaker [[John William McCormack]] and Senate Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] both lacked the influence of their predecessors and struggled to exercise effective leadership over committee chairs.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nIn 1961, Kennedy prioritized passing five bills: federal assistance for education, medical insurance for the elderly, housing legislation, federal aid to struggling areas, and an increase in the [[minimum wage in the United States|federal minimum wage]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=99}} Kennedy's bill to increase the [[minimum wage in the United States|federal minimum wage]] to $1.25 an hour passed in early 1961, but an amendment inserted by the staunch segregationist Congressman from Georgia, [[Carl Vinson]], exempted hundreds of thousands of laundry workers (a job reserved for African-American women at the time) from the law.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=102\u2013103}} Kennedy also won passage of the Area Redevelopment Act and the Housing Act of 1961. The Area Redevelopment Act provided federal funding to economically struggling regions of the country, while the Housing Act of 1961 provided funds for urban renewal and public housing and authorized federal [[mortgage loans]] to those who did not qualify for public housing.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=105\u2013106}} Kennedy proposed a bill providing for $2.3 billion in federal educational aid to the states, with more money going to states with lower per-capita income. Though the Senate passed the education bill, it was defeated in the House by a coalition of Republicans, Southern Democrats, and Catholics.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=103\u2013104}} Kennedy's health insurance bill, which would have paid for hospitalization and nursing costs for the elderly, failed to pass either house of Congress due to the opposition of Republicans, Southern Democrats, and the [[American Medical Association]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=104\u2013105}} A bill that would have established the Department of Urban Affairs and Housing was also defeated.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\nIn 1962 and 1963, Kennedy won approval of the Manpower Development and Training Act, designed to provide job retraining, as well as bills that increased the regulation of drug manufacturers and authorized grants and loans for the construction of higher education facilities. Another Kennedy policy, the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, gave the president the power to cut [[tariffs in United States history|tariffs]] and to take action against countries employing discriminatory tariffs.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=107\u2013109}} Following the passage of that act, the U.S. and other countries agreed to major cuts in tariffs in the [[Kennedy Round]].{{Sfn|Johnson|2018|pp=460\u2013461}} Congress also passed the [[Community Mental Health Act]], providing funding to local mental health community centers. These centers provided out-patient services such as marriage counseling and aid to those suffering from [[alcoholism]].{{sfn|Patterson|1996|p=463}} In 1963, Kennedy began to focus more on the issue of poverty, and some of the ideas developed during his presidency would later influence President Johnson's [[War on Poverty]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=119\u2013122}}\n\n====Peace Corps====\n{{listen\n| title = Establishment of the Peace Corps\n| filename = JFK Establishment of the Peace Corps edit.ogg\n| description = John F.

Due in large part to Shriver's effective lobbying efforts, Congress approved the permanent establishment of the Peace Corps programs. Kennedy took great pride in the Peace Corps, and he ensured that it remained free of CIA influence, but he largely left its administration to Shriver. In the ensuing twenty-five years, more than 100,000 Americans served in 44 countries as part of the program. Most Peace Corps volunteers taught English in schools, but many became involved in activities like construction and food delivery.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=155\u2013159}}\n\n===Economy===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:1em; text-align:center\"\n|+ Federal finances and GDP during Kennedy's presidency<ref>All figures, except for debt percentage, are presented in billions of dollars.

Kennedy was proud that his Labor Department help keep wages steady in the steel industry, but was outraged in April 1962, [[Roger Blough]], the president of [[U.S. Steel]], quietly informed Kennedy that his company would raise prices.{{sfn|Parmet|1983|p=238}} In response, Attorney General Robert Kennedy began a price-fixing investigation against U.S. Steel, and President Kennedy convinced other steel companies to rescind their price increases until finally even U.S. Steel, isolated and in danger of being undersold, agreed to rescind its own price increase.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=130\u2013134}}<ref>Denise M.

The predictions according to the Keynesian model indicated the cuts would decrease income taxes by about $10 billion and corporate taxes by about $3.5 billion. The plan also included reforms designed to reduce the impact of [[itemized deduction]]s, as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped. Republicans and many Southern Democrats opposed the bill, calling for simultaneous reductions in expenditures, but debate continued throughout 1963.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=139\u2013141}} In February 1964, three months Into Johnson's administration, Congress approved the [[Revenue Act of 1964]], which lowered the top individual rate to 70 percent, and the top corporate rate to 48 percent.<ref>{{cite book |title=Why Budgets Matter: Budget Policy and American Politics |last=Ippolito |first=Dennis |year=2004 |publisher=Penn State Press |pages=173\u2013175|isbn=0-271-02260-4}}</ref>\n\n===Civil rights===\n====Early presidency====\n[[File:Thurgood Marshall 1957-09-17.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|In May 1961 Kennedy appointed [[Thurgood Marshall]] to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals]].]]\n\nThe turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s. [[Jim Crow]] [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] had been established law in the [[Deep South]] for much of the 20th century,<ref name=Grantham_p156>Grantham (1988), ''The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History'', p. 156</ref> but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] had ruled in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that [[racial segregation]] in public schools was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially in southern states, did not obey the Supreme Court's decision. Kennedy favored desegregation and other civil rights causes, but he generally did not place a high priority on civil rights, especially before 1963.{{sfn|Patterson|1996|pp=473\u2013475}} Recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats could block legislation, Kennedy did not introduce civil rights legislation upon taking office.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=487}} Kennedy did appoint many blacks to office, including civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Kennedy also established the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission#Background|President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity]] to investigate employment discrimination and expanded the Justice Department's involvement in voting rights cases.{{sfn|Patterson|1996|pp=473\u2013475}}\n\nKennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress, and he distanced himself from it.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|pp=60, 66}} As articulated by brother Robert, the administration's early priority was to \"keep the president out of this civil rights mess.\"{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the South, viewed Kennedy as lukewarm,{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} especially concerning the [[Freedom Riders]]. The Freedom Riders organized an integrated public transportation effort in the South and were repeatedly met with white mob violence.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Robert Kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the Freedom Riders to \"get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts.\"{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=123\u2013126}} Kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up \"hated memories of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]\" among conservative Southern whites.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Displeased with Kennedy's pace addressing the issue of segregation, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and use an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of \"[[Second Emancipation Proclamation]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/emancipation-proclamation|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle|publisher=Stanford University}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1962, [[James Meredith]] enrolled at the [[University of Mississippi]] but was prevented from entering.

Rather than proposing comprehensive legislation, President Kennedy put his support behind a proposed constitutional amendment that would prohibit states from conditioning the right to vote in [[US federal election|federal elections]] on payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other types of tax. He considered the constitutional amendment the best way to avoid a filibuster, as the claim that federal abolition of the poll tax was unconstitutional would be moot.

Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a \"triumph of managed protest\", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580\u2013584}}\n\nNotwithstanding the success of the March, the larger struggle was far from over. Three weeks later, [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|a bomb exploded]] on Sunday, September 15 at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion, and two other children shot to death in the aftermath.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=599\u2013600}} Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for its passage.

He asked Johnson to explore the feasibility of beating the Soviets to the Moon. Though he was concerned about the program's costs, Kennedy agreed to Johnson's recommendation that the U.S. commit to a manned lunar landing as the major objective of the U.S. space program.

In 1962, [[John Glenn]] became the first American to orbit the Earth, and the following year [[Mariner program]] sent an unmanned flight past [[Venus]]. Though some members of Congress came to favor shifting NASA's budget to other programs, Kennedy and Johnson remained committed to the lunar landing.

Both Robert Kennedy and John F. Kennedy had played a role on that committee, and in 1960 Robert Kennedy published the book ''[[The Enemy Within (Kennedy book)|The Enemy Within]]'', which focused on the influence of organized crime within businesses and organized labor.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=145\u2013146}} Under the leadership of the attorney general, the Kennedy administration shifted the focus of the Justice Department, the FBI, and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to organized crime. Kennedy also won congressional approval for five bills designed to crack down on interstate [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], gambling, and the transportation of firearms. The federal government targeted prominent [[American Mafia|Mafia]] leaders like [[Carlos Marcello]] and [[Joey Aiuppa]]; Marcello was deported to [[Guatemala]], while Aiuppa was convicted of violating of the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=146\u2013148}} The attorney general's top target was perhaps [[Jimmy Hoffa]], the head of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters Union]].

Kennedy''' began at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] on January 20, 1961, when [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] was [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|35th]] [[President of the United States]], and ended on November 22, 1963, upon his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]], a span of {{age in days|Jan 20, 1961|Nov 22, 1963}} days. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Massachusetts]], he took office following the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], in which he narrowly defeated [[Richard Nixon]], the then\u2013[[incumbent]] Vice President. He was succeeded by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].\n\nKennedy's time in office was marked by [[Cold War]] tensions with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. In Cuba, a failed attempt was made in April 1961 at the [[Bay of Pigs]] to overthrow the government of [[Fidel Castro]]. In October 1962, the Kennedy administration learned that Soviet [[ballistic missiles]] had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] nearly resulted in [[nuclear war]], but ended when the Soviets withdrew the missiles. To contain Communist expansion in Asia, Kennedy increased the number of American military advisers in [[South Vietnam]] by a factor of 18; a further escalation of the American role in the [[Vietnam War]] would take place after Kennedy's death. In [[Latin America]], Kennedy's [[Alliance for Progress]] aimed to promote human rights and foster economic development.\n\nIn domestic politics, Kennedy made bold proposals in his [[New Frontier]] agenda, but many of his initiatives were blocked by the [[conservative coalition]] of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats. The failed initiatives include federal aid education, medical care for the aged, and aid to economically depressed areas. Though initially reluctant to pursue civil rights legislation, in 1963 Kennedy proposed a major civil rights bill that ultimately became the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The economy experienced steady growth, low inflation and a drop in unemployment rates during Kennedy's tenure. Kennedy adopted [[Keynesian economics]] and proposed a tax cut bill that was passed into law as the [[Revenue Act of 1964]]. Kennedy also established the [[Peace Corps]] and promised to land an American on the moon, thereby intensifying the [[Space Race]] with the Soviet Union.\n\nKennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on November 22, 1963 while visiting [[Dallas]], Texas. The [[Warren Commission]] concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] acted alone in assassinating Kennedy, but the assassination gave rise to [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|a wide array of conspiracy theories]]. Kennedy was the first [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] elected president, as well as the youngest candidate ever to win a U.S. presidential election. Historians and political scientists tend to [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|rank]] Kennedy as an above-average president.\n\n==1960 election==\n{{main|1960 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1960.svg|thumb|upright=1.05|1960 electoral vote results]]\n\nKennedy, who represented [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States Senate]] from 1953 to 1960, had finished second on the vice presidential ballot of the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]]. After Republican President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] defeated [[Adlai Stevenson II]] in the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]], Kennedy began to prepare a bid for the presidency in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=12\u201313}} In January 1960, Kennedy formally announced his candidacy in that year's presidential election.

He easily won the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1960|party's primaries]] and received the nearly-unanimous backing of the delegates at the [[1960 Republican National Convention]].

Kennedy administration}}\n\n===The Cold War and flexible response===\n{{main|Flexible response}}\n\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the [[Soviet Union]], manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the [[Cold War]]. Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of [[containment]], which sought to stop the spread of Communism.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=704\u2013705}} President Eisenhower's [[New Look (policy)|New Look]] policy had emphasized the use of nuclear weapons to [[Deterrence theory|deter]] the threat of Soviet aggression. Fearful of the possibility of a global nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as [[flexible response]]. This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals. As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the [[United States special operations forces]], elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts. Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the U.S. to counter Soviet influence without resorting to war.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=76\u201377}} At the same time, he ordered a massive build-up of the nuclear arsenal to establish superiority over the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=704\u2013705}} \n\nIn pursuing this military build-up, Kennedy shifted away from Eisenhower's deep concern for budget deficits caused by military spending.{{sfn|Patterson|1996|pp=489\u2013490}} In contrast to Eisenhower\u2019s warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them. The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424. He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles. Meanwhile, he called on cities to prepare fallout shelters for nuclear war.<ref> Stephen G Rabe, \u201cJohn F.

The summit would cover several topics, but both leaders knew that the most contentious issue would be that of [[Berlin]], which had been divided into two cities with the start of the Cold War. The enclave of [[West Berlin]] lay within Soviet-allied [[East Germany]], but was supported by the U.S. and other Western powers. The Soviets wanted to reunify Berlin under the control of East Germany, partly due to the large number of East Germans who had fled to West Berlin.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=74, 77\u201378}} Khrushchev had clashed with Eisenhower over the issue but had tabled it after the [[1960 U-2 incident]]; with the inauguration of a new U.S. president, Khrushchev was once again determined to bring the status of West Berlin to the fore. Kennedy's handling of the Bay of Pigs crisis convinced him that Kennedy would wither under pressure. Kennedy, meanwhile, wanted to meet with Khrushchev as soon as possible in order to reduce tensions and minimize the risk of nuclear war. Prior to summit, Harriman advised Kennedy, \"[Khrushchev's] style will be to attack you and see if he can get away with it. Laugh about it, don't get into a fight. Rise above it. Have some fun.\"{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=72\u201373, 76}}\n\nOn June 4, 1961, the president [[Vienna summit|met with Khrushchev in Vienna]], where he made it clear that any treaty between [[East Berlin]] and the Soviet Union that interfered with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=161\u2013175}} The two leaders also discussed the situation in Laos, the [[Congo Crisis]], China's [[China and weapons of mass destruction|fledgling nuclear program]], a potential nuclear test ban treaty, and other issues.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=78\u201379}} Shortly after Kennedy returned home, the Soviet Union announced its intention to sign a treaty with East Berlin that would threaten Western access to West Berlin. Kennedy, depressed and angry, assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=161\u2013175}}\n\nIn the weeks immediately after the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the USSR. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where Dean Acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=185}} In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25&nbsp;billion to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=201}} Meanwhile, the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking further passage of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to the [[Berlin Wall]].{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=213}} Kennedy acquiesced to the wall, though he sent Vice President Johnson to West Berlin to reaffirm U.S. commitment to the enclave's defense. In the following months, in a sign of rising Cold War tensions, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union ended a moratorium on nuclear weapon testing.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\n{{main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs and invasion Cuban and Soviet leaders feared that the United States was planning another invasion of Cuba, and Khrushchev increased economic and military assistance to the island.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=203\u2013205}} The Kennedy administration viewed the growing [[Cuba\u2013Soviet Union relations|Cuba-Soviet alliance]] with alarm, fearing that it could eventually pose a threat to the United States.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=113\u2013114}} Kennedy did not believe that the Soviet Union would risk placing nuclear weapons in Cuba, but he dispatched CIA [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy planes to determine the extent of the Soviet military build-up.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=113\u2013114}} On October 14, 1962, the spy planes took photographs of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites being built in Cuba by the Soviets. The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16, and a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=345}}\n\nFollowing the Vienna Summit, Khrushchev came to believe that Kennedy would not respond effectively to provocations. He saw the deployment of the missiles in Cuba as a way to close the \"[[missile gap]]\" and provide for the defense of Cuba. By late 1962, both the United States and the Soviet Union possessed [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) capable of delivering nuclear payloads, but the U.S. maintained well over 100 ICBMs, as well as over 100 [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBMs). By contrast, the Soviet Union did not possess SLBMs, and had less than 25 ICBMs. The placement of missiles in Cuba thus threatened to significantly enhance the Soviet Union's [[first strike capability]] and even the nuclear imbalance.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=205\u2013208}} Kennedy himself did not believe that the deployment of missiles to Cuba fundamentally altered the strategic balance of the nuclear forces; more significant for him was the political and psychological implications of allowing the Soviet Union to maintain nuclear weapons in Cuba.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=211}}\n\n{{listen | filename = John F Kennedy Address on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba.ogg | title = Address on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba | description = Kennedy addressing the nation on October 22, 1962, about the buildup of arms on Cuba}}\n\nKennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the U.S.S.R., but if the U.S. did nothing, it would appear weak. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=245}} To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad hoc body of key advisers, later known as [[EXCOMM]], that met secretly between October 16 and October 28.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=207\u2013208}} The members of EXCOMM agreed that the missiles must be removed from Cuba, but differed as to the best method. Some favored an airstrike, possibly followed by an invasion of Cuba, but Robert Kennedy and others argued that a surprise airstrike would be immoral and would invite Soviet reprisals.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=211\u2013212}} The other major option that emerged was a naval blockade, designed to prevent further arms shipments to Cuba. Though he had initially favored an immediate air strike, the president quickly came to favor the naval blockade the first method of response, while retaining the option of an airstrike at a later date.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=210, 212\u2013213}} EXCOMM voted 11-to-6 in favor of the naval blockade, which was also supported by British ambassador [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|David Ormsby-Gore]] and Eisenhower, both of whom were consulted privately.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=215\u2013217}} On October 22, after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of Congress about the situation, Kennedy announced on national television that the U.S. had discovered evidence of the Soviet deployment of missiles to Cuba. He called for the immediate withdrawal of the missiles, as well as the convening of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the Organization of American States (OAS). Finally, he announced that the U.S. would begin a naval blockade of Cuba in order to intercept arms shipments.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=217\u2013218}}\n\nOn October 23, in a unanimous vote, the OAS approved a resolution that endorsed the blockade and called for the removal of the Soviet nuclear weapons from Cuba. That same day, Stevenson presented the U.S. case to the UN Security Council, though the Soviet Union's [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]] precluded the possibility of passing a Security Council resolution.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=219}} On the morning of October 24, over 150 U.S. ships were deployed to enforce the blockade against Cuba. Several Soviet ships approached the blockade line, but they stopped or reverse course to avoid the blockade.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=220}} On October 25, Khrushchev offered to remove the missiles if the U.S. promised not to invade Cuba. The next day, he sent a second message in which he also demanded the removal of [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] from [[Turkey]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=721\u2013722}} EXCOMM settled on what has been termed the \"[[Trollope ploy]];\" the U.S. would respond to the Khrushchev's first message and ignore the second. On October 27, Kennedy sent a letter to Khrushchev calling for the removal of the Cuban missiles in return for an end to the blockade and an American promise to refrain from invading Cuba. At the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed the Soviet ambassador that the U.S. would remove the missiles from Turkey after the end of the crisis.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=225\u2013226}} Few members of EXCOMM expected Khrushchev to agree to the offer, but on October 28 Khrushchev publicly announced that he would withdraw the missiles from Cuba.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=225\u2013226}} Negotiations over the details of the withdrawal continued, but the U.S. ended the naval blockade on November 20, and most Soviet soldiers left Cuba by early 1963.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=228}}\n\nThe U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its missiles in Italy and Turkey; the missiles were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missiles.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|pp=184\u2013186}} In the aftermath of the crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union established a [[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|hotline]] to ensure clear communications between the leaders of the two countries.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=723}} The Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since. In the end, \"the humanity\" of the two men prevailed.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=189}} The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=425}} Kennedy's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis has received wide praise from many scholars, although some critics fault the Kennedy administration for precipitating the crisis with its efforts to remove Castro.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=124\u2013126}}{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=722\u2013723}} Khrushchev, meanwhile, was widely mocked for his performance, and was removed from power in October 1964.{{sfn|Patterson|1996|p=506}}\n\n====Nuclear Test Ban Treaty====\n{{main|Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty}}\n{{further|American University speech}}\n[[File:President Kennedy American University Commencement Address June 10, 1963.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.95|Kennedy delivers the [[commencement speech]] at [[American University]], June 10, 1963.]]\n\nTroubled by the long-term dangers of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]], Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=552}} In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy had reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but further negotiations were derailed by the resumption of nuclear testing.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=227}} Soviet-American relations improved after the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the powers resumed negotiations over a test ban treaty.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=230\u2013231}}\n\n{{Listen\n| filename = Jfk American University 4654 06-10-63.ogg\n| title = ''World Peace'' Speech\n| description = Speech from [[American University]] by John F.

Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a test-ban treaty with the Soviets.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=542}} Each party sought a comprehensive test ban treaty, but a dispute over the number of on-site inspections allowed in each year prevented a total ban on testing.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=230\u2013231}} Ultimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union agreed to a limited treaty that prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=550}} The treaty represented an important deescalation of Cold War tensions, but both countries continued to build their respective nuclear stockpiles.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=232\u2013234}} The U.S. and the Soviet Union also reached an agreement whereby the U.S. sold millions of bushels of wheat to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=230}}\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n[[File:John F.

Eisenhower considered [[Laos]] to be \"the cork in the bottle;\" if it fell to Communism, Eisenhower believed other Southeast Asian would, as well.{{sfn|Parmet|1983|pp=133-37}} The Joint Chiefs proposed sending 60,000 American  soldiers to uphold the friendly government, but Kennedy rejected this strategy in the aftermath of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. He instead sought a negotiated solution between the government and the left-wing insurgents, who were backed by [[North Vietnam]] and the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=708}} Kennedy was unwilling to send more than a token force to neighboring [[Thailand]], a key American ally. By the end of the year, Harriman had helped arrange the [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos]], which temporarily brought an end to the crisis, but the [[Laotian Civil War]] continued.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=96\u201398}} Though he was unwilling to commit U.S. forces to a major military intervention in Laos, Kennedy did approve [[CIA activities in Laos]] designed to defeat Communist insurgents through bombing raids and the recruitment of the [[Hmong people]].{{sfn|Patterson|1996|p=498}}\n\n====Vietnam====\n{{see also|Role of the United States in the Vietnam War}}\n\nDuring his presidency, Kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the [[South Vietnam]]ese government.{{sfn|Dunnigan|Nofi|1999|p=257}} Vietnam had been divided into a communist North Vietnam and a non-Communist South Vietnam after the [[1954 Geneva Conference]], but North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] established the [[Viet Cong]] in 1960 to foment support for unification in South Vietnam. The president of South Vietnam, [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], had alienated many of his constituents by avoiding land reforms, refusing to hold free elections, and staging an anti-Communist purge. Kennedy escalated American involvement in Vietnam in 1961 by financing the South Vietnam army, increasing the number of U.S. military advisers above the levels of the Eisenhower administration, and authorizing U.S. helicopter units to provide support to South Vietnamese forces.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=256\u2013261}}\n\nThough Kennedy provided support for South Vietnam throughout his tenure, Vietnam remained a secondary issue for the Kennedy administration until 1963.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=256\u2013257}} Kennedy increasingly soured on Diem, whose violent [[Buddhist crisis|crackdown on Buddhist practices]] further galvanized opposition to his leadership. In August 1963, [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] replaced [[Frederick Nolting]] as the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam. Days after his arrival in South Vietnam, Lodge reported that several South Vietnamese generals sought the assent of the U.S. government to their plan of removing Diem from power. The Kennedy administration was split regarding not just the removal of Diem, but also their assessment of the military situation in South Vietnam and the proper U.S. role in the country. Without the full support of the U.S., General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] (known as \"Big Minh\") called off the potential coup in South Vietnam. Big Minh again approached the U.S. about a coup, and administration official informed him that the U.S. would neither support or oppose the toppling of Diem. In November 1963, a junta of senior military officers [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|executed Diem]] and his influential brother, [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=262\u2013268}}\n\nBy November 1963, there were 16,000 American military personnel in South Vietnam, up from Eisenhower's 900 advisors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm |title=Vietnam War |publisher=Swarthmore College Peace Collection |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803124531/http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm |archivedate=3 August 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the aftermath of the aborted coup in September 1963, the Kennedy administration reevaluated its policies in South Vietnam.

The United Kingdom\u2014which had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19, and whose economy was heavily dependent on Kuwaiti oil\u2014responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Kennedy dispatched a U.S. Navy task force to [[Bahrain]], and the U.K. (at the urging of the Kennedy administration) brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The situation was resolved in October, when the British troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong [[Arab League]] force.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=36}}\n\nIn December 1961, Qasim's government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the British- and American-owned [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC)'s [[Concession (contract)|concessionary holding]] to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession. U.S. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as UN member state, which they believed to be connected. Senior National Security Council adviser [[Robert Komer]] worried that if the IPC ceased production in response, Qasim might \"grab Kuwait\" (thus achieving a \"stranglehold\" on Middle Eastern oil production), or \"throw himself into Russian arms.\" Komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against Qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to \"get Iraq back on [a] more neutral keel.\"{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=37, 40-42}}\n\nThe anti-imperialist and anti-communist [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Iraqi Ba'ath Party]] [[Ramadan Revolution|overthrew and executed Qasim in a violent coup]] on February 8, 1963.

Kennedy shaking hands in Miami, Florida (10998767613).jpg|thumb|upright=.95|Kennedy in [[Miami]], Florida, November 18, 1963]]\n\nKennedy called his domestic program the \"[[New Frontier]]\"; it included initiatives such as medical care for the elderly, federal aid to education, and the creation of a department of housing and urban development.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=63\u201365}} His New Frontier program was strongly influenced by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1944 \"[[Second Bill of Rights]]\" address, as well as Harry Truman's [[Fair Deal]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=99}} Kennedy also called for a large tax cut as an economic stimulus measure. However, many of his programs were blocked by the [[conservative coalition]] of Republicans and southern Democrats.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=63\u201365}} The conservative coalition, which controlled key [[United States congressional committee|congressional committees]] and made up a majority of both houses of Congress during Kennedy's presidency, had prevented the implementation of progressive reforms since the late 1930s.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=39}} Kennedy's small margin of victory in the 1960 election, his lack of deep connections to influential members of Congress, and his administration's focus on foreign policy also hindered the passage of New Frontier policies.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=40\u201341, 100}} Passage of the New Frontier was made even more difficult after the death of Speaker of the House [[Sam Rayburn]]; new Speaker [[John William McCormack]] and Senate Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] both lacked the influence of their predecessors and struggled to exercise effective leadership over committee chairs.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nIn 1961, Kennedy prioritized passing five bills: federal assistance for education, medical insurance for the elderly, housing legislation, federal aid to struggling areas, and an increase in the [[minimum wage in the United States|federal minimum wage]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|p=99}} Kennedy's bill to increase the [[minimum wage in the United States|federal minimum wage]] to $1.25 an hour passed in early 1961, but an amendment inserted by the staunch segregationist Congressman from Georgia, [[Carl Vinson]], exempted hundreds of thousands of laundry workers (a job reserved for African-American women at the time) from the law.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=102\u2013103}} Kennedy also won passage of the Area Redevelopment Act and the Housing Act of 1961. The Area Redevelopment Act provided federal funding to economically struggling regions of the country, while the Housing Act of 1961 provided funds for urban renewal and public housing and authorized federal [[mortgage loans]] to those who did not qualify for public housing.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=105\u2013106}} Kennedy proposed a bill providing for $2.3 billion in federal educational aid to the states, with more money going to states with lower per-capita income. Though the Senate passed the education bill, it was defeated in the House by a coalition of Republicans, Southern Democrats, and Catholics.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=103\u2013104}} Kennedy's health insurance bill, which would have paid for hospitalization and nursing costs for the elderly, failed to pass either house of Congress due to the opposition of Republicans, Southern Democrats, and the [[American Medical Association]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=104\u2013105}} A bill that would have established the Department of Urban Affairs and Housing was also defeated.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\nIn 1962 and 1963, Kennedy won approval of the Manpower Development and Training Act, designed to provide job retraining, as well as bills that increased the regulation of drug manufacturers and authorized grants and loans for the construction of higher education facilities. Another Kennedy policy, the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, gave the president the power to cut [[tariffs in United States history|tariffs]] and to take action against countries employing discriminatory tariffs.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=107\u2013109}} Following the passage of that act, the U.S. and other countries agreed to major cuts in tariffs in the [[Kennedy Round]].{{Sfn|Johnson|2018|pp=460\u2013461}} Congress also passed the [[Community Mental Health Act]], providing funding to local mental health community centers. These centers provided out-patient services such as marriage counseling and aid to those suffering from [[alcoholism]].{{sfn|Patterson|1996|p=463}} In 1963, Kennedy began to focus more on the issue of poverty, and some of the ideas developed during his presidency would later influence President Johnson's [[War on Poverty]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=119\u2013122}}\n\n====Peace Corps====\n{{listen\n| title = Establishment of the Peace Corps\n| filename = JFK Establishment of the Peace Corps edit.ogg\n| description = John F.

Due in large part to Shriver's effective lobbying efforts, Congress approved the permanent establishment of the Peace Corps programs. Kennedy took great pride in the Peace Corps, and he ensured that it remained free of CIA influence, but he largely left its administration to Shriver. In the ensuing twenty-five years, more than 100,000 Americans served in 44 countries as part of the program. Most Peace Corps volunteers taught English in schools, but many became involved in activities like construction and food delivery.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=155\u2013159}}\n\n===Economy===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:1em; text-align:center\"\n|+ Federal finances and GDP during Kennedy's presidency<ref>All figures, except for debt percentage, are presented in billions of dollars.

Kennedy was proud that his Labor Department help keep wages steady in the steel industry, but was outraged in April 1962, [[Roger Blough]], the president of [[U.S. Steel]], quietly informed Kennedy that his company would raise prices.{{sfn|Parmet|1983|p=238}} In response, Attorney General Robert Kennedy began a price-fixing investigation against U.S. Steel, and President Kennedy convinced other steel companies to rescind their price increases until finally even U.S. Steel, isolated and in danger of being undersold, agreed to rescind its own price increase.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=130\u2013134}}<ref>Denise M.

The predictions according to the Keynesian model indicated the cuts would decrease income taxes by about $10 billion and corporate taxes by about $3.5 billion. The plan also included reforms designed to reduce the impact of [[itemized deduction]]s, as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped. Republicans and many Southern Democrats opposed the bill, calling for simultaneous reductions in expenditures, but debate continued throughout 1963.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=139\u2013141}} In February 1964, three months Into Johnson's administration, Congress approved the [[Revenue Act of 1964]], which lowered the top individual rate to 70 percent, and the top corporate rate to 48 percent.<ref>{{cite book |title=Why Budgets Matter: Budget Policy and American Politics |last=Ippolito |first=Dennis |year=2004 |publisher=Penn State Press |pages=173\u2013175|isbn=0-271-02260-4}}</ref>\n\n===Civil rights===\n====Early presidency====\n[[File:Thurgood Marshall 1957-09-17.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|In May 1961 Kennedy appointed [[Thurgood Marshall]] to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals]].]]\n\nThe turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s. [[Jim Crow]] [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] had been established law in the [[Deep South]] for much of the 20th century,<ref name=Grantham_p156>Grantham (1988), ''The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History'', p. 156</ref> but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] had ruled in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that [[racial segregation]] in public schools was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially in southern states, did not obey the Supreme Court's decision. Kennedy favored desegregation and other civil rights causes, but he generally did not place a high priority on civil rights, especially before 1963.{{sfn|Patterson|1996|pp=473\u2013475}} Recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats could block legislation, Kennedy did not introduce civil rights legislation upon taking office.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=487}} Kennedy did appoint many blacks to office, including civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Kennedy also established the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission#Background|President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity]] to investigate employment discrimination and expanded the Justice Department's involvement in voting rights cases.{{sfn|Patterson|1996|pp=473\u2013475}}\n\nKennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress, and he distanced himself from it.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|pp=60, 66}} As articulated by brother Robert, the administration's early priority was to \"keep the president out of this civil rights mess.\"{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the South, viewed Kennedy as lukewarm,{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} especially concerning the [[Freedom Riders]]. The Freedom Riders organized an integrated public transportation effort in the South and were repeatedly met with white mob violence.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Robert Kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the Freedom Riders to \"get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts.\"{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=123\u2013126}} Kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up \"hated memories of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]\" among conservative Southern whites.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Displeased with Kennedy's pace addressing the issue of segregation, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and use an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of \"[[Second Emancipation Proclamation]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/emancipation-proclamation|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle|publisher=Stanford University}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1962, [[James Meredith]] enrolled at the [[University of Mississippi]] but was prevented from entering.

Rather than proposing comprehensive legislation, President Kennedy put his support behind a proposed constitutional amendment that would prohibit states from conditioning the right to vote in [[US federal election|federal elections]] on payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other types of tax. He considered the constitutional amendment the best way to avoid a filibuster, as the claim that federal abolition of the poll tax was unconstitutional would be moot.

Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a \"triumph of managed protest\", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580\u2013584}}\n\nNotwithstanding the success of the March, the larger struggle was far from over. Three weeks later, [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|a bomb exploded]] on Sunday, September 15 at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion, and two other children shot to death in the aftermath.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=599\u2013600}} Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for its passage.

He asked Johnson to explore the feasibility of beating the Soviets to the Moon. Though he was concerned about the program's costs, Kennedy agreed to Johnson's recommendation that the U.S. commit to a manned lunar landing as the major objective of the U.S. space program.

In 1962, [[John Glenn]] became the first American to orbit the Earth, and the following year [[Mariner program]] sent an unmanned flight past [[Venus]]. Though some members of Congress came to favor shifting NASA's budget to other programs, Kennedy and Johnson remained committed to the lunar landing.

Both Robert Kennedy and John F. Kennedy had played a role on that committee, and in 1960 Robert Kennedy published the book ''[[The Enemy Within (Kennedy book)|The Enemy Within]]'', which focused on the influence of organized crime within businesses and organized labor.{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=145\u2013146}} Under the leadership of the attorney general, the Kennedy administration shifted the focus of the Justice Department, the FBI, and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to organized crime. Kennedy also won congressional approval for five bills designed to crack down on interstate [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], gambling, and the transportation of firearms. The federal government targeted prominent [[American Mafia|Mafia]] leaders like [[Carlos Marcello]] and [[Joey Aiuppa]]; Marcello was deported to [[Guatemala]], while Aiuppa was convicted of violating of the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]].{{sfn|Giglio|2006|pp=146\u2013148}} The attorney general's top target was perhaps [[Jimmy Hoffa]], the head of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters Union]].

He is the author of ''[[My Uncle's Wedding]]'', ''[[Journey to Same-Sex Parenthood]]'', ''The Ultimate Guide for Gay Dads'', and ''We Make It Better''.\n\n==Books==\n===''My Uncle\u2019s Wedding''===\n''My Uncle\u2019s Wedding'' is a children's picture book about marriage equality. The main character is a boy named Andy who finds out that his uncle, Mike, is going to marry his long-term boyfriend, Steve. In the book, Andy talks about his uncle's wedding, how it affects him, and the things he gets to do in preparation for the ceremony. Tracy K. Greene created illustrations and the author is credited as Eric Ross instead of Eric Rosswood because he wrote and published the book prior to getting married and changing his last name.\n\nRosswood stated he intentionally left the word \"gay\" out of the book because the story was about a wedding, not a \"gay wedding.\"<ref name=\"Hurley\" /> ''My Uncle\u2019s Wedding'' was praised by [[Marriage Equality USA]]<ref name=\"Queer Me Up\">{{cite news|title=\"My Uncle\u2019s Wedding\" Children\u2019s Book|url=http://queermeup.com/culture-2/my-uncles-wedding-childrens-book/|accessdate=6 May 2018|publisher=Queer Me Up}}</ref>  and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]]. During the official book release, California Senator [[Mark Leno]] presented Rosswood with a Senate Certificate of Recognition for ''My Uncle's Wedding'', stating the book's \"vital role in creating a brighter future.\"<ref name=\"Edge Media Network\">{{cite news|title=First Graders in San Francisco Learn About Marriage Equality for Harvey Milk Day|url=https://www.edgemedianetwork.com/index.php?ch=style&sc=&sc3=&id=120081|accessdate=6 May 2018|publisher=Edge Media Network|date=May 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn various interviews, Rosswood explained that the reason he wrote ''My Uncle\u2019s Wedding'' was because he didn't like how opponents of marriage equality would always use kids for political gain, so he decided to write about the topic from a child's perspective.<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\nWhile the book was typically well received, the anti-LGBT group [[National Organization for Marriage]] (NOM) was quick to condemn it.<ref name=\"Hooper\">{{cite news|last1=Hooper|first1=Jeremy|title=NOM routinely denies personal animus.

He wrote ''Journey to Same-Sex Parenthood'' to help same-sex couples start their own families.<ref name=\"Gressitt\" /> The book compares adoption, foster care, assisted reproduction, surrogacy, and co-parenting to help LGBTQ people decide which path is right for them.

writer and LGBT activist, best known for writing books about parenting. He is the author of ''[[My Uncle's Wedding]]'', ''[[Journey to Same-Sex Parenthood]]'', ''The Ultimate Guide for Gay Dads'', and ''We Make It Better''.\n\n==Books==\n===''My Uncle\u2019s Wedding''===\n''My Uncle\u2019s Wedding'' is a children's picture book about marriage equality. The main character is a young boy named Andy who finds out that his uncle, Mike, is going to get married to his long-term boyfriend, Steve. In the book, Andy talks about his uncle's wedding, how it affects him, and the things he gets to do in preparation for the ceremony. Tracy K. Greene created illustrations and the author is credited as Eric Ross instead of Eric Rosswood because he wrote and published the book prior to getting married and changing his last name.\n\nRosswood stated he intentionally left the word \"gay\" out of the book because the story was about a wedding, not a \"gay wedding.\"<ref name=\"Hurley\" /> ''My Uncle\u2019s Wedding'' was praised by [[Marriage Equality USA]]<ref name=\"Queer Me Up\">{{cite news|title=\"My Uncle\u2019s Wedding\" Children\u2019s Book|url=http://queermeup.com/culture-2/my-uncles-wedding-childrens-book/|accessdate=6 May 2018|publisher=Queer Me Up}}</ref>  and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]]. During the official book release, California Senator [[Mark Leno]] presented Rosswood with a Senate Certificate of Recognition for ''My Uncle's Wedding'', stating the book's \"vital role in creating a brighter future.\"<ref name=\"Edge Media Network\">{{cite news|title=First Graders in San Francisco Learn About Marriage Equality for Harvey Milk Day|url=https://www.edgemedianetwork.com/index.php?ch=style&sc=&sc3=&id=120081|accessdate=6 May 2018|publisher=Edge Media Network|date=May 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn various interviews, Rosswood explained that the reason he wrote ''My Uncle\u2019s Wedding'' was because he didn't like how opponents of marriage equality would always use kids for political gain, so he decided to write about the topic from a child's perspective.<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\nWhile the book was typically well received, the anti-LGBT group [[National Organization for Marriage]] (NOM) was quick to condemn it.<ref name=\"Hooper\">{{cite news|last1=Hooper|first1=Jeremy|title=NOM routinely denies personal animus.

He wrote ''Journey to Same-Sex Parenthood'' to help same-sex couples start their own families.<ref name=\"Gressitt\" /> The book compares adoption, foster care, assisted reproduction, surrogacy, and co-parenting to help LGBTQ people decide which path is right for them.

In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football. At this time, Goater suffered homesickness, finding it difficult to adapt to the English climate: \"It took me a good two years to get used to life in England.

In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football. At this time, Goater suffered homesickness, finding it difficult to adapt to the English climate: \"It took me a good two years to get used to life in England. At first I thought the sun never shone and it wasn't for me.\"<ref name=\"early\" /> However, he gradually got used to living in England, and over the course of seven seasons at Rotherham he gained a reputation as a reliable lower division striker, scoring 86 goals in 262 appearances, with a winner's medal for the 1996 [[Football League Trophy|Auto Windscreens Shield]] the highlight. A 1992 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] gave Goater his first experience of playing against a [[Premier League]] team.

In the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]] season, Goater became the first Manchester City player since [[Francis Lee]] in 1972 to score more than 30 goals in a season.

The Vijayanagar rulers installed viceroys to rule over various parts of the empire. In 1532 CE, [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], the brother and successor of [[Krishnadevaraya|Krishna Deva Raya]] of Vijayanagar granted Sevappa Nayak, the governor of Thanjavur, permission to establish a feudatory kingdom following his Southern Campaigns against the last Chola ruler.\n{{TNhistory}}\n\n==Literature==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}\n[[Telugu literature]] flourished during the reign of Nayakas in [[Tanjavur]] which was referred to as Southern School of Telugu Literature.<ref name=tel1>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&pg=PA269&dq=literature+tajavur+nayaks+telugu&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhsbHr683mAhU7wjgGHTe3DGUQ6AEIVjAF#v=onepage&q=literature%20tajavur%20nayaks%20telugu&f=false|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1998|language=en}}</ref> Many Telugu Musicians and Pandits were part of their court.<ref name=tel1 />\n\n==Nayak kings==\n\n===Chevvappa Nayak===\n{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}\n[[Chevvappa Nayak]] a.k.a. Sevappa Nayak (1532\u20131580), was the first Thanjavur Nayak king.  He was the son of Timmappa Nayak, a Vijayanagara viceroy in the [[Arcot]] region from his wife Bayyambika. The work ''[[Raghunathabhyudayam]]'' written by [[Vijayaraghava Nayaka]] gives some genealogical details of Timmappa. Timmappa or ''Timmabhupati'' was the ruler of North Arcot with his capital at Nedungunram.<ref name=\"Tanjore p.27\">''Nayaks of Tanjore'', by V. Vriddhagirisan, p.27</ref> The epigraphs of all of the Tanjore Nayaks show that they belonged to Nedungunram.<ref name=\"Tanjore p.27\"/> One of Krishnadevaraya's epigraphs mentions that Timmappa also had the high privilege of serving him as a door keeper (vasal) and was the emperor's ''dalavay'' (commander) who took part in the Raichur campaign.<ref>[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=GD_6ka-aYuQC |page=26 }} ''Nayaks of Tanjore'', by V. Vriddhagirisan, p.27]</ref> According to historian V. Vriddhagirisan, Timmappa Nayak was the brother of Nagama Nayak.<ref>''Nayaks of Tanjore'' by V. Vriddhagirisn, p.151</ref> Nagama Nayak was the father of [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty#Visvanatha Nayakka Ayyar .5B21.5D|Visvanatha Nayak]] (founder of the Madurai Nayak dynastic line). Hence Viswanatha Nayak and Chevvappa Nayak were cousins.\n\nThe work ''Raghunathabhyudayam'' mentions that Timmappa and Bayambika had 4 sons: Pedda Seva, Chinna Seva, Pedda Malla and Chinna Malla. However, not much is known of the other 3 sons. Of the 4 sons, Chinna Seva alias Sevappa Nayak seems to have distinguished himself.\n\nBefore assuming power of the Tanjore kingdom, Sevvappa had distinguished himself under Krishnadavaraya as an administrator and a builder. Sevappa's wife Murtimamba was the sister-in-law of [[Achyuta Deva Raya]] and the sister of the Vijayanagara Queen, Thirumalamba. Some sources suggest that Sevappa acquired the Thanjavur Kingdom as ''[[Stridhana]]'' (dowry) from Achyutadeva Raya. Sevappa was also a ceremonial [[betel]] bearer to [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], the brother of [[Krishnadevaraya]].\n\nAccording to the book ''Arunachala: A short history of hill and temple in Tiruvannamalai'' (pg 54-55), the \"position of a ceremonial betel bearer or ''adaiappan'' (''thambul karandivan'') was a post given to a very trusted subordinate.. and Sevappa being a powerful and influential man of the locality was appointed the first nayak\". The position of a betel bearer was usually not given to an outsider, as this position would make the man privy to all of the king's personal details. Therefore, the position was usually given to a trusted member within the family.\n\n===Achuthappa Nayak===\nSevappa's son, [[Achuthappa Nayak]] (1560\u20131614), was named in memory of Achyuta Deva Raya. He led a peaceful reign of 54 years. Up until 1580 Achuthappa Nayak co-ruled with his father under the Yuvaraja title while immediately after that he was joined by his heir, son Raghunatha Nayak. He was said to be deeply religious and was well considered a master in the art of warfare. His minister was [[Govinda Dikshitar]], a great scholar and a shrewd administrator. His long reign was of comparative peace apart from the internal struggles enabling him to contribute much to spiritual and public utility development.\n\n====Conflicts and wars====\n\n=====Wars with Madurai=====\nDuring Achuthappa's reign, the Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by the [[Deccan sultanates]] armies at the [[battle of Talikota]]. Later when the Vijaynagara rulers re-established their capital in Chandragiri and Vellore under Sriranga Rayas, Achuthappa Nayak continued his loyalty while Gingee and Madurai Nayaks intended to break free by refusing to pay tribute. This would also lead to bitter animosity between the [[Madurai Nayaks]] and the Tanjore Nayaks ultimately leading to the Battle at Vallamprakara where the Tanjore army with the Rayas fought against Veerappa Nayak of Madurai by defeating the latter. Same time when the Rayas of [[Chandragiri]] were waging wars with the Deccan Sultanates in southern [[Andhra Pradesh]] Achuthappa Nayak provided support.\n\n=====Wars with Portugal=====\nPortugal controlled the [[Nagapattinam]] territory as well as the Colombo province in [[Ceylon]] and the entire West Coast of India. The King of [[Jaffna kingdom]] went into a war against Portugal against the methods adopted by the missionary conversions in Jaffna. Later King of Jaffna sought help from the Tanjore Nayaks in repelling Portuguese advances through many battles<ref>['Nayek of Tanjore sends an army of Vadugas with King Varuna Gulata (Varnakula Aditya/Nilayitta) of the Karieas to assist'; The temporal and spiritual conquest of Ceylon, Fern\u00e3o de Queyroz, p. 468]</ref>\n\nAchuthappa Nayak provided land grants to the new Italian settlers who escaped the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Siege of Malta]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the demand of their conversion to Hinduism.<ref name=\"Nayaks of Tanjore\"/>\n\n====Public contributions====\nAchuthappa Nayak was deeply religious from his young days and the fertile nature of his country helped him make large contributions in gifts and infrastructure to major Temples and also important irrigation systems. The main benefactor was the Srirangam Temple. His assistant and advisor was his [[Minister (government)|minister]] Govinda Dikshita.\n\n=====Srirangam Temple=====\n[[File:Srirangam 1909 stonecarving.jpg|Stone carving at Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. Source: ''The National Geographic Magazine'', November 1909|thumb|right|230px]]\nThe [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Srirangam Temple]] towers (Gopurams) of the North and West and the eighth Prakara (temple Wall Street) and several Halls (Mandapam) inside the Temple complex were built by him. The Golden Vimana of the inner most shrines (Temple Flag) and the image of God studded with Crown jewels was presented by Achuthappa Nayak.<ref name=\"Nayaks of Tanjore\"/>\n\n=====Other Temples=====\nHis other major contributions include the Pushyamantapas (Halls) with steps leading to river [[Cauvery]] in [[Mayavaram]], [[Tiruvidaimarudur]], Tiruvadi and [[Kumbakonam]] and Golden Kalasas of [[Tiruvannamalai]] Temple Gopurams (Towers) some of the Gopurams in Rameswaram. Several temples in Arcot and [[Tanjore]] regions namely Temples in Tiruvidaimarudur and [[Chidambaram]] received villages as grants.\n\n=====Irrigation=====\nHis one remarkable contribution is the construction of a dam across Cauvery near Tiruvadi leading to efficient irrigation in its vicinity.\n\n=====Housing=====\n\nNumerous [[Agraharam|Agraharas]] (housing for [[Brahmin]]s) in [[Tanjore]] country were built in his period.\n\n====Final years====\nDuring his last days the Rayas now ruling from Chandragiri and [[Vellore]] had rival claimants within the family to the title and were heading for a war with the other Nayak kings taking sides with some suited to their vested interests.\n\n===Raghunatha Nayak===\n[[Raghunatha Nayak]] (1600\u20131634) is regarded as the greatest in the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty. He is famous for his patronage of literature other scholarly research. One of his wives, Ramabhadramba was highly educated and a gifted poet. During his time he granted military assistance to the [[Chandragiri]] ruler [[Venkatapati Deva Raya|Venkata II]] to recover most of his lost areas from the [[Golconda]] forces. In 1620 Raghunatha Nayak permitted a Danish settlement at [[Tarangambadi]].  This encouraged the English to seek trade with the Thanjavur Nayaks. The Tanjore cannon or Raghunatha cannon, supposed to be the largest cannon in the world was installed during Raghunatha Nayak, built with Danish metallurgy know how.<ref name=\"The Hindu\">{{cite web|title= Living History: A cannon in monumental neglect - The Hindu\n|url= http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/living-history-a-cannon-in-monumental-neglect/article2848696.ece|publisher=The Hindu|date=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thanjavur cannon.jpg|thumb|Thanjavur cannon installed during <ref name=\"The Hindu\"/>\n reign]]\n\nRaghunatha was a gifted scholar in [[Sanskrit]], [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language]]s, as well as a talented musician.

[[Govinda Dikshita]]'s son Yajnanarayana has written an account on Raghunatha's rule in his work ''Sahitya Ratnakara''. Raghunatha was a gifted scholar and an expert in the art of swordplay, a fine marksman and a skilled master in horse riding. In the field of music, Raghunatha created new ragas, talas, and melas like Jayanta sena (Ragam), Ramananda (Talam), Sargita vidya and Raghunatha (Mela). His Sanskrit treatise on music, ''Sangita Sudha'' opened the secrets of music to all. Raghunatha also composed kavyas and dance-dramas like Prabandkas, Parijatapaharana, Valmika Charitra Kavya, Achyutendrabhyudayam, Gajendramoksham, Nala Caritiam and '''Rukmini Krishna Vivaha Yakshagana'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume18/articles/article7.htm |title=Introduction To Sangitasudha |publisher=Tamilartsacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=GD_6ka-aYuQC |page=108 }} |title=Nayaks of Tanjore - V.

Gobburi Jagga Raya, brother of the previous ruler Venkata II's favourite Queen Obayamma claimed her putative son as the King and murdered [[Sriranga II]] along with his family in the Vellore Prison. Jagga Raya was strongly challenged by Yachamanedu, the chief of [[Nayaks of Kalahasti|Kalahasti]] who claimed the throne for Rama Deva, the rightful heir whom he had smuggled out from the Vellore Prison. Jagga Raya sought help from the [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee Nayak]] and Muttu Virappa of [[Madurai Nayaks|Madurai]] to attack Yachamanedu and Rama Deva.  Yachamanedu and Ramadeva sought support from Raghunatha, who still treated the Vijaynagar as his authority.\n\n=====The Battle of Toppur=====\n{{main|Battle of Toppur}}\nJagga Raya assembled a large army near [[Tiruchirappalli]], the capital of Muttu Virappa comprising the armies of [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee]], [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]], [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty|Madurai]], and some Portuguese from the coast. Yachama led the forces of [[Vijayanagar Empire|Vijayanagara]] and [[Nayaks of Kalahasti|Kalahasti]] from [[Vellore]] and was joined midway by [[Tanjore Nayaks|Tanjore]] forces headed by Raghunatha.Yachama's army was further strengthened by  nobles from [[Karnataka]] and (according to some accounts) Dutch and [[Jaffna]] armies.\n\nBoth the Armies met at the Toppur, at an open field on the northern banks of River [[Cauvery]], between Tiruchirappalli and [[Grand Anicut]] in late months of 1616.  The huge assembly of forces on either side is estimated to be as many as a million soldiers (according to Dr. Barradas in Sewell's Book) and considered to be one of the biggest battles in southern India.\n\n=====Result=====\nIn the Battle Jagga Raya's troops could not withstand the aggression generated by the imperial forces.  Yachama and Raghunatha, the generals of the imperial camp led their forces with great discipline.  Jagga Raya was slain by Yachama, and his army broke the ranks and took flight.  Yethiraja, the brother of Jagga Raya, had to run for his life.  Muttu Virappa tried to escape, he was pursued by Yachama's general Rao Dama Nayani who captured him near [[Tiruchirapalli]].  The Nayak of [[Gingee]] in the encounter lost all his forts except [[Gingee Fort]] and the putative son of [[Venkata II]], cause of all trouble was captured.  The Victory was celebrated by the imperial armies headed by Raghunatha and Yachamanedu, who planted pillars of Victory and crowned Rama Deva as Rama Deva Raya, in early months of 1617.  Rama Deva Raya was barely 15 years old when he ascended the throne.\n\n===Vijaya Raghava Nayak===\n[[Vijaya Raghava Nayak]] (1634\u20131673), was the last of the Nayak Kings of Thanjavur.  He was also called ''Mannaru Dasa''; and like the rest of his family, he built prakaras, gopurams, mandapams and tanks in the Mannargudi Rajagopalaswamy temple.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2004/05/23/stories/2004052300310400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Shrine in the forest | date=2004-05-23}}</ref> Vijayaraghava's long reign witnessed a large amount of literary output both in music and Telugu literature. Vijayaraghava's court had a number of poets and literary scholars. Vijayaraghava Nayak wrote more than thirty books in Telugu.<ref name=raghunatha1/> His long reign was sadly brought to an abrupt end by [[Chokkanatha Nayak]] of Madurai.\n\n==End of Nayak rule==\n{{See also|Chokkanatha Nayak}}\nThe end of the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty was brought on by Chokkanatha Nayak, the [[Nayak of Madurai]].  The dispute was due to the refusal of Vijaya Ragava Nayak to give his daughter in marriage to Chokkanatha Nayak.  Chokkantha determined to fetch the maiden by force back into their capital, successfully stormed the Thanjavur palace in 1673 after flattening much of the fort walls by cannons.  But Chokkanatha Nayak was thwarted in his attempts by Vijaya Ragava Nayak, when  he, in a gruesome act of defiance, blew up his daughter and all the other ladies of the palace.  He then charged at the attacking army with his son and his body-guard. He was captured after a brief fight, and was beheaded by the Madurai General Samukham Venkata Krishnappa Nayak.\n\n==Maratha conquest==\nChokkanatha placed his younger brother [[Alagiri Nayak]] on the throne of Thanjavur, but within a year the latter threw off his allegiance, and Chokkanatha was forced to recognise the independence of Thanjavur. A son of Vijaya Raghava induced the Bijapur Sultan to help him get back  the Thanjavur throne. In 1675, the Sultan of Bijapur sent a force commanded by the Maratha general [[Venkoji]] (alias Ekoji) to drive away the Madurai usurper. Venkaji defeated Alagiri with ease, and occupied Thanjavur. He did not, however, place his protege on the throne as instructed by the Bijapur Sultan, but seized the kingdom and made himself king. Thus ended the reign of Nayaks and the start of [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom|Maratha power]] in Thanjavur.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Madurai Nayak dynasty]]\n* [[Nayaks of Gingee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Nagaswamy, R ''Tamil Coins- a study'', (1970), State Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu\n* Vriddhagirisan V, ''Nayaks of Tanjore'', {{ISBN|8120609964}}, Reprint Annamalainagar 1942 edn., 1995\n* Velcheru Narayana Rao|Rao, David Shulman and Sanjay Subrahmanyam.

The Vijayanagar rulers installed viceroys to rule over various parts of the empire. In 1532 CE, [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], the brother and successor of [[Krishnadevaraya|Krishna Deva Raya]] of Vijayanagar granted Sevappa Nayak, the governor of Thanjavur, permission to establish a feudatory kingdom following his Southern Campaigns against the last Chola ruler.\n{{TNhistory}}\n\n==Literature==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}\n[[Telugu literature]] flourished during the reign of Nayakas in [[Tanjavur]] which was referred to as Southern School of Telugu Literature.<ref name=tel1>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&pg=PA269&dq=literature+tajavur+nayaks+telugu&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhsbHr683mAhU7wjgGHTe3DGUQ6AEIVjAF#v=onepage&q=literature%20tajavur%20nayaks%20telugu&f=false|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1998|language=en}}</ref> Many Telugu Musicians and Pandits were part of their court.<ref name=tel1 />\n\n==Nayak kings==\n\n===Chevvappa Nayak===\n{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}\n[[Chevvappa Nayak]] a.k.a. Sevappa Nayak (1532\u20131580), was the first Thanjavur Nayak king.  He was the son of Timmappa Nayak, a Vijayanagara viceroy in the [[Arcot]] region from his wife Bayyambika. The work ''[[Raghunathabhyudayam]]'' written by [[Vijayaraghava Nayaka]] gives some genealogical details of Timmappa. Timmappa or ''Timmabhupati'' was the ruler of North Arcot with his capital at Nedungunram.<ref name=\"Tanjore p.27\">''Nayaks of Tanjore'', by V. Vriddhagirisan, p.27</ref> The epigraphs of all of the Tanjore Nayaks show that they belonged to Nedungunram.<ref name=\"Tanjore p.27\"/> One of Krishnadevaraya's epigraphs mentions that Timmappa also had the high privilege of serving him as a door keeper (vasal) and was the emperor's ''dalavay'' (commander) who took part in the Raichur campaign.<ref>[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=GD_6ka-aYuQC |page=26 }} ''Nayaks of Tanjore'', by V. Vriddhagirisan, p.27]</ref> According to historian V. Vriddhagirisan, Timmappa Nayak was the brother of Nagama Nayak.<ref>''Nayaks of Tanjore'' by V. Vriddhagirisn, p.151</ref> Nagama Nayak was the father of [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty#Visvanatha Nayakka Ayyar .5B21.5D|Visvanatha Nayak]] (founder of the Madurai Nayak dynastic line). Hence Viswanatha Nayak and Chevvappa Nayak were cousins.\n\nThe work ''Raghunathabhyudayam'' mentions that Timmappa and Bayambika had 4 sons: Pedda Seva, Chinna Seva, Pedda Malla and Chinna Malla. However, not much is known of the other 3 sons. Of the 4 sons, Chinna Seva alias Sevappa Nayak seems to have distinguished himself.\n\nBefore assuming power of the Tanjore kingdom, Sevvappa had distinguished himself under Krishnadavaraya as an administrator and a builder. Sevappa's wife Murtimamba was the sister-in-law of [[Achyuta Deva Raya]] and the sister of the Vijayanagara Queen, Thirumalamba. Some sources suggest that Sevappa acquired the Thanjavur Kingdom as ''[[Stridhana]]'' (dowry) from Achyutadeva Raya. Sevappa was also a ceremonial [[betel]] bearer to [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], the brother of [[Krishnadevaraya]].\n\nAccording to the book ''Arunachala: A short history of hill and temple in Tiruvannamalai'' (pg 54-55), the \"position of a ceremonial betel bearer or ''adaiappan'' (''thambul karandivan'') was a post given to a very trusted subordinate.. and Sevappa being a powerful and influential man of the locality was appointed the first nayak\". The position of a betel bearer was usually not given to an outsider, as this position would make the man privy to all of the king's personal details. Therefore, the position was usually given to a trusted member within the family.\n\n===Achuthappa Nayak===\nSevappa's son, [[Achuthappa Nayak]] (1560\u20131614), was named in memory of Achyuta Deva Raya. He led a peaceful reign of 54 years. Up until 1580 Achuthappa Nayak co-ruled with his father under the Yuvaraja title while immediately after that he was joined by his heir, son Raghunatha Nayak. He was said to be deeply religious and was well considered a master in the art of warfare. His minister was [[Govinda Dikshitar]], a great scholar and a shrewd administrator. His long reign was of comparative peace apart from the internal struggles enabling him to contribute much to spiritual and public utility development.\n\n====Conflicts and wars====\n\n=====Wars with Madurai=====\nDuring Achuthappa's reign, the Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by the [[Deccan sultanates]] armies at the [[battle of Talikota]]. Later when the Vijaynagara rulers re-established their capital in Chandragiri and Vellore under Sriranga Rayas, Achuthappa Nayak continued his loyalty while Gingee and Madurai Nayaks intended to break free by refusing to pay tribute. This would also lead to bitter animosity between the [[Madurai Nayaks]] and the Tanjore Nayaks ultimately leading to the Battle at Vallamprakara where the Tanjore army with the Rayas fought against Veerappa Nayak of Madurai by defeating the latter. Same time when the Rayas of [[Chandragiri]] were waging wars with the Deccan Sultanates in southern [[Andhra Pradesh]] Achuthappa Nayak provided support.\n\n=====Wars with Portugal=====\nPortugal controlled the [[Nagapattinam]] territory as well as the Colombo province in [[Ceylon]] and the entire West Coast of India. The King of [[Jaffna kingdom]] went into a war against Portugal against the methods adopted by the missionary conversions in Jaffna. Later King of Jaffna sought help from the Tanjore Nayaks in repelling Portuguese advances through many battles<ref>['Nayek of Tanjore sends an army of Vadugas with King Varuna Gulata (Varnakula Aditya/Nilayitta) of the Karieas to assist'; The temporal and spiritual conquest of Ceylon, Fern\u00e3o de Queyroz, p. 468]</ref>\n\nAchuthappa Nayak provided land grants to the new Italian settlers who escaped the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Siege of Malta]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the demand of their conversion to Hinduism.<ref name=\"Nayaks of Tanjore\"/>\n\n====Public contributions====\nAchuthappa Nayak was deeply religious from his young days and the fertile nature of his country helped him make large contributions in gifts and infrastructure to major Temples and also important irrigation systems. The main benefactor was the Srirangam Temple. His assistant and advisor was his [[Minister (government)|minister]] Govinda Dikshita.\n\n=====Srirangam Temple=====\n[[File:Srirangam 1909 stonecarving.jpg|Stone carving at Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam.

The Golden Vimana of the inner most shrines (Temple Flag) and the image of God studded with Crown jewels was presented by Achuthappa Nayak.<ref name=\"Nayaks of Tanjore\"/>\n\n=====Other Temples=====\nHis other major contributions include the Pushyamantapas (Halls) with steps leading to river [[Cauvery]] in [[Mayavaram]], [[Tiruvidaimarudur]], Tiruvadi and [[Kumbakonam]] and Golden Kalasas of [[Tiruvannamalai]] Temple Gopurams (Towers) some of the Gopurams in Rameswaram. Several temples in Arcot and [[Tanjore]] regions namely Temples in Tiruvidaimarudur and [[Chidambaram]] received villages as grants.\n\n=====Irrigation=====\nHis one remarkable contribution is the construction of a dam across Cauvery near Tiruvadi leading to efficient irrigation in its vicinity.\n\n=====Housing=====\n\nNumerous [[Agraharam|Agraharas]] (housing for [[Brahmin]]s) in [[Tanjore]] country were built in his period.\n\n====Final years====\nDuring his last days the Rayas now ruling from Chandragiri and [[Vellore]] had rival claimants within the family to the title and were heading for a war with the other Nayak kings taking sides with some suited to their vested interests.\n\n===Raghunatha Nayak===\n[[Raghunatha Nayak]] (1600\u20131634) is regarded as the greatest in the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty. He is famous for his patronage of literature other scholarly research. One of his wives, Ramabhadramba was highly educated and a gifted poet. During his time he granted military assistance to the [[Chandragiri]] ruler [[Venkatapati Deva Raya|Venkata II]] to recover most of his lost areas from the [[Golconda]] forces. In 1620 Raghunatha Nayak permitted a Danish settlement at [[Tarangambadi]].  This encouraged the English to seek trade with the Thanjavur Nayaks. The Tanjore cannon or Raghunatha cannon, supposed to be the largest cannon in the world was installed during Raghunatha Nayak, built with Danish metallurgy know how.<ref name=\"The Hindu\">{{cite web|title= Living History: A cannon in monumental neglect - The Hindu\n|url= http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/living-history-a-cannon-in-monumental-neglect/article2848696.ece|publisher=The Hindu|date=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thanjavur cannon.jpg|thumb|Thanjavur cannon installed during <ref name=\"The Hindu\"/>\n reign]]\n\nRaghunatha was a gifted scholar in [[Sanskrit]], [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language]]s, as well as a talented musician.

[[Govinda Dikshita]]'s son Yajnanarayana has written an account on Raghunatha's rule in his work ''Sahitya Ratnakara''. Raghunatha was a gifted scholar and an expert in the art of swordplay, a fine marksman and a skilled master in horse riding. In the field of music, Raghunatha created new ragas, talas, and melas like Jayanta sena (Ragam), Ramananda (Talam), Sargita vidya and Raghunatha (Mela). His Sanskrit treatise on music, ''Sangita Sudha'' opened the secrets of music to all. Raghunatha also composed kavyas and dance-dramas like Prabandkas, Parijatapaharana, Valmika Charitra Kavya, Achyutendrabhyudayam, Gajendramoksham, Nala Caritiam and '''Rukmini Krishna Vivaha Yakshagana'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilartsacademy.com/journals/volume18/articles/article7.htm |title=Introduction To Sangitasudha |publisher=Tamilartsacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=GD_6ka-aYuQC |page=108 }} |title=Nayaks of Tanjore - V.

Gobburi Jagga Raya, brother of the previous ruler Venkata II's favourite Queen Obayamma claimed her putative son as the King and murdered [[Sriranga II]] along with his family in the Vellore Prison. Jagga Raya was strongly challenged by Yachamanedu, the chief of [[Nayaks of Kalahasti|Kalahasti]] who claimed the throne for Rama Deva, the rightful heir whom he had smuggled out from the Vellore Prison. Jagga Raya sought help from the [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee Nayak]] and Muttu Virappa of [[Madurai Nayaks|Madurai]] to attack Yachamanedu and Rama Deva.  Yachamanedu and Ramadeva sought support from Raghunatha, who still treated the Vijaynagar as his authority.\n\n=====The Battle of Toppur=====\n{{main|Battle of Toppur}}\nJagga Raya assembled a large army near [[Tiruchirappalli]], the capital of Muttu Virappa comprising the armies of [[Nayaks of Gingee|Gingee]], [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]], [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty|Madurai]], and some Portuguese from the coast. Yachama led the forces of [[Vijayanagar Empire|Vijayanagara]] and [[Nayaks of Kalahasti|Kalahasti]] from [[Vellore]] and was joined midway by [[Tanjore Nayaks|Tanjore]] forces headed by Raghunatha.Yachama's army was further strengthened by  nobles from [[Karnataka]] and (according to some accounts) Dutch and [[Jaffna]] armies.\n\nBoth the Armies met at the Toppur, at an open field on the northern banks of River [[Cauvery]], between Tiruchirappalli and [[Grand Anicut]] in late months of 1616.  The huge assembly of forces on either side is estimated to be as many as a million soldiers (according to Dr. Barradas in Sewell's Book) and considered to be one of the biggest battles in southern India.\n\n=====Result=====\nIn the Battle Jagga Raya's troops could not withstand the aggression generated by the imperial forces.  Yachama and Raghunatha, the generals of the imperial camp led their forces with great discipline.  Jagga Raya was slain by Yachama, and his army broke the ranks and took flight.  Yethiraja, the brother of Jagga Raya, had to run for his life.  Muttu Virappa tried to escape, he was pursued by Yachama's general Rao Dama Nayani who captured him near [[Tiruchirapalli]].  The Nayak of [[Gingee]] in the encounter lost all his forts except [[Gingee Fort]] and the putative son of [[Venkata II]], cause of all trouble was captured.  The Victory was celebrated by the imperial armies headed by Raghunatha and Yachamanedu, who planted pillars of Victory and crowned Rama Deva as Rama Deva Raya, in early months of 1617.  Rama Deva Raya was barely 15 years old when he ascended the throne.\n\n===Vijaya Raghava Nayak===\n[[Vijaya Raghava Nayak]] (1634\u20131673), was the last of the Nayak Kings of Thanjavur.  He was also called ''Mannaru Dasa''; and like the rest of his family, he built prakaras, gopurams, mandapams and tanks in the Mannargudi Rajagopalaswamy temple.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2004/05/23/stories/2004052300310400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Shrine in the forest | date=2004-05-23}}</ref> Vijayaraghava's long reign witnessed a large amount of literary output both in music and Telugu literature. Vijayaraghava's court had a number of poets and literary scholars. Vijayaraghava Nayak wrote more than thirty books in Telugu.<ref name=raghunatha1/> His long reign was sadly brought to an abrupt end by [[Chokkanatha Nayak]] of Madurai.\n\n==End of Nayak rule==\n{{See also|Chokkanatha Nayak}}\nThe end of the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty was brought on by Chokkanatha Nayak, the [[Nayak of Madurai]].  The dispute was due to the refusal of Vijaya Ragava Nayak to give his daughter in marriage to Chokkanatha Nayak.  Chokkantha determined to fetch the maiden by force back into their capital, successfully stormed the Thanjavur palace in 1673 after flattening much of the fort walls by cannons.  But Chokkanatha Nayak was thwarted in his attempts by Vijaya Ragava Nayak, when  he, in a gruesome act of defiance, blew up his daughter and all the other ladies of the palace.  He then charged at the attacking army with his son and his body-guard. He was captured after a brief fight, and was beheaded by the Madurai General Samukham Venkata Krishnappa Nayak.\n\n==Maratha conquest==\nChokkanatha placed his younger brother [[Alagiri Nayak]] on the throne of Thanjavur, but within a year the latter threw off his allegiance, and Chokkanatha was forced to recognise the independence of Thanjavur. A son of Vijaya Raghava induced the Bijapur Sultan to help him get back  the Thanjavur throne. In 1675, the Sultan of Bijapur sent a force commanded by the Maratha general [[Venkoji]] (alias Ekoji) to drive away the Madurai usurper. Venkaji defeated Alagiri with ease, and occupied Thanjavur. He did not, however, place his protege on the throne as instructed by the Bijapur Sultan, but seized the kingdom and made himself king. Thus ended the reign of Nayaks and the start of [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom|Maratha power]] in Thanjavur.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Madurai Nayak dynasty]]\n* [[Nayaks of Gingee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Nagaswamy, R ''Tamil Coins- a study'', (1970), State Department of Archaeology, Government of Tamil Nadu\n* Vriddhagirisan V, ''Nayaks of Tanjore'', {{ISBN|8120609964}}, Reprint Annamalainagar 1942 edn., 1995\n* Velcheru Narayana Rao|Rao, David Shulman and Sanjay Subrahmanyam.

He turned pro without having ever lost an amateur bout and is now known as one of the best amateur boxers to ever step in the ring.\n\n== Professional career ==\nOn January 18, 1985, Ricardo made his professional debut at the age of 18 by scoring a third round knockout of Rogelio Hernandez. He accumulated a record of 26\u20130 before receiving his first shot at a world title.\n\n=== WBC Minimumweight Championship ===\nOn October 10, 1990, L\u00f3pez defeated Lineal and WBC [[Mini flyweight|Minimumweight]] Champion [[Hideyuki Ohashi]] of [[Japan]] via a fifth round knockout to win his first world title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/straw.htm|title=Ricardo L\u00f3pez - Lineal Minimumweight Champion|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref> In 1991, he defeated [[Korean people|Korean]] former champion [[Kyung-Yung Lee]] (20\u20131). In 1992, he defended his title against\nPretty Boy Lucas (22\u20132\u20132) of the [[Philippines]] and Rocky Lin (14\u20130) of [[Taiwan]]. L\u00f3pez started 1993 with a stoppage victory over amateur standout [[Oh Kwang-soo|Kwang-Soo Oh]] and followed it with a knockout over future two-time champion [[Saman Sorjaturong]] of Thailand. Sorjaturong was knocked down once in the 1st round and twice in the 2nd round when the referee stopped the bout.\n\nLater that year, he knocked out Filipino former champion Manny Melchor in the 11th round. In his tenth title defense, L\u00f3pez defeated future champion Kermin Guardia (21\u20130) by unanimous decision. He knocked out Surachai Saengmorakot (10\u20130) in the first round of his next bout. In 1995, he defeated Andy Tabanas (30\u20132) of the Philippines via 12th round knock out. In his next bout, he defeated another [[Filipino people|Filipino]] boxer and founder of the famous \"Ala Gym\" Ala Villamor (29\u20131\u20131) by knockout. In 1997, L\u00f3pez defended his title against Mongkol Charoen (20\u20131).\n\n=== WBO and WBA Minimumweight Championship ===\nIn his 20th world title bout, L\u00f3pez unified his WBC title by defeating WBO Minimumweight Champion [[Alex S\u00e1nchez (boxer)|Alex S\u00e1nchez]] (25\u20131) of [[Puerto Rico]] via 5th round knockout. After Lopez won the [[WBO]] title, he said he wanted to give his championship belt to his father, who is a boxing fan. His statement to Mexican newspapers prompted the organization to take away Lopez's title and sanction a match between [[Eric Jamili]] and [[Mickey Cantwell]] to fill the vacancy. \"It was enough for us,\" said the WBO president, [[Francisco Valcarcel]] , of Lopez's intention. \"That's a public resignation.\" [[Dwight Manley]] , Lopez's agent, said Lopez should have had a hearing before the [[WBO]] took away his title. \"He got no letter, he got no telephone call,\" Manley said.\n\n\n\nOn March 7, 1998, L\u00f3pez fought undefeated WBA Minimumweight Champion [[Rosendo \u00c1lvarez]] to a technical draw after referee [[Arthur Mercante Sr.]] stopped the contest following an accidental head butt in the seventh round. In the rematch, \u00c1lvarez came in over the minimumweight limit and was subsequently stripped of his title. Due to the weight disparity, the fight was in jeopardy. However, L\u00f3pez chose to proceed with the contest against the heavier \u00c1lvarez with only L\u00f3pez eligible to claim the now vacant WBA title. L\u00f3pez defeated \u00c1lvarez by split decision to claim his third Minimumweight title.<ref>[http://www.fightwriter.com/jorge-arce-ko6-rosendo-alvarez JORGE ARCE KO6 ROSENDO ALVAREZ].

Notifight.com. Retrieved on January 26, 2012.</ref>\n\n== Amateur career ==\nL\u00f3pez would win four consecutive Guantes de Oro de M\u00e9xico Championships from 1981 to 1984. He turned pro without having ever lost an amateur bout and is now known as one of the best amateur boxers to ever step in the ring.\n\n== Professional career ==\nOn January 18, 1985, Ricardo made his professional debut at the age of 18 by scoring a third round knockout of Rogelio Hernandez. He accumulated a record of 26\u20130 before receiving his first shot at a world title.\n\n=== WBC Minimumweight Championship ===\nOn October 10, 1990, L\u00f3pez defeated Lineal and WBC [[Mini flyweight|Minimumweight]] Champion [[Hideyuki Ohashi]] of [[Japan]] via a fifth round knockout to win his first world title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/straw.htm|title=Ricardo L\u00f3pez - Lineal Minimumweight Champion|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref> In 1991, he defeated [[Korean people|Korean]] former champion [[Kyung-Yung Lee]] (20\u20131). In 1992, he defended his title against\nPretty Boy Lucas (22\u20132\u20132) of the [[Philippines]] and Rocky Lin (14\u20130) of [[Taiwan]]. L\u00f3pez started 1993 with a stoppage victory over amateur standout [[Oh Kwang-soo|Kwang-Soo Oh]] and followed it with a knockout over future two-time champion [[Saman Sorjaturong]] of Thailand. Sorjaturong was knocked down once in the 1st round and twice in the 2nd round when the referee stopped the bout.\n\nLater that year, he knocked out Filipino former champion Manny Melchor in the 11th round. In his tenth title defense, L\u00f3pez defeated future champion Kermin Guardia (21\u20130) by unanimous decision. He knocked out Surachai Saengmorakot (10\u20130) in the first round of his next bout. In 1995, he defeated Andy Tabanas (30\u20132) of the Philippines via 12th round knock out. In his next bout, he defeated another [[Filipino people|Filipino]] boxer and founder of the famous \"Ala Gym\" Ala Villamor (29\u20131\u20131) by knockout. In 1997, L\u00f3pez defended his title against Mongkol Charoen (20\u20131).\n\n=== WBO and WBA Minimumweight Championship ===\nIn his 20th world title bout, L\u00f3pez unified his WBC title by defeating WBO Minimumweight Champion [[Alex S\u00e1nchez (boxer)|Alex S\u00e1nchez]] (25\u20131) of [[Puerto Rico]] via 5th round knockout. On March 7, 1998, L\u00f3pez fought undefeated WBA Minimumweight Champion [[Rosendo \u00c1lvarez]] to a technical draw after referee [[Arthur Mercante Sr.]] stopped the contest following an accidental head butt in the seventh round. In the rematch, \u00c1lvarez came in over the minimumweight limit and was subsequently stripped of his title. Due to the weight disparity, the fight was in jeopardy. However, L\u00f3pez chose to proceed with the contest against the heavier \u00c1lvarez with only L\u00f3pez eligible to claim the now vacant WBA title. L\u00f3pez defeated \u00c1lvarez by split decision to claim his third Minimumweight title.<ref>[http://www.fightwriter.com/jorge-arce-ko6-rosendo-alvarez JORGE ARCE KO6 ROSENDO ALVAREZ].

He was the most important of the early [[patronage|patrons]] of the game of [[cricket]] and did much to help its evolution from [[village cricket]] to [[first-class cricket]].\n\n==Early life==\nLennox was styled [[Earl of March]] from his birth in 1701 as heir to his father's dukedom.<ref>Marshall, p. 1.</ref>  He also inherited his father's love of sports, particularly [[cricket]].<ref>Marshall, pp. 7\u201317.</ref>  He had a serious accident at the age of 12 when he was thrown from a horse during a hunt, but he recovered and it did not deter him from horsemanship.<ref>Marshall, pp. 18\u201320.</ref>\n\nMarch entered into an arranged marriage in December 1719 when he was still only 18 and his bride, [[Sarah Lennox, Duchess of Richmond|Hon. Sarah Cadogan]], was just 13, in order to use Sarah's large dowry to pay his considerable debts.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} They were married at [[The Hague]].<ref>Marshall, pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 1722, March became [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chichester (UK Parliament constituency)|Chichester]] as first member with Sir Thomas Miller as his second. He gave up his seat after his father died in May 1723 and he succeeded to the title of 2nd Duke of Richmond. A feature of Richmond's career was the support he received from his wife, Sarah, her interest being evident in surviving letters. Their marriage was a great success, especially by Georgian standards.\n\nTheir grandson who became the 4th Duke is known to cricket history as the [[Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond|Hon. Col. Charles Lennox]], a noted amateur batsman of the late 18th century who was one of [[Thomas Lord]]'s main guarantors when he established his [[Lord's Old Ground|new ground]] in [[Marylebone]].<ref>Altham, p. 51.</ref>\n\n==Cricket career==\n===The Duke of Richmond's XI===\n{{Infobox cricketer\n| name = Charles Lennox\n| image = \n| country = England\n| fullname = Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond\n| nickname =\n| birth_date = {{Birth date|1701|5|18|df=yes}}\n| birth_place = [[Goodwood, West Sussex|Goodwood]], [[West Sussex]], England\n| death_date = {{Death date and age|1750|8|8|1701|5|18|df=yes}}\n| death_place = [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]], England\n| batting = \n| bowling = \n| role = \n| club1 = [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]]\n| year1 = c.1720\u20131750\n| club2 =\n| year2 =\n| columns = \n| date = 17 July\n| year = 2009\n| source = John Marshall\n}}\n\nThe 2nd Duke of Richmond has been described as early cricket's greatest patron.<ref>Underdown, p. 53.</ref> Although he had played cricket as a boy, his real involvement began after he succeeded to the dukedom.<ref>Birley, p. 18.</ref> He captained his own team and his players included some of the earliest known professionals, such as his groom [[Thomas Waymark]]. Later, when he patronised [[Slindon Cricket Club]], Richmond was associated with the [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Newland brothers]]. His earliest recorded match is the one against [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage's XI]] on 20 July 1725, which is mentioned in a surviving letter from Sir William to the Duke.<ref>McCann, p. 4</ref><ref>Marshall, p. 41.</ref>\n\nRecords have survived of four matches played by Richmond's team in the [[1727 English cricket season|1727 season]]. Two were against Gage's XI and two against an XI raised by the [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] patron [[Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton|Alan Brodrick]].<ref>McCann, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> These last two games are highly significant because Richmond and Brodrick drew up [[Articles of Agreement (cricket)|Articles of Agreement]] beforehand to determine the rules that must apply in their contests. These were itemised in sixteen points.<ref>Birley, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> It is believed that this was the first time that rules (or some part of the rules as in this case) were formally agreed, although rules as such definitely existed. The first full codification of the [[Laws of Cricket]] was done in 1744. In early times, the rules would be agreed upon orally and were subject to local variations; this syndrome was also evident in [[association football|football]] until [[the FA]] was founded, especially regarding the question of handling the ball. Essentially the articles of agreement focused on residential qualifications and ensuring that there was no dissent by any player other than the two captains.<ref>Birley, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn 1728, Richmond's Sussex played twice against [[Edwin Stead]]'s [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and lost both matches, \"(Kent's) men have been too expert for those of Sussex\".<ref>Waghorn, p. 7.</ref> In 1730, Richmond's team played two matches against Gage's XI and another match against a Surrey XI backed by a Mr Andrews of Sunbury. Richmond lost to Andrews.<ref>Waghorn, p. 1.</ref> The second of his matches against Gage, due to be played at [[The Dripping Pan]], near [[Lewes]], was \"put off on account of Waymark, the Duke's man, being ill\".<ref>Waghorn, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\nIn 1731, Richmond was involved in one of the most controversial matches recorded in the early history of cricket. On 16 August, his Sussex team played a Middlesex XI backed by one Thomas Chambers at an unspecified venue in Chichester. Chambers' team won this match, which had a prize of 100 guineas, and a return was arranged to take place at [[Richmond Green]] on 23 August.<ref>Buckley, p. 6.</ref> The return match was played for 200 guineas and it is notable as the earliest match of which the team scores are known: Richmond's XI 79, Chambers' XI 119; Richmond's XI 72, Chambers' XI 23\u20135 (approx.). The game ended promptly at a pre-agreed time although Chambers' XI with \"four or five more to have come in\" and needing \"about 8 to 10 notches\" clearly had the upper hand. The end result caused a fracas among the crowd at Richmond Green, who were incensed by the prompt finish because the Duke of Richmond had arrived late and delayed the start of the game. The riot resulted in some of the Sussex players \"having the shirts torn off their backs\" and it was said \"a law suit would commence about the play\".<ref>McCann, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> In a note about another match involving Chambers' XI in September, [[G. B. Buckley]] has recorded that Richmond may have conceded the result to Chambers, presumably to stop the threat of litigation.<ref>Buckley, p. 7.</ref>\n\nRichmond is not mentioned in cricket sources again for ten years. He may have stepped aside after the 1731 fracas but it is more likely that he terminated his Duke of Richmond's XI after he broke his leg in 1733 and could no longer play himself.<ref name=\"TJMlxi\">McCann, p. lxi.</ref> Instead, he channelled his enthusiasm for cricket through a team from the small village of [[Slindon]], which bordered on his Goodwood estate.<ref name=\"TJMlxi\"/>\n\n===Slindon===\nThe rise to fame of [[Slindon Cricket Club]] was based on the play of [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Richard Newland]] and the patronage of Richmond. On Thursday, 9 July 1741, in a letter to her husband, the Duchess of Richmond mentions a conversation with John Newland regarding a Slindon v. East Dean match at Long Down, near Eartham, a week earlier. This is the earliest recorded mention of any of the Newland family.<ref>McCann, p. 19.</ref> Then, on 28 July, Richmond sent two letters to the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Duke of Newcastle]] to tell him about a game that day which had resulted in a brawl with \"hearty blows\" and \"broken heads\". The game was at Portslade between Slindon, who won, and unnamed opponents.<ref>McCann, p. 20.</ref>\n\nOn Monday 7 September 1741, Slindon played [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] at [[Merrow Down]], near Guildford. Richmond, in a letter to the Duke of Newcastle before the game, spoke of \"poor little Slyndon against almost your whole county of Surrey\". Next day he wrote again, saying that \"wee (''sic'') have beat Surrey almost in one innings\".<ref>McCann, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nThe Duchess wrote to him on Wednesday 9 September and said she \"wish'd..... that the Sussex mobb (''sic'') had thrash'd the Surrey mob\". She had \"a grudge to those fellows ever since they mob'd you\" (apparently a reference to the [[Richmond Green]] fiasco in August 1731). She then said she wished the Duke \"had won more of their moneys\".<ref>McCann, p. 21.</ref>\n\nIn 1744, Richmond created what is now the world's oldest known [[Scoring (cricket)|scorecard]] for the match between [[London Cricket Club|London]] and Slindon at the [[Artillery Ground]] on 2 June. Slindon won by 55 runs and the original scorecard is now among Richmond's papers in the possession of the West Sussex Records Office.<ref name=\"CA44\">{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/98/98236.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=London v. Slindon, 1744 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1745, Richmond backed a Sussex XI against Surrey in a match at Berry Hill, near [[Arundel]]. It appears that Surrey won the game in view of a comment made by [[Lord John Philip Sackville]] in a letter to Richmond dated Saturday 14 September: \"I wish you had let Ridgeway play instead of your stopper behind it might have turned the match in our favour\".<ref>McCann, pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\n===Single wicket===\nWhen [[single wicket]] became the dominant form of cricket in the late 1740s, Richmond entered a number of teams mostly centred on [[Stephen Dingate]], who was in his employ at the time. For example, a number of matches were played by a \"threes\" team of Dingate, Joseph Rudd and Pye. Richmond often found himself opposed by his former groom [[Thomas Waymark]], still an outstanding player but now resident in Berkshire.<ref>Ashley-Cooper, ''At the Sign of the Wicket'', p. 52.</ref>\n\nRichmond died on 8 August 1750. He had been arguably the greatest of the game's early patrons, particularly of the Slindon club and of Sussex cricket in general. His death was followed by a slump in the fortunes of Sussex cricket, which featured few matches of significance until the rise of [[Brighton Cricket Club]] in the 1790s.\n\n==Career in the peerage==\nRichmond held many titles, including the [[Order of the Garter]] (KG), [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB), [[Privy Counsellor]] (PC) and [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS). In 1734 he succeeded to the title of [[Duke of Aubigny]] in France on the death of his grandmother [[Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Richmond, Earls and Dukes of|volume=23|page=306|first=Ronald John|last=McNeill|authorlink=Ronald McNeill, 1st Baron Cushendun}}</ref>\n\nHe served as [[Lord of the Bedchamber]] to [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] from 1727 and, in 1735, he was appointed [[Master of the Horse]].\n\n==Freemasonry==\nHe was admitted a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 1724.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lennox,_Charles_(1701-1750)_(DNB00) Wikisource DNB]</ref> Later that year, he followed his father, the 1st Duke, into [[freemasonry]] and was a [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] in 1724, a few years after its formation in 1717. His father had been a [[Masonic ritual and symbolism#The purpose of Masonic ritual|Master Mason]] in [[Chichester]] in 1696.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; Was a member of the nobility an artisan operative mason, as the freemason degree was not yet written?|date=July 2018}}\n\nAs [[Duke of Aubigny]], he also assisted in introducing freemasonry into France. In 1734, he created a [[masonic lodge]] in the Chateau d'Aubigny neart [[Metz]] in north-east France. One a year later, with another past Grand Master, [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], he assisted in inaugurating a lodge in the hotel at Rue Bussy, in Paris.<ref>Audrey T. Carpenter, ''John Theophilus Desaguliers: A Natural Philosopher, Engineer and Freemason in Newtonian England'', Continuum, 2011, pp199-207</ref>\n\n==Civic roles==\nHe was elected [[Mayor of Chichester]] for 1735\u201336.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://chichestercity.gov.uk/abd/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/List-of-Mayors.pdf|title= Chichester City Council List of Mayors|publisher= Chichester City Council|accessdate= 8 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nRichmond was one of the founding Governors of London's [[Foundling Hospital]], which received its [[Royal Charter]] from George II in 1739. The Foundling Hospital was a charity dedicated to saving London's [[child abandonment|abandoned children]]. Both the Duke and the Duchess took great interest in the project. The Duke attended committee meetings and both took part in the [[baptism]] and naming of the first children accepted by the hospital in March 1741.\n\n==Military career==\nRichmond was a [[Lieutenant-General]] in the British Army and served under the notorious [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] in the Hanoverian campaign against the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].\n\n==Smuggling==\nThe 1740s was a turbulent time for Sussex. There was a rise in smuggling gangs; of these probably, the most violent was the notorious [[Hawkhurst Gang]].<ref name=mac185>McGlynn, pp. 185\u2013189</ref>\n\nThe gang were responsible for the brutal murder of a bootmaker and a customs official.<ref name=waugh143>Waugh, p.143</ref> Richmond decided to pursue those responsible with a vengeance. He began by petitioning the authorities so that a special [[Assizes (England and Wales)|assize]] could be held at Chichester.<ref>Dyndor Z.

However although his campaign managed to reduce the incidence of smuggling it was reported by the writer [[Horace Walpole]], in 1752 (after Richmond's death) that Sussex was \"stiff\" with smugglers.<ref name=mac185 />\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nRichmond married [[Sarah Lennox, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox|Lady Sarah Cadogan]] (1705\u20131751), daughter of [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan]], on 4 December 1719 at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].

He was the son of [[Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond|Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox]], the yougest of the seven illegitimate sons of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. He was the most important of the early [[patronage|patrons]] of the game of [[cricket]] and did much to help its evolution from [[village cricket]] to [[first-class cricket]].\n\n==Early life==\nLennox was styled [[Earl of March]] from his birth in 1701 as heir to his father's dukedom.<ref>Marshall, p. 1.</ref>  He also inherited his father's love of sports, particularly [[cricket]].<ref>Marshall, pp. 7\u201317.</ref>  He had a serious accident at the age of 12 when he was thrown from a horse during a hunt, but he recovered and it did not deter him from horsemanship.<ref>Marshall, pp. 18\u201320.</ref>\n\nMarch entered into an arranged marriage in December 1719 when he was still only 18 and his bride, [[Sarah Lennox, Duchess of Richmond|Hon. Sarah Cadogan]], was just 13, in order to use Sarah's large dowry to pay his considerable debts.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} They were married at [[The Hague]].<ref>Marshall, pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\nIn 1722, March became [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chichester (UK Parliament constituency)|Chichester]] as first member with Sir Thomas Miller as his second. He gave up his seat after his father died in May 1723 and he succeeded to the title of 2nd Duke of Richmond. A feature of Richmond's career was the support he received from his wife, Sarah, her interest being evident in surviving letters. Their marriage was a great success, especially by Georgian standards.\n\nTheir grandson who became the 4th Duke is known to cricket history as the [[Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond|Hon. Col. Charles Lennox]], a noted amateur batsman of the late 18th century who was one of [[Thomas Lord]]'s main guarantors when he established his [[Lord's Old Ground|new ground]] in [[Marylebone]].<ref>Altham, p. 51.</ref>\n\n==Cricket career==\n===The Duke of Richmond's XI===\n{{Infobox cricketer\n| name = Charles Lennox\n| image = \n| country = England\n| fullname = Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond\n| nickname =\n| birth_date = {{Birth date|1701|5|18|df=yes}}\n| birth_place = [[Goodwood, West Sussex|Goodwood]], [[West Sussex]], England\n| death_date = {{Death date and age|1750|8|8|1701|5|18|df=yes}}\n| death_place = [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]], England\n| batting = \n| bowling = \n| role = \n| club1 = [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]]\n| year1 = c.1720\u20131750\n| club2 =\n| year2 =\n| columns = \n| date = 17 July\n| year = 2009\n| source = John Marshall\n}}\n\nThe 2nd Duke of Richmond has been described as early cricket's greatest patron.<ref>Underdown, p. 53.</ref> Although he had played cricket as a boy, his real involvement began after he succeeded to the dukedom.<ref>Birley, p. 18.</ref> He captained his own team and his players included some of the earliest known professionals, such as his groom [[Thomas Waymark]]. Later, when he patronised [[Slindon Cricket Club]], Richmond was associated with the [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Newland brothers]]. His earliest recorded match is the one against [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage's XI]] on 20 July 1725, which is mentioned in a surviving letter from Sir William to the Duke.<ref>McCann, p. 4</ref><ref>Marshall, p. 41.</ref>\n\nRecords have survived of four matches played by Richmond's team in the [[1727 English cricket season|1727 season]]. Two were against Gage's XI and two against an XI raised by the [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] patron [[Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton|Alan Brodrick]].<ref>McCann, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> These last two games are highly significant because Richmond and Brodrick drew up [[Articles of Agreement (cricket)|Articles of Agreement]] beforehand to determine the rules that must apply in their contests. These were itemised in sixteen points.<ref>Birley, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> It is believed that this was the first time that rules (or some part of the rules as in this case) were formally agreed, although rules as such definitely existed. The first full codification of the [[Laws of Cricket]] was done in 1744. In early times, the rules would be agreed upon orally and were subject to local variations; this syndrome was also evident in [[association football|football]] until [[the FA]] was founded, especially regarding the question of handling the ball. Essentially the articles of agreement focused on residential qualifications and ensuring that there was no dissent by any player other than the two captains.<ref>Birley, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn 1728, Richmond's Sussex played twice against [[Edwin Stead]]'s [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] and lost both matches, \"(Kent's) men have been too expert for those of Sussex\".<ref>Waghorn, p. 7.</ref> In 1730, Richmond's team played two matches against Gage's XI and another match against a Surrey XI backed by a Mr Andrews of Sunbury. Richmond lost to Andrews.<ref>Waghorn, p. 1.</ref> The second of his matches against Gage, due to be played at [[The Dripping Pan]], near [[Lewes]], was \"put off on account of Waymark, the Duke's man, being ill\".<ref>Waghorn, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\nIn 1731, Richmond was involved in one of the most controversial matches recorded in the early history of cricket. On 16 August, his Sussex team played a Middlesex XI backed by one Thomas Chambers at an unspecified venue in Chichester. Chambers' team won this match, which had a prize of 100 guineas, and a return was arranged to take place at [[Richmond Green]] on 23 August.<ref>Buckley, p. 6.</ref> The return match was played for 200 guineas and it is notable as the earliest match of which the team scores are known: Richmond's XI 79, Chambers' XI 119; Richmond's XI 72, Chambers' XI 23\u20135 (approx.). The game ended promptly at a pre-agreed time although Chambers' XI with \"four or five more to have come in\" and needing \"about 8 to 10 notches\" clearly had the upper hand. The end result caused a fracas among the crowd at Richmond Green, who were incensed by the prompt finish because the Duke of Richmond had arrived late and delayed the start of the game. The riot resulted in some of the Sussex players \"having the shirts torn off their backs\" and it was said \"a law suit would commence about the play\".<ref>McCann, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> In a note about another match involving Chambers' XI in September, [[G. B. Buckley]] has recorded that Richmond may have conceded the result to Chambers, presumably to stop the threat of litigation.<ref>Buckley, p. 7.</ref>\n\nRichmond is not mentioned in cricket sources again for ten years. He may have stepped aside after the 1731 fracas but it is more likely that he terminated his Duke of Richmond's XI after he broke his leg in 1733 and could no longer play himself.<ref name=\"TJMlxi\">McCann, p. lxi.</ref> Instead, he channelled his enthusiasm for cricket through a team from the small village of [[Slindon]], which bordered on his Goodwood estate.<ref name=\"TJMlxi\"/>\n\n===Slindon===\nThe rise to fame of [[Slindon Cricket Club]] was based on the play of [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Richard Newland]] and the patronage of Richmond. On Thursday, 9 July 1741, in a letter to her husband, the Duchess of Richmond mentions a conversation with John Newland regarding a Slindon v. East Dean match at Long Down, near Eartham, a week earlier. This is the earliest recorded mention of any of the Newland family.<ref>McCann, p. 19.</ref> Then, on 28 July, Richmond sent two letters to the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Duke of Newcastle]] to tell him about a game that day which had resulted in a brawl with \"hearty blows\" and \"broken heads\". The game was at Portslade between Slindon, who won, and unnamed opponents.<ref>McCann, p. 20.</ref>\n\nOn Monday 7 September 1741, Slindon played [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] at [[Merrow Down]], near Guildford. Richmond, in a letter to the Duke of Newcastle before the game, spoke of \"poor little Slyndon against almost your whole county of Surrey\". Next day he wrote again, saying that \"wee (''sic'') have beat Surrey almost in one innings\".<ref>McCann, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nThe Duchess wrote to him on Wednesday 9 September and said she \"wish'd..... that the Sussex mobb (''sic'') had thrash'd the Surrey mob\". She had \"a grudge to those fellows ever since they mob'd you\" (apparently a reference to the [[Richmond Green]] fiasco in August 1731). She then said she wished the Duke \"had won more of their moneys\".<ref>McCann, p. 21.</ref>\n\nIn 1744, Richmond created what is now the world's oldest known [[Scoring (cricket)|scorecard]] for the match between [[London Cricket Club|London]] and Slindon at the [[Artillery Ground]] on 2 June. Slindon won by 55 runs and the original scorecard is now among Richmond's papers in the possession of the West Sussex Records Office.<ref name=\"CA44\">{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/98/98236.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=London v. Slindon, 1744 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1745, Richmond backed a Sussex XI against Surrey in a match at Berry Hill, near [[Arundel]]. It appears that Surrey won the game in view of a comment made by [[Lord John Philip Sackville]] in a letter to Richmond dated Saturday 14 September: \"I wish you had let Ridgeway play instead of your stopper behind it might have turned the match in our favour\".<ref>McCann, pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\n\n===Single wicket===\nWhen [[single wicket]] became the dominant form of cricket in the late 1740s, Richmond entered a number of teams mostly centred on [[Stephen Dingate]], who was in his employ at the time. For example, a number of matches were played by a \"threes\" team of Dingate, Joseph Rudd and Pye. Richmond often found himself opposed by his former groom [[Thomas Waymark]], still an outstanding player but now resident in Berkshire.<ref>Ashley-Cooper, ''At the Sign of the Wicket'', p. 52.</ref>\n\nRichmond died on 8 August 1750. He had been arguably the greatest of the game's early patrons, particularly of the Slindon club and of Sussex cricket in general. His death was followed by a slump in the fortunes of Sussex cricket, which featured few matches of significance until the rise of [[Brighton Cricket Club]] in the 1790s.\n\n==Career in the peerage==\nRichmond held many titles, including the [[Order of the Garter]] (KG), [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB), [[Privy Counsellor]] (PC) and [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS). In 1734 he succeeded to the title of [[Duke of Aubigny]] in France on the death of his grandmother [[Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Richmond, Earls and Dukes of|volume=23|page=306|first=Ronald John|last=McNeill|authorlink=Ronald McNeill, 1st Baron Cushendun}}</ref>\n\nHe served as [[Lord of the Bedchamber]] to [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] from 1727 and, in 1735, he was appointed [[Master of the Horse]].\n\n==Freemasonry==\nHe was admitted a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 1724.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lennox,_Charles_(1701-1750)_(DNB00) Wikisource DNB]</ref> Later that year, he followed his father, the 1st Duke, into [[freemasonry]] and was a [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] in 1724, a few years after its formation in 1717. His father had been a [[Masonic ritual and symbolism#The purpose of Masonic ritual|Master Mason]] in [[Chichester]] in 1696.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; Was a member of the nobility an artisan operative mason, as the freemason degree was not yet written?|date=July 2018}}\n\nAs [[Duke of Aubigny]], he also assisted in introducing freemasonry into France. In 1734, he created a [[masonic lodge]] in the Chateau d'Aubigny neart [[Metz]] in north-east France. One a year later, with another past Grand Master, [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], he assisted in inaugurating a lodge in the hotel at Rue Bussy, in Paris.<ref>Audrey T. Carpenter, ''John Theophilus Desaguliers: A Natural Philosopher, Engineer and Freemason in Newtonian England'', Continuum, 2011, pp199-207</ref>\n\n==Civic roles==\nHe was elected [[Mayor of Chichester]] for 1735\u201336.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://chichestercity.gov.uk/abd/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/List-of-Mayors.pdf|title= Chichester City Council List of Mayors|publisher= Chichester City Council|accessdate= 8 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nRichmond was one of the founding Governors of London's [[Foundling Hospital]], which received its [[Royal Charter]] from George II in 1739. The Foundling Hospital was a charity dedicated to saving London's [[child abandonment|abandoned children]]. Both the Duke and the Duchess took great interest in the project. The Duke attended committee meetings and both took part in the [[baptism]] and naming of the first children accepted by the hospital in March 1741.\n\n==Military career==\nRichmond was a [[Lieutenant-General]] in the British Army and served under the notorious [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] in the Hanoverian campaign against the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].\n\n==Smuggling==\nThe 1740s was a turbulent time for Sussex. There was a rise in smuggling gangs; of these probably, the most violent was the notorious [[Hawkhurst Gang]].<ref name=mac185>McGlynn, pp. 185\u2013189</ref>\n\nThe gang were responsible for the brutal murder of a bootmaker and a customs official.<ref name=waugh143>Waugh, p.143</ref> Richmond decided to pursue those responsible with a vengeance. He began by petitioning the authorities so that a special [[Assizes (England and Wales)|assize]] could be held at Chichester.<ref>Dyndor Z.
