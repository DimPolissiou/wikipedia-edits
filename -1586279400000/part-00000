The main sensory modalities can be described on the basis of how each is transduced. Listing all the different sensory modalities, which can number as many as 17, involves separating the major senses into more specific categories, or submodalities, of the larger sense. An individual sensory modality represents the sensation of a specific type of stimulus. For example, the general sensation and perception of touch, which is known as somatosensation, can be separated into light pressure, deep pressure, vibration, itch, pain, temperature, or hair movement, while the general sensation and perception of taste can be separated into submodalities of [[sweet]], [[Saltiness|salty]], [[sour]], [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]], and [[umami]], all of which are based on different chemicals binding to [[sensory neuron]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24|title=Anatomy and Physiology|publisher=Rice University (OpenStax)|date=2016-02-26|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Receptors ===\n{{Main|Sensory receptor}}\nSensory receptors are the cells or structures that detect sensations. [[Stimulus (physiology)|Stimuli]] in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the [[peripheral nervous system]]. During transduction, physical stimulus is converted into [[action potential]] by receptors and transmitted towards the [[central nervous system]] for processing.<ref name=\"mcb\" /> Different types of stimuli are sensed by different types of [[Sensory neuron|receptor cells]]. Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of three different criteria: [[Sensory neuron|cell type]], position, and function. Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell type and their position in relation to stimuli they sense. Receptors can further be classified functionally on the basis of the [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]] of stimuli, or how the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell [[membrane potential]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Structural receptor types ====\n\n===== Location =====\nOne way to classify receptors is based on their location relative to the stimuli. An [[Exteroception|exteroceptor]] is a receptor that is located near a stimulus of the external environment, such as the somatosensory receptors that are located in the skin. An [[Interoception|interoceptor]] is one that interprets stimuli from internal organs and tissues, such as the receptors that sense the increase in blood pressure in the [[aorta]] or [[carotid sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== Cell type =====\nThe cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a [[neuron]] that has a [[free nerve ending]], with [[dendrite]]s embedded in tissue that would receive a sensation; (2) a neuron that has an encapsulated ending in which the sensory nerve endings are encapsulated in [[connective tissue]] that enhances their sensitivity; or (3) a specialized [[Sensory neuron|receptor cell]], which has distinct structural components that interpret a specific type of stimulus. The [[Nociceptor|pain]] and [[Thermoreceptor|temperature receptors]] in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve endings (1). Also located in the dermis of the skin are [[Pacinian corpuscle|lamellated corpuscles]], neurons with encapsulated nerve endings that respond to pressure and touch (2). The cells in the retina that respond to light stimuli are an example of a specialized receptor (3), a [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA [[transmembrane protein]] receptor is a protein in the [[cell membrane]] that mediates a physiological change in a neuron, most often through the opening of [[ion channel]]s or changes in the [[cell signaling]] processes. Transmembrane receptors are activated by chemicals called [[ligand]]s. For example, a molecule in food can serve as a ligand for taste receptors. Other transmembrane proteins, which are not accurately called receptors, are sensitive to mechanical or thermal changes. Physical changes in these proteins increase ion flow across the membrane, and can generate an [[action potential]] or a [[graded potential]] in the [[sensory neuron]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Functional receptor types ====\nA third classification of receptors is by how the receptor [[Transduction (physiology)|transduces]] stimuli into [[membrane potential]] changes. Stimuli are of three general types. Some stimuli are ions and [[macromolecule]]s that affect transmembrane receptor proteins when these chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane. Some stimuli are physical variations in the environment that affect receptor cell membrane potentials. Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from visible light. For humans, the only electromagnetic energy that is perceived by our eyes is visible light. Some other organisms have receptors that humans lack, such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of bees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nReceptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce. The different types of functional receptor cell types are [[mechanoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s, [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]], [[chemoreceptor]]s ([[osmoreceptor]]), [[thermoreceptor]]s, and [[nociceptor]]s. Physical stimuli, such as pressure and vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a mechanoreceptor.  Photoreceptors convert light (visible [[electromagnetic radiation]]) into signals. Chemical stimuli can be interpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an object's taste or smell, while osmoreceptors respond to a chemical solute concentrations of body fluids. Nociception (pain) interprets the presence of tissue damage, from sensory information from mechano-, chemo-, and thermoreceptors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of neural science|date=1991|publisher=Appleton & Lange|others=Kandel, Eric R., Schwartz, James H.

This minimum amount of stimulus is called the absolute threshold.<ref name=\"pri\" /> The absolute threshold is defined as the minimum amount of stimulation necessary for the detection of a stimulus 50% of the time.<ref name=\"wol\">{{cite book|last1=Wolfe|first1=Jeremy|title=Sensation & perception|last2=Kluender|first2=Keith|last3=Levi|first3=Dennis|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=978-0-87893-572-7|edition=3rd|page=7|year=2012}}</ref> Absolute threshold is measured by using a method called [[signal detection]]. This process involves presenting stimuli of varying intensities to a subject in order to determine the level at which the subject can reliably detect stimulation in a given sense.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n\n==== Differential threshold ====\n{{Main|Differential threshold}}\nDifferential threshold or just noticeable difference (JDS) is the smallest detectable difference between two stimuli, or the smallest difference in stimuli that can be judged to be different from each other.<ref name=\"wol\" /> [[Weber's Law]] is an empirical law that states that the difference threshold is a constant fraction of the comparison stimulus.<ref name=\"wol\" /> According to Weber's Law, bigger stimuli require larger differences to be noticed.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n[[File:Power_exponents_and_Steven's_Power_Law.svg|thumb|Human power exponents and Steven&#x27;s Power Law]]\n[[Psychophysics#Magnitude estimation|Magnitude estimation]] is a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] method in which subjects assign perceived values of given stimuli. The relationship between stimulus intensity and perceptive intensity is described by [[Steven's power law]].<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Signal detection theory ===\n{{Main|Signal detection theory}}\nSignal detection theory quantifies the experience of the subject to the presentation of a stimulus in the presence of [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]]. There is internal noise and there is external noise when it comes to signal detection. The internal noise originates from static in the nervous system. For example, an individual with closed eyes in a dark room still sees something - a blotchy pattern of grey with intermittent brighter flashes -, this is internal noise. External noise is the result of noise in the environment that can interfere with the detection of the stimulus of interest. Noise is only a problem if the magnitude of the noise is large enough to interfere with signal collection. The [[nervous system]] calculates a criterion, or an internal threshold, for the detection of a signal in the presence of noise. If a signal is judged to be above the criterion, thus the signal is differentiated from the noise, the signal is sensed and perceived. Errors in signal detection can potentially lead to [[false positives and false negatives]]. The sensory criterion might be shifted based on the importance of the detecting the signal. Shifting of the criterion may influence the likelihood of false positives and false negatives.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Private perceptive experience ===\n{{Main|Qualia}}\nSubjective visual and auditory experiences appear to be similar across humans subjects. The same cannot be said about taste. For example, there is a molecule called [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP) that some humans experience as bitter, some as almost tasteless, while others experience it as somewhere between tasteless and bitter. There is a genetic basis for this difference between perception given the same sensory stimulus. This subjective difference in taste perception has implications for individuals' food preferences, and consequently, health.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Sensory adaptation ===\n{{Main|Sensory adaptation}}\nWhen a stimulus is constant and unchanging, perceptual sensory adaptation occurs. During this process, the subject becomes less sensitive to the stimulus.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n\n=== Fourier analysis ===\n{{Main|Fourier analysis}}\nBiological auditory (hearing), vestibular and spatial, and visual systems (vision) appear to break down real-world complex stimuli into [[sine wave]] components, through the mathematical process called Fourier analysis. Many neurons have a strong preference for certain sine [[frequency]] components in contrast to others. The way that simpler sounds and images are [[Code|encoded]] during sensation can provide insight into how perception of real-world objects happens.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Sensory neuroscience and the biology of perception ===\n{{Main|Sensory neuroscience}}\nPerception occurs when [[nerve]]s that lead from the [[Sensory nervous system|sensory organs]] (e.g. eye) to the brain are stimulated, even if that stimulation is unrelated to the target signal of the sensory organ. For example, in the case of the eye, it does not matter whether light or something else stimulates the optic nerve, that stimulation will results in visual perception, even if there was no visual stimulus to begin with. (To prove this point to yourself (and if you are a human), close your eyes (preferably in a dark room) and press gently on the outside corner of one eye through the eyelid. You will see a visual spot toward the inside of your visual field, near your nose.)<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n==== Sensory nervous system ====\n{{Main|Sensory nervous system}}\nAll stimuli received by the [[Sensory neuron|receptors]] are [[Transduction (physiology)|transduced]] to an [[action potential]], which is carried along one or more afferent [[neuron]]<nowiki/>s towards a specific area ([[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]) of the [[brain]]. Just as different nerves are dedicated to sensory and motors tasks, different areas of the brain (cortices) are similarly dedicated to different [[Sensory cortex|sensory]] and [[Perception|perceptual]] tasks. More complex processing is accomplished across primary cortical regions that spread beyond the primary cortices. Every nerve, [[Sensory nerve|sensory]] or [[Motor nerve|motor]], has its own signal transmission speed. For example, nerves in the frog's legs have a 90&nbsp;ft/s (99&nbsp;km/h) signal transmission speed, while sensory nerves in humans, transmit sensory information at speeds between 165&nbsp;ft/s (181&nbsp;km/h) and 330&nbsp;ft/s (362&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"wol\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The [[human]] external sensory and perceptual system<ref name=\"wol\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n![[Stimulus (physiology)|Physical stimulus]]\n!Sensory organ\n![[Sensory receptor]]\n![[Sensory system]]\n![[Cranial nerves|Cranial nerve(s)]]\n![[Cerebral cortex]]\n!Primary associated [[Perception|perception(s]])\n!Name\n|-\n|[[Light]]\n|[[Human eye|Eyes]]\n|[[Photoreceptor cell|Photoreceptor]]\n|[[Visual system]]\n|[[Optic (II) nerve|Optic (II)]]\n|[[Visual cortex]]\n|[[Visual perception]]\n|[[Visual perception|Vision]]\n|-\n|[[Sound]]\n|[[Ear]]s\n|[[Mechanoreceptor]]\n|[[Auditory system]]\n|[[Vestibulocochlear nerve|Vestibulocochlear (VIII)]]\n|[[Auditory cortex]]\n|[[Auditory perception]]\n|[[Hearing|Hearing (audition)]]\n|-\n|[[Gravity]] and [[acceleration]]\n|[[Inner ear]]\n|Mechanoreceptor\n|[[Vestibular system]]\n|Vestibulocochlear (VIII)\n|[[Vestibular cortex]]\n|[[Equilibrioception]]\n|[[Balance (ability)|Balance (equilibrium)]] \n|-\n|[[Chemical substance]]\n|[[Human nose|Nose]]\n|[[Chemoreceptor]]\n|[[Olfactory system]]\n|[[Olfactory nerve|Olfactory (I)]]\n|[[Olfactory cortex]]\n|[[Olfactory perception]], Gustatory perception (taste or flavor)<ref>Small DM, Green BG.

Multimodality integrates different senses into one unified perceptual experience. Information from one sense has the potential to influence how information from another is perceived.<ref name=\"pri\" /> Multimodal perception is qualitatively different from unimodal perception. There has been a growing body of evidence since the mid-1990s on the neural correlates of multimodal perception.<ref name=\"cal\">Calvert, G.A., Hansen, P.C., Iversen, S.D. and Brammer, M.J., 2001.

(1946-2004).|title=Biology|date=cop. 2005|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0-321-26984-5|oclc=904492777}}</ref> Human external sensation is based on the sensory organs of the [[Human eye|eyes]], [[Human ear|ears]], [[Human skin|skin]], [[vestibular system]], [[Human nose|nose]], and [[Human mouth|mouth]], which contribute, respectively, to the sensory [[perception]]s of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[hearing]], [[touch]], [[Equilibrioception|spatial orientation]], [[Olfaction|smell]], and [[Flavor|taste]]. Smell and taste are both responsible for identifying molecules and thus both are types of [[chemoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s. Both olfaction (smell) and gustation (taste) require the transduction of chemical stimuli into electrical potentials.<ref name=\"pri\" /><ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n==== Visual system (vision) ====\n{{Main|Visual system}}\nThe visual system, or sense of sight, is based on the transduction of light stimuli received through the eyes and contributes to [[visual perception]]. The visual system detects [[light]] on [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] in the [[retina]] of each eye that generates electrical [[Action potential|nerve impulses]] for the perception of varying colors and brightness. There are two types of photoreceptors: [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]]. Rods are very sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors. Cones distinguish colors but are less sensitive to dim light.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the molecular level, visual stimuli cause changes in the photopigment molecule that lead to changes in membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell. A single unit of light is called a [[photon]], which is described in physics as a packet of energy with properties of both a particle and a wave. The [[energy]] of a photon is represented by its [[wavelength]], with each wavelength of visible light corresponding to a particular [[color]]. Visible light is [[electromagnetic radiation]] with a wavelength between 380 and 720&nbsp;nm. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation longer than 720&nbsp;nm fall into the [[infrared]] range, whereas wavelengths shorter than 380&nbsp;nm fall into the [[ultraviolet]] range. Light with a wavelength of 380&nbsp;nm is [[blue]] whereas light with a wavelength of 720&nbsp;nm is dark [[red]]. All other colors fall between red and blue at various points along the wavelength scale.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe three types of cone [[opsin]]<nowiki/>s, being sensitive to different wavelengths of light, provide us with color vision. By comparing the activity of the three different cones, the brain can extract color information from visual stimuli. For example, a bright blue light that has a wavelength of approximately 450&nbsp;nm would activate the \u201cred\u201d cones minimally, the \u201cgreen\u201d cones marginally, and the \u201cblue\u201d cones predominantly. The relative activation of the three different cones is calculated by the brain, which perceives the color as blue. However, cones cannot react to low-intensity light, and rods do not sense the color of light. Therefore, our low-light vision is\u2014in essence\u2014in [[grayscale]]. In other words, in a dark room, everything appears as a shade of [[Grey|gray]]. If you think that you can see colors in the dark, it is most likely because your brain knows what color something is and is relying on that memory.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere is some disagreement as to whether the visual system consists of one, two, or thre submodalities. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two submodalities, given that different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} that [[stereopsis]], the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the [[visual cortex]] of the brain where patterns and objects in [[Real image|images]] are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.\n\nThe inability to see is called [[blindness]]. Blindness may result from damage to the eyeball, especially to the retina, damage to the optic nerve that connects each eye to the brain, and/or from [[stroke]] ([[infarct]]s in the brain).  Temporary or permanent blindness can be caused by poisons or medications. People who are blind from degradation or damage to the visual cortex, but still have functional eyes, are actually capable of some level of vision and reaction to visual stimuli but not a conscious perception; this is known as [[blindsight]]. People with blindsight are usually not aware that they are reacting to visual sources, and instead just unconsciously adapt their behavior to the stimulus.\n\nOn February 14, 2013 researchers developed a [[neural implant]] that gives [[rat]]s the ability to sense [[infrared]] light which for the first time provides [[living creatures]] with new abilities, instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities.<ref>{{cite journal|date=14 February 2013|title=Implant gives rats sixth sense for infrared light|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/14/implant-gives-rats-sixth-sense-for-infrared-light|journal=Wired UK|access-date=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Auditory system (hearing) ====\n{{Main|Auditory system}}\nHearing, or audition, is the transduction of [[sound waves]] into a neural signal that is made possible by the structures of the [[ear]]. The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known as the [[Auricle (anatomy)|auricle]]. At the end of the [[auditory canal]] is the tympanic membrane, or [[Eardrum|ear drum]], which vibrates after it is struck by sound waves. The auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane are often referred to as the [[external ear]]. The [[middle ear]] consists of a space spanned by three small bones called the [[ossicles]]. The three ossicles are the [[malleus]], [[incus]], and [[stapes]], which are Latin names that roughly translate to hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus. The incus, in turn, articulates with the stapes. The stapes is then attached to the [[inner ear]], where the sound waves will be [[Transduction (physiology)|transduced]] into a neural signal. The middle ear is connected to the [[pharynx]] through the [[Eustachian tube]], which helps equilibrate air pressure across the tympanic membrane. The tube is normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of the pharynx contract during [[swallowing]] or [[yawn]]ing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that is the sense of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the [[inner ear]], which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000&nbsp;[[hertz]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing, Physics Factbook by Glenn Elert (ed)|date=|publisher=Hypertextbook.com|access-date=2014-04-05}}</ref> with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called [[deafness]] or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as [[Seismic communication|vibrations conducted through the body]] by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine the direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vicdeaf.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/Information%20Sheets/Deaf%20Culture%20and%20Communication%20-%20A%20Basic%20Guide.pdf|title=Deaf Culture and Communication: A Basic Guide|year=2010|work=Victorian Deaf Society}}</ref>\n\n==== Somatosensory system (touch) ====\n{{Main|Somatosensory system}}\nSomatosensation is considered a general sense, as opposed to the special senses discussed in this section. Somatosensation is the group of sensory modalities that are associated with touch and interoception. The modalities of sometosensation include [[pressure]], [[vibration]], light touch, [[Tickling|tickle]], [[itch]], [[temperature]], [[pain]], [[kinesthesia]].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Somatosensation]], also called [[tactition]]  (adjectival form: tactile) is a perception resulting from activation of neural [[Mechanoreceptor|receptors]], generally in the [[skin]] including [[hair follicle]]s, but also in the [[tongue]], [[throat]], and [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]]. A variety of [[pressure]] receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.).

[[Paresthesia]] is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or [[numbness]] of the skin that may result from nerve damage and may be permanent or temporary.\n\nTwo types of somatosensory signals that are transduced by [[free nerve ending]]s are pain and temperature. These two modalities use [[thermoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s and [[nociceptor]]s to transduce temperature and pain stimuli, respectively. Temperature receptors are stimulated when local temperatures differ from [[body temperature]]. Some thermoreceptors are sensitive to just cold and others to just heat. Nociception is the sensation of potentially damaging stimuli. Mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli beyond a set threshold will elicit painful sensations. Stressed or damaged tissues release chemicals that activate receptor proteins in the nociceptors. For example, the sensation of heat associated with spicy foods involves [[capsaicin]], the active molecule in hot peppers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLow frequency vibrations are sensed by mechanoreceptors called [[Merkel cell]]s, also known as type I cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Merkel cells are located in the [[stratum basale]] of the [[epidermis]]. Deep pressure and vibration is transduced by lamellated ([[Pacinian corpuscle|Pacinian]]) corpuscles, which are receptors with encapsulated endings found deep in the dermis, or subcutaneous tissue. Light touch is transduced by the encapsulated endings known as tactile ([[Meissner corpuscle|Meissner]]) corpuscles. Follicles are also wrapped in a [[plexus]] of nerve endings known as the hair follicle plexus. These nerve endings detect the movement of hair at the surface of the skin, such as when an insect may be walking along the [[skin]]. Stretching of the skin is transduced by stretch receptors known as [[bulbous corpuscle]]s. Bulbous corpuscles are also known as Ruffini corpuscles, or type II cutaneous mechanoreceptors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe heat receptors are sensitive to infrared radiation and can occur in specialized organs, for instance in [[pit vipers]]. The [[Thermoreceptor|thermoceptors]] in the skin are quite different from the [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] thermoceptors in the brain ([[POAH|hypothalamus]]), which provide feedback on internal body temperature.\n\n==== Vestibular system (balance) ====\n{{Main|Vestibular system}}\n\nThe vestibular sense, or sense of balance (equilibrium), is the sense that contributes to the perception of balance (equilibrium), spatial orientation, direction, or acceleration ([[equilibrioception]]). Along with audition, the [[inner ear]] is responsible for encoding information about equilibrium. A similar [[mechanoreceptor]]\u2014a hair cell with [[Stereocilia (inner ear)|stereocilia]]\u2014senses head position, head movement, and whether our bodies are in motion. These cells are located within the [[Vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] of the inner ear. Head position is sensed by the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[saccule]], whereas head movement is sensed by the [[semicircular canals]]. The neural signals generated in the [[vestibular ganglion]] are transmitted through the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] to the [[Brainstem|brain stem]] and [[cerebellum]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe semicircular canals are three ring-like extensions of the vestibule. One is oriented in the horizontal plane, whereas the other two are oriented in the vertical plane. The [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior]] and posterior vertical canals are oriented at approximately 45 degrees relative to the [[sagittal plane]]. The base of each semicircular canal, where it meets with the vestibule, connects to an enlarged region known as the [[Ampullary cupula|ampulla]]. The ampulla contains the hair cells that respond to rotational movement, such as turning the head while saying \u201cno.\u201d The stereocilia of these hair cells extend into the [[Ampullary cupula|cupula]], a membrane that attaches to the top of the ampulla. As the head rotates in a plane parallel to the semicircular canal, the fluid lags, deflecting the cupula in the direction opposite to the head movement. The semicircular canals contain several ampullae, with some oriented horizontally and others oriented vertically. By comparing the relative movements of both the horizontal and vertical ampullae, the vestibular system can detect  the direction of most head movements within three-dimensional ([[Three-dimensional space|3D]]) space.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[vestibular nerve]] conducts information from sensory receptors in three [[Osseous ampullae|ampulla]] that sense motion of fluid in three [[semicircular canal]]s caused by three-dimensional rotation of the head.  The vestibular nerve also conducts information from the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and the [[saccule]], which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend under the weight of [[otolith]]s (which are small crystals of [[calcium carbonate]]) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, linear acceleration, and the direction of gravitational force.\n\n==== Gustatory system (taste) ====\n{{Main|Gustatory system}}\nThe gustatory system or the sense of taste is the [[sensory system]] that is partially responsible for the [[perception]] of [[Flavor|taste (flavor)]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trivedi|first=Bijal P.|date=June 2012|title=Gustatory system: The finer points of taste|journal=Nature|volume=486|issue=7403|pages=S2\u2013S3|doi=10.1038/486s2a|pmid=22717400|bibcode=2012Natur.486S...2T|issn=0028-0836}}</ref>  A few recognized [[Stimulus modality|submodalities]] exist within taste: [[sweet]], [[Saltiness|salty]], [[sour]], [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]], and [[umami]]. Very recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste submodality for fats, or lipids.<ref name=\":0\" /> The sense of taste is often confused with the perception of flavor, which is the results of the [[multimodal integration]] of gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) sensations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray, M. M. (Micah M.), editor. Wallace, Mark T., editor.|title=The neural bases of multisensory processes|isbn=978-1-4398-1219-8|oclc=759160178|date=2011-08-25}}</ref> \n[[File:Philippe_Mercier_-_The_Sense_of_Taste_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|Philippe Mercier - The Sense of Taste - Google Art Project]]\nWithin the structure of the [[lingual papillae]] are [[taste bud]]s that contain specialized gustatory receptor cells for the [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]] of taste stimuli. These receptor cells are sensitive to the chemicals contained within foods that are ingested, and they release [[neurotransmitter]]s based on the amount of the chemical in the food. Neurotransmitters from the gustatory cells can activate [[sensory neuron]]s in the [[Facial nerve|facial]], [[Glossopharyngeal nerve|glossopharyngeal]], and [[Vagus nerve|vagus]] [[cranial nerves]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSalty and sour taste submodalities are triggered by the [[cations]] [[Na\u207a|Na+]] and [[Hydrogen ion|H+]], respectively. The other taste modalities result from food molecules binding to a [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein\u2013coupled receptor]]. A G protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to [[depolarization]] of the gustatory cell. The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of [[glucose]] (or [[sugar substitute]]s) dissolved in the [[saliva]]. Bitter taste is similar to sweet in that food molecules bind to G protein\u2013coupled receptors. The taste known as umami is often referred to as the savory taste. Like sweet and bitter, it is based on the activation of G protein\u2013coupled receptors by a specific molecule.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOnce the gustatory cells are activated by the taste molecules, they release [[neurotransmitter]]s onto the [[dendrite]]s of sensory neurons. These neurons are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, as well as a component within the vagus nerve dedicated to the [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]]. The facial nerve connects to taste buds in the anterior third of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve connects to taste buds in the posterior two thirds of the tongue. The vagus nerve connects to taste buds in the extreme posterior of the tongue, verging on the [[pharynx]], which are more sensitive to [[Noxious stimulus|noxious stimuli]] such as bitterness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFlavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called taste buds, or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue.

The inability to taste is called [[ageusia]].\n\n==== Olfactory system (smell) ====\n{{Main|Olfactory system}}\nLike the sense of taste, the sense of smell, or the olfactiory system, is also responsive to [[Chemical substance|chemical stimuli]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Unlike taste, there are hundreds of [[olfactory receptor]]<nowiki/>s (388 according to one source), each binding to a particular molecular feature. [[Odor|Odor molecules]] possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitatory signals from different receptors makes up what humans perceive as the molecule's smell.<ref name=\"Moonwalk\">{{cite web|url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/sense-of-smell-olfactory-receptors.html|title=A Sense of Smell: Olfactory Receptors|date=2007-01-09|work=Sandwalk|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe olfactory receptor neurons are located in a small region within the [[Nasal cavity|superior nasal cavity]]. This region is referred to as the [[olfactory epithelium]] and contains [[Bipolar neuron|bipolar sensory neurons]]. Each olfactory sensory neuron has [[dendrite]]s that extend from the [[apical surface]] of the [[epithelium]] into the [[mucus]] lining the cavity. As airborne molecules are inhaled through the [[Human nose|nose]], they pass over the olfactory epithelial region and dissolve into the mucus. These odorant molecules bind to proteins that keep them dissolved in the mucus and help transport them to the olfactory dendrites. The odorant\u2013protein complex binds to a receptor protein within the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite. These receptors are G protein\u2013coupled, and will produce a graded [[membrane potential]] in the [[Olfactory receptor neuron|olfactory neurons]].<ref name=\":0\" /> \n[[File:The_sense_of_smell_Philippe_Mercier.jpg|thumb|The sense of smell Bequest of [[Mrs E.G. Elgar]], 1945 [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].]]\nIn the [[Human brain|brain]], olfaction is processed by the [[olfactory cortex]]. Olfactory receptor neurons in the nose differ from most other neurons in that they die and regenerate on a regular basis. The inability to smell is called [[anosmia]]. Some neurons in the nose are specialized to detect [[pheromone]]s.<ref name=\"LiveScience\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/2737-surprising-impact-taste-smell.html|title=The Surprising Impact of Taste and Smell|work=LiveScience}}</ref> Loss of the sense of smell can result in food tasting bland. A person with an impaired sense of smell may require additional [[spice]] and [[seasoning]] levels for food to be tasted. Anosmia may also be related to some presentations of mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]], because the loss of enjoyment of food may lead to a general sense of despair. The ability of olfactory neurons to replace themselves decreases with age, leading to age-related anosmia. This explains why some elderly people salt their food more than younger people do.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\n{{Main|Interoception}}\n\n==== Proprioception ====\n\n[[Proprioception]], the kinesthetic sense, provides the [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]] of the brain with information on the movement and relative positions of the parts of the body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.<ref name=\"roblesdelatorre\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-IEEE-MM-2006.pdf|title=The Importance of the Sense of Touch in Virtual and Real Environments|work=International Society for Haptics|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Pain ====\n\n[[Nociception]] (physiological [[pain]]) signals nerve-damage or damage to tissue. The three types of pain receptors are cutaneous (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research in the first half of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]] of the brain.<ref name=\"Fulbright 2001\">{{cite journal|authors=Fulbright RK, Troche CJ, Skudlarski P, Gore JC, Wexler BE|date=November 2001|title=Functional MR imaging of regional brain activation associated with the affective experience of pain|journal=AJR.

For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts.

They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.\n\nBlind people report they are able to navigate and in some cases identify an object by interpreting reflected sounds (especially their own footsteps), a phenomenon known as [[human echolocation]].\n\n==== Electroreception ====\n[[Electroreception]] (or electroception) is the ability to detect [[electric field]]s. Several species of fish, [[shark]]s, and rays have the capacity to sense changes in electric fields in their immediate vicinity. For cartilaginous fish this occurs through a specialized organ called the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]]. Some fish passively sense changing nearby electric fields; some generate their own weak electric fields, and sense the pattern of field potentials over their body surface; and some use these electric field generating and sensing capacities for social [[communication]]. The mechanisms by which electroceptive fish construct a spatial representation from very small differences in field potentials involve comparisons of spike latencies from different parts of the fish's body.\n\nThe only orders of mammals that are known to demonstrate electroception are the [[dolphin]] and [[monotreme]] orders. Among these mammals, the [[platypus]]<ref name=\"Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus\">{{cite web|url=http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html|title=Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990209085517/http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html|archive-date=1999-02-09|access-date=}}</ref> has the most acute sense of electroception.\n\nA dolphin can detect electric fields in water using electroreceptors in [[Whisker|vibrissal crypts]] arrayed in pairs on its snout and which evolved from whisker motion sensors.<ref name=\"Drake 2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Drake|first1=Nadia|year=2011|title=Life: Dolphin can sense electric fields: Ability may help species track prey in murky waters|journal=Science News|volume=180|issue=5|pages=12|doi=10.1002/scin.5591800512|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> These electroreceptors can detect electric fields as weak as 4.6 microvolts per centimeter, such as those generated by contracting muscles and pumping gills of potential prey. This permits the dolphin to locate prey from the seafloor where sediment limits visibility and echolocation.\n\nSpiders have been shown to detect electric fields to determine a suitable time to extend web for 'ballooning'.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morley|first1=Erica|date=July 5, 2018|title=Electric Fields Elicit Ballooning in Spiders|journal=Current Biology|volume=28|issue=14|pages=2324\u20132330.e2|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2018.05.057|pmid=29983315|pmc=6065530}}</ref>\n\n[[Body modification]] enthusiasts have experimented with magnetic implants to attempt to replicate this sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/05/implant-gives-man-th.html|title=Implant gives man the sense of \"magnetic vision\"|access-date=2011-04-23}}</ref> However, in general humans (and it is presumed other mammals) can detect electric fields only indirectly by detecting the effect they have on hairs. An electrically charged balloon, for instance, will exert a force on human arm hairs, which can be felt through tactition and identified as coming from a static charge (and not from wind or the like). This is not electroreception, as it is a post-sensory cognitive action.\n\n==== Hygroreception ====\n[[Hygroreception]] is the ability to detect changes in the moisture content of the environment.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Enjin A, Zaharieva EE, Frank DD, Mansourian S, Suh GS, Gallio M, Stensmyr MC|date=May 2016|title=Humidity Sensing in Drosophila|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1352\u20138|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.03.049|pmc=5305172|pmid=27161501}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Tichy H, Kallina W|date=2013-01-16|title=The evaporative function of cockroach hygroreceptors|journal=PLOS One|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e53998|bibcode=2013PLoSO...853998T|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053998|pmc=3546976|pmid=23342058}}</ref>\n\n==== Infrared sensing ====\n{{Main|Infrared sensing in snakes}}\n\nThe ability to sense [[infrared]] thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of [[snakes]]. Essentially, it allows these reptiles to \"see\" radiant heat at [[wavelengths]] between 5 and 30 [[\u03bcm]] to a degree of accuracy such that a blind [[rattlesnake]] can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes.<ref>(Kardong & Mackessy 1991)</ref> It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that it may also be used in thermoregulatory decision making.<ref>(Krochmal et al. 2004)</ref> The facial pit underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[pitvipers]] and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[pythons]], having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.<ref>(Pough et al. 1992)</ref> The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[Loreal pit]]), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family [[Viperidae]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target [[Endotherm|endothermic]] prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision-making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain heat-sensing pits) cannot.\n\nIn spite of its detection of IR light, the pits' IR detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors \u2013 while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is in fact a temperature-sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than a chemical reaction to light.<ref name=\"Gracheva et al. 2010\">(Gracheva et al. 2010)</ref> This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original \"resting\" or \"inactive\" temperature.<ref name=\"Gracheva et al. 2010\" />\n\n==== Other ====\nPressure detection uses the organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in shape of the [[gas bladder]] to the middle ear. It can be used to regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the [[weather fish]] and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder.\n\nCurrent detection is a detection system of water currents, consisting mostly of [[Vortex|vortices]], found in the [[lateral line]] of fish and aquatic forms of amphibians. The lateral line is also sensitive to low-frequency vibrations. The mechanoreceptors are [[hair cell]]s, the same mechanoreceptors for vestibular sense and hearing. It is used primarily for navigation, hunting, and schooling. The receptors of the [[Electroception|electrical sense]] are modified hair cells of the lateral line system.\n\n[[Polarized light]] direction/detection is used by [[bees]] to orient themselves, especially on cloudy days. [[Cuttlefish]], some [[beetles]], and [[mantis shrimp]] can also perceive the polarization of light.  Most sighted humans can in fact learn to roughly detect large areas of polarization by an effect called [[Haidinger's brush]], however this is considered an [[entoptic phenomenon]] rather than a separate sense.\n\n[[Slit sensilla]]e of spiders detect mechanical strain in the exoskeleton, providing information on force and vibrations.\n\n== Plant sensation ==\nBy using a variety of sense receptors, plants sense light, temperature, humidity, chemical substances, chemical gradients, reorientation, magnetic fields, infections, tissue damage and mechanical pressure. The absence of a nervous system notwithstanding, plants interpret and respond to these stimuli by a variety of hormonal and cell-to-cell communication pathways that result in movement, morphological changes and physiological state alterations at the organism level, that is, result in plant behavior. Such physiological and cognitive functions are generally not believed to give rise to mental phenomena or qualia, however, as these are typically considered the product of nervous system activity. The emergence of mental phenomena from the activity of systems functionally or computationally analogous to that of nervous systems is, however, a hypothetical possibility explored by some schools of thought in the philosophy of mind field, such as [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[Computational theory of mind|computationalism]].\n\nHowever, plants could perceive the world around them,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170109-plants-can-see-hear-and-smell-and-respond|title=Earth - Plants can see, hear and smell \u2013 and respond|date=10 January 2017|website=BBC}}</ref> and might be able to emit airborne sounds similar to \"screaming\" when [[Stress (biology)|stressed]].

S. Lewis}}</ref> This traditional concept of five senses is common today.\n\nThe traditional five senses are enumerated as the \"five material faculties\" (''{{IAST|pa\u00f1canna\u1e43 indriy\u0101na\u1e43 avakanti}}'') in Hindu literature. They appear in allegorical representation as early as in the [[Katha Upanishad]] (roughly 6th century BC), as five horses drawing the \"[[chariot]]\" of the body, guided by the mind as \"chariot driver\".\n\nDepictions of the five traditional senses as [[allegory]] became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] and [[Flemish Baroque painter]]s. A typical example is [[G\u00e9rard de Lairesse]]'s ''Allegory of the Five Senses'' (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a [[convex mirror]], hearing is the [[cupid]]-like boy with a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], smell is represented by the girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and touch is represented by the woman holding the bird.\n\nIn [[Buddhist philosophy]], [[Ayatana]] or \"sense-base\" includes the mind as a sense organ, in addition to the traditional five. This addition to the commonly acknowledged senses may arise from the psychological orientation involved in Buddhist thought and practice. The mind considered by itself is seen as the principal gateway to a different spectrum of phenomena that differ from the physical sense data. This way of viewing the human sense system indicates the importance of internal sources of sensation and perception that complements our experience of the external world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aesthesis]]\n* [[Apperception]]\n* [[Attention]]\n* [[\u0100yatana]] (sense bases in Theravada Buddhism)\n* [[Chemesthesis]]\n* [[Empiricism]]\n* [[Extrasensory Perception]]\n* [[Entoptic phenomenon]]\n* Increased sensitivity:\n** [[Supertaster]]\n** [[Hyperesthesia]]\n** [[Hyperacusis]]\n* [[Illusion]]s\n** [[Auditory illusion]]\n** [[Optical illusion]]\n** [[Touch illusion]]\n* [[intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]]\n* [[Multisensory integration]]\n* [[Phantom limb]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[\u1e62a\u1e0d\u0101yatana|Sa\u1e37\u0101yatana]] and [[Ayatana]] (the six senses as a concept in [[Buddhism]])\n* [[Sensation and perception psychology]]\n* [[Sense of direction]]\n* [[Sensitivity (human)]]\n* [[Sensorium]]\n* [[Sensory processing disorder]]\n* [[Sensus divinitatis]]\n* [[Synesthesia]] ([[Ideasthesia]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|Senses}}\n{{Wikiversity|What is the sixth sense}}\n{{Commons category|Senses}}\n\n* The 2004 [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] ([http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/2004/index.html announced] 4 October 2004) was won by [[Richard Axel]] and [[Linda Buck]] for their work explaining olfaction, published first in a joint paper in 1991 that described the very large family of about one thousand genes for odorant receptors and how the receptors link to the brain.\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/32909/Sensing-or-feeling/ Answers to several questions related to senses and human feeling from curious kids]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070520084243/http://www.physpharm.fmd.uwo.ca/undergrad/sensesweb/ The Physiology of the Senses tutorial] 12 animated chapters on vision, hearing, touch, balance and memory.\n\n{{Sensory system}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Perception]]\n[[Category:Senses| ]]\n[[Category:Sensory systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the cognitive process of sensation||}}\n{{short description|Physiological capacity of organisms that provides data for perception}}\n[[File:SensoryProcessing.png|alt=|thumb|440x440px|Sensation consists of signal collection and transduction]]\nThe physical process during which [[Sensory nervous system|sensory systems]] respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and provide [[data]] for [[perception]] is called '''sensation'''.<ref name=\"wol\" /> During sensation, sense organs engage in stimulus collection and [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]].<ref name=\"pri\">Privitera, A.

The main sensory modalities can be described on the basis of how each is transduced. Listing all the different sensory modalities, which can number as many as 17, involves separating the major senses into more specific categories, or submodalities, of the larger sense. An individual sensory modality represents the sensation of a specific type of stimulus. For example, the general sensation and perception of touch, which is known as somatosensation, can be separated into light pressure, deep pressure, vibration, itch, pain, temperature, or hair movement, while the general sensation and perception of taste can be separated into submodalities of [[sweet]], [[Saltiness|salty]], [[sour]], [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]], and [[umami]], all of which are based on different chemicals binding to [[sensory neuron]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24|title=Anatomy and Physiology|publisher=Rice University (OpenStax)|date=2016-02-26|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Receptors ===\n{{Main|Sensory receptor}}\nSensory receptors are the cells or structures that detect sensations. [[Stimulus (physiology)|Stimuli]] in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the [[peripheral nervous system]]. During transduction, physical stimulus is converted into [[action potential]] by receptors and transmitted towards the [[central nervous system]] for processing.<ref name=\"mcb\" /> Different types of stimuli are sensed by different types of [[Sensory neuron|receptor cells]]. Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of three different criteria: [[Sensory neuron|cell type]], position, and function. Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell type and their position in relation to stimuli they sense. Receptors can further be classified functionally on the basis of the [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]] of stimuli, or how the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell [[membrane potential]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Structural receptor types ====\n\n===== Location =====\nOne way to classify receptors is based on their location relative to the stimuli. An [[Exteroception|exteroceptor]] is a receptor that is located near a stimulus of the external environment, such as the somatosensory receptors that are located in the skin. An [[Interoception|interoceptor]] is one that interprets stimuli from internal organs and tissues, such as the receptors that sense the increase in blood pressure in the [[aorta]] or [[carotid sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== Cell type =====\nThe cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a [[neuron]] that has a [[free nerve ending]], with [[dendrite]]s embedded in tissue that would receive a sensation; (2) a neuron that has an encapsulated ending in which the sensory nerve endings are encapsulated in [[connective tissue]] that enhances their sensitivity; or (3) a specialized [[Sensory neuron|receptor cell]], which has distinct structural components that interpret a specific type of stimulus. The [[Nociceptor|pain]] and [[Thermoreceptor|temperature receptors]] in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve endings (1). Also located in the dermis of the skin are [[Pacinian corpuscle|lamellated corpuscles]], neurons with encapsulated nerve endings that respond to pressure and touch (2). The cells in the retina that respond to light stimuli are an example of a specialized receptor (3), a [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA [[transmembrane protein]] receptor is a protein in the [[cell membrane]] that mediates a physiological change in a neuron, most often through the opening of [[ion channel]]s or changes in the [[cell signaling]] processes. Transmembrane receptors are activated by chemicals called [[ligand]]s. For example, a molecule in food can serve as a ligand for taste receptors. Other transmembrane proteins, which are not accurately called receptors, are sensitive to mechanical or thermal changes. Physical changes in these proteins increase ion flow across the membrane, and can generate an [[action potential]] or a [[graded potential]] in the [[sensory neuron]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Functional receptor types ====\nA third classification of receptors is by how the receptor [[Transduction (physiology)|transduces]] stimuli into [[membrane potential]] changes. Stimuli are of three general types. Some stimuli are ions and [[macromolecule]]s that affect transmembrane receptor proteins when these chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane. Some stimuli are physical variations in the environment that affect receptor cell membrane potentials. Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from visible light. For humans, the only electromagnetic energy that is perceived by our eyes is visible light. Some other organisms have receptors that humans lack, such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of bees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nReceptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce. The different types of functional receptor cell types are [[mechanoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s, [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]], [[chemoreceptor]]s ([[osmoreceptor]]), [[thermoreceptor]]s, and [[nociceptor]]s. Physical stimuli, such as pressure and vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a mechanoreceptor.  Photoreceptors convert light (visible [[electromagnetic radiation]]) into signals. Chemical stimuli can be interpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an object's taste or smell, while osmoreceptors respond to a chemical solute concentrations of body fluids. Nociception (pain) interprets the presence of tissue damage, from sensory information from mechano-, chemo-, and thermoreceptors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of neural science|date=1991|publisher=Appleton & Lange|others=Kandel, Eric R., Schwartz, James H.

This minimum amount of stimulus is called the absolute threshold.<ref name=\"pri\" /> The absolute threshold is defined as the minimum amount of stimulation necessary for the detection of a stimulus 50% of the time.<ref name=\"wol\">{{cite book|last1=Wolfe|first1=Jeremy|title=Sensation & perception|last2=Kluender|first2=Keith|last3=Levi|first3=Dennis|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=978-0-87893-572-7|edition=3rd|page=7|year=2012}}</ref> Absolute threshold is measured by using a method called [[signal detection]]. This process involves presenting stimuli of varying intensities to a subject in order to determine the level at which the subject can reliably detect stimulation in a given sense.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n\n==== Differential threshold ====\n{{Main|Differential threshold}}\nDifferential threshold or just noticeable difference (JDS) is the smallest detectable difference between two stimuli, or the smallest difference in stimuli that can be judged to be different from each other.<ref name=\"wol\" /> [[Weber's Law]] is an empirical law that states that the difference threshold is a constant fraction of the comparison stimulus.<ref name=\"wol\" /> According to Weber's Law, bigger stimuli require larger differences to be noticed.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n[[File:Power_exponents_and_Steven's_Power_Law.svg|thumb|Human power exponents and Steven&#x27;s Power Law]]\n[[Psychophysics#Magnitude estimation|Magnitude estimation]] is a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] method in which subjects assign perceived values of given stimuli. The relationship between stimulus intensity and perceptive intensity is described by [[Steven's power law]].<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Signal detection theory ===\n{{Main|Signal detection theory}}\nSignal detection theory quantifies the experience of the subject to the presentation of a stimulus in the presence of [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]]. There is internal noise and there is external noise when it comes to signal detection. The internal noise originates from static in the nervous system. For example, an individual with closed eyes in a dark room still sees something - a blotchy pattern of grey with intermittent brighter flashes -, this is internal noise. External noise is the result of noise in the environment that can interfere with the detection of the stimulus of interest. Noise is only a problem if the magnitude of the noise is large enough to interfere with signal collection. The [[nervous system]] calculates a criterion, or an internal threshold, for the detection of a signal in the presence of noise. If a signal is judged to be above the criterion, thus the signal is differentiated from the noise, the signal is sensed and perceived. Errors in signal detection can potentially lead to [[false positives and false negatives]]. The sensory criterion might be shifted based on the importance of the detecting the signal. Shifting of the criterion may influence the likelihood of false positives and false negatives.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Private perceptive experience ===\n{{Main|Qualia}}\nSubjective visual and auditory experiences appear to be similar across humans subjects. The same cannot be said about taste. For example, there is a molecule called [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP) that some humans experience as bitter, some as almost tasteless, while others experience it as somewhere between tasteless and bitter. There is a genetic basis for this difference between perception given the same sensory stimulus. This subjective difference in taste perception has implications for individuals' food preferences, and consequently, health.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Sensory adaptation ===\n{{Main|Sensory adaptation}}\nWhen a stimulus is constant and unchanging, perceptual sensory adaptation occurs. During this process, the subject becomes less sensitive to the stimulus.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n\n=== Fourier analysis ===\n{{Main|Fourier analysis}}\nBiological auditory (hearing), vestibular and spatial, and visual systems (vision) appear to break down real-world complex stimuli into [[sine wave]] components, through the mathematical process called Fourier analysis. Many neurons have a strong preference for certain sine [[frequency]] components in contrast to others. The way that simpler sounds and images are [[Code|encoded]] during sensation can provide insight into how perception of real-world objects happens.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Sensory neuroscience and the biology of perception ===\n{{Main|Sensory neuroscience}}\nPerception occurs when [[nerve]]s that lead from the [[Sensory nervous system|sensory organs]] (e.g. eye) to the brain are stimulated, even if that stimulation is unrelated to the target signal of the sensory organ. For example, in the case of the eye, it does not matter whether light or something else stimulates the optic nerve, that stimulation will results in visual perception, even if there was no visual stimulus to begin with. (To prove this point to yourself (and if you are a human), close your eyes (preferably in a dark room) and press gently on the outside corner of one eye through the eyelid. You will see a visual spot toward the inside of your visual field, near your nose.)<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n==== Sensory nervous system ====\n{{Main|Sensory nervous system}}\nAll stimuli received by the [[Sensory neuron|receptors]] are [[Transduction (physiology)|transduced]] to an [[action potential]], which is carried along one or more afferent [[neuron]]<nowiki/>s towards a specific area ([[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]) of the [[brain]]. Just as different nerves are dedicated to sensory and motors tasks, different areas of the brain (cortices) are similarly dedicated to different [[Sensory cortex|sensory]] and [[Perception|perceptual]] tasks. More complex processing is accomplished across primary cortical regions that spread beyond the primary cortices. Every nerve, [[Sensory nerve|sensory]] or [[Motor nerve|motor]], has its own signal transmission speed. For example, nerves in the frog's legs have a 90&nbsp;ft/s (99&nbsp;km/h) signal transmission speed, while sensory nerves in humans, transmit sensory information at speeds between 165&nbsp;ft/s (181&nbsp;km/h) and 330&nbsp;ft/s (362&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"wol\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The [[human]] external sensory and perceptual system<ref name=\"wol\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n![[Stimulus (physiology)|Physical stimulus]]\n!Sensory organ\n![[Sensory receptor]]\n![[Sensory system]]\n![[Cranial nerves|Cranial nerve(s)]]\n![[Cerebral cortex]]\n!Primary associated [[Perception|perception(s]])\n!Name\n|-\n|[[Light]]\n|[[Human eye|Eyes]]\n|[[Photoreceptor cell|Photoreceptor]]\n|[[Visual system]]\n|[[Optic (II) nerve|Optic (II)]]\n|[[Visual cortex]]\n|[[Visual perception]]\n|[[Visual perception|Vision]]\n|-\n|[[Sound]]\n|[[Ear]]s\n|[[Mechanoreceptor]]\n|[[Auditory system]]\n|[[Vestibulocochlear nerve|Vestibulocochlear (VIII)]]\n|[[Auditory cortex]]\n|[[Auditory perception]]\n|[[Hearing|Hearing (audition)]]\n|-\n|[[Gravity]] and [[acceleration]]\n|[[Inner ear]]\n|Mechanoreceptor\n|[[Vestibular system]]\n|Vestibulocochlear (VIII)\n|[[Vestibular cortex]]\n|[[Equilibrioception]]\n|[[Balance (ability)|Balance (equilibrium)]] \n|-\n|[[Chemical substance]]\n|[[Human nose|Nose]]\n|[[Chemoreceptor]]\n|[[Olfactory system]]\n|[[Olfactory nerve|Olfactory (I)]]\n|[[Olfactory cortex]]\n|[[Olfactory perception]], Gustatory perception (taste or flavor)<ref>Small DM, Green BG.

Multimodality integrates different senses into one unified perceptual experience. Information from one sense has the potential to influence how information from another is perceived.<ref name=\"pri\" /> Multimodal perception is qualitatively different from unimodal perception. There has been a growing body of evidence since the mid-90's on the neural correlates of multimodal perception.<ref name=\"cal\">Calvert, G.A., Hansen, P.C., Iversen, S.D. and Brammer, M.J., 2001.

(1946-2004).|title=Biology|date=cop. 2005|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0-321-26984-5|oclc=904492777}}</ref> Human external sensation is based on the sensory organs of the [[Human eye|eyes]], [[Human ear|ears]], [[Human skin|skin]], [[vestibular system]], [[Human nose|nose]], and [[Human mouth|mouth]], which contribute, respectively, to the sensory [[perception]]s of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[hearing]], [[touch]], [[Equilibrioception|spatial orientation]], [[Olfaction|smell]], and [[Flavor|taste]]. Smell and taste are both responsible for identifying molecules and thus both are types of [[chemoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s. Both olfaction (smell) and gustation (taste) require the transduction of chemical stimuli into electrical potentials.<ref name=\"pri\" /><ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n==== Visual system (vision) ====\n{{Main|Visual system}}\nThe visual system, or sense of sight, is based on the transduction of light stimuli received through the eyes and contributes to [[visual perception]]. The visual system detects [[light]] on [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] in the [[retina]] of each eye that generates electrical [[Action potential|nerve impulses]] for the perception of varying colors and brightness. There are two types of photoreceptors: [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]]. Rods are very sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors. Cones distinguish colors but are less sensitive to dim light.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the molecular level, visual stimuli cause changes in the photopigment molecule that lead to changes in membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell. A single unit of light is called a [[photon]], which is described in physics as a packet of energy with properties of both a particle and a wave. The [[energy]] of a photon is represented by its [[wavelength]], with each wavelength of visible light corresponding to a particular [[color]]. Visible light is [[electromagnetic radiation]] with a wavelength between 380 and 720&nbsp;nm. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation longer than 720&nbsp;nm fall into the [[infrared]] range, whereas wavelengths shorter than 380&nbsp;nm fall into the [[ultraviolet]] range. Light with a wavelength of 380&nbsp;nm is [[blue]] whereas light with a wavelength of 720&nbsp;nm is dark [[red]]. All other colors fall between red and blue at various points along the wavelength scale.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe three types of cone [[opsin]]<nowiki/>s, being sensitive to different wavelengths of light, provide us with color vision. By comparing the activity of the three different cones, the brain can extract color information from visual stimuli. For example, a bright blue light that has a wavelength of approximately 450&nbsp;nm would activate the \u201cred\u201d cones minimally, the \u201cgreen\u201d cones marginally, and the \u201cblue\u201d cones predominantly. The relative activation of the three different cones is calculated by the brain, which perceives the color as blue. However, cones cannot react to low-intensity light, and rods do not sense the color of light. Therefore, our low-light vision is\u2014in essence\u2014in [[grayscale]]. In other words, in a dark room, everything appears as a shade of [[Grey|gray]]. If you think that you can see colors in the dark, it is most likely because your brain knows what color something is and is relying on that memory.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere is some disagreement as to whether the visual system consists of one, two, or thre submodalities. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two submodalities, given that different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} that [[stereopsis]], the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the [[visual cortex]] of the brain where patterns and objects in [[Real image|images]] are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.\n\nThe inability to see is called [[blindness]]. Blindness may result from damage to the eyeball, especially to the retina, damage to the optic nerve that connects each eye to the brain, and/or from [[stroke]] ([[infarct]]s in the brain).  Temporary or permanent blindness can be caused by poisons or medications. People who are blind from degradation or damage to the visual cortex, but still have functional eyes, are actually capable of some level of vision and reaction to visual stimuli but not a conscious perception; this is known as [[blindsight]]. People with blindsight are usually not aware that they are reacting to visual sources, and instead just unconsciously adapt their behavior to the stimulus.\n\nOn February 14, 2013 researchers developed a [[neural implant]] that gives [[rat]]s the ability to sense [[infrared]] light which for the first time provides [[living creatures]] with new abilities, instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities.<ref>{{cite journal|date=14 February 2013|title=Implant gives rats sixth sense for infrared light|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/14/implant-gives-rats-sixth-sense-for-infrared-light|journal=Wired UK|access-date=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Auditory system (hearing) ====\n{{Main|Auditory system}}\nHearing, or audition, is the transduction of [[sound waves]] into a neural signal that is made possible by the structures of the [[ear]]. The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known as the [[Auricle (anatomy)|auricle]]. At the end of the [[auditory canal]] is the tympanic membrane, or [[Eardrum|ear drum]], which vibrates after it is struck by sound waves. The auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane are often referred to as the [[external ear]]. The [[middle ear]] consists of a space spanned by three small bones called the [[ossicles]]. The three ossicles are the [[malleus]], [[incus]], and [[stapes]], which are Latin names that roughly translate to hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus. The incus, in turn, articulates with the stapes. The stapes is then attached to the [[inner ear]], where the sound waves will be [[Transduction (physiology)|transduced]] into a neural signal. The middle ear is connected to the [[pharynx]] through the [[Eustachian tube]], which helps equilibrate air pressure across the tympanic membrane. The tube is normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of the pharynx contract during [[swallowing]] or [[yawn]]ing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that is the sense of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the [[inner ear]], which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000&nbsp;[[hertz]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing, Physics Factbook by Glenn Elert (ed)|date=|publisher=Hypertextbook.com|access-date=2014-04-05}}</ref> with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called [[deafness]] or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as [[Seismic communication|vibrations conducted through the body]] by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine the direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vicdeaf.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/Information%20Sheets/Deaf%20Culture%20and%20Communication%20-%20A%20Basic%20Guide.pdf|title=Deaf Culture and Communication: A Basic Guide|year=2010|work=Victorian Deaf Society}}</ref>\n\n==== Somatosensory system (touch) ====\n{{Main|Somatosensory system}}\nSomatosensation is considered a general sense, as opposed to the special senses discussed in this section. Somatosensation is the group of sensory modalities that are associated with touch and interoception. The modalities of sometosensation include [[pressure]], [[vibration]], light touch, [[Tickling|tickle]], [[itch]], [[temperature]], [[pain]], [[kinesthesia]].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Somatosensation]], also called [[tactition]]  (adjectival form: tactile) is a perception resulting from activation of neural [[Mechanoreceptor|receptors]], generally in the [[skin]] including [[hair follicle]]s, but also in the [[tongue]], [[throat]], and [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]]. A variety of [[pressure]] receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.).

[[Paresthesia]] is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or [[numbness]] of the skin that may result from nerve damage and may be permanent or temporary.\n\nTwo types of somatosensory signals that are transduced by [[free nerve ending]]s are pain and temperature. These two modalities use [[thermoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s and [[nociceptor]]s to transduce temperature and pain stimuli, respectively. Temperature receptors are stimulated when local temperatures differ from [[body temperature]]. Some thermoreceptors are sensitive to just cold and others to just heat. Nociception is the sensation of potentially damaging stimuli. Mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli beyond a set threshold will elicit painful sensations. Stressed or damaged tissues release chemicals that activate receptor proteins in the nociceptors. For example, the sensation of heat associated with spicy foods involves [[capsaicin]], the active molecule in hot peppers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLow frequency vibrations are sensed by mechanoreceptors called [[Merkel cell]]s, also known as type I cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Merkel cells are located in the [[stratum basale]] of the [[epidermis]]. Deep pressure and vibration is transduced by lamellated ([[Pacinian corpuscle|Pacinian]]) corpuscles, which are receptors with encapsulated endings found deep in the dermis, or subcutaneous tissue. Light touch is transduced by the encapsulated endings known as tactile ([[Meissner corpuscle|Meissner]]) corpuscles. Follicles are also wrapped in a [[plexus]] of nerve endings known as the hair follicle plexus. These nerve endings detect the movement of hair at the surface of the skin, such as when an insect may be walking along the [[skin]]. Stretching of the skin is transduced by stretch receptors known as [[bulbous corpuscle]]s. Bulbous corpuscles are also known as Ruffini corpuscles, or type II cutaneous mechanoreceptors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe heat receptors are sensitive to infrared radiation and can occur in specialized organs, for instance in [[pit vipers]]. The [[Thermoreceptor|thermoceptors]] in the skin are quite different from the [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] thermoceptors in the brain ([[POAH|hypothalamus]]), which provide feedback on internal body temperature.\n\n==== Vestibular system (balance) ====\n{{Main|Vestibular system}}\n\nThe vestibular sense, or sense of balance (equilibrium), is the sense that contributes to the perception of balance (equilibrium), spatial orientation, direction, or acceleration ([[equilibrioception]]). Along with audition, the [[inner ear]] is responsible for encoding information about equilibrium. A similar [[mechanoreceptor]]\u2014a hair cell with [[Stereocilia (inner ear)|stereocilia]]\u2014senses head position, head movement, and whether our bodies are in motion. These cells are located within the [[Vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] of the inner ear. Head position is sensed by the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[saccule]], whereas head movement is sensed by the [[semicircular canals]]. The neural signals generated in the [[vestibular ganglion]] are transmitted through the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] to the [[Brainstem|brain stem]] and [[cerebellum]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe semicircular canals are three ring-like extensions of the vestibule. One is oriented in the horizontal plane, whereas the other two are oriented in the vertical plane. The [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior]] and posterior vertical canals are oriented at approximately 45 degrees relative to the [[sagittal plane]]. The base of each semicircular canal, where it meets with the vestibule, connects to an enlarged region known as the [[Ampullary cupula|ampulla]]. The ampulla contains the hair cells that respond to rotational movement, such as turning the head while saying \u201cno.\u201d The stereocilia of these hair cells extend into the [[Ampullary cupula|cupula]], a membrane that attaches to the top of the ampulla. As the head rotates in a plane parallel to the semicircular canal, the fluid lags, deflecting the cupula in the direction opposite to the head movement. The semicircular canals contain several ampullae, with some oriented horizontally and others oriented vertically. By comparing the relative movements of both the horizontal and vertical ampullae, the vestibular system can detect  the direction of most head movements within three-dimensional ([[Three-dimensional space|3D]]) space.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[vestibular nerve]] conducts information from sensory receptors in three [[Osseous ampullae|ampulla]] that sense motion of fluid in three [[semicircular canal]]s caused by three-dimensional rotation of the head.  The vestibular nerve also conducts information from the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and the [[saccule]], which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend under the weight of [[otolith]]s (which are small crystals of [[calcium carbonate]]) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, linear acceleration, and the direction of gravitational force.\n\n==== Gustatory system (taste) ====\n{{Main|Gustatory system}}\nThe gustatory system or the sense of taste is the [[sensory system]] that is partially responsible for the [[perception]] of [[Flavor|taste (flavor)]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trivedi|first=Bijal P.|date=June 2012|title=Gustatory system: The finer points of taste|journal=Nature|volume=486|issue=7403|pages=S2\u2013S3|doi=10.1038/486s2a|pmid=22717400|bibcode=2012Natur.486S...2T|issn=0028-0836}}</ref>  A few recognized [[Stimulus modality|submodalities]] exist within taste: [[sweet]], [[Saltiness|salty]], [[sour]], [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]], and [[umami]]. Very recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste submodality for fats, or lipids.<ref name=\":0\" /> The sense of taste is often confused with the perception of flavor, which is the results of the [[multimodal integration]] of gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) sensations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray, M. M. (Micah M.), editor. Wallace, Mark T., editor.|title=The neural bases of multisensory processes|isbn=978-1-4398-1219-8|oclc=759160178|date=2011-08-25}}</ref> \n[[File:Philippe_Mercier_-_The_Sense_of_Taste_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|Philippe Mercier - The Sense of Taste - Google Art Project]]\nWithin the structure of the [[lingual papillae]] are [[taste bud]]s that contain specialized gustatory receptor cells for the [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]] of taste stimuli. These receptor cells are sensitive to the chemicals contained within foods that are ingested, and they release [[neurotransmitter]]s based on the amount of the chemical in the food. Neurotransmitters from the gustatory cells can activate [[sensory neuron]]s in the [[Facial nerve|facial]], [[Glossopharyngeal nerve|glossopharyngeal]], and [[Vagus nerve|vagus]] [[cranial nerves]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSalty and sour taste submodalities are triggered by the [[cations]] [[Na\u207a|Na+]] and [[Hydrogen ion|H+]], respectively. The other taste modalities result from food molecules binding to a [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein\u2013coupled receptor]]. A G protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to [[depolarization]] of the gustatory cell. The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of [[glucose]] (or [[sugar substitute]]s) dissolved in the [[saliva]]. Bitter taste is similar to sweet in that food molecules bind to G protein\u2013coupled receptors. The taste known as umami is often referred to as the savory taste. Like sweet and bitter, it is based on the activation of G protein\u2013coupled receptors by a specific molecule.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOnce the gustatory cells are activated by the taste molecules, they release [[neurotransmitter]]s onto the [[dendrite]]s of sensory neurons. These neurons are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, as well as a component within the vagus nerve dedicated to the [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]]. The facial nerve connects to taste buds in the anterior third of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve connects to taste buds in the posterior two thirds of the tongue. The vagus nerve connects to taste buds in the extreme posterior of the tongue, verging on the [[pharynx]], which are more sensitive to [[Noxious stimulus|noxious stimuli]] such as bitterness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFlavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called taste buds, or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue.

The inability to taste is called [[ageusia]].\n\n==== Olfactory system (smell) ====\n{{Main|Olfactory system}}\nLike the sense of taste, the sense of smell, or the olfactiory system, is also responsive to [[Chemical substance|chemical stimuli]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Unlike taste, there are hundreds of [[olfactory receptor]]<nowiki/>s (388 according to one source), each binding to a particular molecular feature. [[Odor|Odor molecules]] possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitatory signals from different receptors makes up what humans perceive as the molecule's smell.<ref name=\"Moonwalk\">{{cite web|url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/sense-of-smell-olfactory-receptors.html|title=A Sense of Smell: Olfactory Receptors|date=2007-01-09|work=Sandwalk|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe olfactory receptor neurons are located in a small region within the [[Nasal cavity|superior nasal cavity]]. This region is referred to as the [[olfactory epithelium]] and contains [[Bipolar neuron|bipolar sensory neurons]]. Each olfactory sensory neuron has [[dendrite]]s that extend from the [[apical surface]] of the [[epithelium]] into the [[mucus]] lining the cavity. As airborne molecules are inhaled through the [[Human nose|nose]], they pass over the olfactory epithelial region and dissolve into the mucus. These odorant molecules bind to proteins that keep them dissolved in the mucus and help transport them to the olfactory dendrites. The odorant\u2013protein complex binds to a receptor protein within the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite. These receptors are G protein\u2013coupled, and will produce a graded [[membrane potential]] in the [[Olfactory receptor neuron|olfactory neurons]].<ref name=\":0\" /> \n[[File:The_sense_of_smell_Philippe_Mercier.jpg|thumb|The sense of smell Bequest of [[Mrs E.G. Elgar]], 1945 [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].]]\nIn the [[Human brain|brain]], olfaction is processed by the [[olfactory cortex]]. Olfactory receptor neurons in the nose differ from most other neurons in that they die and regenerate on a regular basis. The inability to smell is called [[anosmia]]. Some neurons in the nose are specialized to detect [[pheromone]]s.<ref name=\"LiveScience\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/2737-surprising-impact-taste-smell.html|title=The Surprising Impact of Taste and Smell|work=LiveScience}}</ref> Loss of the sense of smell can result in food tasting bland. A person with an impaired sense of smell may require additional [[spice]] and [[seasoning]] levels for food to be tasted. Anosmia may also be related to some presentations of mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]], because the loss of enjoyment of food may lead to a general sense of despair. The ability of olfactory neurons to replace themselves decreases with age, leading to age-related anosmia. This explains why some elderly people salt their food more than younger people do.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\n{{Main|Interoception}}\n\n==== Proprioception ====\n\n[[Proprioception]], the kinesthetic sense, provides the [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]] of the brain with information on the movement and relative positions of the parts of the body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.<ref name=\"roblesdelatorre\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-IEEE-MM-2006.pdf|title=The Importance of the Sense of Touch in Virtual and Real Environments|work=International Society for Haptics|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Pain ====\n\n[[Nociception]] (physiological [[pain]]) signals nerve-damage or damage to tissue. The three types of pain receptors are cutaneous (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research in the first half of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]] of the brain.<ref name=\"Fulbright 2001\">{{cite journal|authors=Fulbright RK, Troche CJ, Skudlarski P, Gore JC, Wexler BE|date=November 2001|title=Functional MR imaging of regional brain activation associated with the affective experience of pain|journal=AJR.

For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts.

They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.\n\nBlind people report they are able to navigate and in some cases identify an object by interpreting reflected sounds (especially their own footsteps), a phenomenon known as [[human echolocation]].\n\n==== Electroreception ====\n[[Electroreception]] (or electroception) is the ability to detect [[electric field]]s. Several species of fish, [[shark]]s, and rays have the capacity to sense changes in electric fields in their immediate vicinity. For cartilaginous fish this occurs through a specialized organ called the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]]. Some fish passively sense changing nearby electric fields; some generate their own weak electric fields, and sense the pattern of field potentials over their body surface; and some use these electric field generating and sensing capacities for social [[communication]]. The mechanisms by which electroceptive fish construct a spatial representation from very small differences in field potentials involve comparisons of spike latencies from different parts of the fish's body.\n\nThe only orders of mammals that are known to demonstrate electroception are the [[dolphin]] and [[monotreme]] orders. Among these mammals, the [[platypus]]<ref name=\"Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus\">{{cite web|url=http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html|title=Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990209085517/http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html|archive-date=1999-02-09|access-date=}}</ref> has the most acute sense of electroception.\n\nA dolphin can detect electric fields in water using electroreceptors in [[Whisker|vibrissal crypts]] arrayed in pairs on its snout and which evolved from whisker motion sensors.<ref name=\"Drake 2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Drake|first1=Nadia|year=2011|title=Life: Dolphin can sense electric fields: Ability may help species track prey in murky waters|journal=Science News|volume=180|issue=5|pages=12|doi=10.1002/scin.5591800512|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> These electroreceptors can detect electric fields as weak as 4.6 microvolts per centimeter, such as those generated by contracting muscles and pumping gills of potential prey. This permits the dolphin to locate prey from the seafloor where sediment limits visibility and echolocation.\n\nSpiders have been shown to detect electric fields to determine a suitable time to extend web for 'ballooning'.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morley|first1=Erica|date=July 5, 2018|title=Electric Fields Elicit Ballooning in Spiders|journal=Current Biology|volume=28|issue=14|pages=2324\u20132330.e2|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2018.05.057|pmid=29983315|pmc=6065530}}</ref>\n\n[[Body modification]] enthusiasts have experimented with magnetic implants to attempt to replicate this sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/05/implant-gives-man-th.html|title=Implant gives man the sense of \"magnetic vision\"|access-date=2011-04-23}}</ref> However, in general humans (and it is presumed other mammals) can detect electric fields only indirectly by detecting the effect they have on hairs. An electrically charged balloon, for instance, will exert a force on human arm hairs, which can be felt through tactition and identified as coming from a static charge (and not from wind or the like). This is not electroreception, as it is a post-sensory cognitive action.\n\n==== Hygroreception ====\n[[Hygroreception]] is the ability to detect changes in the moisture content of the environment.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Enjin A, Zaharieva EE, Frank DD, Mansourian S, Suh GS, Gallio M, Stensmyr MC|date=May 2016|title=Humidity Sensing in Drosophila|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1352\u20138|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.03.049|pmc=5305172|pmid=27161501}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Tichy H, Kallina W|date=2013-01-16|title=The evaporative function of cockroach hygroreceptors|journal=PLOS One|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e53998|bibcode=2013PLoSO...853998T|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053998|pmc=3546976|pmid=23342058}}</ref>\n\n==== Infrared sensing ====\n{{Main|Infrared sensing in snakes}}\n\nThe ability to sense [[infrared]] thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of [[snakes]]. Essentially, it allows these reptiles to \"see\" radiant heat at [[wavelengths]] between 5 and 30 [[\u03bcm]] to a degree of accuracy such that a blind [[rattlesnake]] can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes.<ref>(Kardong & Mackessy 1991)</ref> It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that it may also be used in thermoregulatory decision making.<ref>(Krochmal et al. 2004)</ref> The facial pit underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[pitvipers]] and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[pythons]], having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.<ref>(Pough et al. 1992)</ref> The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[Loreal pit]]), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family [[Viperidae]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target [[Endotherm|endothermic]] prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision-making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain heat-sensing pits) cannot.\n\nIn spite of its detection of IR light, the pits' IR detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors \u2013 while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is in fact a temperature-sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than a chemical reaction to light.<ref name=\"Gracheva et al. 2010\">(Gracheva et al. 2010)</ref> This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original \"resting\" or \"inactive\" temperature.<ref name=\"Gracheva et al. 2010\" />\n\n==== Other ====\nPressure detection uses the organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in shape of the [[gas bladder]] to the middle ear. It can be used to regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the [[weather fish]] and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder.\n\nCurrent detection is a detection system of water currents, consisting mostly of [[Vortex|vortices]], found in the [[lateral line]] of fish and aquatic forms of amphibians. The lateral line is also sensitive to low-frequency vibrations. The mechanoreceptors are [[hair cell]]s, the same mechanoreceptors for vestibular sense and hearing. It is used primarily for navigation, hunting, and schooling. The receptors of the [[Electroception|electrical sense]] are modified hair cells of the lateral line system.\n\n[[Polarized light]] direction/detection is used by [[bees]] to orient themselves, especially on cloudy days. [[Cuttlefish]], some [[beetles]], and [[mantis shrimp]] can also perceive the polarization of light.  Most sighted humans can in fact learn to roughly detect large areas of polarization by an effect called [[Haidinger's brush]], however this is considered an [[entoptic phenomenon]] rather than a separate sense.\n\n[[Slit sensilla]]e of spiders detect mechanical strain in the exoskeleton, providing information on force and vibrations.\n\n== Plant sensation ==\nBy using a variety of sense receptors, plants sense light, temperature, humidity, chemical substances, chemical gradients, reorientation, magnetic fields, infections, tissue damage and mechanical pressure. The absence of a nervous system notwithstanding, plants interpret and respond to these stimuli by a variety of hormonal and cell-to-cell communication pathways that result in movement, morphological changes and physiological state alterations at the organism level, that is, result in plant behavior. Such physiological and cognitive functions are generally not believed to give rise to mental phenomena or qualia, however, as these are typically considered the product of nervous system activity. The emergence of mental phenomena from the activity of systems functionally or computationally analogous to that of nervous systems is, however, a hypothetical possibility explored by some schools of thought in the philosophy of mind field, such as [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[Computational theory of mind|computationalism]].\n\nHowever, plants could perceive the world around them,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170109-plants-can-see-hear-and-smell-and-respond|title=Earth - Plants can see, hear and smell \u2013 and respond|date=10 January 2017|website=BBC}}</ref> and might be able to emit airborne sounds similar to \"screaming\" when [[Stress (biology)|stressed]].

S. Lewis}}</ref> This traditional concept of five senses is common today.\n\nThe traditional five senses are enumerated as the \"five material faculties\" (''{{IAST|pa\u00f1canna\u1e43 indriy\u0101na\u1e43 avakanti}}'') in Hindu literature. They appear in allegorical representation as early as in the [[Katha Upanishad]] (roughly 6th century BC), as five horses drawing the \"[[chariot]]\" of the body, guided by the mind as \"chariot driver\".\n\nDepictions of the five traditional senses as [[allegory]] became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] and [[Flemish Baroque painter]]s. A typical example is [[G\u00e9rard de Lairesse]]'s ''Allegory of the Five Senses'' (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a [[convex mirror]], hearing is the [[cupid]]-like boy with a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], smell is represented by the girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and touch is represented by the woman holding the bird.\n\nIn [[Buddhist philosophy]], [[Ayatana]] or \"sense-base\" includes the mind as a sense organ, in addition to the traditional five. This addition to the commonly acknowledged senses may arise from the psychological orientation involved in Buddhist thought and practice. The mind considered by itself is seen as the principal gateway to a different spectrum of phenomena that differ from the physical sense data. This way of viewing the human sense system indicates the importance of internal sources of sensation and perception that complements our experience of the external world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aesthesis]]\n* [[Apperception]]\n* [[Attention]]\n* [[\u0100yatana]] (sense bases in Theravada Buddhism)\n* [[Chemesthesis]]\n* [[Empiricism]]\n* [[Extrasensory Perception]]\n* [[Entoptic phenomenon]]\n* Increased sensitivity:\n** [[Supertaster]]\n** [[Hyperesthesia]]\n** [[Hyperacusis]]\n* [[Illusion]]s\n** [[Auditory illusion]]\n** [[Optical illusion]]\n** [[Touch illusion]]\n* [[intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]]\n* [[Multisensory integration]]\n* [[Phantom limb]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[\u1e62a\u1e0d\u0101yatana|Sa\u1e37\u0101yatana]] and [[Ayatana]] (the six senses as a concept in [[Buddhism]])\n* [[Sensation and perception psychology]]\n* [[Sense of direction]]\n* [[Sensitivity (human)]]\n* [[Sensorium]]\n* [[Sensory processing disorder]]\n* [[Sensus divinitatis]]\n* [[Synesthesia]] ([[Ideasthesia]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|Senses}}\n{{Wikiversity|What is the sixth sense}}\n{{Commons category|Senses}}\n\n* The 2004 [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] ([http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/2004/index.html announced] 4 October 2004) was won by [[Richard Axel]] and [[Linda Buck]] for their work explaining olfaction, published first in a joint paper in 1991 that described the very large family of about one thousand genes for odorant receptors and how the receptors link to the brain.\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/32909/Sensing-or-feeling/ Answers to several questions related to senses and human feeling from curious kids]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070520084243/http://www.physpharm.fmd.uwo.ca/undergrad/sensesweb/ The Physiology of the Senses tutorial] 12 animated chapters on vision, hearing, touch, balance and memory.\n\n{{Sensory system}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Perception]]\n[[Category:Senses| ]]\n[[Category:Sensory systems]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo/fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"}

The iTaukei language is spoken either as a first or second language by most [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]] who make up around 54% of the population. \n\nFijians of [[Indo-Fijians|Indian]] descent make up a further 37%, mainly speaking a local variant of [[Hindi]], known as ''[[Fiji Hindi]]''. English, a remnant of British colonial rule over the islands, was the sole official language until 1997 and is widely used in government, business and education as a [[lingua franca]]. Considerable business is also done in Fijian, especially away from larger town centre.\n\nA small number of other Indigenous [[Central Pacific languages|West Fijian]] and [[East Fijian languages|East Fijian]] regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]] are also spoken by immigrant populations.\n\n==History==\nUntil the 19th century, Fiji's population consisted almost entirely of indigenous Fijians, who were of mixed Polynesian and Melanesian descent and generally spoke languages of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language]] family. After the islands came under [[British Empire|British colonial rule]], a number of contract workers were brought from present-day [[British India]], spreading the use of the [[Hindi]] language. \n\nAll three of Fiji's official languages have greatly been influenced by one another, in terms of vocabulary and, in some cases, grammar because of the constant, everyday contact between these languages, now for over a century. Fiji's diverse, multiracial and multilingual makeup make these languages, as well as other unofficial, minority languages in Fiji (such as Chinese, Western Fijian, Banaban, Rotuman, Tuvaluan and other present Indian languages), influence one another.\n\n==English==\n[[English language|English]] usage in Fiji predates the cession of Fiji to [[Great Britain]] by a few decades. English was first encountered from the first explorers and traders and found greater popularity as a [[lingua franca]] (albeit mixed with English in an early and now extinct [[Pidgin Fijian]]) between frontier settlers and the indigenous peoples. By the time of the British administration, much of the [[Ratu|Fijian nobility]] were able to comprehend basic English. The English spoken in Fiji today is very different and has developed significantly over the close to 150 years of usage in the islands.\n\nLike many former colonies of Great Britain, there are certain 'situational varieties' of English present. There is the very formal, 'Proper' English (which would resemble formal English in [[Australia]] or the [[United Kingdom]]) as it is known, which is to be used in government and any other situation deemed formal enough for its use, but it has fallen out of favor due to the popularity of the more laid back varieties and is still spoken only by the older generation that lived through the colonial days. A sort of mid-level English is used in school, church, work and in semi-formal situations and is basically English with localized grammatical innovations and words imported from Hindi and Fijian; it is quickly becoming 'formal English' in Fiji. \n\nVery informal Fiji English, or Finglish, is used among all races with family, friends and in general conversations and in any other situation not deemed formal. Fiji English has been tentatively studied by linguists and has been suggested as a separate [[dialect]] from [[Standard English]] (as has developed in Australia and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]]) but the distinction is not made locally or in the constitution. Moreover, other linguists suggest it is part of a greater South Pacific English dialect because of the shared development of English within former [[British colonies]] and [[protectorates]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].\n\n==iTaukei==\niTaukei is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian family]] spoken in [[Fiji]]. It has 300,000 first-language speakers, which is almost one-third of the population of Fiji, but another 300,000 speak it as a second language. The early missionaries selected the [[Fijian language|Bau dialect]] or Bauan (which, among the East Fijian dialects, held the place that French would in Europe, while the purer Rewa dialect would be Latin) as the standard dialect for printing and communicating. Bauan soon became the standard of communication among the indigenous [[Fijians|iTaukei]]. Bauan was selected not only because of its prestige but also because it was the language of the then politically dominant island of Bau and the [[Ratu|Mataiwelagi]] chiefs (and claimed King of Fiji).\n\nBy the middle to the late 19th century, with the push by missionaries, Bauan had also invaded the Western areas of Viti Levu, which spoke an entirely different set of dialects belonging to the [[Central Pacific languages|West Fijian language]], which is grouped with Polynesian and Rotuman in the [[Central Pacific languages|West Fijian-Polynesian language family]] and practiced a different culture. This occurred up to the point that many Bauan words entered many western Fijian languages. Bauan was then adopted by the British administration for communication with the iTaukei. Over time, it evolved into what is today [[Fijian language|Standard Fijian]] which includes many English and Other Fijian Dialectal contributions, becoming quite distinct from the original Bauan Dialect.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Orientation - Bau|url = http://www.everyculture.com/Oceania/Bau-Orientation.html|website = www.everyculture.com|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==Hindi==\n\nHindi is an official language in [[Fiji]]. In the 1997 Constitution, it was referred to as \"Hindustani\",<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/fj00000_.html |title=Section 4 of Fiji Constitution |publisher=servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=3 May 2009}}</ref> but in the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji]], it is simply called \"Hindi\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/govt--publications/constitution.aspx|title=- Ooops! -|author=|date=|website=www.fiji.gov.fj|accessdate=8 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011085543/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/govt--publications/constitution.aspx|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Fiji Hindi]], also known as Fijian Baat or Fijian Hindustani, is the language spoken by most [[Fiji]]an citizens of [[India]]n descent. It is derived mainly from the [[Awadhi]] and [[Bhojpuri]] varieties of [[Hindi languages|Hindi]]. It has also borrowed a large number of words from [[Fijian language|Fijian]] and [[English language|English]]. The relation between Fiji Hindi and [[Standard Hindi]] is similar to the relation between [[Afrikaans]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Indian [[indenture]]d labourers were initially brought to Fiji mainly from districts of eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]] and [[South India]] such as from [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. They spoke numerous, mainly Hindi, dialects and languages depending on their district of origin.\n\nA language soon developed in Fiji that combined the common elements of the [[Hindi dialects]] spoken in these areas with Fijian, Arabic, and English words; this has diverged significantly from the varieties of Hindi spoken on the [[Indian sub-continent]]. The development of Fiji Hindi was accelerated by the need for labourers speaking different dialects and sub-dialects of Hindi to work together and the practice of young children being left during working hours in early versions of day care centers. \n\nLater, approximately 15,000 Indian indentured labourers, who were mainly speakers of [[Dravidian languages]] ([[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]]), were brought from South India. By this time Fiji Hindi was well established as the lingua franca of Fiji Indians and the South Indian labourers had to learn it to communicate with the more numerous North Indians and European overseers. Inward migration of free Gujarati and Punjabi settlers further contributed to Fiji Hindi.\n\n==Others==\nFiji is also home to many smaller minorities which make up its multicultural and multilingual populace.\n\n[[Rotuman language|Rotuman]], also referred to as Rotunan, Rutuman or F\u00e4eag Rotuma, is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] spoken by the indigenous people of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] island group of [[Rotuma]], an island with a [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]]-influenced culture that was incorporated as a dependency into the Colony of [[Fiji]] in 1881 and later chose to remain with Fiji in 1970 upon independence and in 1987, when Fiji became a republic. The rotuman language is spoken by more than 2000 people on the island of Rotuma and a further 10,000 people who live or work in the Republic of Fiji.\n\nOther Indian languages are spoken in Fiji. After the indenture system, Indians who spoke [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] arrived in Fiji as free immigrants. At present, many free settler descendants in Fiji and their families speak [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Telugu, Punjabi and Gujarati at home, but all speak and communicate with each other in English. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nTwo significant languages that are seeing growth are [[Cantonese Chinese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Many Chinese settlers, especially from southern China speak Cantonese, which is quickly incorporating many Fijian and English words. Many of these migrants are farmers and are constantly exposed to the Fijian and Hindi dominated areas of rural Fiji.\n\nFurthermore, sizeable minorities of Micronesians and Polynesians mean that Fiji is also home to various [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian]] and [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] languages. Significant among them are the Banaban, which is the language of the former residents of Ocean Island, which was decimated through British phosphate mining. They were given [[Rabi Island]] in North-Eastern Fiji as a new homeland and number 2000\u20133000. Also, Kioa, which was given to former [[Tuvalu]]ans, who migrated as the consequence of overcrowding on [[Vaitupu]]. They speak [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]], a Polynesian language and number around a thousand. Also, there are many Tongan residents and Fijians of Tongan descent in Fiji. These groups speak the [[Tongan language]] or a mix of Tongan and Fijian.\n\n==See also==\n* [[National language debate in Fiji]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Fiji topics}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Articles Related to Languages of Fiji\n|list = \n{{Languages of Fiji}}\n{{Oceania in topic|Languages of}}\n{{English dialects by continent}}\n{{English official language clickable map}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Languages of Fiji| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=October 2015}}\n{{Languages of\n| country  = Fiji\n| official = [[English language|English]], [[Fijian language|iTaukei]], [[Fiji Hindi]]\n}}\n[[Fiji]] has three official languages under the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 constitution]] (and not revoked by the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|2013 Constitution]]): [[English language|English]], [[Fijian language|iTaukei]] and Hindi. The iTaukei language is spoken either as a first or second language by most [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]] who make up around 54% of the population. \n\nFijians of [[Indo-Fijians|Indian]] descent make up a further 37%, mainly speaking a local variant of [[Hindi]], known as ''[[Fiji Hindi]]''. English, a remnant of British colonial rule over the islands, was the sole official language until 1997 and is widely used in government, business and education as a [[lingua franca]]. Considerable business is also done in Fijian, especially away from larger town centre.\n\nA small number of other Indigenous [[Central Pacific languages|West Fijian]] and [[East Fijian languages|East Fijian]] regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]] are also spoken by immigrant populations.\n\n==History==\nUntil the 19th century, Fiji's population consisted almost entirely of indigenous Fijians, who were of mixed Polynesian and Melanesian descent and generally spoke languages of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language]] family. After the islands came under [[British Empire|British colonial rule]], a number of contract workers were brought from present-day [[British India]], spreading the use of the [[Hindi]] language. \n\nAll three of Fiji's official languages have greatly been influenced by one another, in terms of vocabulary and, in some cases, grammar because of the constant, everyday contact between these languages, now for over a century. Fiji's diverse, multiracial and multilingual makeup make these languages, as well as other unofficial, minority languages in Fiji (such as Chinese, Western Fijian, Banaban, Rotuman, Tuvaluan and other present Indian languages), influence one another.\n\n==English==\n[[English language|English]] usage in Fiji predates the cession of Fiji to [[Great Britain]] by a few decades. English was first encountered from the first explorers and traders and found greater popularity as a [[lingua franca]] (albeit mixed with English in an early and now extinct [[Pidgin Fijian]]) between frontier settlers and the indigenous peoples. By the time of the British administration, much of the [[Ratu|Fijian nobility]] were able to comprehend basic English. The English spoken in Fiji today is very different and has developed significantly over the close to 150 years of usage in the islands.\n\nLike many former colonies of Great Britain, there are certain 'situational varieties' of English present. There is the very formal, 'Proper' English (which would resemble formal English in [[Australia]] or the [[United Kingdom]]) as it is known, which is to be used in government and any other situation deemed formal enough for its use, but it has fallen out of favor due to the popularity of the more laid back varieties and is still spoken only by the older generation that lived through the colonial days. A sort of mid-level English is used in school, church, work and in semi-formal situations and is basically English with localized grammatical innovations and words imported from Hindi and Fijian; it is quickly becoming 'formal English' in Fiji. \n\nVery informal Fiji English, or Finglish, is used among all races with family, friends and in general conversations and in any other situation not deemed formal. Fiji English has been tentatively studied by linguists and has been suggested as a separate [[dialect]] from [[Standard English]] (as has developed in Australia and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]]) but the distinction is not made locally or in the constitution. Moreover, other linguists suggest it is part of a greater South Pacific English dialect because of the shared development of English within former [[British colonies]] and [[protectorates]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].\n\n==iTaukei==\niTaukei is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian family]] spoken in [[Fiji]]. It has 300,000 first-language speakers, which is almost one-third of the population of Fiji, but another 300,000 speak it as a second language. The early missionaries selected the [[Fijian language|Bau dialect]] or Bauan (which, among the East Fijian dialects, held the place that French would in Europe, while the purer Rewa dialect would be Latin) as the standard dialect for printing and communicating. Bauan soon became the standard of communication among the indigenous [[Fijians|iTaukei]]. Bauan was selected not only because of its prestige but also because it was the language of the then politically dominant island of Bau and the [[Ratu|Mataiwelagi]] chiefs (and claimed King of Fiji).\n\nBy the middle to the late 19th century, with the push by missionaries, Bauan had also invaded the Western areas of Viti Levu, which spoke an entirely different set of dialects belonging to the [[Central Pacific languages|West Fijian language]], which is grouped with Polynesian and Rotuman in the [[Central Pacific languages|West Fijian-Polynesian language family]] and practiced a different culture. This occurred up to the point that many Bauan words entered many western Fijian languages. Bauan was then adopted by the British administration for communication with the iTaukei. Over time, it evolved into what is today [[Fijian language|Standard Fijian]] which includes many English and Other Fijian Dialectal contributions, becoming quite distinct from the original Bauan Dialect.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Orientation - Bau|url = http://www.everyculture.com/Oceania/Bau-Orientation.html|website = www.everyculture.com|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==Hindi==\n\nHindi is an official language in [[Fiji]]. In the 1997 Constitution, it was referred to as \"Hindustani\",<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/fj00000_.html |title=Section 4 of Fiji Constitution |publisher=servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=3 May 2009}}</ref> but in the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji]], it is simply called \"Hindi\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/govt--publications/constitution.aspx|title=- Ooops! -|author=|date=|website=www.fiji.gov.fj|accessdate=8 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011085543/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/govt--publications/constitution.aspx|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Fiji Hindi]], also known as Fijian Baat or Fijian Hindustani, is the language spoken by most [[Fiji]]an citizens of [[India]]n descent. It is derived mainly from the [[Awadhi]] and [[Bhojpuri]] varieties of [[Hindi languages|Hindi]]. It has also borrowed a large number of words from [[Fijian language|Fijian]] and [[English language|English]].

The name is based on a corruption of the area's principal thoroughfare, Elm Street.

The neighborhood is north of [[Exposition Park, Dallas|Exposition Park]] and south of [[Bryan Place]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early days ===\n\nAfter independence from the Mexican-American War, Texas became a part of the United States in 1845. Four years later, Dallas was founded after the Civil War. After the 1850s\u2019 slave liberation in Texas, many slaves from Texas and nearby states built their houses and cropped their land in the future Deep Ellum, which was one of the largest African-American communities.<ref>Velin, Gabriel. \"Dallas Freedman\u2019s Town: One Community\u2019s Preservation Within a Gentrified Environment.\" The Eagle Feather 7 (2010): n. pag.

Although African-American neighborhoods pulled together during these hard times, some negative reports derailed their efforts by exposing African-Americans\u2019 terrible living conditions.<ref>Govenar, A.

In 1940, the government started to revise the law to update the city appearance following the national city's beautiful movement. At the same time, some changes in zoning and rebuilding the \u201cslum\u201d started from 1943 to 1945.\n\n'''Highway\u2019s influence towards Deep Ellum'''\n\nIn 1912, the concept of highway first entered the American consciousness. Based on support from the government of Dallas, new highways were designed at a rapid rate. In the early 1940s, the railway was torn out with strong reproach from the residents, causing problems for them. However, the highway\u2019s negative influence on those neighborhoods was not reported, and it was a significant reason for the low quality of living for black people. This successfully boosted business in Deep Ellum but did not last too long. A new highway known as the Central Expressway was built by 1947 and completed by 1949. It departed from Elm town to downtown Dallas and decreased the African- American population. After two decades of debating between the city bureau and residents, most blocks from Deep Elm were removed by the requirement of the city\u2019s plan. In 1968, the freeway\u00a0construction commenced, and the majority of residents were asked to move to other places.<ref name=\"search.ebscohost.com.srv-proxy2.library.tamu.edu\"/> As Prior. M (2005) said, \u201chistorical communities in Deep Ellum were leveled to the ground because excessive speculation during the period of rising interest rates had caused the \u201cbubble\u201d of the real estate boom to explode of the 1970s and the \u201cbust\u201d of the 1980s.\u201d<ref>Prior, M., & Kemper, R.

More affluent white citizens replaced the black community because of increasing property values, which drove many homeowners out of Deep Ellum and into less expensive housing elsewhere.[5] Meanwhile, many African- American artists tried to save Deep Ellum as a historic district and their effort worked. The City of Dallas remains two blocks within historical Deep Ellum, even though the cultural and historical meaning changed and partially disappeared  over time. In the 2000 Census, Dallas had 119,624 residents and African- American occupied 20.5% of the total population and 20.2% in 2005.<ref>US Census Bureau. (2017, January 11).

Munger]] built his first cotton gin factory, the Continental Gin Company, in a series of brick warehouses along Elm Street and Trunk Avenue in Deep Ellum in 1888. As the business grew to become the largest manufacturer of cotton-processing equipment in the United States, Munger expanded the factory by adding additional structures along Trunk and Elm in 1912 and 1914, respectively. A Dallas Landmark District, the industrial complex was converted to loft apartments in 1997.\n\nIn 1914, [[Henry Ford]] selected Deep Ellum as the site for one of his earliest automobile plants. Designed by architect John Graham, who designed many regional facilities for Ford during the early 1900s, the building was constructed as an assembly plant for the famous [[Ford Model T]]. The plant remained in this location at 2700 Canton Street until the mid-1930s; [[Adam Hats]] moved into the four-story brick and Terracotta structure in 1959. The Dallas Landmark was converted to loft apartments in 1997, giving new life\u2014and adding yet another layer of history to the building.\n\nThe [[Knights of Pythias Temple (Dallas, Texas)|Knights of Pythias Temple]], also known as the Union Bankers Trust Building, is located at 2551 Elm Street. Opened in 1916, the building was designed by African-American architect [[William Sidney Pittman]], the state's first black architect and the son-in-law of [[Booker T. Washington]]. In addition to serving as the state headquarters for the Knights, the temple housed some of the city's earliest offices for black doctors, dentists and lawyers and served as the social and cultural center for the African- American community until the late 1930s. The building was Pittman's largest built work.<ref name=deepellum>{{cite book|chapter=William Sidney Pittman|pages=37\u201344|location=College Station|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|title=Deep Ellum: The Other Side of Dallas|year=2013|last1=Govenar|first1=Alan|last2=Brakefield|first2=Jay|ISBN=978-1-60344-958-8}}</ref>\n\nOther Dallas Landmarks within Deep Ellum include The Palace Shop at 2814 Main Street (ca. 1913) and Parks Brothers Warehouse at 2639 Elm Street (ca. 1923).\n\n=== Entertainment district ===\n[[File:Deep Ellum November 2017 06 (Trees).jpg|thumb|[[Trees Dallas|Trees]] in 2017]]\n\nThe 1990s were a high point for Deep Ellum as Dallas' liveliest entertainment district. At that time, Deep Ellum had become such a popular attraction that the streets often were blocked off to traffic, especially on weekends. It also spawned several events like the Deep Ellum Film Festival and Deep Ellum Arts Festival.\n\nBy 1991, Deep Ellum had 57 bars and [[nightclub]]s. There were restaurants, tattoo parlors, other diverse retail shops, and an increasing amount of high-rent residential [[loft]] space. However, over time the streets became much emptier on weekend nights than in the 1990s. New events such as the CODE (Culture of Deep Ellum) events, and Dallas Rock Meetup Group monthly festival, involve multi-venue, multi-band performances that help to maintain Deep Ellum's viability as a live music hotspot.\n\nNotable businesses of the 1990s and beyond include The Curtain Club, Deep Ellum Live (closed in 2004), [[Trees Dallas|Trees]] (closed late 2005, reopened August 2009), 2826, Club Dada (closed & reopened 2006), The Angry Dog (a restaurant, still in business), Monica's Aca y Alla (a restaurant, closed in 2012), Looker Hair Group (a salon), Galaxy Club (closed early 2007), the Green Room (closed September 2006, reopened 2010, closed 2011, reopened June 2013), and The Red Blood Club (closed & reopened 2007, and then closed again in 2008, and then reopened again in March 2014). For lovers of electronic music there is currently a notable small dancing club in East Dallas called \"It'll Do\"; which reopened its doors on June 16, 2019<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=It'll Do Club Opening|date=2012-06-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=80&v=7jTg5ypuzT0|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref> to bring a spot for lovers of electronic music to congregate.\n\nOne notable event involved Russell Hobbs, the former owner of Theatre Gallery and the Prophet Bar, who, in early 1988, converted to Christianity, closed his two still-popular clubs, and opened The Door, a Christian oriented venue. An interesting success story involved Eduardo Greene, owner of Eduardo's Aca y Alla. In the mid-1990s, Greene divorced his wife, had a highly publicized sex-change and reopened under her new name, Monica's Aca y Alla.\n\n=== Crime ===\n[[Image:Random-1.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|States of the goodwillingness of Deep Ellum's people]]\n\nFor a time, Deep Ellum struggled with a perception of a high crime rate that made people reluctant to visit the area. In mid-2006, local papers had begun to report the near-demise of the neighborhood, as a large percentage of the long-time live music venues had closed that year, leaving mostly clubs oriented more towards 'hip hop' and other music, dancing and drinking, and radically altering the \"feel\". In 2007, several additional small and medium clubs had closed, although new live-music venues spring up without warning.\n\nPerhaps the most known and tragic crime associated with the area that garnered nationwide attention was the murder of two children by their father. On May 2, 2001, [[John Battaglia]] murdered his daughters Faith and Liberty in his loft in Deep Ellum.<ref>Mervosh, Sarah. \"[http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2015/07/john-battaglia-convicted-child-killer-on-texas-death-row-loses-latest-appeal.html/ John Battaglia, Texas death row inmate who killed daughters, loses latest appeal]\".

Retrieved on March 30, 2016.</ref>\n\nThings began turning around in 2009 and 2010, as evidenced by a slew of new bar, live music venue and restaurant openings. Some of the recent and planned openings include the re-launch of the near-legendary venue Trees, old favorites such as Club Dada and The Green Room, Tucker's Blues, The Boiler Room, Anvil Pub and La Grange (now punk rock hotspot Three Links).\n\nThe area then was in a state of positive transition and on the upswing. In 2007, the City of Dallas encouraged large scale residential, multi-family dwelling construction in Deep Ellum, in hopes of making it more financially successful.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dallas City Council Addendum from 9 April 2008 \u00a7 Deep Ellum TIF District|url=http://www.dallascityhall.com/council_briefings/agendas/agendas_0408/Final%20Addendum_04092008.pdf|work=Dallas City Hall|access-date=June 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113162326/http://dallascityhall.com/council_briefings/agendas/agendas_0408/Final%20Addendum_04092008.pdf|archive-date=November 13, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dallas City Council briefing from 9 May 2012 \u00a7 Comprehensive plan|url=http://www.dallascityhall.com/council_briefings/agendas/agendas_0512/FinalCombined_05092012.pdf|work=Dallas City Hall|access-date=June 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029011555/http://dallascityhall.com/council_briefings/agendas/agendas_0512/FinalCombined_05092012.pdf|archive-date=October 29, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, several projects that improved infrastructure were undertaken such as a comprehensive repaving of the streets and roads surfaces to add more parking and make the rough and worn sections of the pavement much better for vehicular and foot traffic. Deep Ellum continues to maintain and grow its place as a cultural and musical center for the DFW Metroplex. Despite the decline of a decade ago, visitors can now walk down Elm Street on a weekend and witness hundreds of pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles, and automobiles, with dozens of venues, restaurants, storefronts, and parking lots.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 2017, the Deep Ellum Foundation established a Public Safety Program to address crime and safety concerns within the neighborhood. The addition of Dallas Police Department Supervisors and Police Officers during the areas busiest hours has led the way in making Deep Ellum a safer place for all who work and visit in the area.\n\nIn 2018, the Foundation hired its first-ever Senior Manager of Public Safety and Security, Phillip Honor\u00e9. Phillip Honor\u00e9 collaborated with business owners, residents and city leaders to improve overall public safety in the popular entertainment and arts district. The Deep Ellum Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation that exists to enhance, improve, and market the neighborhood of Deep Ellum as a whole through public safety, marketing and promotion, business development and recruitment, and general improvement efforts for the area. Reviews on the Foundation's progress are mixed.\n\nIn 2018, scooter companies flooded Deep Ellum with scooters and the city was not prepared to regulate them leading to a public safety issue due to people riding them on the sidewalk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/dallas-city-council/2019/07/13/dallas-could-add-limits-scooter-rides-address-safety-risks|title=Dallas could add more limits on scooter rides to address safety risks|date=July 13, 2019|website=Dallas News}}</ref> Motorized scooters are not allowed to be ridden in the neighborhood on the sidewalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dallascityhall.com/departments/transportation/DCH%20Documents/Dockless%20Vehicles/Sidewalk%20Riding%20Prohibition%20Area%20Map.pdf|format=PDF|title=Sidewalk Riding Prohibition Area|website=Dallascityhall.com|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, crime in Deep Ellum saw a slight increase in minor crimes after years of constant decline and improvement.

By the 1920s, the neighborhood had become a hotbed for early jazz and blues musicians, hosting the likes of [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], Huddie \"[[Lead Belly]]\" Ledbetter, and [[Bessie Smith]] in Deep Ellum clubs like The Harlem and The Palace.<ref name=\"Devil\">{{cite book|title=The Devil's Music|author=Giles Oakley|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/67 67]|isbn=978-0-306-80743-5|date=1997|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/67}}</ref>  From 1920 to 1950, the number of nightclubs, cafes and domino parlors in Deep Ellum jumped from 12 to 20.\n\nIn 1937, a columnist described Deep Ellum as:\n\n{{quote|...[the] one spot in the city that needs no [[daylight saving time]] because there is no bedtime...[It is] the only place recorded on earth where business, religion, hoodooism, gambling and stealing goes on at the same time without friction...Last Saturday a prophet held the best audience in this 'Madison Square Garden' in announcing that Jesus Christ would come to Dallas in person in 1939.

The song and the lyrics were derived from the Georgia Crackers\u2019 1927 recording, \"The Georgia Black Bottom.\" The Shelton Brothers recorded \"Deep Elem Blues\" on Decca in 1935. Despite these earlier recordings, they claimed credit for the song. The lyrics narrate white men seeking immoral and illegal entertainment in an African American part of town.<ref>Govenar and Brakefield (2013), pp. 17\u201320.</ref> The Shelton Brothers iterated the name of the district in \"Deep Elem Blues, No. 2,\"  \"What\u2019s the Matter with Deep Elem,\" and \"Deep Elm Boogie Woogie Blues.\" Dick Stabile and his Orchestra, the Texas Wanderers, and the Wilburn Brothers all invoked the district\u2019s name in separate Decca pressings.<ref>Govenar and Brakefield (2013), p. 25\u201326.</ref>\n\n\"Deep Ellum Blues\" was later performed by the [[Grateful Dead]]:\n\n{{quote|When you go down on Deep Ellum,<br />Put your money in your socks<br />'Cause them Women on Deep Ellum<br />Sho' will throw you on the rocks.\n(chorus)<br />Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Ellum Blues.<br />Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Ellum Blues.<ref name=\"paynechapVI\"/>}}\n\nFollowing World War II, the success of Deep Ellum started to fade. The ever-growing availability and use of the automobile led to the removal of the Houston and Texas Central railroad tracks\u2014to make way for [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]]\u2014and by 1956 the [[streetcar line]] had been removed. Businesses closed, residents moved to the suburbs and the music all but stopped. In 1969, a new elevation of Central Expressway truncated Deep Ellum, completely obliterating the 2400 block of Elm Street, viewed by many as the center of the neighborhood. By the 1970s, few original businesses remained.\n\n===1983\u20131999: \"Glory Days of Deep Ellum\"===\n[[File:Deep Ellum November 2017 04 (Deep Ellum Neon Sign).jpg|thumb|Deep Ellum Neon Sign]]\n\nIn 1983, the Near East Side Area Planning Study, or \"Deep Ellum Plan\", was revealed to the public. The city planned to \"downzone\" Deep Ellum, meaning that building height, population, and street width were to be carefully monitored so as to help the neighborhood maintain an artistic, historic atmosphere. Artists and musicians began to move into the area, opening up new galleries and venues, attracting young creatives to the area. Over the course of the 1980s, Deep Ellum became well known as a hot-spot for the Dallas Punk Scene.<ref name=HTO>{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas Online|first=Lisa C.|last=Maxwell|title=DEEP ELLUM|access-date=August 3, 2018|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hpd01|date=November 1, 2015|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Murray Hammond of [[Old 97's]], punk and hardcore outfits as prolific as [[Dead Kennedys]] were playing at local galleries. With the insurgence of new nightclubs and venues, Deep Ellum began to explode as a local music spot. However, throughout the mid '80s, the neighborhood still faced serious safety issues, one of which being the overwhelming presence of skinheads, but as Deep Ellum continued to expand, the threats dwindled. By 1991, over 50 nightclubs and bars had opened in Deep Ellum, including [[Trees Dallas]].<ref name=oral>Freedman, Pete (November 13, 2011).

Once Deep Ellum had gained traction as the heart of music in Dallas, popular touring artists such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Radiohead]], [[The Roots]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], and [[Fugazi]] would book shows at venues including [[Trees Dallas]] and [[The Bomb Factory]].<ref name=\"oral\" />\n\n== Graffiti ==\n{{Original research|date=December 2011 | 200px}}\n[[File:Murals along the Good Latimer Tunnel in Deep Ellum.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Murals along the Good Latimer Tunnel]]\n\nIn addition to live music, Deep Ellum was a hotbed for the emerging genre of [[street art]].  Many of the music venues used graffiti artists to advertise music shows.\n\nIn 1991, the city commissioned local artists to create murals along the [[Good-Latimer Expressway]] tunnel (a major entry to the neighborhood) in a project organized by artist Frank Campagna, which he named TunnelVisions. The tunnel was demolished in the spring of 2007 to make way for the [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART]] Green Line train. In 2009, Campagna led artists in the completion of a mural project along the re-designed Good-Latimer gateway, and subsequently, additional mural projects in the adjacent art park under the I-30 overpass at Good Latimer between Commerce and Canton streets. The wide variety of images, largely in a 'graffiti' style, have long been a popular tourist attraction.\n\nWhile street art is popular in Deep Ellum, a large portion of the murals in the area are commissioned by local businesses. Some of the most recognizable murals were created by Frank Campagna, owner of Kettle Art Gallery, and alternately known as the Godfather of Dallas Street Art, for legendary music venues such as Gypsy Tea Room and Trees. Most recently, the 42 Mural project invited a select number of artists to paint murals throughout Deep Ellum, in hopes of passing along the history and heritage of the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Deep Ellum Tunnel|url=http://www.uer.ca/locations/show.asp?locid=26134|work=Urban Exploration Resource}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Deep Ellum Tunnels|url=http://www.lowriderarte.com/hot_spot/0707_lrap_deep_ellum_tunnels_hot_spot/|work=Lowrider Arte|access-date=June 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913064737/http://www.lowriderarte.com/hot_spot/0707_lrap_deep_ellum_tunnels_hot_spot/|archive-date=September 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Transportation ==\n=== Highways ===\n* [[Image:I-345.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 345]] ([[Image:US 75.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 75 (Texas)|US 75]]/[[Image:I-45.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|I-45]] connection)\n\n([[U.S. Route 67 (Texas)|US 67]], [[U.S. Route 80 (Texas)|US 80]], and [[U.S. Route 175|US 175]] have all previously passed through parts of Deep Ellum, but are now routed onto nearby freeways.)\n\n=== Trains ===\n* '''[[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART]]''' {{DART G}}\n** [[Deep Ellum Station]]\n** [[Baylor University Medical Center Station]]\n\n== Education ==\n[[Image:North Dallas High 02.jpg|thumb|[[North Dallas High School]] serves residents north of Commerce Street]]\nDeep Ellum is served by the [[Dallas Independent School District]].\n\nResidents of Deep Ellum north of Commerce Street are zoned to Ignacio Zaragoza Elementary School, Alex W.

Four years later, Dallas was founded after the Civil War.

Although African-American neighborhoods pulled together during these hard times, some negative reports derailed their efforts by exposing African-Americans\u2019 terrible living conditions.<ref>Govenar, A.

In 1940, the government started to revise the law to update the city appearance following the national city's beautiful movement. At the same time, some changes in zoning and rebuilding the \u201cslum\u201d started from 1943 to 1945.\n\n'''Highway\u2019s influence towards Deep Ellum'''\n\nIn 1912, the concept of highway first entered the American consciousness. Based on support from the government of Dallas, new highways were designed at a rapid rate. In the early 1940s, the railway was torn out with strong reproach from the residents, causing problems for them. However, the highway\u2019s negative influence on those neighborhoods was not reported, and it was a significant reason for the low quality of living for black people. This successfully boosted business in Deep Ellum but did not last too long. A new highway known as the Central Expressway was built by 1947 and completed by 1949. It departed from Elm town to downtown Dallas and decreased the African- American population. After two decades of debating between the city bureau and residents, most blocks from Deep Elm were removed by the requirement of the city\u2019s plan. In 1968, the freeway\u00a0construction commenced, and the majority of residents were asked to move to other places.<ref name=\"search.ebscohost.com.srv-proxy2.library.tamu.edu\"/> As Prior.

More affluent white citizens replaced the black community because of increasing property values, which drove many homeowners out of Deep Ellum and into less expensive housing elsewhere.[5] Meanwhile, many African- American artists tried to save Deep Ellum as a historic district and their effort worked. The City of Dallas remains two blocks within historical Deep Ellum, even though the cultural and historical meaning changed and partially disappeared  over time. In the 2000 Census, Dallas had 119,624 residents and African- American occupied 20.5% of the total population and 20.2% in 2005.<ref>US Census Bureau. (2017, January 11). Population Change for Places With Populations of 50,000 : 2000 to 2010. Retrieved from https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/cph-series/cph-t/cph-t-3.html.</ref> By the Census resources from 1970s to 2000s, it shows how African- American diminished and disappeared.\n\n=== Industrial development ===\n[[Robert S. Munger]] built his first cotton gin factory, the Continental Gin Company, in a series of brick warehouses along Elm Street and Trunk Avenue in Deep Ellum in 1888. As the business grew to become the largest manufacturer of cotton-processing equipment in the United States, Munger expanded the factory by adding additional structures along Trunk and Elm in 1912 and 1914, respectively. A Dallas Landmark District, the industrial complex was converted to loft apartments in 1997.\n\nIn 1914, [[Henry Ford]] selected Deep Ellum as the site for one of his earliest automobile plants. Designed by architect John Graham, who designed many regional facilities for Ford during the early 1900s, the building was constructed as an assembly plant for the famous [[Ford Model T]]. The plant remained in this location at 2700 Canton Street until the mid-1930s; [[Adam Hats]] moved into the four-story brick and Terracotta structure in 1959. The Dallas Landmark was converted to loft apartments in 1997, giving new life\u2014and adding yet another layer of history to the building.\n\nThe [[Knights of Pythias Temple (Dallas, Texas)|Knights of Pythias Temple]], also known as the Union Bankers Trust Building, is located at 2551 Elm Street. Opened in 1916, the building was designed by African-American architect [[William Sidney Pittman]], the state's first black architect and the son-in-law of [[Booker T. Washington]]. In addition to serving as the state headquarters for the Knights, the temple housed some of the city's earliest offices for black doctors, dentists and lawyers and served as the social and cultural center for the African- American community until the late 1930s. The building was Pittman's largest built work.<ref name=deepellum>{{cite book|chapter=William Sidney Pittman|pages=37\u201344|location=College Station|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|title=Deep Ellum: The Other Side of Dallas|year=2013|last1=Govenar|first1=Alan|last2=Brakefield|first2=Jay|ISBN=978-1-60344-958-8}}</ref>\n\nOther Dallas Landmarks within Deep Ellum include The Palace Shop at 2814 Main Street (ca. 1913) and Parks Brothers Warehouse at 2639 Elm Street (ca. 1923).\n\n=== Entertainment district ===\n[[File:Deep Ellum November 2017 06 (Trees).jpg|thumb|[[Trees Dallas|Trees]] in 2017]]\n\nThe 1990s were a high point for Deep Ellum as Dallas' liveliest entertainment district. At that time, Deep Ellum had become such a popular attraction that the streets often were blocked off to traffic, especially on weekends. It also spawned several events like the Deep Ellum Film Festival and Deep Ellum Arts Festival.\n\nBy 1991, Deep Ellum had 57 bars and [[nightclub]]s. There were restaurants, tattoo parlors, other diverse retail shops, and an increasing amount of high-rent residential [[loft]] space. However, over time the streets became much emptier on weekend nights than in the 1990s. New events such as the CODE (Culture of Deep Ellum) events, and Dallas Rock Meetup Group monthly festival, involve multi-venue, multi-band performances that help to maintain Deep Ellum's viability as a live music hotspot.\n\nNotable businesses of the 1990s and beyond include The Curtain Club, Deep Ellum Live (closed in 2004), [[Trees Dallas|Trees]] (closed late 2005, reopened August 2009), 2826, Club Dada (closed & reopened 2006), The Angry Dog (a restaurant, still in business), Monica's Aca y Alla (a restaurant, closed in 2012), Looker Hair Group (a salon), Galaxy Club (closed early 2007), the Green Room (closed September 2006, reopened 2010, closed 2011, reopened June 2013), and The Red Blood Club (closed & reopened 2007, and then closed again in 2008, and then reopened again in March 2014). For lovers of electronic music there is currently a notable small dancing club in East Dallas called \"It'll Do\"; which reopened its doors on June 16, 2019<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=It'll Do Club Opening|date=2012-06-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=80&v=7jTg5ypuzT0|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref> to bring a spot for lovers of electronic music to congregate.\n\nOne notable event involved Russell Hobbs, the former owner of Theatre Gallery and the Prophet Bar, who, in early 1988, converted to Christianity, closed his two still-popular clubs, and opened The Door, a Christian oriented venue. An interesting success story involved Eduardo Greene, owner of Eduardo's Aca y Alla. In the mid-90's, Greene divorced his wife, had a highly publicized sex-change and reopened under her new name, Monica's Aca y Alla.\n\n=== Crime ===\n[[Image:Random-1.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|States of the goodwillingness of Deep Ellum's people]]\n\nFor a time, Deep Ellum struggled with a perception of a high crime rate that made people reluctant to visit the area. In mid-2006, local papers had begun to report the near-demise of the neighborhood, as a large percentage of the long-time live music venues had closed that year, leaving mostly clubs oriented more towards 'hip hop' and other music, dancing and drinking, and radically altering the \"feel\". In 2007, several additional small and medium clubs had closed, although new live-music venues spring up without warning.\n\nPerhaps the most known and tragic crime associated with the area that garnered nationwide attention was the murder of two children by their father. On May 2, 2001, [[John Battaglia]] murdered his daughters Faith and Liberty in his loft in Deep Ellum.<ref>Mervosh, Sarah. \"[http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2015/07/john-battaglia-convicted-child-killer-on-texas-death-row-loses-latest-appeal.html/ John Battaglia, Texas death row inmate who killed daughters, loses latest appeal]\". ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. July 15, 2015. Retrieved on March 30, 2016.</ref>\n\nThings began turning around in 2009 and 2010, as evidenced by a slew of new bar, live music venue and restaurant openings. Some of the recent and planned openings include the re-launch of the near-legendary venue Trees, old favorites such as Club Dada and The Green Room, Tucker's Blues, The Boiler Room, Anvil Pub and La Grange (now punk rock hotspot Three Links).\n\nThe area then was in a state of positive transition and on the upswing. In 2007, the City of Dallas encouraged large scale residential, multi-family dwelling construction in Deep Ellum, in hopes of making it more financially successful.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dallas City Council Addendum from 9 April 2008 \u00a7 Deep Ellum TIF District|url=http://www.dallascityhall.com/council_briefings/agendas/agendas_0408/Final%20Addendum_04092008.pdf|work=Dallas City Hall|access-date=June 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113162326/http://dallascityhall.com/council_briefings/agendas/agendas_0408/Final%20Addendum_04092008.pdf|archive-date=November 13, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dallas City Council briefing from 9 May 2012 \u00a7 Comprehensive plan|url=http://www.dallascityhall.com/council_briefings/agendas/agendas_0512/FinalCombined_05092012.pdf|work=Dallas City Hall|access-date=June 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029011555/http://dallascityhall.com/council_briefings/agendas/agendas_0512/FinalCombined_05092012.pdf|archive-date=October 29, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, several projects that improved infrastructure were undertaken such as a comprehensive repaving of the streets and roads surfaces to add more parking and make the rough and worn sections of the pavement much better for vehicular and foot traffic. Deep Ellum continues to maintain and grow its place as a cultural and musical center for the DFW Metroplex. Despite the decline of a decade ago, visitors can now walk down Elm Street on a weekend and witness hundreds of pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles, and automobiles, with dozens of venues, restaurants, storefronts, and parking lots.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 2017, the Deep Ellum Foundation established a Public Safety Program to address crime and safety concerns within the neighborhood. The addition of Dallas Police Department Supervisors and Police Officers during the areas busiest hours has led the way in making Deep Ellum a safer place for all who work and visit in the area.\n\nIn 2018, the Foundation hired its first-ever Senior Manager of Public Safety and Security, Phillip Honor\u00e9. Phillip Honor\u00e9 collaborated with business owners, residents and city leaders to improve overall public safety in the popular entertainment and arts district. The Deep Ellum Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation that exists to enhance, improve, and market the neighborhood of Deep Ellum as a whole through public safety, marketing and promotion, business development and recruitment, and general improvement efforts for the area. Reviews on the Foundation's progress are mixed.\n\nIn 2018, scooter companies flooded Deep Ellum with scooters and the city was not prepared to regulate them leading to a public safety issue due to people riding them on the sidewalk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/dallas-city-council/2019/07/13/dallas-could-add-limits-scooter-rides-address-safety-risks|title=Dallas could add more limits on scooter rides to address safety risks|date=July 13, 2019|website=Dallas News}}</ref> Motorized scooters are not allowed to be ridden in the neighborhood on the sidewalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dallascityhall.com/departments/transportation/DCH%20Documents/Dockless%20Vehicles/Sidewalk%20Riding%20Prohibition%20Area%20Map.pdf|format=PDF|title=Sidewalk Riding Prohibition Area|website=Dallascityhall.com|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, crime in Deep Ellum saw a slight increase in minor crimes after years of constant decline and improvement.

By the 1920s, the neighborhood had become a hotbed for early jazz and blues musicians, hosting the likes of [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], Huddie \"[[Lead Belly]]\" Ledbetter, and [[Bessie Smith]] in Deep Ellum clubs like The Harlem and The Palace.<ref name=\"Devil\">{{cite book|title=The Devil's Music|author=Giles Oakley|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/67 67]|isbn=978-0-306-80743-5|date=1997|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/67}}</ref>  From 1920 to 1950, the number of nightclubs, cafes and domino parlors in Deep Ellum jumped from 12 to 20.\n\nIn 1937, a columnist described Deep Ellum as:\n\n{{quote|...[the] one spot in the city that needs no [[daylight saving time]] because there is no bedtime...[It is] the only place recorded on earth where business, religion, hoodooism, gambling and stealing goes on at the same time without friction...Last Saturday a prophet held the best audience in this 'Madison Square Garden' in announcing that Jesus Christ would come to Dallas in person in 1939.

In a song called \"Take A Whiff on Me\":\n\n{{quote|Walked up Ellum an' I come down Main,<br />Tryin' to bum a nickel jes' to buy cocaine.<br />Ho, Ho, baby, take a whiff on me.<ref name=\"paynechapVI\"/>}}\n\nThe most famous song about the district was recorded in 1933 under the title of \"Deep Elm Blues\" by the Lone Star Cowboys. The song and the lyrics were derived from the Georgia Crackers\u2019 1927 recording, \"The Georgia Black Bottom.\" The Shelton Brothers recorded \"Deep Elem Blues\" on Decca in 1935. Despite these earlier recordings, they claimed credit for the song. The lyrics narrate white men seeking immoral and illegal entertainment in an African American part of town.<ref>Govenar and Brakefield (2013), pp. 17\u201320.</ref> The Shelton Brothers iterated the name of the district in \"Deep Elem Blues, No. 2,\"  \"What\u2019s the Matter with Deep Elem,\" and \"Deep Elm Boogie Woogie Blues.\" Dick Stabile and his Orchestra, the Texas Wanderers, and the Wilburn Brothers all invoked the district\u2019s name in separate Decca pressings.<ref>Govenar and Brakefield (2013), p. 25\u201326.</ref>\n\n\"Deep Ellum Blues\" was later performed by the [[Grateful Dead]]:\n\n{{quote|When you go down on Deep Ellum,<br />Put your money in your socks<br />'Cause them Women on Deep Ellum<br />Sho' will throw you on the rocks.\n(chorus)<br />Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Ellum Blues.<br />Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Ellum Blues.<ref name=\"paynechapVI\"/>}}\n\nFollowing World War II, the success of Deep Ellum started to fade. The ever-growing availability and use of the automobile led to the removal of the Houston and Texas Central railroad tracks\u2014to make way for [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]]\u2014and by 1956 the [[streetcar line]] had been removed. Businesses closed, residents moved to the suburbs and the music all but stopped. In 1969, a new elevation of Central Expressway truncated Deep Ellum, completely obliterating the 2400 block of Elm Street, viewed by many as the center of the neighborhood. By the 1970s, few original businesses remained.\n\n===1983\u20131999: \"Glory Days of Deep Ellum\"===\n[[File:Deep Ellum November 2017 04 (Deep Ellum Neon Sign).jpg|thumb|Deep Ellum Neon Sign]]\n\nIn 1983, the Near East Side Area Planning Study, or \"Deep Ellum Plan\", was revealed to the public. The city planned to \"downzone\" Deep Ellum, meaning that building height, population, and street width were to be carefully monitored so as to help the neighborhood maintain an artistic, historic atmosphere. Artists and musicians began to move into the area, opening up new galleries and venues, attracting young creatives to the area. Over the course of the 1980s, Deep Ellum became well known as a hot-spot for the Dallas Punk Scene.<ref name=HTO>{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas Online|first=Lisa C.|last=Maxwell|title=DEEP ELLUM|access-date=August 3, 2018|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hpd01|date=November 1, 2015|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Murray Hammond of [[Old 97's]], punk and hardcore outfits as prolific as [[Dead Kennedys]] were playing at local galleries. With the insurgence of new nightclubs and venues, Deep Ellum began to explode as a local music spot. However, throughout the mid '80s, the neighborhood still faced serious safety issues, one of which being the overwhelming presence of skinheads, but as Deep Ellum continued to expand, the threats dwindled. By 1991, over 50 nightclubs and bars had opened in Deep Ellum, including [[Trees Dallas]].<ref name=oral>Freedman, Pete (November 13, 2011).

Once Deep Ellum had gained traction as the heart of music in Dallas, popular touring artists such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Radiohead]], [[The Roots]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], and [[Fugazi]] would book shows at venues including [[Trees Dallas]] and [[The Bomb Factory]].<ref name=\"oral\" />\n\n== Graffiti ==\n{{Original research|date=December 2011 | 200px}}\n[[File:Murals along the Good Latimer Tunnel in Deep Ellum.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Murals along the Good Latimer Tunnel]]\n\nIn addition to live music, Deep Ellum was a hotbed for the emerging genre of [[street art]].  Many of the music venues used graffiti artists to advertise music shows.\n\nIn 1991, the city commissioned local artists to create murals along the [[Good-Latimer Expressway]] tunnel (a major entry to the neighborhood) in a project organized by artist Frank Campagna, which he named TunnelVisions. The tunnel was demolished in the spring of 2007 to make way for the [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART]] Green Line train. In 2009, Campagna led artists in the completion of a mural project along the re-designed Good-Latimer gateway, and subsequently, additional mural projects in the adjacent art park under the I-30 overpass at Good Latimer between Commerce and Canton streets. The wide variety of images, largely in a 'graffiti' style, have long been a popular tourist attraction.\n\nWhile street art is popular in Deep Ellum, a large portion of the murals in the area are commissioned by local businesses. Some of the most recognizable murals were created by Frank Campagna, owner of Kettle Art Gallery, and alternately known as the Godfather of Dallas Street Art, for legendary music venues such as Gypsy Tea Room and Trees. Most recently, the 42 Mural project invited a select number of artists to paint murals throughout Deep Ellum, in hopes of passing along the history and heritage of the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Deep Ellum Tunnel|url=http://www.uer.ca/locations/show.asp?locid=26134|work=Urban Exploration Resource}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Deep Ellum Tunnels|url=http://www.lowriderarte.com/hot_spot/0707_lrap_deep_ellum_tunnels_hot_spot/|work=Lowrider Arte|access-date=June 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913064737/http://www.lowriderarte.com/hot_spot/0707_lrap_deep_ellum_tunnels_hot_spot/|archive-date=September 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Transportation ==\n=== Highways ===\n* [[Image:I-345.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 345]] ([[Image:US 75.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 75 (Texas)|US 75]]/[[Image:I-45.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|I-45]] connection)\n\n([[U.S. Route 67 (Texas)|US 67]], [[U.S. Route 80 (Texas)|US 80]], and [[U.S. Route 175|US 175]] have all previously passed through parts of Deep Ellum, but are now routed onto nearby freeways.)\n\n=== Trains ===\n* '''[[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART]]''' {{DART G}}\n** [[Deep Ellum Station]]\n** [[Baylor University Medical Center Station]]\n\n== Education ==\n[[Image:North Dallas High 02.jpg|thumb|[[North Dallas High School]] serves residents north of Commerce Street]]\nDeep Ellum is served by the [[Dallas Independent School District]].\n\nResidents of Deep Ellum north of Commerce Street are zoned to Ignacio Zaragoza Elementary School, Alex W.

Packages can be tested for their ability to be [[recycle]]d and their ability to degrade as surface [[litter]], in a sealed [[landfill]] or under [[compost]]ing conditions.<ref>ASTM D6954 Standard Guide for Exposing and Testing Plastics that Degrade in the Environment by a Combination of Oxidation and Biodegradation</ref>\n\n== Purposes ==\nPackaging testing might have a variety of purposes, such as:\n* Determine if, or verify that, the requirements of a [[specification]], [[regulation]], or [[contract]] are met\n* Decide if a [[new product development]] program is on track: Demonstrate [[proof of concept]]\n* Provide [[Technical standard|standard]] [[data]] for other scientific, engineering, and [[quality assurance]] functions\n* Validate suitability for end-use\n* Provide a basis for  [[technical communication]]\n* Provide a technical means of comparison of several options\n* Provide [[evidence]] in legal proceedings: [[product liability]], [[patents]], product claims, etc.\n* Help solve problems with current packaging\n* Help identify potential cost savings in packaging\n\nPackaging tests can be used for:\n* Subjecting packages (and contents) to stresses and dynamics found in the field\n* Reproducing the types of damage to packages and contents found in actual shipments\n* Controlling the uniformity of production of packages or components\n\n== Importance of testing ==\n[[File:Packaging test, infestation, k7995-7.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Testing the ability of packages to resist insect infestation<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last = Cooke\n | first = Linda\n | title = Pest-Proofing Food Packaging\n | journal = Agricultural Research\n |date=March 1998\n | url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/mar98/pest0398.pdf\n | doi =\n | id =\n }}</ref>]]\nFor some types of products, package testing is mandated by regulations: [[food]]. [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[medical device]]s, [[dangerous goods]], etc.  This may cover both the design qualification, periodic retesting, and control of the packaging processes.  Processes may be controlled by a variety of [[quality management system]]s such as [[HACCP]], [[statistical process control]], validation protocols, ISO 9000, etc.\n\nFor unregulated products, testing can be required by a contract or governing specification.  The degree of package testing can often be a business decision.  [[Risk management]] may involve factors such as\n* costs of packaging\n* costs of package testing\n* value of contents being shipped\n* value of customer's good will\n* product liability exposure\n* other potential costs of inadequate packaging\n* etc.\n\nWith distribution packaging, one vital [[Packaging and labeling#Package development considerations|packaging development consideration]] is to determine if a packaged-product is likely to be damaged in the process of getting to the final customer. A primary purpose of a package is to ensure the safety of a product during transportation and storage. If a product is damaged during this process, then the package has failed to accomplish a primary objective and the customer will either return the product or be unlikely to purchase the product altogether.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kiyohide |first=Hasegawa |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=Recent Trend of Transport Packaging Test |journal=JPI Journal|volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=716\u2013722 |url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200419/000020041904A0658492.php |accessdate=16 Feb 2010 |quote= }}</ref>\n\nPackage testing is often a formal part of [[Project management]] programs.  Packages are usually tested when there is a new packaging design, a revision to a current design, a change in packaging material, and various other reasons. Testing a new packaging design before full scale manufacturing can save  time and money.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medicaldesign.com/contract-manufacturing/packaging/package_testing_risk_0608/ |title=Package Testing as Risk Management |accessdate=2010-02-16 |last= Dvorak|first= Paul|date=  June 1, 2008 |publisher= }}</ref>\n\n== Laboratory affiliation ==\nMany suppliers or vendors offer limited material and package testing as a free service to customers.  It is common for packagers to partner with reputable suppliers: Many suppliers have certified quality management systems such as [[ISO 9000]] or allow customers to conduct  technical and quality audits.  Data from testing is commonly shared.  There is sometimes a risk that supplier testing may tend to be self-serving and not completely impartial.\n\nLarge companies often have their own packaging staff and a package testing and development [[laboratory]].  Corporate engineers know their products, manufacturing capabilities, logistics system, and their customers best.  Cost reduction of existing products and cost avoidance for new products have been documented.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Johnson\n  | first = C\n  | contribution = In-House Testing of Computer Packaging\n  | year = 1995\n  | title = Distribution Packaging Technology\n  | editor-last = Fiedler\n  | editor-first = R M\n  | volume =\n  | pages =\n  | place =\n  | publisher = IoPP\n  | id =\n  }}</ref>\n\nAnother option is to use a paid [[consultant]], [[Independent contractor]], and third-party [[independent testing laboratory]].  They are commonly chosen for specialized expertise, for access to certain test equipment, for surge projects, or where independent testing is otherwise required.  Many have certifications and accreditations:  ISO 9000, [[ISO/IEC 17025]], and various governing agencies.\n\n== Procedures ==\nSeveral [[standards organizations]] publish test methods for package testing.  Included are:\n* [[International Organization for Standardization]], ISO\n* [[ASTM International]]\n* [[European Committee for Standardization]]. CEN\n* [[TAPPI]]\n* Military Standards<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Maloney\n  | first = J.

There are also many corporate test standards in use.  A review of technical literature and patents provides good options to consider for test procedures.\n\nResearchers are not restricted to the use of published standards but can modify existing test methods or develop procedures specific to their particular needs.  If a test is conducted with a deviation from a published test method or if a new method is employed, the test report must fully disclose the procedure.\n\n== Materials testing ==\n[[File:Inspekt desk 50kN IMGP8563.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Materials and components are often evaluated on a [[universal testing machine]]]]\n\nThe basis of packaging design and performance is the component materials.  The [[physical properties]], and sometimes [[chemical properties]], of the materials need to be communicated to [[packaging engineer]]s to aid in the design process.  Suppliers publish [[data sheet]]s and other technical communications that include the typical or average relevant physical properties and the test method these are based upon.  Sometimes these are adequate.  Other times, additional material and component testing is required by the packager or supplier to better define certain characteristics.\n\nWhen a final package design is complete, the specifications for the component materials needs to be communicated to suppliers.  Packaging materials testing is often needed to identify the critical material characteristics and [[engineering tolerance]]s. These are used to prepare and enforce specifications.\n\nFor example, [[shrink film]] data might include: [[tensile strength]] (MD and CD), [[elongation (materials science)|elongation]],  [[Elastic modulus]], [[surface energy]],  thickness, [[Moisture vapor transmission rate]], [[Oxygen transmission rate]], heat seal strength, heat sealing conditions, heat shrinking conditions, etc.  Average and [[process capability]] are often provided. The chemical properties related for use as  Food contact materials may be necessary.\n\n== Testing with people ==\nSome types of package testing do not use scientific instruments but use people for the evaluation.\n\nThe regulations for [[child-resistant packaging]] require a test protocol that involves children. Samples of the test packages are given to a prescribed population of children. With specified 50-child panels, a high percentage must be unable to open a test package within 5 minutes.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = CPSC Requirements under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act\n  | website =\n  | publisher = CPSC\n  | url = http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/regsumpppa.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = }}</ref>\nAdults are also tested for their ability to open a child-resistant package.\n\nConsumer packages are often evaluated by [[focus group]]s. People evaluate the package features in a room monitored by video cameras.  The consumer responses are treated qualitatively for feedback into the new packaging process.\n\nSome food packagers use [[organoleptic]] evaluations.  People use their senses (taste, smell, etc.) to determine if a package component has tainted the food in the package.\n\nA new package may be evaluated in a [[test market]] that uses people to try the packages at home.  Consumers have the opportunity to buy a product, perhaps with a coupon or discount.  Return [[postcard]]s or [[Internet]] sites provide feedback to package developers.  Perhaps the most critical feedback is repeated sales items in the new package. Packaging evaluations are an important part of [[marketing research]].\n\nLegibility of text on packaging and labels is always subjective due to the inherent variations of people. Efforts have been made to help better quantify this by people in a laboratory: still using people for the evaluation but also employing a test apparatus to help reduce variability.<ref>ASTM D7298</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | last =Bix\n | first =L\n |author2=Kosugi |author3=Wartaru |author4=Sundar |author5=Becker\n | title = The use of change detection as a method of objectively evaluating labels\n | journal = Packaging Technology and Science\n | volume =23\n | issue =7\n | pages =393\u2013401\n | date =2010\n| doi=10.1002/pts.904}}</ref>\n\nSome laboratory tests are conducted but still result in an [[observation]] by people.

The measured performance of many packages is affected by the conditioning and testing atmospheres.  For example, [[paper]] based products are strongly affected by their moisture content:  [[Relative humidity]] needs to be controlled.  Plastic products are often strongly affected by [[temperature]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marcondes |first=Jorge |author2=Hatton |author3=Graham |author4=Schueueman |date=July 2003|title=Effect of temperature on the cushioning properties of some foamed plastic materials|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201376 |id=|url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.614}}</ref>\n\nConditions of 23&nbsp;\u00b0C (73.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) and 50% relative humidity are common but other standard testing conditions are also published in material and package test standards. Engineering tolerances for the conditions are also specified.  Often the package is conditioned to the specified environment and tested under those conditions.  This can be in a conditioned room or in a chamber enclosing the test.  With some testing, the package is conditioned to a specified environment, then is removed to ambient conditions and quickly tested.  The test report needs to state the actual conditions used.\n\nEngineers have found it important to know the effects of the full range of expected conditions on package performance.  This can be through investigating published technical literature, obtaining supplier documentation, or by conducting controlled tests at diverse conditions.\n\n=== Relevant Standards ===\n:ASTM D4332- Standard Practice for Conditioning Containers, Packages, or Packaging Components for Testing\n:ASTM E171- Standard Specification for Standard Atmospheres for Conditioning and Testing Flexible Barrier Materials\n:ASTM F2825 Standard Practice for Climate Stressing of Packaging Systems for Single Parcel Delivery\n\n== Degradation of product ==\n[[File:Heat Sealing Film for Permeability Test.jpg|right|thumb|170px| [[Heat sealer]] used to prepare  bag of  lettuce for shelf life testing]]\nLaboratory tests can help determine the [[shelf life]] of a package and its contents under a variety of conditions. This is particularly important for foods, pharmaceuticals, some chemicals, and a variety of products. The testing is usually product specific: the mechanisms of degradation are often different. Exposures to expected and elevated temperatures and humidities are commonly used for shelf life testing.  The ability of packaging to control product degradation is frequently a subject of laboratory and field evaluations.\n\n=== Relevant tests ===\n:ASTM E2454 Standard Guide for Sensory Evaluation Methods to Determine the Sensory Shelf -life of Consumer Products\n:DoD 4140.27M Shelf Life Management Manual, 2000\n:ISO 11987 Ophthalmic Optics, Contact Lenses, Determination of Shelf Life\n\n=== Barrier Properties ===\n{{Main|Moisture vapor transmission rate| Oxygen transmission rate|  Carbon dioxide transmission rate}}\n\nMany products degrade with exposure to the atmosphere: foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, etc.   The ability of a package to control the [[permeation]] and penetration of gasses is vital for many types of products.  Tests are often conducted on the packaging materials but also on the completed packages, sometimes after being subjected to flexing, handling, vibration, or temperature.\n\n== Degradation of Packages ==\nPackages can degrade with exposure to temperature, humidity, time, sterilization (steam, radiation, gas, etc.), sunlight, and other environmental factors. For some types of packaging, it is common to test for possible [[corrosion]] of metals, [[polymer degradation]], and [[weather testing of polymers]].  Several types of [[accelerated aging]]  of packaging and materials can be accomplished in a laboratory.\n\nExposure to elevated temperatures accelerates some degradation mechanisms.  An [[Arrhenius equation]] is often used to correlate certain chemical reactions at different temperatures, based on the proper choice of  [[Q10 (temperature coefficient)|Q<sub>10</sub>]] coefficients.\n\nAs with any laboratory testing, validating field trials are important.\n\n=== Relevant tests ===\n:ASTM D3045 Standard Practice for Heat Aging of Plastics without Load\n:ASTM F1640 Standard Guide for Packaging Materials for Foods to be Irradiated\n:ASTM F1980\u2013 Standard Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile Medical Device Packages\n:ASTM G151 Standard Practice for Exposing Non-metallic Materials in Accelerated Test Devices that are Laboratory Light Sources\n\n== Vacuum testing ==\n[[File:Vacuum Chamber Package testing.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Vacuum chamber for testing leaks in packaging component]]\n[[Vacuum chamber]]s are used to test the ability of a package to withstand low pressures.

Package integrity and product protection are important packaging functions. Tests are conducted to measure the resistance of packages and products to controlled laboratory shock and impact.\n\nTesting also determines the effectiveness of package [[cushioning]] to isolate fragile products from [[shock (mechanics)|shock]].

The ability of [[insulated shipping container]]s to protect their contents from exposure to temperature fluctuations can be measured in a laboratory. The testing can be of empty containers or of full containers with appropriate jell or [[ice pack]]s, contents, etc.  Ovens, freezers, and environmental chambers are commonly used for this and other types of packaging.\n\nDigital [[temperature data logger]]s are used to measure temperatures experienced in different distribution systems.  This data is sometimes used to develop unique laboratory  test methods for that distribution system.\n\n=== Relevant tests ===\n:ASTM D3103-Standard Test Method for Thermal Insulation Performance of Distribution Packages\n:ISTA 7E \u2013 Testing Standard for Thermal Transport Packaging Used in Parcel Delivery System Shipment\n\n==Thermal shock==\nSome packages, particularly glass, can be sensitive to sudden changes in temperature: [[Thermal shock]].

Objective laboratory  procedures are frequently used to help determine performance.  [[Test fixture|Fixtured]] \u2018\u2019hands\u2019\u2019 of various designs are used to hold a handle (sometimes two handles for a box).  Most common are \u201cjerk testing\u2019\u2019 by modified drop test procedures or use of  the constant pull rates of a [[universal testing machine]].  Other procedures use a static force by hanging a heavily loaded package for an extended time or even using a [[centrifuge]].\n\n===Relevant tests===\n:ASTM D6804, Standard Guide for Hand Hole Design in Corrugated Boxes, Appendix\n\n== Vibration ==\n[[File:Vibration tester.png|thumb|right|170px|Vibration tester to simulate vibration\n[[Frequency|frequencies]] at which packaged products are subjected during shipments]]\n\n[[Vibration]] is encountered during shipping (vehicle vibration, rough roads, etc.) and movement on [[conveyor]]s.  Potential vibration damage may include:\n* fractures and [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] damage\n* loose wires, screw caps, etc.\n* bruises on soft products (fruit, etc.)\n* surface abrasion\n* etc.\nThe ability of a package to withstand these vibrations and to protect the contents can be measured by several laboratory test procedures.  Some allow searching for the particular frequencies of vibration that have potential for damage. [[Modal testing]] methodologies are sometimes employed. Others use specified bands of random vibration to better represent complex vibrations measured in field studies of distribution environments.\n\n=== Relevant tests ===\n:ASTM D999- Standard Test Methods for Vibration Testing of Shipping Containers\n:ASTM D3580-Standard Test Methods for Vibration (Vertical Linear Motion) Test of Products\n:ASTM D4728- Standard Test Method for Random Vibration Testing of Shipping Containers\n:ASTM D5112- Standard Test Method for Vibration (Horizontal Linear Sinusoidal Motion) Test of Products\n:ASTM D7387- Standard Test Method for Vibration Testing of Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBCs) Used for Shipping Liquid Hazardous Materials (Dangerous Goods)\n\n== Compression ==\n[[File:Army.mil-2007-02-07-153623.jpg|thumb|150 px|Compression test for steel drum]]\n{{Main|Container compression test}}\nCompression testing relates to stacking or crushing of packages, particularly shipping containers.  It usually measures of the force required to crush a package, stack of packages, or a unit load.  Packages can be empty or filled as for shipment.   A force-deflection curve used to obtain the peak load or other desired points.  Other tests use a constant load and measure the time to failure or to a critical deflection.\n\nDynamic compression is sometimes tested by shock or impact testing with an additional load to crush the test package.

A variety of standard  test schedules or protocols are available for evaluating transport packaging.  They are used to help determine the ability of complete and filled shipping containers to various types of [[logistics]] systems.  Some test the general ruggedness of the shipping container while others have been shown to reproduce the types of damage encountered in distribution.  Some base the type and severity of testing on formal studies of the distribution environment: [[instrumentation]], data loggers, and observation. Test cycles with these documented elements better simulate parts of certain logistics shipping environments.\n\n:ASTM International\n::ASTM D4169- Standard Practice for Performance Testing of Shipping Containers and Systems\n::ASTM D7386- Standard Practice for Performance Testing of Packages for Single Parcel Delivery Systems.\n:ISO\n::ISO 4180:2009   Packaging \u2013 Complete filled transport packages \u2013 General rules for the compilation of performance test schedules\n\n:International Safe Transit Association\n:: Procedure 1A: Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) or Less\n:: Procedure 1B: Packaged-Products weighing Over 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg)\n:: Procedure 1C: Extended Testing for Individual Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) or Less\n:: Procedure 1D: Extended Testing for Individual Packaged-Products weighing Over 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg)\n:: Procedure 1E: Unitized Loads\n:: Procedure 1G: Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) or Less (Random Vibration)\n:: Procedure 1H: Packaged-Products weighing Over 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) (Random Vibration)\n:: Procedure 2A: Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) or Less\n:: Procedure 2B: Packaged-Products weighing over 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg)\n:: Procedure 2C: Furniture Packages\n:: Procedure 3A: Packaged-Products for Parcel Delivery System Shipments 70&nbsp;kg (150 lb) or Less (standard, small, flat or elongated)\n:: Procedure 3B: Packaged-Products for Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipment\n:: Procedure 3E: Unitized Loads of Same Product\n:: Procedure 3F: Packaged Products for Distribution Center to Retail Outlet Shipment 100 lb (45&nbsp;kg)\n:: Procedure 3H: Performance Test for Products or Packaged-Products in Mechanically Handled Bulk Transport Containers\n:: Project 3K: Fast Moving Consumer Goods for the European Retail Supply Chain\n:: Project 4AB: Enhanced Simulation Performance Tests (online test planner)\n:: 6-FEDEX-A: FedEx Procedures for Testing Packaged Products Weighing Up to 150 lbs\n:: 6-FEDEX-B: FedEx Procedures for Testing Packaged Products Weighing Over 150 lbs\n:: 6-SAMSCLUB, Packaged-Products for Sam\u2019s Club\u00ae Distribution System Shipment\n:: Procedure 7D: Thermal Controlled Transport Packaging for Parcel Delivery System Shipment\n:: ISTA 7E: Testing Standard for Thermal Transport Packaging Used in Parcel Delivery System\n\n=== Field trials ===\n:Laboratory testing can often help identify shipping container constructions that, in general, should perform well in the field.  Of course, laboratory tests cannot fully reproduce the full range of field hazards, their magnitudes, nor their frequency.  [[Field experiment]]s are often conducted to help validate the laboratory testing.\n\n:The advantage of laboratory testing is that it subjects replicate packages to identical sets of test sequences: a relatively small number of samples often can suffice.  Field hazards, by their nature, are highly variable: thus repeated shipments do not receive the same types or magnitudes of drops, vibrations, kicks, impacts, abrasion, etc.  Because of this uncontrolled variability, more replicate sample shipments are often necessary.\n\n:Larger scale test markets are used to give additional assurance of performance and acceptability for a new or revised packaged-product.  Feedback is carefully obtained and evaluated.   Feedback on package performance continues when full production and distribution have been achieved.\n\n== Product requirements ==\nIn addition, package testing often relates to the specific product inside the package.  Some broad categories of products and special package testing considerations follow:\n\n=== Food packaging ===\nFoods categories such as fresh [[produce]], [[frozen food]]s, [[irradiated food]]s, fresh fish, [[canned food]]s, etc. have regulatory requirements and special packaging needs.  Package testing often relates to:\n:::[[Food safety]]\n:::Compatibility of the package with the food\n:::Migration of material from the packaging to the food\n:::Shelf life\n:::Barrier properties, porosity, package atmosphere, etc\n:::Special quality assurance needs, [[good manufacturing practice]]s, HACCP, validation protocols, etc\n\n=== Pharmaceutical packaging ===\nPackaging for drugs and [[pharmaceutical]]s is highly regulated.  Special testing needs include:\n:::Safety of drugs and pharmaceuticals\n:::Barrier properties\n:::Shelf life\n:::Compatibility of package with the drugs\n:::Sterility\n:::Tamper resistance, child resistance, etc\n:::Special quality assurance needs, good manufacturing practices, validation protocols, etc\n{{Main|Validation (drug manufacture)}}\n\n=== Medical Packaging ===\nPackaging for medical materials, [[medical devices]], [[health care]] supplies, etc., have special user requirements and is highly regulated. Barrier properties, durability, visibility, sterility and strength need to be controlled; usually with documented test results for initial designs and for production.\n\nAssurance of sterility and suitability for use are critical.  For example, medical devices and products are often sterilized in the package.  The sterility must be maintained throughout distribution to allow immediate use by physicians.  A series of special packaging tests is used to measure the ability of the package to maintain sterility.  [[Verification and validation]] protocols are rigidly maintained.\n\n::Relevant standards\n:::ASTM F1585 \u2013 Guide for Integrity Testing of Porous Medical Packages\n:::ASTM D3078 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Detection of Leaks in Flexible Packaging (Bubble)\n:::ASTM F1140 \u2013 Standard Test Methods for Internal Pressurization Failure Resistance of Unrestrained Packages\n:::ASTM F1608 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Microbial Ranking of Packaging Materials\n:::ASTM F1929 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Detecting Seal Strength in Porous Medical Packaging by Dye Penetration\n:::ASTM F2054 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Burst Testing of Flexible Package Seals Using Internal Air Pressurization Within Restraining Plates\n:::ASTM F2095 \u2013 Standard Test Methods for Pressure Decay Leak Test for Flexible Packages With and Without Restraining Plates\n:::ASTM F2096 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Detecting Gross Leaks in Medical Packaging by Internal Pressurization\n:::ASTM F2097 \u2013 Standard Guide for Design and Evaluation of Primary Flexible Packaging for Medical Products\n:::ASTM F2228 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Non-Destructive Detection of Leaks in Medical Packaging Which Incorporates Pourous Barrier Material by CO2 Tracer Gas\n:::ASTM F2391 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Measuring Package and Seal Integrity using Helium as the Tracer Gas\n:::ASTM F3039 - Standard Test Method for Detecting Leaks in Nonporous Packaging or Flexible Barrier Materials by Dye Penetration\n:::EN 868-1 \u2013 Packaging materials and systems for medical devices which are to be sterilized.

Documentation is important:  formal [[test method]], test report, photographs, video, etc.\n\nTesting can be a [[qualitative property|qualitative]] or [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] procedure.  Package testing is often a [[physical test]]. With some types of packaging such as food and pharmaceuticals, [[chemical test]]s are conducted to determine suitability of [[food contact materials]].  Testing programs range from simple tests with little [[replication (statistics)|replication]] to more thorough [[experimental design]]s.\n\nPackage testing can extend for the full life cycle.  Packages can be tested for their ability to be [[recycle]]d and their ability to degrade as surface [[litter]], in a sealed [[landfill]] or under [[compost]]ing conditions.<ref>ASTM D6954 Standard Guide for Exposing and Testing Plastics that Degrade in the Environment by a Combination of Oxidation and Biodegradation</ref>\n\n== Purposes ==\nPackaging testing might have a variety of purposes, such as:\n* Determine if, or verify that, the requirements of a [[specification]], [[regulation]], or [[contract]] are met\n* Decide if a [[new product development]] program is on track: Demonstrate [[proof of concept]]\n* Provide [[Technical standard|standard]] [[data]] for other scientific, engineering, and [[quality assurance]] functions\n* Validate suitability for end-use\n* Provide a basis for  [[technical communication]]\n* Provide a technical means of comparison of several options\n* Provide [[evidence]] in legal proceedings: [[product liability]], [[patents]], product claims, etc.\n* Help solve problems with current packaging\n* Help identify potential cost savings in packaging\n\nPackaging tests can be used for:\n* Subjecting packages (and contents) to stresses and dynamics found in the field\n* Reproducing the types of damage to packages and contents found in actual shipments\n* Controlling the uniformity of production of packages or components\n\n== Importance of testing ==\n[[File:Packaging test, infestation, k7995-7.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Testing the ability of packages to resist insect infestation<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last = Cooke\n | first = Linda\n | title = Pest-Proofing Food Packaging\n | journal = Agricultural Research\n |date=March 1998\n | url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/mar98/pest0398.pdf\n | doi =\n | id =\n }}</ref>]]\nFor some types of products, package testing is mandated by regulations: [[food]]. [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[medical device]]s, [[dangerous goods]], etc.  This may cover both the design qualification, periodic retesting, and control of the packaging processes.  Processes may be controlled by a variety of [[quality management system]]s such as [[HACCP]], [[statistical process control]], validation protocols, ISO 9000, etc.\n\nFor unregulated products, testing can be required by a contract or governing specification.  The degree of package testing can often be a business decision.  [[Risk management]] may involve factors such as\n* costs of packaging\n* costs of package testing\n* value of contents being shipped\n* value of customer\u2019s good will\n* product liability exposure\n* other potential costs of inadequate packaging\n* etc.\n\nWith distribution packaging, one vital [[Packaging and labeling#Package development considerations|packaging development consideration]] is to determine if a packaged-product is likely to be damaged in the process of getting to the final customer. A primary purpose of a package is to ensure the safety of a product during transportation and storage. If a product is damaged during this process, then the package has failed to accomplish a primary objective and the customer will either return the product or be unlikely to purchase the product altogether.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kiyohide |first=Hasegawa |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=Recent Trend of Transport Packaging Test |journal=JPI Journal|volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=716\u2013722 |url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200419/000020041904A0658492.php |accessdate=16 Feb 2010 |quote= }}</ref>\n\nPackage testing is often a formal part of [[Project management]] programs.  Packages are usually tested when there is a new packaging design, a revision to a current design, a change in packaging material, and various other reasons. Testing a new packaging design before full scale manufacturing can save  time and money.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medicaldesign.com/contract-manufacturing/packaging/package_testing_risk_0608/ |title=Package Testing as Risk Management |accessdate=2010-02-16 |last= Dvorak|first= Paul|date=  June 1, 2008 |publisher= }}</ref>\n\n== Laboratory affiliation ==\nMany suppliers or vendors offer limited material and package testing as a free service to customers.  It is common for packagers to partner with reputable suppliers: Many suppliers have certified quality management systems such as [[ISO 9000]] or allow customers to conduct  technical and quality audits.  Data from testing is commonly shared.  There is sometimes a risk that supplier testing may tend to be self-serving and not completely impartial.\n\nLarge companies often have their own packaging staff and a package testing and development [[laboratory]].  Corporate engineers know their products, manufacturing capabilities, logistics system, and their customers best.  Cost reduction of existing products and cost avoidance for new products have been documented.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Johnson\n  | first = C\n  | contribution = In-House Testing of Computer Packaging\n  | year = 1995\n  | title = Distribution Packaging Technology\n  | editor-last = Fiedler\n  | editor-first = R M\n  | volume =\n  | pages =\n  | place =\n  | publisher = IoPP\n  | id =\n  }}</ref>\n\nAnother option is to use a paid [[consultant]], [[Independent contractor]], and third-party [[independent testing laboratory]].  They are commonly chosen for specialized expertise, for access to certain test equipment, for surge projects, or where independent testing is otherwise required.  Many have certifications and accreditations:  ISO 9000, [[ISO/IEC 17025]], and various governing agencies.\n\n== Procedures ==\nSeveral [[standards organizations]] publish test methods for package testing.  Included are:\n* [[International Organization for Standardization]], ISO\n* [[ASTM International]]\n* [[European Committee for Standardization]]. CEN\n* [[TAPPI]]\n* Military Standards<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Maloney\n  | first = J.

There are also many corporate test standards in use.  A review of technical literature and patents provides good options to consider for test procedures.\n\nResearchers are not restricted to the use of published standards but can modify existing test methods or develop procedures specific to their particular needs.  If a test is conducted with a deviation from a published test method or if a new method is employed, the test report must fully disclose the procedure.\n\n== Materials testing ==\n[[File:Inspekt desk 50kN IMGP8563.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Materials and components are often evaluated on a [[universal testing machine]]]]\n\nThe basis of packaging design and performance is the component materials.  The [[physical properties]], and sometimes [[chemical properties]], of the materials need to be communicated to [[packaging engineer]]s to aid in the design process.  Suppliers publish [[data sheet]]s and other technical communications that include the typical or average relevant physical properties and the test method these are based upon.  Sometimes these are adequate.  Other times, additional material and component testing is required by the packager or supplier to better define certain characteristics.\n\nWhen a final package design is complete, the specifications for the component materials needs to be communicated to suppliers.  Packaging materials testing is often needed to identify the critical material characteristics and [[engineering tolerance]]s. These are used to prepare and enforce specifications.\n\nFor example, [[shrink film]] data might include: [[tensile strength]] (MD and CD), [[elongation (materials science)|elongation]],  [[Elastic modulus]], [[surface energy]],  thickness, [[Moisture vapor transmission rate]], [[Oxygen transmission rate]], heat seal strength, heat sealing conditions, heat shrinking conditions, etc.  Average and [[process capability]] are often provided. The chemical properties related for use as  Food contact materials may be necessary.\n\n== Testing with people ==\nSome types of package testing do not use scientific instruments but use people for the evaluation.\n\nThe regulations for [[child-resistant packaging]] require a test protocol that involves children. Samples of the test packages are given to a prescribed population of children. With specified 50-child panels, a high percentage must be unable to open a test package within 5 minutes.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = CPSC Requirements under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act\n  | website =\n  | publisher = CPSC\n  | url = http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/regsumpppa.pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = }}</ref>\nAdults are also tested for their ability to open a child-resistant package.\n\nConsumer packages are often evaluated by [[focus group]]s. People evaluate the package features in a room monitored by video cameras.  The consumer responses are treated qualitatively for feedback into the new packaging process.\n\nSome food packagers use [[organoleptic]] evaluations.  People use their senses (taste, smell, etc.) to determine if a package component has tainted the food in the package.\n\nA new package may be evaluated in a [[test market]] that uses people to try the packages at home.  Consumers have the opportunity to buy a product, perhaps with a coupon or discount.  Return [[postcard]]s or [[Internet]] sites provide feedback to package developers.  Perhaps the most critical feedback is repeated sales items in the new package. Packaging evaluations are an important part of [[marketing research]].\n\nLegibility of text on packaging and labels is always subjective due to the inherent variations of people. Efforts have been made to help better quantify this by people in a laboratory: still using people for the evaluation but also employing a test apparatus to help reduce variability.<ref>ASTM D7298</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | last =Bix\n | first =L\n |author2=Kosugi |author3=Wartaru |author4=Sundar |author5=Becker\n | title = The use of change detection as a method of objectively evaluating labels\n | journal = Packaging Technology and Science\n | volume =23\n | issue =7\n | pages =393\u2013401\n | date =2010\n| doi=10.1002/pts.904}}</ref>\n\nSome laboratory tests are conducted but still result in an [[observation]] by people.

The measured performance of many packages is affected by the conditioning and testing atmospheres.  For example, [[paper]] based products are strongly affected by their moisture content:  [[Relative humidity]] needs to be controlled.  Plastic products are often strongly affected by [[temperature]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marcondes |first=Jorge |author2=Hatton |author3=Graham |author4=Schueueman |date=July 2003|title=Effect of temperature on the cushioning properties of some foamed plastic materials|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201376 |id=|url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1002/pts.614}}</ref>\n\nConditions of 23&nbsp;\u00b0C (73.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) and 50% relative humidity are common but other standard testing conditions are also published in material and package test standards. Engineering tolerances for the conditions are also specified.  Often the package is conditioned to the specified environment and tested under those conditions.  This can be in a conditioned room or in a chamber enclosing the test.  With some testing, the package is conditioned to a specified environment, then is removed to ambient conditions and quickly tested.  The test report needs to state the actual conditions used.\n\nEngineers have found it important to know the effects of the full range of expected conditions on package performance.  This can be through investigating published technical literature, obtaining supplier documentation, or by conducting controlled tests at diverse conditions.\n\n=== Relevant Standards ===\n:ASTM D4332- Standard Practice for Conditioning Containers, Packages, or Packaging Components for Testing\n:ASTM E171- Standard Specification for Standard Atmospheres for Conditioning and Testing Flexible Barrier Materials\n:ASTM F2825 Standard Practice for Climate Stressing of Packaging Systems for Single Parcel Delivery\n\n== Degradation of product ==\n[[File:Heat Sealing Film for Permeability Test.jpg|right|thumb|170px| [[Heat sealer]] used to prepare  bag of  lettuce for shelf life testing]]\nLaboratory tests can help determine the [[shelf life]] of a package and its contents under a variety of conditions. This is particularly important for foods, pharmaceuticals, some chemicals, and a variety of products. The testing is usually product specific: the mechanisms of degradation are often different. Exposures to expected and elevated temperatures and humidities are commonly used for shelf life testing.  The ability of packaging to control product degradation is frequently a subject of laboratory and field evaluations.\n\n=== Relevant tests ===\n:ASTM E2454 Standard Guide for Sensory Evaluation Methods to Determine the Sensory Shelf -life of Consumer Products\n:DoD 4140.27M Shelf Life Management Manual, 2000\n:ISO 11987 Ophthalmic Optics, Contact Lenses, Determination of Shelf Life\n\n=== Barrier Properties ===\n{{Main|Moisture vapor transmission rate| Oxygen transmission rate|  Carbon dioxide transmission rate}}\n\nMany products degrade with exposure to the atmosphere: foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, etc.   The ability of a package to control the [[permeation]] and penetration of gasses is vital for many types of products.  Tests are often conducted on the packaging materials but also on the completed packages, sometimes after being subjected to flexing, handling, vibration, or temperature.\n\n== Degradation of Packages ==\nPackages can degrade with exposure to temperature, humidity, time, sterilization (steam, radiation, gas, etc.), sunlight, and other environmental factors. For some types of packaging, it is common to test for possible [[corrosion]] of metals, [[polymer degradation]], and [[weather testing of polymers]].  Several types of [[accelerated aging]]  of packaging and materials can be accomplished in a laboratory.\n\nExposure to elevated temperatures accelerates some degradation mechanisms.  An [[Arrhenius equation]] is often used to correlate certain chemical reactions at different temperatures, based on the proper choice of  [[Q10 (temperature coefficient)|Q<sub>10</sub>]] coefficients.\n\nAs with any laboratory testing, validating field trials are important.\n\n=== Relevant tests ===\n:ASTM D3045 Standard Practice for Heat Aging of Plastics without Load\n:ASTM F1640 Standard Guide for Packaging Materials for Foods to be Irradiated\n:ASTM F1980\u2013 Standard Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile Medical Device Packages\n:ASTM G151 Standard Practice for Exposing Non-metallic Materials in Accelerated Test Devices that are Laboratory Light Sources\n\n== Vacuum testing ==\n[[File:Vacuum Chamber Package testing.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Vacuum chamber for testing leaks in packaging component]]\n[[Vacuum chamber]]s are used to test the ability of a package to withstand low pressures.

Package integrity and product protection are important packaging functions. Tests are conducted to measure the resistance of packages and products to controlled laboratory shock and impact.\n\nTesting also determines the effectiveness of package [[cushioning]] to isolate fragile products from [[shock (mechanics)|shock]].

The ability of [[insulated shipping container]]s to protect their contents from exposure to temperature fluctuations can be measured in a laboratory. The testing can be of empty containers or of full containers with appropriate jell or [[ice pack]]s, contents, etc.  Ovens, freezers, and environmental chambers are commonly used for this and other types of packaging.\n\nDigital [[temperature data logger]]s are used to measure temperatures experienced in different distribution systems.

It usually measures of the force required to crush a package, stack of packages, or a unit load.  Packages can be empty or filled as for shipment.   A force-deflection curve used to obtain the peak load or other desired points.  Other tests use a constant load and measure the time to failure or to a critical deflection.\n\nDynamic compression is sometimes tested by shock or impact testing with an additional load to crush the test package.

A variety of standard  test schedules or protocols are available for evaluating transport packaging.  They are used to help determine the ability of complete and filled shipping containers to various types of [[logistics]] systems.  Some test the general ruggedness of the shipping container while others have been shown to reproduce the types of damage encountered in distribution.  Some base the type and severity of testing on formal studies of the distribution environment: [[instrumentation]], data loggers, and observation. Test cycles with these documented elements better simulate parts of certain logistics shipping environments.\n\n:ASTM International\n::ASTM D4169- Standard Practice for Performance Testing of Shipping Containers and Systems\n::ASTM D7386- Standard Practice for Performance Testing of Packages for Single Parcel Delivery Systems.\n:ISO\n::ISO 4180:2009   Packaging \u2013 Complete filled transport packages \u2013 General rules for the compilation of performance test schedules\n\n:International Safe Transit Association\n:: Procedure 1A: Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) or Less\n:: Procedure 1B: Packaged-Products weighing Over 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg)\n:: Procedure 1C: Extended Testing for Individual Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) or Less\n:: Procedure 1D: Extended Testing for Individual Packaged-Products weighing Over 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg)\n:: Procedure 1E: Unitized Loads\n:: Procedure 1G: Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) or Less (Random Vibration)\n:: Procedure 1H: Packaged-Products weighing Over 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) (Random Vibration)\n:: Procedure 2A: Packaged-Products weighing 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg) or Less\n:: Procedure 2B: Packaged-Products weighing over 150 lb (68&nbsp;kg)\n:: Procedure 2C: Furniture Packages\n:: Procedure 3A: Packaged-Products for Parcel Delivery System Shipments 70&nbsp;kg (150 lb) or Less (standard, small, flat or elongated)\n:: Procedure 3B: Packaged-Products for Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipment\n:: Procedure 3E: Unitized Loads of Same Product\n:: Procedure 3F: Packaged Products for Distribution Center to Retail Outlet Shipment 100 lb (45&nbsp;kg)\n:: Procedure 3H: Performance Test for Products or Packaged-Products in Mechanically Handled Bulk Transport Containers\n:: Project 3K: Fast Moving Consumer Goods for the European Retail Supply Chain\n:: Project 4AB: Enhanced Simulation Performance Tests (online test planner)\n:: 6-FEDEX-A: FedEx Procedures for Testing Packaged Products Weighing Up to 150 lbs\n:: 6-FEDEX-B: FedEx Procedures for Testing Packaged Products Weighing Over 150 lbs\n:: 6-SAMSCLUB, Packaged-Products for Sam\u2019s Club\u00ae Distribution System Shipment\n:: Procedure 7D: Thermal Controlled Transport Packaging for Parcel Delivery System Shipment\n:: ISTA 7E: Testing Standard for Thermal Transport Packaging Used in Parcel Delivery System\n\n=== Field trials ===\n:Laboratory testing can often help identify shipping container constructions that, in general, should perform well in the field.  Of course, laboratory tests cannot fully reproduce the full range of field hazards, their magnitudes, nor their frequency.  [[Field experiment]]s are often conducted to help validate the laboratory testing.\n\n:The advantage of laboratory testing is that it subjects replicate packages to identical sets of test sequences: a relatively small number of samples often can suffice.  Field hazards, by their nature, are highly variable: thus repeated shipments do not receive the same types or magnitudes of drops, vibrations, kicks, impacts, abrasion, etc.  Because of this uncontrolled variability, more replicate sample shipments are often necessary.\n\n:Larger scale test markets are used to give additional assurance of performance and acceptability for a new or revised packaged-product.  Feedback is carefully obtained and evaluated.   Feedback on package performance continues when full production and distribution have been achieved.\n\n== Product requirements ==\nIn addition, package testing often relates to the specific product inside the package.  Some broad categories of products and special package testing considerations follow:\n\n=== Food packaging ===\nFoods categories such as fresh [[produce]], [[frozen food]]s, [[irradiated food]]s, fresh fish, [[canned food]]s, etc. have regulatory requirements and special packaging needs.  Package testing often relates to:\n:::[[Food safety]]\n:::Compatibility of the package with the food\n:::Migration of material from the packaging to the food\n:::Shelf life\n:::Barrier properties, porosity, package atmosphere, etc\n:::Special quality assurance needs, [[good manufacturing practice]]s, HACCP, validation protocols, etc\n\n=== Pharmaceutical packaging ===\nPackaging for drugs and [[pharmaceutical]]s is highly regulated.  Special testing needs include:\n:::Safety of drugs and pharmaceuticals\n:::Barrier properties\n:::Shelf life\n:::Compatibility of package with the drugs\n:::Sterility\n:::Tamper resistance, child resistance, etc\n:::Special quality assurance needs, good manufacturing practices, validation protocols, etc\n{{Main|Validation (drug manufacture)}}\n\n=== Medical Packaging ===\nPackaging for medical materials, [[medical devices]], [[health care]] supplies, etc., have special user requirements and is highly regulated. Barrier properties, durability, visibility, sterility and strength need to be controlled; usually with documented test results for initial designs and for production.\n\nAssurance of sterility and suitability for use are critical.  For example, medical devices and products are often sterilized in the package.  The sterility must be maintained throughout distribution to allow immediate use by physicians.  A series of special packaging tests is used to measure the ability of the package to maintain sterility.  [[Verification and validation]] protocols are rigidly maintained.\n\n::Relevant standards\n:::ASTM F1585 \u2013 Guide for Integrity Testing of Porous Medical Packages\n:::ASTM D3078 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Detection of Leaks in Flexible Packaging (Bubble)\n:::ASTM F1140 \u2013 Standard Test Methods for Internal Pressurization Failure Resistance of Unrestrained Packages\n:::ASTM F1608 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Microbial Ranking of Packaging Materials\n:::ASTM F1929 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Detecting Seal Strength in Porous Medical Packaging by Dye Penetration\n:::ASTM F2054 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Burst Testing of Flexible Package Seals Using Internal Air Pressurization Within Restraining Plates\n:::ASTM F2095 \u2013 Standard Test Methods for Pressure Decay Leak Test for Flexible Packages With and Without Restraining Plates\n:::ASTM F2096 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Detecting Gross Leaks in Medical Packaging by Internal Pressurization\n:::ASTM F2097 \u2013 Standard Guide for Design and Evaluation of Primary Flexible Packaging for Medical Products\n:::ASTM F2228 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Non-Destructive Detection of Leaks in Medical Packaging Which Incorporates Pourous Barrier Material by CO2 Tracer Gas\n:::ASTM F2391 \u2013 Standard Test Method for Measuring Package and Seal Integrity using Helium as the Tracer Gas\n:::ASTM F3039 - Standard Test Method for Detecting Leaks in Nonporous Packaging or Flexible Barrier Materials by Dye Penetration\n:::EN 868-1 \u2013 Packaging materials and systems for medical devices which are to be sterilized.

There are some material and construction requirements but also performance testing is required. The testing is based on the packing group (hazard level) of the contents, the quantity of material, and the type of container.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = How to Comply with Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations\n  | website =\n  | publisher = US DoT\n  | url = http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/hazmat/complyhmregs.htm#hm\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n:::Relevant standards\n:::ASTM D4919- Standard Specification for Testing of Hazardous Materials Packaging\n:::ASTM D7387- Standard Test Method for Vibration Testing of Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBCs) Used for Shipping Liquid Hazardous Materials (Dangerous Goods)\n:::ASTM D7760 Standard Guide for Conducting Internal Pressure Tests on United Nations (UN) Packagings\n:::ASTM D7887 Standard Guide for Selection of Substitute, Non-hazardous, Liquid Filling Substances for Packagings Subjected to the United Nations Performance Tests\n:::ASTM D7790: Standard Guide for Preparation of Plastic Packagings Containing Liquids for United Nations (UN) Drop Testing\n\n:::[[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods]]\n:::ISO 16104 \u2013 2003  Packaging \u2013 Transport packaging for dangerous goods \u2013 Test methods\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Data analysis]]\n* [[Nondestructive testing]]\n* [[Verification and validation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Books, General References ===\n* ASTM STP 1294  Durability Testing of Nonmetallic Materials, 1996\n* Lockhart, H., and Paine, F.A.,  \"Packaging of Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Products\", 2006, Blackie, {{ISBN|0-7514-0167-6}}\n* Meisner, \"Transport Packaging\", Third Edition, IoPP, 2016\n* Pilchik, R., \"Validating Medical Packaging\" 2002, {{ISBN|1-56676-807-1}}\n* Robertson, G.
