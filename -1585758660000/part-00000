Brookline borders six of [[Boston]]'s neighborhoods: [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], [[Allston]], [[Fenway\u2013Kenmore]], [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]], [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[West Roxbury]]. The city of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] lies to the west of Brookline.\n\nAt the 2010 census, the population of the town was 58,732. It is the most populous municipality in Massachusetts to have a [[New England town|town]] (rather than city) form of government.\n\nBrookline was first settled in 1638 as a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in Boston, but was incorporated as a separate town in 1705.\n\nBrookline was the birthplace and hometown of [[John F. Kennedy]], 35th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dorchester 1858.jpg|thumb|right|1858 map of north-central Norfolk County, showing Brookline (upper left) along with Dorchester, Roxbury and West Roxbury, all three of which were later annexed by Boston]]\n\nOnce part of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] territory, Brookline was first settled by [[White people|European]] colonists in the early 17th century. The area was an outlying part of the colonial settlement of Boston and known as the hamlet of Muddy River. In 1705, it was incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The northern and southern borders of the town were marked by two small rivers or brooks, hence the name. The northern border with Brighton (which was itself part of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] until 1807) was Smelt Brook. (That name appears on maps starting at least as early as 1852, but sometime between 1888 and 1925 the brook was covered over.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html Packard's Corner: Once and Future City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725072914/http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html |date=July 25, 2009 }}</ref>) The southern boundary, abutting Boston, was the [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]].\n\nThe Town of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline border was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. This merger created a narrow strip of land along the [[Charles River]] belonging to Boston, cutting Brookline off from the shoreline. It also put certain lands north of the Muddy River on the Boston side, including what are now [[Kenmore Square]] and [[Packard's Corner]]. The current northern border follows Commonwealth Avenue, and on the northeast, St. Mary's Street. When [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] designed the [[Emerald Necklace]] of parks and parkways for Boston in the 1890s, the Muddy River was integrated into the [[Riverway]] and [[Olmsted Park]], creating parkland accessible by both Boston and Brookline residents.\n\nThroughout its history, Brookline has resisted being annexed by Boston, in particular during the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]]. The neighboring towns of [[West Roxbury]] and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]] connected Brookline to the rest of Norfolk County until they were annexed by Boston in 1874 and 1912, respectively, putting them in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]. Brookline is now separated from the remainder of Norfolk County.\n\nBrookline has long been regarded as a pleasant and verdant environment. In the 1841 edition of the ''Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening'', Andrew Jackson Downing described the area this way:\n{{quote|The whole of this neighborhood of Brookline is a kind of landscape garden, and there is nothing in America of the sort, so inexpressibly charming as the lanes which lead from one cottage, or villa, to another. No animals are allowed to run at large, and the open gates, with tempting vistas and glimpses under the pendent boughs, give it quite an Arcadian air of rural freedom and enjoyment. These lanes are clothed with a profusion of trees and wild shrubbery, often almost to the carriage tracks, and curve and wind about, in a manner quite bewildering to the stranger who attempts to thread them alone; and there are more hints here for the lover of the picturesque in lanes than we ever saw assembled together in so small a compass.<ref>[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html Arnold Arboretum Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202082944/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html |date=February 2, 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nBrookline residents were among the first in the country to propose extending the vote to women. [[Benjamin F. Butler]], in his 1882 campaign for Governor, advocated the idea.<ref>John Gould Curtis, History of the Town of Brookline Massachusetts, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York, 1933, pg.305</ref>\n\n===Transportation history===\nTwo branches of upper [[Boston Post Road]], established in the 1670s, passed through Brookline. Brookline Village was the original center of retail activity.<ref>[http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html Brookline Village] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008104829/http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}</ref> In 1810, the Boston and Worcester Turnpike, now [[Massachusetts Route 9]], was laid out, starting on [[Huntington Avenue]] in Boston and passing through the village center on its way west.\n\nSteam railroads came to Brookline in the middle of the 19th century. The [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] was constructed in the early 1830s, and passed through Brookline near the Charles River. The rail line is still in active use, now paralleled by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. The Highland Branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] was built from Kenmore Square to Brookline Village in 1847, and was extended into Newton in 1852. In the late 1950s, this would become the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]].\n\nThe portion of Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square was laid out in 1850.  [[Streetcar]] tracks were laid above ground on Beacon Street in 1888, from [[Coolidge Corner]] to [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in Boston, via Kenmore Square.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org/history/presComm/beaconSt.asp|title=History of Beacon St.|website=www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  In 1889, they were electrified and extended over the Brighton border at [[Cleveland Circle]]. They would eventually become the [[Green Line \"C\" Branch]].\n\nThanks to the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] system, this upgrade from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to electric trolleys occurred on many major streets all over the region, and made transportation into downtown Boston faster and cheaper. Much of Brookline was developed into a [[streetcar suburb]], with large brick apartment buildings sprouting up along the new streetcar lines.\n\n===Etymology===\nBrookline was known as the hamlet of '''Muddy River''' and was considered part of Boston until the Town of Brookline was independently incorporated in 1705.  (The [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]] was used as the Brookline\u2013Boston border at incorporation.) It is said that the name derives from a farm therein once owned by Judge [[Samuel Sewall]].<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Dudley, Dean (1871)\n| title =Brookline, Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury Directory for 1871; Containing a General Directory of the Residents, Town Registers, Business Directory, Map, &c., &c.\n| year = 1871\n| publisher=Dean Dudley & Co.\n| location =  Boston\n| isbn =\n| pages = 15\u201316\n| quote = The name of Brookline came, as the late Rev. Samuel Sewall (great grandson of Judge Samuel Sewall) conjectures, from one of the farms within its bounds, namely the Gates' farm, hired of Judge Sewall, which was probably called Brookline because Smelt-brook, running through it, formed the line between that and one of the neighboring farms, and this brook also separated that farm from Cambridge.  Judge Sewall, in his journal, often mentions the name \"Brookline\" before the town was incorporated.  Rev. Mr. S. also thinks it was Judge Sewall that suggested that name for the town.}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Brookline has a total area of {{convert|17.7|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, all but {{convert|0.1|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} (0.44%) of which is land.\n\nThe northern part of Brookline, roughly north of the D-line tracks, is urban in character, as highly walkable and transit rich. The population density of this part of town is nearly {{convert|20,000|PD/sqmi|-3}}, on a par with the densest neighborhoods in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], Massachusetts (the densest cities in New England), and just below that of central Boston's residential districts (Back Bay, South End, Fenway, etc.).  The overall density of Brookline, which also includes suburban districts and grand estates south of the D-line, is still higher than that of many of the largest cities in the United States, especially in the South and West.  Brookline borders [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] (part of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]) to the west and [[Boston]] (part of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) in all other directions; it is therefore non-contiguous with any other part of Norfolk County.  Brookline became an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] in 1873, when the neighboring town of [[West Roxbury]] was annexed by Boston (and left Norfolk County to join [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]), and Brookline refused to be annexed by Boston after the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]].\n\nBrookline separates the bulk of the city of Boston (except for a narrow neck or corridor near the [[Charles River]]) from its westernmost neighborhoods of [[Allston\u2013Brighton]], which had been the separate town of Brighton until annexed by Boston in 1873.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\nThere are many neighborhood associations, some of which overlap.<ref>{{cite web |title=Map - Brookline Neighborhood Alliance

Brookline borders six of [[Boston]]'s neighborhoods: [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], [[Allston]], [[Fenway\u2013Kenmore]], [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]], [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[West Roxbury]]. The city of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] lies to the west of Brookline.\n\nAt the 2010 census, the population of the town was 58,732. It is the most populous municipality in Massachusetts to have a [[New England town|town]] (rather than city) form of government.\n\nBrookline was first settled in 1638 as a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in Boston, but was incorporated as a separate town in 1705.\n\nBrookline was the birthplace and hometown of [[John F. Kennedy]], 35th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dorchester 1858.jpg|thumb|right|1858 map of north-central Norfolk County, showing Brookline (upper left) along with Dorchester, Roxbury and West Roxbury, all three of which were later annexed by Boston]]\n\nOnce part of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] territory, Brookline was first settled by [[White people|European]] colonists in the early 17th century. The area was an outlying part of the colonial settlement of Boston and known as the hamlet of Muddy River. In 1705, it was incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The northern and southern borders of the town were marked by two small rivers or brooks, hence the name. The northern border with Brighton (which was itself part of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] until 1807) was Smelt Brook. (That name appears on maps starting at least as early as 1852, but sometime between 1888 and 1925 the brook was covered over.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html Packard's Corner: Once and Future City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725072914/http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html |date=July 25, 2009 }}</ref>) The southern boundary, abutting Boston, was the [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]].\n\nThe Town of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline border was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. This merger created a narrow strip of land along the [[Charles River]] belonging to Boston, cutting Brookline off from the shoreline. It also put certain lands north of the Muddy River on the Boston side, including what are now [[Kenmore Square]] and [[Packard's Corner]]. The current northern border follows Commonwealth Avenue, and on the northeast, St. Mary's Street. When [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] designed the [[Emerald Necklace]] of parks and parkways for Boston in the 1890s, the Muddy River was integrated into the [[Riverway]] and [[Olmsted Park]], creating parkland accessible by both Boston and Brookline residents.\n\nThroughout its history, Brookline has resisted being annexed by Boston, in particular during the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]]. The neighboring towns of [[West Roxbury]] and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]] connected Brookline to the rest of Norfolk County until they were annexed by Boston in 1874 and 1912, respectively, putting them in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]. Brookline is now separated from the remainder of Norfolk County.\n\nBrookline has long been regarded as a pleasant and verdant environment. In the 1841 edition of the ''Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening'', Andrew Jackson Downing described the area this way:\n{{quote|The whole of this neighborhood of Brookline is a kind of landscape garden, and there is nothing in America of the sort, so inexpressibly charming as the lanes which lead from one cottage, or villa, to another. No animals are allowed to run at large, and the open gates, with tempting vistas and glimpses under the pendent boughs, give it quite an Arcadian air of rural freedom and enjoyment. These lanes are clothed with a profusion of trees and wild shrubbery, often almost to the carriage tracks, and curve and wind about, in a manner quite bewildering to the stranger who attempts to thread them alone; and there are more hints here for the lover of the picturesque in lanes than we ever saw assembled together in so small a compass.<ref>[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html Arnold Arboretum Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202082944/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html |date=February 2, 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nBrookline residents were among the first in the country to propose extending the vote to women. [[Benjamin F. Butler]], in his 1882 campaign for Governor, advocated the idea.<ref>John Gould Curtis, History of the Town of Brookline Massachusetts, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York, 1933, pg.305</ref>\n\n===Transportation history===\nTwo branches of upper [[Boston Post Road]], established in the 1670s, passed through Brookline. Brookline Village was the original center of retail activity.<ref>[http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html Brookline Village] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008104829/http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}</ref> In 1810, the Boston and Worcester Turnpike, now [[Massachusetts Route 9]], was laid out, starting on [[Huntington Avenue]] in Boston and passing through the village center on its way west.\n\nSteam railroads came to Brookline in the middle of the 19th century. The [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] was constructed in the early 1830s, and passed through Brookline near the Charles River. The rail line is still in active use, now paralleled by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. The Highland Branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] was built from Kenmore Square to Brookline Village in 1847, and was extended into Newton in 1852. In the late 1950s, this would become the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]].\n\nThe portion of Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square was laid out in 1850.  [[Streetcar]] tracks were laid above ground on Beacon Street in 1888, from [[Coolidge Corner]] to [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in Boston, via Kenmore Square.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org/history/presComm/beaconSt.asp|title=History of Beacon St.|website=www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  In 1889, they were electrified and extended over the Brighton border at [[Cleveland Circle]]. They would eventually become the [[Green Line \"C\" Branch]].\n\nThanks to the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] system, this upgrade from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to electric trolleys occurred on many major streets all over the region, and made transportation into downtown Boston faster and cheaper. Much of Brookline was developed into a [[streetcar suburb]], with large brick apartment buildings sprouting up along the new streetcar lines.\n\n===Etymology===\nBrookline was known as the hamlet of '''Muddy River''' and was considered part of Boston until the Town of Brookline was independently incorporated in 1705.  (The [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]] was used as the Brookline\u2013Boston border at incorporation.) It is said that the name derives from a farm therein once owned by Judge [[Samuel Sewall]].<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Dudley, Dean (1871)\n| title =Brookline, Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury Directory for 1871; Containing a General Directory of the Residents, Town Registers, Business Directory, Map, &c., &c.\n| year = 1871\n| publisher=Dean Dudley & Co.\n| location =  Boston\n| isbn =\n| pages = 15\u201316\n| quote = The name of Brookline came, as the late Rev. Samuel Sewall (great grandson of Judge Samuel Sewall) conjectures, from one of the farms within its bounds, namely the Gates' farm, hired of Judge Sewall, which was probably called Brookline because Smelt-brook, running through it, formed the line between that and one of the neighboring farms, and this brook also separated that farm from Cambridge.  Judge Sewall, in his journal, often mentions the name \"Brookline\" before the town was incorporated.  Rev. Mr. S. also thinks it was Judge Sewall that suggested that name for the town.}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Brookline has a total area of {{convert|17.7|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, all but {{convert|0.1|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} (0.44%) of which is land.\n\nThe northern part of Brookline, roughly north of the D-line tracks, is urban in character, as highly walkable and transit rich. The population density of this part of town is nearly {{convert|20,000|PD/sqmi|-3}}, on a par with the densest neighborhoods in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], Massachusetts (the densest cities in New England), and just below that of central Boston's residential districts (Back Bay, South End, Fenway, etc.).  The overall density of Brookline, which also includes suburban districts and grand estates south of the D-line, is still higher than that of many of the largest cities in the United States, especially in the South and West.  Brookline borders [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] (part of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]) to the west and [[Boston]] (part of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) in all other directions; it is therefore non-contiguous with any other part of Norfolk County.  Brookline became an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] in 1873, when the neighboring town of [[West Roxbury]] was annexed by Boston (and left Norfolk County to join [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]), and Brookline refused to be annexed by Boston after the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]].\n\nBrookline separates the bulk of the city of Boston (except for a narrow neck or corridor near the [[Charles River]]) from its westernmost neighborhoods of [[Allston\u2013Brighton]], which had been the separate town of Brighton until annexed by Boston in 1873.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\nThere are many neighborhood associations, some of which overlap.<ref>{{cite web |title=Map - Brookline Neighborhood Alliance

He led the team in 12 Tours and won six of them.\n\n==Racing==\nMarcel Bidot was the son of a failed caf\u00e9 owner,<ref>The business collapsed in 1925 and Bidot had to bail out his parents with 15,000 francs and find them a home.</ref> a former racing cyclist who then ran one of the clubs in his home town of [[Troyes]], in the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] region. His son, Marcel, worked for the [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] bank in the town and rode for his father's club. He went training after work at 7pm.\nHe turned professional in 1923<ref>://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme/CyclismeFicheCoureur3141.html</ref> and at [[Alcyon]] earned 2,000 francs a month, ten times his pay at the bank.<ref>V\u00e9lo, France, 1992</ref> \"At the time you could get a good meal for 20 francs and a newspaper for 25 centimes,\" he said.\n\nHe rode every Tour de France from 1926 to 1930 and then again in 1932. His first was the longest of all Tours, at 5,745&nbsp;km with a stage of 435&nbsp;km from [[Metz]] to [[Dunkirk]]. The organiser, [[Henri Desgrange]], forbade riders from accepting mechanical help after breakdowns and his officials watched him pedalling with one foot after the other pedal broke. He stopped after a while and struggled on with the pedal tied to the crank with a leather strap. The judges finally relented and allowed him to borrow a bike from a spectator, but on condition that he used his own wheels. The bike was too small but Bidot still finished the stage.\n\nThat wasn't the end of his troubles. His [[freewheel]] broke in the [[Pyrenees]] and he could no longer turn the wheel - in the absence of a [[derailleur]], which Desgrange had also banned - to ride a lower gear. He had to ride up the col du [[Tourmalet]] and three other passes in the gear in which he had planned to ride down them. The weather was so bad that only half the field reached the end of the stage at [[Luchon]] and officials had to search inns and houses along the route to see what had happened to the others.\n\nBidot punctured on the [[Izoard]] and again a judge was there to see he accepted no help. Bidot said:\n\n:There I was in the Casse D\u00e9serte<ref>A section of the Izoard known for its lunar landscape.</ref> My fingers were solid with cold and I couldn't unstick the tyre from the rim. I tried to do it with my teeth. Impossible. Several minutes went by and then along came Meunier, the driver of the [[Alcyon]] car, and he threw me a penknife. The [[Commissaire (cycling)|commissaire]] made sure I couldn't get to it. 'I forbid you to pick it up,' he said. I had to get the tyre off with a wing-nut.'<ref>A butterfly nut holding the wheel to the forks.</ref>\n\nOf that 1926 Tour he said:\n\n:We used to set off at midnight and finish the following night, with hours between the riders. The racing was in the last 100km. We used to put two or three tubular tyres round our shoulders and even that wasn't enough. In the rain, the mountain roads became bogs. A lot of riders had wired-on tyres<ref>Racing tyres at the time were usually tubular and had to be stuck to the rim with glue; a wired-on tyre is the more traditional sort with, once removed from the wheel, a detachable inner tube.</ref> and no brakes. There was no tar on the roads, only stones and rocks.<ref>V\u00e9lo, France, 1992</ref>\n\nBidot's best placing in the Tour was fifth, in 1930, the first year of national teams. His prizes, 51,900 francs, bought him his house in St-Ly\u00e9.<ref>V\u00e9lo, France, 1992</ref> He won stages in 1928 and 1929 and was national champion in 1929.<ref>https://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme/CyclismeFicheCoureur3141.html</ref>\n\n==Management==\n\nFrance insisted that the managers of its national teams had no interest in any of the riders' sponsors.

He led the team in 12 Tours and won six of them.\n\n==Racing==\nMarcel Bidot was the son of a failed caf\u00e9 owner,<ref>The business collapsed in 1925 and Bidot had to bail out his parents with 15,000 francs and find them a home.</ref> a former racing cyclist who then ran one of the clubs in his home town of [[Troyes]], in the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] region. His son, Marcel, worked for the [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] bank in the town and rode for his father's club. He went training after work at 7pm.\nHe turned professional in 1923<ref>://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme/CyclismeFicheCoureur3141.html</ref> and at [[Alcyon]] earned 2,000 francs a month, ten times his pay at the bank.<ref>V\u00e9lo, France, 1992</ref> \"At the time you could get a good meal for 20 francs and a newspaper for 25 centimes,\" he said.\n\nHe rode every Tour de France from 1926 to 1930 and then again in 1932. His first was the longest of all Tours, at 5,745&nbsp;km with a stage of 435&nbsp;km from [[Metz]] to [[Dunkirk]]. The organiser, [[Henri Desgrange]], forbade riders from accepting mechanical help after breakdowns and his officials watched him pedalling with one foot after the other pedal broke. He stopped after a while and struggled on with the pedal tied to the crank with a leather strap. The judges finally relented and allowed him to borrow a bike from a spectator, but on condition that he used his own wheels. The bike was too small but Bidot still finished the stage.\n\nThat wasn't the end of his troubles. His [[freewheel]] broke in the [[Pyrenees]] and he could no longer turn the wheel - in the absence of a [[derailleur]], which Desgrange had also banned - to ride a lower gear. He had to ride up the col du [[Tourmalet]] and three other passes in the gear in which he had planned to ride down them. The weather was so bad that only half the field reached the end of the stage at [[Luchon]] and officials had to search inns and houses along the route to see what had happened to the others.\n\nBidot punctured on the [[Izoard]] and again a judge was there to see he accepted no help. Bidot said:\n\n:There I was in the Casse D\u00e9serte<ref>A section of the Izoard known for its lunar landscape.</ref> My fingers were solid with cold and I couldn't unstick the tyre from the rim. I tried to do it with my teeth. Impossible. Several minutes went by and then along came Meunier, the driver of the [[Alcyon]] car, and he threw me a penknife. The [[Commissaire (cycling)|commissaire]] made sure I couldn't get to it. 'I forbid you to pick it up,' he said. I had to get the tyre off with a wing-nut.'<ref>A butterfly nut holding the wheel to the forks.</ref>\n\nOf that 1926 Tour he said:\n\n:We used to set off at midnight and finish the following night, with hours between the riders. The racing was in the last 100km. We used to put two or three tubular tyres round our shoulders and even that wasn't enough. In the rain, the mountain roads became bogs. A lot of riders had wired-on tyres<ref>Racing tyres at the time were usually tubular and had to be stuck to the rim with glue; a wired-on tyre is the more traditional sort with, once removed from the wheel, a detachable inner tube.</ref> and no brakes. There was no tar on the roads, only stones and rocks.<ref>V\u00e9lo, France, 1992</ref>\n\nBidot's best placing in the Tour was fifth, in 1930, the first year of national teams. His prizes, 51,900 francs, bought him his house in St-Ly\u00e9.<ref>V\u00e9lo, France, 1992</ref> He won stages in 1928 and 1929 and was national champion in 1929.<ref>https://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme/CyclismeFicheCoureur3141.html</ref>\n\n==Management==\n\nFrance insisted that the managers of its national teams had no interest in any of the riders' sponsors. The team was run through the 1950s by Jean Bidot, his brother. He took on a job with the Simplex derailleur company and Marcel took his place in 1952. He continued to work in the wine trade.\n\nHe led the national team in 12 Tours and won six of them.

Recently, different teams have proposed novel theoretical studies on possible experimental configurations to finally observe it on Earth.\n\nIn 2014, physicists at [[Imperial College London]] proposed a relatively simple way to physically demonstrate the Breit\u2013Wheeler process.<ref name=\"phys.org\"/> The collider experiment that the physicists proposed involves two key steps. First, they would use an extremely powerful high-intensity laser to accelerate electrons to nearly the speed of light. They would then fire these electrons into a slab of gold to create a beam of photons a billion times more energetic than those of visible light. The next stage of the experiment involves a tiny gold can called a [[hohlraum]] (German for 'empty room'). Scientists would fire a high-energy laser at the inner surface of this hohlraum to create a thermal radiation field. They would then direct the photon beam from the first stage of the experiment through the centre of the hohlraum, causing the photons from the two sources to collide and form electrons and positrons. It would then be possible to detect the formation of the electrons and positrons when they exited the can.<ref name=\"phys.org\">{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2014-05-scientists-year-quest.html |title=Scientists discover how to turn light into matter after 80-year quest |date=18 May 2014 |work=Phys.org |accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s suggest that this technique is capable of producing of the order of 10<sup>5</sup> Breit\u2013Wheeler pairs in a single shot.<ref name=\"nature\">{{cite journal|authors=O.

They propose to collide two high-energy photon sources (composed of non-coherent hard x-ray and gamma-ray photons) generated from the interaction of two extremely-intense lasers on solid thin foils or gas jets. With the forthcoming generations of short-pulse extremely intense lasers, laser interaction with solid target will be the place of strong radiative effects driven by the nonlinear inverse quantum scattering. This effect, negligible so far, will become a dominant cooling mechanism for the extremely relativistic electrons accelerated above the 100-MeV level at the laser-solid interface via different mechanisms.\n\n===Multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler experiments===\nThe multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler has already been observed and studied experimentally. One of the most efficient configuration to maximize the multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler pair production consists on colliding head-on a bunch of gamma photon with a counter-propagating (or with a slight collision angle, the co-propagating configuration being the less efficient configuration) ultra-high intensity laser pulse. To first create the photons and then have the pair production in an all-in-one setup, the similar configuration can be used by colliding giga-electronvolt (GeV) electrons. Depending on the laser intensity, these electrons will first radiate gamma photons via the so-called nonlinear inverse [[Compton scattering]] mechanism when interacting with the laser pulse. Still interacting with the laser, the photons then turn into multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler electron-positron pairs.\n\nThis method has been considered In 1997 at the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]]. Researchers were able to conduct the multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler process using electrons to first create high-energy photons,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bula|first=C.|last2=McDonald|first2=K.

Recently, different teams have proposed novel theoretical studies on possible experimental configurations to finally observe it on Earth.\n\nIn 2014, physicists at [[Imperial College London]] proposed a relatively simple way to physically demonstrate the Breit\u2013Wheeler process.<ref name=\"phys.org\"/> The collider experiment that the physicists proposed involves two key steps. First, they would use an extremely powerful high-intensity laser to accelerate electrons to nearly the speed of light. They would then fire these electrons into a slab of gold to create a beam of photons a billion times more energetic than those of visible light. The next stage of the experiment involves a tiny gold can called a [[hohlraum]] (German for 'empty room'). Scientists would fire a high-energy laser at the inner surface of this hohlraum to create a thermal radiation field. They would then direct the photon beam from the first stage of the experiment through the centre of the hohlraum, causing the photons from the two sources to collide and form electrons and positrons. It would then be possible to detect the formation of the electrons and positrons when they exited the can.<ref name=\"phys.org\">{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2014-05-scientists-year-quest.html |title=Scientists discover how to turn light into matter after 80-year quest |date=18 May 2014 |work=Phys.org |accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s suggest that this technique is capable of producing of the order of 10<sup>5</sup> Breit\u2013Wheeler pairs in a single shot.<ref name=\"nature\">{{cite journal|authors=O.

They propose to collide two high-energy photon sources (composed of non-coherent hard x-ray and gamma-ray photons) generated from the interaction of two extremely-intense lasers on solid thin foils or gas jets. With the forthcoming generations of short-pulse extremely intense lasers, laser interaction with solid target will be the place of strong radiative effects driven by the nonlinear inverse quantum scattering. This effect, negligible so far, will become a dominant cooling mechanism for the extremely relativistic electrons accelerated above the 100-MeV level at the laser-solid interface via different mechanisms.\n\n===Multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler experiments===\nThe multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler has already been observed and studied experimentally. One of the most efficient configuration to maximize the multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler pair production consists on colliding head-on a bunch of gamma photon with a counter-propagating (or with a slight collision angle, the co-propagating configuration being the less efficient configuration) ultra-high intensity laser pulse. To first create the photons and then have the pair production in an all-in-one setup, the similar configuration can be used by colliding giga-electronvolt (GeV) electrons. Depending on the laser intensity, these electrons will first radiate gamma photons via the so-called nonlinear inverse Compton scattering mechanism when interacting with the laser pulse. Still interacting with the laser, the photons then turn into multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler electron-positron pairs.\n\nThis method has been considered In 1997 at the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]]. Researchers were able to conduct the multiphoton Breit\u2013Wheeler process using electrons to first create high-energy photons,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bula|first=C.|last2=McDonald|first2=K.

The song appears on their second, [[Bananarama (album)|self-titled album]] and was released as a single in the UK in 1984.\n\nIn its album version, \"Hot Line to Heaven\" is a seven-plus-minutes mid-tempo pop song.  It was edited to about three-and-a-half minutes for its single release.  After Bananarama recorded the [[soundtrack]] song \"[[The Wild Life (Bananarama song)|The Wild Life]]\" (from the film of the same name), the edited version of \"Hot Line to Heaven\" was pressed onto the ''Bananarama'' album in order to make room for the late-addition of \"The Wild Life\".  This was only a temporary pressing, however, as ''Bananarama'''s track listing was restored several months later, with the full version of \"Hot Line to Heaven\" intact.\n\nThe single did not perform well on the charts and got very limited release outside of UK.  As was the case with the ''Bananarama'' album, the dark lyrical content did not meet with mainstream acceptance and became the group's lowest charting UK single since their debut \"[[Aie a Mwana]]\", however it was the fourth release from the album.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] features the girls trying to persuade a record executive to be interested in their demo tapes. They annoy him by playing their tape and dancing around his office until the executive loses his cool and throws them out.

Rool has also been seen piloting a variety of vessels, including Gangplank Galleon, a large pirate ship in ''Donkey Kong Country'', the Flying Krock, a [[steampunk]] inspired [[flying machine]] in ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'', and the Knautilus, a fish-shaped [[submarine]] in ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!]]''.\n\nK.

During this battle, K. Rool attempts to punish the Kongs by running into them, jumping on them from above, tossing his crown, and summoning a downpour of cannonballs, presumably from the ship's mast. Halfway through the battle, K. Rool feigns defeat, causing the game's \"Kredits\" to roll. This is an attempt to deceive the player, as he gets back up soon after and must be jumped on a few more times before the battle truly ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h514y8NumNc&t=60m17s|title=Donkey Kong Country :: SPEED RUN Live (0:58:17) (101%) [SNES] by NewAgeRetroHippie #AGDQ 2014|publisher=[[Speed Demos Archive]]|date=March 3, 2014|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Donkey Kong Country 2'' ====\nIn ''Donkey Kong Country 2'', K.

This disguise complements the pirate motif of ''Donkey Kong Country 2''. The Kongs confront Kaptain K. Rool aboard the Flying Krock, a flying machine that hovers above Crocodile Isle. During this battle, they must avoid an onslaught of cannonballs and toxic gases that can either reverse the player's controls, slow them down, or briefly stun them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycMAPfCmd7s&t=51m5s|title=Donkey Kong Country 2 :: SPEED RUN Live (0:46:14) by Reflected #AGDQ 2014|publisher=[[Speed Demos Archive]]|date=March 4, 2014|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKaptain K.

Rool goes into hiding due to the destruction of Crocodile Isle. This time he kidnaps both Donkey Kong and [[Diddy Kong]], imprisons the Queen Banana Bird, and heads to the Northern Kremisphere. Here he resides in Kastle Kaos, and takes on the role of a [[helipack]]-wearing mad scientist, aptly named Baron K. Roolenstein. He tricks the heroes [[Dixie Kong]] and [[Kiddy Kong]] into believing that he has been defeated and KAOS\u2014a [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]-esque robot\u2014is responsible for kidnapping the other Kongs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/Fil-Z4oEZ3c6_edKKvtG9ysKNbXBHjmg|title=Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|publisher=[[Nintendo.com]]|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref> Once they reach the castle, they are shocked to learn that K. Rool has been the true mastermind behind the plot. He states that, \"I'd have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids\", a reference to the cartoon ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vF4MK6BJ7k&t=55m22s|title=Donkey Kong Country 3 :: SPEED RUN (0:52:47) by MorKs #AGDQ 2014|publisher=[[Speed Demos Archive]]|date=March 4, 2014|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBaron K.

During both boss fights, K. Rool utilizes electricity and technology to torment the Kongs. After being defeated for a second time, K.

Rool decides to take a more barbaric approach by planning to blow up Kong Isle with his \"Blast-o-matic\" laser.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv04LhJoKLA|title=Donkey Kong 64 - Intro Story|date=March 7, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref> K. Rool wears his traditional King attire for the majority of the game, but in the final battle against the Kongs, he wears a boxing outfit under the [[ring name]] of King \"Krusha\" K. Rool and does battle with them in front of his Kremling subordinates. This final boss fight has five rounds due to there being five playable characters, though typical [[Boxing#Professional boxing|boxing matches]] usually have up to 12 rounds. Much like in his original appearance, K. Rool attempts to trick the Kongs by playing dead. After being distracted by [[Candy Kong]] in a brief cutscene, Funky Kong delivers the final blow to the Kremling King with a mechanical boot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2UtaXj8-f8&t=48m5s|title=Donkey Kong 64 SPEED RUN in 0:53:40 by Cfox7 (Awesome Games Done Quick 2013) N64|publisher=[[Speed Demos Archive]]|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other appearances ===\n\n==== Video games ====\nIn addition to his primary roles in Rare's ''Donkey Kong Country'' games, King K.

K. Rool's first playable appearance outside of the ''Donkey Kong'' series was in ''Mario Super Sluggers''. He is the strongest right-handed batter in the game, but has poor stamina and fielding.

Players receive places in the following order of precedence:<ref name=\"Rulebook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.atptour.com/Corporate/Rulebook.aspx|title=2019 ATP Official Rulebook|publisher=ATP|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n# First, the top 7 players in the [[ATP Race|ATP Race to London]] on the Monday after the final tournament of the ATP Tour, that is, after the [[2020 Rolex Paris Masters|2020 Paris Masters]].\n# Second, up to two 2020 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam tournament]] winners ranked anywhere 8th\u201320th, in ranking order\n# Third, the eighth ranked player in the ATP rankings\nIn the event of this totaling more than 8 players, those lower down in the selection order become the alternates. If further alternates are needed, these players are selected by the ATP.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" />\n\nProvisional rankings are published weekly as the ''ATP Race to London'', coinciding with the 52-week rolling ATP rankings on the date of selection. Points are accumulated in [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]], [[ATP Tour]] and [[ATP Challenger Tour]] tournaments from the 52 weeks prior to the selection date, with points from the [[2018 ATP World Tour|previous years Tour Finals]] excluded. Players accrue points across 18 tournaments, usually made up of:\n\n* The 4 Grand Slam tournaments\n* The 8 mandatory [[ATP Masters]] tournaments\n* The best results from any 6 other tournaments that carry ranking points\n\nAll players must include the ranking points for mandatory Masters tournaments for which they are on the original acceptance list and for all Grand Slams for which they would be eligible, even if they do not compete (in which case they receive zero points). Furthermore, players who finished 2017 in the world's top 30 are ''commitment players'' who must (if not injured) include points for the 8 mandatory Masters tournament regardless of whether they enter, and who must compete in at least 4 [[ATP 500]] tournaments (though the [[Monte Carlo Masters]] may count to this total), of which one must take place after the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].  Zero point scores may also be taken from withdrawals by non-injured players from [[ATP 500]] tournaments according to certain other conditions outlined by the ATP.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" /> Beyond these rules, however, a player may substitute his next best tournament result for missed Masters and Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nPlayers may have their ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment reduced by one tournament, by reaching each of the following milestones:\n# 600 tour level matches (as of January 1, 2020),\n# 12 years of service,\n# 31 years of age (as of January 1, 2020).\nIf a player satisfies all three of these conditions, their mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment is dropped entirely. Players must be in good standing as defined by the ATP as to avail of the reduced commitment.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" />\n\nThe [[ATP Cup]] will count as an additional event in a player's rankings breakdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atptour.com/en/news/atp-cup-faqs|title=ATP Cup FAQs|accessdate=25 November 2019|publisher=ATP}}</ref>\n\n===Doubles===\nEight teams compete at the tournament, with one named alternates. The eight competing teams receive places according to the same order of precedence as in Singles.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" /> The named alternate will be offered first to any unaccepted teams in the selection order, then to the highest ranked unaccepted team, and then to a team selected by the ATP.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" /> Points are accumulated in the same competitions as for the Singles tournament. However, for Doubles teams there are no commitment tournaments, so teams are ranked according to their 18 highest points scoring results from any tournaments.\n\n==Points

Kingdom\n|defchamps=\n|defchampd=\n}}\n\nThe '''2020 [[ATP Finals]]''' (also known as the '''2020 [[Nitto Denko|Nitto]] ATP Finals''' for sponsorship reasons) is a men's [[tennis]] tournament that will be played at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O<sub>2</sub> Arena]] in London, United Kingdom, from 15 to 22 November 2020. It is the season-ending event for the highest-ranked singles players and doubles teams on the [[2020 ATP Tour]].\n\n==Tournament==\n\nThe 2020 ATP Finals will take place from 15 to 22 November at the O<sub>2</sub> Arena in London, United Kingdom. It will be the 51st edition of the tournament (46th in doubles). The tournament is run by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) and is part of the [[2020 ATP Tour]]. The event takes place on indoor hard courts. It serves as the season-ending championships for players on the ATP Tour.\nThe eight players who qualify for the event are split into two groups of four. During this stage, players compete in a round-robin format (meaning players play against all the other players in their group).\nThe two players with the best results in each group progress to the semifinals, where the winners of a group face the runners-up of the other group. This stage, however, is a knock-out stage. The doubles competition uses the same format.\n\n===Format===\n\nThe ATP Finals has a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format, with eight players/teams divided into two groups of four. The eight seeds are determined by the ATP Rankings and ATP Doubles Team Rankings on the Monday after the last ATP Tour tournament of the calendar year. All singles matches, including the final, are best of three sets with tie-breaks in each set including the third. All doubles matches are two sets (no ad) and a Match Tie-break.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nittoatpfinals.com/en/event/rules-and-format|title=Format Nitto ATP Finals|publisher=ATP|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Qualification==\n\n===Singles===\nEight players compete at the tournament, with two named alternates. Players receive places in the following order of precedence:<ref name=\"Rulebook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.atptour.com/Corporate/Rulebook.aspx|title=2019 ATP Official Rulebook|publisher=ATP|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n# First, the top 7 players in the [[ATP Race|ATP Race to London]] on the Monday after the final tournament of the ATP Tour, that is, after the [[2020 Rolex Paris Masters|2020 Paris Masters]].\n# Second, up to two 2020 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam tournament]] winners ranked anywhere 8th\u201320th, in ranking order\n# Third, the eighth ranked player in the ATP rankings\nIn the event of this totaling more than 8 players, those lower down in the selection order become the alternates. If further alternates are needed, these players are selected by the ATP.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" />\n\nProvisional rankings are published weekly as the ''ATP Race to London'', coinciding with the 52-week rolling ATP rankings on the date of selection. Points are accumulated in [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]], [[ATP Tour]] and [[ATP Challenger Tour]] tournaments from the 52 weeks prior to the selection date, with points from the [[2018 ATP World Tour|previous years Tour Finals]] excluded. Players accrue points across 18 tournaments, usually made up of:\n\n* The 4 Grand Slam tournaments\n* The 8 mandatory [[ATP Masters]] tournaments\n* The best results from any 6 other tournaments that carry ranking points\n\nAll players must include the ranking points for mandatory Masters tournaments for which they are on the original acceptance list and for all Grand Slams for which they would be eligible, even if they do not compete (in which case they receive zero points). Furthermore, players who finished 2017 in the world's top 30 are ''commitment players'' who must (if not injured) include points for the 8 mandatory Masters tournament regardless of whether they enter, and who must compete in at least 4 [[ATP 500]] tournaments (though the [[Monte Carlo Masters]] may count to this total), of which one must take place after the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].  Zero point scores may also be taken from withdrawals by non-injured players from [[ATP 500]] tournaments according to certain other conditions outlined by the ATP.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" /> Beyond these rules, however, a player may substitute his next best tournament result for missed Masters and Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nPlayers may have their ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment reduced by one tournament, by reaching each of the following milestones:\n# 600 tour level matches (as of January 1, 2020),\n# 12 years of service,\n# 31 years of age (as of January 1, 2020).\nIf a player satisfies all three of these conditions, their mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment is dropped entirely. Players must be in good standing as defined by the ATP as to avail of the reduced commitment.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" />\n\nThe [[ATP Cup]] will count as an additional event in a player's rankings breakdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atptour.com/en/news/atp-cup-faqs|title=ATP Cup FAQs|accessdate=25 November 2019|publisher=ATP}}</ref>\n\n===Doubles===\nEight teams compete at the tournament, with one named alternates. The eight competing teams receive places according to the same order of precedence as in Singles.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" /> The named alternate will be offered first to any unaccepted teams in the selection order, then to the highest ranked unaccepted team, and then to a team selected by the ATP.<ref name=\"Rulebook\" /> Points are accumulated in the same competitions as for the Singles tournament. However, for Doubles teams there are no commitment tournaments, so teams are ranked according to their 18 highest points scoring results from any tournaments.\n\n==Points
