According to the [[New Testament]], she was the stepdaughter of [[Herod Antipas]] who demanded, and received, the head of [[John the Baptist]].\n\nAccording to [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]], Salome was first married to her uncle, [[Philip the Tetrarch]], who reigned over [[Ituraea]], [[Trachonitis]], and [[Batanaea]]. After Philip's death in 34 AD, she married her cousin [[Aristobulus of Chalcis]] and became queen of [[Kingdom of Chalcis|Chalcis]] and [[Lesser Armenia|Armenia Minor]]. As Salome is not named in the [[New Testament]], she is sometimes referred to as \"the daughter of Herodias\".\n\n==First-century accounts and sources==\nSalome is commonly identified with the daughter of Herodias who, according to the New Testament ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 6:17\u201329 and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 14:3\u201311), danced for [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]. In his ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'', Josephus mentions marriages and children of the daughter of Herodias named Salome.\n\n===New Testament===\nAccording to [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 6:21\u201329 a daughter of [[Herodias]] danced before [[Herod Antipas|Herod]] at his birthday celebration, and in doing so gave her mother the opportunity to obtain the head of [[John the Baptist]]. Although the New Testament accounts do not mention a name for the girl, this daughter of Herodias is often identified with Salome. According to Mark's gospel, Herodias bore a grudge against John for stating that Herod's marriage to her was unlawful; she encouraged her daughter to demand that John be executed.<ref name=\"Betsworth2010\">{{cite book|author=Sharon Betsworth|title=The Reign of God is Such as These: A Socio-Literary Analysis of Daughters in the Gospel of Mark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctZXwDmc4MwC&pg=PA117|year=2010|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-17531-1|pages=117\u201319}}</ref>\n\nMark's account (6:21\u201328) reads:<blockquote>A convenient day arrived when Herod spread an evening meal on his birthday for his high officials and the military commanders and the most prominent men of Galilee. The daughter of Herodias came in and danced, pleasing Herod and those dining with him. The king said to the girl: \"Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.\" Yes, he swore to her: \"Whatever you ask me for, I will give it to you, up to half my kingdom.\" So she went out and said to her mother: \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d She said: \u201cThe head of John the Baptist.\" She immediately rushed in to the king and made her request, saying: \"I want you to give me right away on a platter the head of John the Baptist.\" Although this deeply grieved him, the king did not want to disregard her request, because of his oaths and his guests. So the king immediately sent a bodyguard and commanded him to bring John\u2019s head. So he went off and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter. He gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.<ref>([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 6:21\u201328, [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]])</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[parallel passage]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (14:6\u201311):<blockquote>But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them: and pleased Herod. Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she would ask of him. But she being instructed before by her mother, said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist. And the king was struck sad: yet because of his oath, and for them that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given. And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. And his head was brought in a dish: and it was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.<ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|Matt]] 14:6\u201311, [[Douay-Rheims Bible|D-R]]</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome ancient Greek versions of Mark read \"Herod's daughter Herodias\" (rather than \"daughter of the said Herodias\").<ref>Taylor, V. (1966). ''The gospel according to St Mark'', 2nd Edition. London: Macmillan (pp310ff.)</ref> To scholars using these ancient texts, both mother and daughter had the same name. However, the Latin Vulgate Bible translates the passage as it is above, and western Church Fathers, therefore, tended to refer to Salome as \"Herodias's daughter\" or just \"the girl\". Nevertheless, because she is otherwise unnamed in the Bible, the idea that both mother and daughter were named Herodias gained some currency in early modern Europe.<ref name=\"Betsworth2010\"/><ref name=\"Spencer2004\">{{cite book|author=F.

According to the [[New Testament]], she was the stepdaughter of [[Herod Antipas]] who demanded, and received, the head of [[John the Baptist]].\n\nAccording to [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]], Salome was first married to her uncle, [[Philip the Tetrarch]], who reigned over [[Ituraea]], [[Trachonitis]], and [[Batanaea]]. After Philip's death in 34 AD, she married her cousin [[Aristobulus of Chalcis]] and became queen of [[Kingdom of Chalcis|Chalcis]] and [[Lesser Armenia|Armenia Minor]]. As Salome is not named in the [[New Testament]], she is sometimes referred to as \"the daughter of Herodias\".\n\n==First-century accounts and sources==\nSalome is commonly identified with the daughter of Herodias who, according to the New Testament ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 6:17\u201329 and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 14:3\u201311), danced for [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]. In his ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'', Josephus mentions marriages and children of the daughter of Herodias named Salome.\n\n===New Testament===\nAccording to [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 6:21\u201329 a daughter of [[Herodias]] danced before [[Herod Antipas|Herod]] at his birthday celebration, and in doing so gave her mother the opportunity to obtain the head of [[John the Baptist]]. Although the New Testament accounts do not mention a name for the girl, this daughter of Herodias is often identified with Salome. According to Mark's gospel, Herodias bore a grudge against John for stating that Herod's marriage to her was unlawful; she encouraged her daughter to demand that John be executed.<ref name=\"Betsworth2010\">{{cite book|author=Sharon Betsworth|title=The Reign of God is Such as These: A Socio-Literary Analysis of Daughters in the Gospel of Mark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctZXwDmc4MwC&pg=PA117|year=2010|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-17531-1|pages=117\u201319}}</ref>\n\nMark's account (6:21\u201328) reads:<blockquote>A convenient day arrived when Herod spread an evening meal on his birthday for his high officials and the military commanders and the most prominent men of Galilee. The daughter of Herodias came in and danced, pleasing Herod and those dining with him. The king said to the girl: \"Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.\" Yes, he swore to her: \"Whatever you ask me for, I will give it to you, up to half my kingdom.\" So she went out and said to her mother: \u201cWhat should I ask for?\u201d She said: \u201cThe head of John the Baptist.\" She immediately rushed in to the king and made her request, saying: \"I want you to give me right away on a platter the head of John the Baptist.\" Although this deeply grieved him, the king did not want to disregard her request, because of his oaths and his guests. So the king immediately sent a bodyguard and commanded him to bring John\u2019s head. So he went off and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter. He gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.<ref>([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 6:21\u201328, [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]])</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[parallel passage]] in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (14:6\u201311):<blockquote>But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them: and pleased Herod. Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she would ask of him. But she being instructed before by her mother, said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist. And the king was struck sad: yet because of his oath, and for them that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given. And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. And his head was brought in a dish: and it was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.<ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|Matt]] 14:6\u201311, [[Douay-Rheims Bible|D-R]]</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome ancient Greek versions of Mark read \"Herod's daughter Herodias\" (rather than \"daughter of the said Herodias\").<ref>Taylor, V. (1966). ''The gospel according to St Mark'', 2nd Edition. London: Macmillan (pp310ff.)</ref> To scholars using these ancient texts, both mother and daughter had the same name. However, the Latin Vulgate Bible translates the passage as it is above, and western Church Fathers, therefore, tended to refer to Salome as \"Herodias's daughter\" or just \"the girl\". Nevertheless, because she is otherwise unnamed in the Bible, the idea that both mother and daughter were named Herodias gained some currency in early modern Europe.<ref name=\"Betsworth2010\"/><ref name=\"Spencer2004\">{{cite book|author=F.

Biden, the former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] and a former [[United States Senator|U.S. senator]] from [[Delaware]], had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 candidate]] after declining to be a candidate in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].\n\nBiden is generally described as a [[moderate]]. His positions include codifying ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' into statute, a [[public option]] for health insurance, [[decriminalization]] of recreational cannabis, passing the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], free [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]], and a $1.7 trillion climate plan embracing the framework of the [[Green New Deal]]. He supports regulation as opposed to a complete ban on [[fracking]].  \n\nAs a former vice president, Biden entered the race with very high name recognition. From his campaign announcement up to the start of elections, he has been the candidate most identified as the frontrunner. He led most national polls through 2019, but did not rank as one of the top three candidates in either the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses]] or the [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire Democratic primary]]. He won a landslide victory in the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary]] on February 29, 2020, which was widely seen as reinvigorating his campaign. In March, Biden was endorsed by 10 of his former competitors, bringing the total number of such endorsements to 12. Biden earned enough delegates on [[Super Tuesday 2020]] to pull ahead of Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]. On April 8, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n==Background==\n===Previous presidential campaigns===\n{{main|Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign}}\n\nBiden's 2020 presidential campaign is his third attempt to seek election for president of the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html|title=One Year From Election, Trump Trails Biden but Leads Warren in Battlegrounds|last=Cohn|first=Nate|date=November 4, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> His first campaign was made in the [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988 Democratic Party primaries]] where he was initially considered one of the potentially strongest candidates.

Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the [[Iowa caucus]] in January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen by [[Barack Obama]] as his running mate and won the general election as [[vice president of the United States]], being sworn in on January 20, 2009.\n\n===Speculation===\nVice President Joe Biden was seen as a potential candidate to succeed [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].

Biden, the former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] and a former [[United States Senator|U.S. senator]] from [[Delaware]], had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 candidate]] after declining to be a candidate in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].\n\nBiden is generally described as a [[moderate]]. His positions include codifying ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' into statute, a [[public option]] for health insurance, [[decriminalization]] of recreational cannabis, passing the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], free [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]], and a $1.7 trillion climate plan embracing the framework of the [[Green New Deal]]. He supports regulation as opposed to a complete ban on [[fracking]].  \n\nAs a former vice president, Biden entered the race with very high name recognition. From his campaign announcement up to the start of elections, he has been the candidate most identified as the frontrunner. He led most national polls through 2019, but did not rank as one of the top three candidates in either the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses]] or the [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire Democratic primary]]. He won a landslide victory in the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary]] on February 29, 2020, which was widely seen as reinvigorating his campaign. In March, Biden was endorsed by 10 of his former competitors, bringing the total number of such endorsements to 12. Biden earned enough delegates on [[Super Tuesday 2020]] to pull ahead of Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]. On April 8, 2020, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n==Background==\n===Previous presidential campaigns===\n{{main|Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign}}\n\nBiden's 2020 presidential campaign is his third attempt to seek election for president of the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html|title=One Year From Election, Trump Trails Biden but Leads Warren in Battlegrounds|last=Cohn|first=Nate|date=November 4, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> His first campaign was made in the [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988 Democratic Party primaries]] where he was initially considered one of the potentially strongest candidates.

Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the [[Iowa caucus]] in January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen by [[Barack Obama]] as his running mate and won the general election as [[vice president of the United States]], being sworn in on January 20, 2009.\n\n===Speculation===\nVice President Joe Biden was seen as a potential candidate to succeed [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]. On October 21, 2015, following the death of his son [[Beau Biden|Beau]], Biden announced that he would not seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/21/joe-biden-not-running-president-2016-election|title=Joe Biden announces he will not run for president in 2016|last=McCarthy|first=Tom|date=October 21, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 25, 2019|last2=Gambino|first2=Lauren|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Roberts|first3=Dan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425013851/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/21/joe-biden-not-running-president-2016-election|archive-date=April 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/joe-biden-concludes-theres-no-time-for-a-2016-run.html|title=Joe Biden Concludes There's No Time for a 2016 Run|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=October 21, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 25, 2019|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320174541/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/joe-biden-concludes-theres-no-time-for-a-2016-run.html|archive-date=March 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring a tour of the [[United States Senate]] with reporters on December 5, 2016, Biden refused to rule out a potential bid for the presidency in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-citing-hidden-hand-of-fate-joe-biden-1480986947-htmlstory.html |title=Joe Biden wouldn't count out a 2020 run for president.

In April 2019, Biden told reporters, \"The fact of the matter is the vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional sense.\" Biden also described himself as an \"Obama-Biden Democrat\".
