The franchise was admitted to the league too late to participate in the [[1960 NFL draft|1960 NFL college draft]]. However, majority owner Murchison signed two college players, [[quarterback]] [[Don Meredith]] from [[1959 SMU Mustangs football team|SMU]], and [[running back]] [[Don Perkins]] from [[New Mexico Lobos football|New Mexico]], to personal services contracts before the draft (and before the franchise was voted into the league). The NFL honored these contracts after the franchise was voted in, although the [[1960 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] drafted Perkins in the ninth round, and Meredith was also selected by the [[1960 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in the third round after owner [[George Halas]] made the pick to help ensure that the expansion Cowboys got off to a solid start. The franchise was allowed to retain both players, but had to give their third-round and ninth-round choices in the [[1962 NFL draft]] to the Bears and Colts, respectively.\n\nOn March 13, {{nfly|1960}}, the franchise selected 36 players in an [[1960 NFL Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. Each of the other 12 NFL teams were allowed to protect 25 players from their 36-man roster. The franchise was then were given 24 hours to select three players from those unprotected by each other team.\n\nThe franchise was placed in the league's [[Eastern and Western Conferences (NFL) 1933\u201369|Western Conference]]. However, since they were the league's thirteenth franchise in addition to being an expansion franchise, it was decided that they would play every team in the league once,<ref name=declwar/> instead of playing each team in their conference twice, as the other teams did.\n\nThe Cowboys' final pre-season game on September 4 was played in rural northeastern [[Oregon]]; they lost {{nowrap|49\u201314}} to the {{nowrap|[[1960 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]]}} at [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]]'s {{nowrap|[[Pendleton Round-Up|rodeo grounds]].<ref name=nenpen>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S1spAAAAIBAJ&sjid=g-cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2266%2C503384 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |title=New NFL entry to play Rams in Pendleton Sunday |date=September 2, 1960 |page=13}}</ref><ref name=rmcdc>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TlspAAAAIBAJ&sjid=g-cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1721%2C1482600 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Rams crush Dallas club |date=September 5, 1960 |page=8}}</ref>}}\n\n===Transactions===\nOther notable transactions prior to the season included acquiring [[quarterback]] [[Eddie LeBaron]] from the [[1959 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], [[wide receiver|offensive end]] [[Billy Howton]] from the [[1959 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], and signing former [[1959 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Gene Babb]].

The next week they played the eventual league champion [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] to a near deadlock, losing 27\u201325, the difference being two blocked extra points.\n\nThe lack of talent on the roster caught up with them as the season went on, however. Their first ever road game was against the woeful [[1960 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], and it ended in defeat, 26\u201314, spoiling quarterback [[Eddie LeBaron]]'s return to the city where he starred for the Redskins during the '50s. The next week the team was annihilated at home by one of the league's top teams, the [[1960 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], 48\u20137. The team would go on to suffer more lopsided defeats, including a 45\u20137 loss to the defending champion [[1960 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]], and a 41\u20137 loss to the eventual Western Conference champion [[1960 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. Squeezed in between blowout losses was rookie quarterback [[Don Meredith]]'s first start, which came against the [[1960 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]]. Predictably, Meredith struggled in a 38\u201313 loss.\n\nThe Cowboys also suffered heartbreaking losses, including a 12\u201310 defeat in St. Louis to the [[1960 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|Cardinals]], a game in which they led late only to lose on a field goal in the last minute, and a 26\u201314 defeat against the [[1960 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], in which the Cowboys surrendered 17 points during the last 6 minutes of the game.\n\nThe lone highlight of 1960 came near the end of the season, when they traveled to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] and tied the [[1960 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] 31\u201331, ending the Giants' hopes of winning the Eastern Conference crown for the third year in a row. New York won the next three conference titles for five in six seasons.\n\nThe Cowboys struggled in almost every statistical category, finishing last in both points scored (177) and points allowed (369). Quarterback LeBaron and the receiving corps provided some big plays in the passing game throughout the season, but LeBaron mostly struggled behind a porous offensive line, and the quarterbacks threw a league-high 33 interceptions. Rookie halfback Perkins was lost prior to the season after breaking a bone in his foot, and the Cowboys rushing attack suffered all season long, finishing last in the league in rushing at 1049 yards, and averaging a paltry 3.4 yards per carry.\n\nDefensively the team was gashed by opposing running games all season long, giving up 2242 yards rushing and allowing 5.0 yards per carry, both last in the league. The team's pass defense had its moments, particularly in games against the [[1960 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] and St. Louis Cardinals, but gave up too many big plays and did not provide much of a pass rush.\n\nThe kicking game proved to be average, and the kick returners were among the worst in the league, despite an ample number of opportunities (a league high 69 kick returns).\n\n==Standings==\n{{1960 NFL Western standings}}\n\n===Roster===\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#c5ced6; color:black; border: 2px solid #001942; text-align: center;\"|'''Dallas Cowboys 1960 roster'''\n|-\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;\" valign=\"top\" | '''Quarterbacks'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">11</span> [[Don Heinrich]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">14</span> [[Eddie LeBaron]]\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">17</span> ''[[Don Meredith]]''\n\n'''Running Backs'''\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">33</span> [[Gene Babb]] FB/OLB\n* <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">45</span> [[L.

The NFL honored these contracts after the franchise was voted in, although the [[1960 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] drafted Perkins in the ninth round, and Meredith was also selected by the [[1960 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in the third round after owner [[George Halas]] made the pick to help ensure that the expansion Cowboys got off to a solid start. The franchise was allowed to retain both players, but had to give their third-round and ninth-round choices in the [[1962 NFL draft]] to the Bears and Colts, respectively.\n\nOn March 13, {{nfly|1960}}, the franchise selected 36 players in an [[1960 NFL Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. Each of the other 12 NFL teams were allowed to protect 25 players from their 36-man roster. The franchise was then were given 24 hours to select three players from those unprotected by each other team.\n\nThe franchise was placed in the league's [[Eastern and Western Conferences (NFL) 1933\u201369|Western Conference]].

one team was idle each week.<br> The fourteenth team ([[1961 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]]) joined the league in {{nfly|1961}} and the NFL initiated a 14-game regular season.\n\n===Season recap===\nExpectations certainly were not high for the Cowboys heading into their inaugural season, but they got off to a hopeful start, as the team took a 14\u20130 lead on [[Bobby Layne]] and the [[1960 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] early in their first game and led throughout before succumbing in the fourth quarter 35\u201328. The next week they played the eventual league champion [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] to a near deadlock, losing 27\u201325, the difference being two blocked extra points.\n\nThe lack of talent on the roster caught up with them as the season went on, however. Their first ever road game was against the woeful [[1960 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], and it ended in defeat, 26\u201314, spoiling quarterback [[Eddie LeBaron]]'s return to the city where he starred for the Redskins during the '50s. The next week the team was annihilated at home by one of the league's top teams, the [[1960 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], 48\u20137. The team would go on to suffer more lopsided defeats, including a 45\u20137 loss to the defending champion [[1960 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]], and a 41\u20137 loss to the eventual Western Conference champion [[1960 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. Squeezed in between blowout losses was rookie quarterback [[Don Meredith]]'s first start, which came against the [[1960 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]]. Predictably, Meredith struggled in a 38\u201313 loss.\n\nThe Cowboys also suffered heartbreaking losses, including a 12\u201310 defeat in St. Louis to the [[1960 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|Cardinals]], a game in which they led late only to lose on a field goal in the last minute, and a 26\u201314 defeat against the [[1960 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], in which the Cowboys surrendered 17 points during the last 6 minutes of the game.\n\nThe lone highlight of 1960 came near the end of the season, when they traveled to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] and tied the [[1960 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] 31\u201331, ending the Giants' hopes of winning the Eastern Conference crown for the third year in a row. New York won the next three conference titles for five in six seasons.\n\nThe Cowboys struggled in almost every statistical category, finishing last in both points scored (177) and points allowed (369). Quarterback LeBaron and the receiving corps provided some big plays in the passing game throughout the season, but LeBaron mostly struggled behind a porous offensive line, and the quarterbacks threw a league-high 33 interceptions. Rookie halfback Perkins was lost prior to the season after breaking a bone in his foot, and the Cowboys rushing attack suffered all season long, finishing last in the league in rushing at 1049 yards, and averaging a paltry 3.4 yards per carry.\n\nDefensively the team was gashed by opposing running games all season long, giving up 2242 yards rushing and allowing 5.0 yards per carry, both last in the league.

In 1868 he changed the name of the school to Keio Gijuku and devoted all his time to education.  While Kei\u014d's initial identity was that of a private school of Western studies, it expanded and established its first university faculty in 1890, and became known as a leading institute in Japanese higher education. It was the first Japanese university to reach its 150th anniversary, celebrating this anniversary in 2008.\n\nKeio has leading research centers. It has approximately 30 Research Centers located on its five main campuses and at other facilities for advanced research in Japan.<ref name=\"ogi.keio.ac.jp\"/> Keio University Research Institute at SFC (KRIS) has joined the [[MIT]] and the French [[INRIA]] in hosting the international [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]].<ref name=\"INRIA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Press/Keio-PR.html |title=W3C, Sep-9-1996 Press Release: Keio University joins MIT and INRIA in hosting W3C |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Mission===\nFukuzawa stated the mission of Keio shown below, which is based on his speech at the alumni party on November 1, 1896.<ref name=\"mission\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/53.html |title=The purpose of Keio University |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n''Keio Gijuku shouldn't be satisfied with being just one educational institution.''<br>\n''Its mission is expected to be a model of the nobility of intelligence and virtue,''<br>\n''to make clear how it can be applied to its family, society, and nation,''<br>\n''and to take an actual action of this statement.''<br>\n''It expects all students being leaders in society by the practice of this mission.''\n\nThose sentences were given to students as his will, and considered as the simple expression of Keio's actual mission.<ref name=\"mission\"/>\n\n===Academic culture===\n\n====Contributor to Japanese modern education systems====\nKeio is known for being the first institution to introduce many modern education systems in Japan. The following are the examples:\n\n* Keio is the earliest Japanese school that introduced an annual fixed course fee, designed by Fukuzawa.<ref>In the [[Edo period]], private schools normally collected money or properties with [[Noshi]] irregularly from students, but those fees highly depended on each student's economic circumstances. Fukuzawa thought such an unstable financial system prevented the modernization of educational institutions as well as professors' professionalism. Then he designed a rudimentary management system for the school's finances.[http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/12.html]</ref>\n* It initially introduced the culture of speech to Japan, which Japan had never had before. It built Japan's earliest speech house [[:ja:\u4e09\u7530\u6f14\u8aac\u9928|Mita Speech House]] in 1875 as well.<ref>Before the [[Meiji Period]], Japanese people had thought the oral statement is not reliable enough for decision making, thus every time people had needed to state their opinions on paper when they had needed to decide something. Fukuzawa thought this culture would seriously prevent to introduce the modern parliamentary regime and the fair court system. Then he developed the art of speech by the arrangement of Western speech. [http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/30.html]</ref>\n* It is regarded as Japan's first university to accept international students.<ref name=\"history of keio 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/41.html |title=The origin of accepting international students |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref> Keio accepted 2 Korean students in 1881 as its (and also Japan's) first international students. 60 Korean students entered in 1883 and 130 Korean students in 1895.\n\n====Dokuritsu Jison====\nKeio put \"{{nihongo|Independence and self-respect|\u72ec\u7acb\u81ea\u5c0a|Dokuritsu Jison}}\" as a foundation of its education. This is meant to be physically and mentally independent, and respect yourself for keeping your virtue.<ref name=\"history of keio 2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/60.html |title=Dokuritsujison |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref> Independence and self-respect are also regarded as Fukuzawa's nature and essence of his education.<ref>In fact, this phrase was also used for his [[Dharma name]], which is a given name when people are dead, representing their nature.</ref>\n\n====Hangaku Hankyo====\n{{nihongo|Learning half and teaching half|\u534a\u5b66\u534a\u6559|Hangaku Hankyo}} is the other unique culture in Keio.<ref name=\"history of keio 3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/16.html |title=Hangaku Hankyo |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref> During the late [[Edo period]] and the early [[Meiji period]], several private prep schools often used students as assistant teachers and it was called \"Learning half and teaching half\". Keio also had initially used this system. In the early period of such schools of Western studies, there had been many things to learn not only for students but also professors themselves. Hence there had been sometimes the occasions that students who had learned in advance had taught other students and even professors. After the proper legal systems for education had been set up, those situations have disappeared. However, Fukuzawa thought the essence of academia was and is a continuous learning, and knowing more things provides more learning opportunities. Keio respects his thought and put the rule in \"{{nihongo|Rules in Keio Gijuku|\u6176\u61c9\u7fa9\u587e\u793e\u4e2d\u4e4b\u7d04\u675f|Keio Gijuku Shachu no Yakusoku}}\" that there shouldn't be any hierarchy between teachers and learners, and all of the people in Keio Gijuku are in the same company. For this reason, there is still a culture in this university that all professors and lecturers are officially called with the honorific of [[Japanese honorifics#Kun|\"Kun\"]] but never \"Teacher\" or \"Professor\".<ref>Japanese people usually use \"Kun\" only between friends. This expression is normally considered as an informal expression and shouldn't be used for professors.</ref><ref>Keio only use the honorific of \"Teacher\" or \"Professors\" officially when they refer Fukuzawa's name.</ref>\n\n====Shachu no Kyoryoku====\n{{nihongo|Collaboration in a company|\u793e\u4e2d\u306e\u5354\u529b|Shachu no Kyoryoku}} is also a uniqueness of Keio.<ref name=\"history of keio 4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/36.html |title=Shachu no Kyoryoku |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref> Fukuzawa stated in 1879 that the Keio's success today is because of the collaboration in its company, and \"Collaboration in a company\" originally came from this article.

In most Japanese universities, there are more payment requirements in the first year such as \"entrance fees\", and less in the rest of the years. There are several types of fees (some require to pay only once and some require to pay once or twice every year) and so-called \"course fee\" is officially only one of those fees.\n\nIn Keio University, Tuition fees vary and depend on the course. Social Science & Humanity studies require the least fees with approximately 1,110,000 yen per year, and School of Medicine requires the most expensive fees with about 3,610,000 yen per year.<ref name=\"Tuition fees1\"/> The tuition fees in graduate school are much less than those for undergraduate studies, as 690,000 yen per year for Social Science & Humanities and 1,313,000 yen per year for School of Medicine.<ref name=\"Tuition fees2\"/>\n\nAlthough it is acceptable to pay twice with half in spring and half in autumn, the \"entrance fee\" is necessary to be paid before enrollment.

In 1868 he changed the name of the school to Keio Gijuku and devoted all his time to education.  While Kei\u014d's initial identity was that of a private school of Western studies, it expanded and established its first university faculty in 1890, and became known as a leading institute in Japanese higher education. It was the first Japanese university to reach its 150th anniversary, celebrating this anniversary in 2008.\n\nKeio has leading research centers. It has approximately 30 Research Centers located on its five main campuses and at other facilities for advanced research in Japan.<ref name=\"ogi.keio.ac.jp\"/> Keio University Research Institute at SFC (KRIS) has joined the [[MIT]] and the French [[INRIA]] in hosting the international [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]].<ref name=\"INRIA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Press/Keio-PR.html |title=W3C, Sep-9-1996 Press Release: Keio University joins MIT and INRIA in hosting W3C |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Mission===\nFukuzawa stated the mission of Keio shown below, which is based on his speech at the alumni party on November 1, 1896.<ref name=\"mission\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/53.html |title=The purpose of Keio University |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n''Keio Gijuku shouldn't be satisfied with being just one educational institution.''<br>\n''Its mission is expected to be a model of the nobility of intelligence and virtue,''<br>\n''to make clear how it can be applied to its family, society, and nation,''<br>\n''and to take an actual action of this statement.''<br>\n''It expects all students being leaders in society by the practice of this mission.''\n\nThose sentences were given to students as his will, and considered as the simple expression of Keio's actual mission.<ref name=\"mission\"/>\n\n===Academic culture===\n\n====Contributor to Japanese modern education systems====\nKeio is known for being the first institution to introduce many modern education systems in Japan. The following are the examples:\n\n* Keio is the earliest Japanese school that introduced an annual fixed course fee, designed by Fukuzawa.<ref>In the [[Edo period]], private schools normally collected money or properties with [[Noshi]] irregularly from students, but those fees highly depended on each student's economic circumstances. Fukuzawa thought such an unstable financial system prevented the modernization of educational institutions as well as professors' professionalism. Then he designed a rudimentary management system for the school's finances.[http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/12.html]</ref>\n* It initially introduced the culture of speech to Japan, which Japan had never had before. It built Japan's earliest speech house [[:ja:\u4e09\u7530\u6f14\u8aac\u9928|Mita Speech House]] in 1875 as well.<ref>Before the [[Meiji Period]], Japanese people had thought the oral statement is not reliable enough for decision making, thus every time people had needed to state their opinions on paper when they had needed to decide something. Fukuzawa thought this culture would seriously prevent to introduce the modern parliamentary regime and the fair court system. Then he developed the art of speech by the arrangement of Western speech. [http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/30.html]</ref>\n* It is regarded as Japan's first university to accept international students.<ref name=\"history of keio 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/41.html |title=The origin of accepting international students |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref> Keio accepted 2 Korean students in 1881 as its (and also Japan's) first international students. 60 Korean students entered in 1883 and 130 Korean students in 1895.\n\n====Dokuritsu Jison====\nKeio put \"{{nihongo|Independence and self-respect|\u72ec\u7acb\u81ea\u5c0a|Dokuritsu Jison}}\" as a foundation of its education. This is meant to be physically and mentally independent, and respect yourself for keeping your virtue.<ref name=\"history of keio 2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/60.html |title=Dokuritsujison |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref> Independence and self-respect are also regarded as Fukuzawa's nature and essence of his education.<ref>In fact, this phrase was also used for his [[Dharma name]], which is a given name when people are dead, representing their nature.</ref>\n\n====Hangaku Hankyo====\n{{nihongo|Learning half and teaching half|\u534a\u5b66\u534a\u6559|Hangaku Hankyo}} is the other unique culture in Keio.<ref name=\"history of keio 3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/16.html |title=Hangaku Hankyo |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref> During the late [[Edo period]] and the early [[Meiji period]], several private prep schools often used students as assistant teachers and it was called \"Learning half and teaching half\". Keio also had initially used this system. In the early period of such schools of Western studies, there had been many things to learn not only for students but also professors themselves. Hence there had been sometimes the occasions that students who had learned in advance had taught other students and even professors. After the proper legal systems for education had been set up, those situations have disappeared. However, Fukuzawa thought the essence of academia was and is a continuous learning, and knowing more things provides more learning opportunities. Keio respects his thought and put the rule in \"{{nihongo|Rules in Keio Gijuku|\u6176\u61c9\u7fa9\u587e\u793e\u4e2d\u4e4b\u7d04\u675f|Keio Gijuku Shachu no Yakusoku}}\" that there shouldn't be any hierarchy between teachers and learners, and all of the people in Keio Gijuku are in the same company. For this reason, there is still a culture in this university that all professors and lecturers are officially called with the honorific of [[Japanese honorifics#Kun|\"Kun\"]] but never \"Teacher\" or \"Professor\".<ref>Japanese people usually use \"Kun\" only between friends. This expression is normally considered as an informal expression and shouldn't be used for professors.</ref><ref>Keio only use the honorific of \"Teacher\" or \"Professors\" officially when they refer Fukuzawa's name.</ref>\n\n====Shachu no Kyoryoku====\n{{nihongo|Collaboration in a company|\u793e\u4e2d\u306e\u5354\u529b|Shachu no Kyoryoku}} is also a uniqueness of Keio.<ref name=\"history of keio 4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/36.html |title=Shachu no Kyoryoku |publisher=Keio University |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref> Fukuzawa stated in 1879 that the Keio's success today is because of the collaboration in its company, and \"Collaboration in a company\" originally came from this article. People in Keio often think that all of the people related to Keio (e.g. professors, students, alumni and their family members) are the part of their company, thus they should try to help each other like brothers and sisters. This culture has been often seen especially in the alumni organization called [[:ja:\u4e09\u7530\u4f1a|Mita-Kai]].<ref name=\"hiromi shimada 1\">{{cite book|title=Keio Mitakai |author=Hiromi Shimada |date=October 2007 |publisher=Sanshusha |language=Japanese|id= {{ASIN|4384039417|country=jp}} }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Edo keiouniversity 1862.jpg|right|thumb|Keio Gijuku in [[Tsukiji]] in 1862]]\n\n[[File:Keio University Library,1912.jpg|right|thumb|Keio University in May 1912]]\n{{nihongo|'''Keio University'''|\u6176\u61c9\u7fa9\u587e\u5927\u5b66|Kei\u014d Gijuku Daigaku}} was established in 1858 as a [[:ja:\u862d\u5b66\u587e|School of Western studies]] located in one of the [[:ja:\u6c5f\u6238\u85e9\u90b8|mansion houses]] in [[Tsukiji]] by the founder [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]].<ref name=\"history 5\">{{cite web |title=Dictionary of Keio No.4 The origin of Keio |publisher=Keio University |url=http://www.keio.ac.jp/ja/contents/mamehyakka/4.html |accessdate=October 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}</ref> Its root is considered as the [[Han school]] for [[Kokugaku]] studies named [[:ja:\u9032\u8129\u9928|Shinshu Kan]] established in 1796.<ref>Although Shinshu Kan didn't have a direct relation to Keio, Many people who studied or managed there were involved with Keio later.

written by [[Nisio Isin]] and illustrated by Vofan. The plot of the series centers around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who survives a vampire attack and subsequently finds himself helping girls involved with a variety of apparitions, deities, ghosts, beasts, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena. Between November 2006 and April 2019, [[Kodansha]] published 25 volumes in the series under its [[Kodansha Box]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], with plans for at least three more volumes {{as of|2017|July|lc=y}}. Each of the series' 18 story arcs share the common title suffix {{Nihongo|''-monogatari''|\u7269\u8a9e}}.\n\n[[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] has animated the ''Monogatari'' series multiple times since 2009. The first season of the [[anime]] adaptation consists of 30 episodes, which were broadcast in Japan between July 2009 and December 2012. The second season consists of 28 episodes broadcast between July and December 2013, and the third and final season consists of 42 episodes broadcast between December 2014 and June 2019. A prequel anime film trilogy, ''[[Kizumonogatari (film series)|Kizumonogatari]]'', was released in 2016 and 2017. A [[manga]] series illustrated by [[Oh! great]] adapting the series' first arc, ''Bakemonogatari'', began serialization in Kodansha's ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' in March 2018.\n\n==Plot and setting==\n{{see also|List of Monogatari characters}}\nThe ''Monogatari'' series revolves around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who has almost restored his humanity after briefly becoming a vampire during spring break. One day, a classmate of his, the reclusive Hitagi Senj\u014dgahara, falls down a flight of stairs at school into Koyomi's arms. To his surprise, he discovers that Hitagi weighs almost nothing, in defiance of physics. Despite being threatened to keep away, Koyomi offers his help and introduces her to Meme Oshino, a strange middle-aged man living in an abandoned [[cram school]] who helped reverse his vampirism. Once Koyomi helps solve Hitagi's problem, she decides to become his girlfriend.\n\nAs the series progresses, Koyomi finds himself involved with other girls afflicted by {{Nihongo|\"oddities\"|\u602a\u7570|kaii|{{lit}} \"strangeness\"}}: the ghost of a child named Mayoi Hachikuji; his underclassman Suruga Kanbaru; Nadeko Sengoku, a friend of his sisters; his classmate Tsubasa Hanekawa; and his own younger sisters Karen and Tsukihi. To deal with the apparitions, which feed on human emotions and often take forms symbolically represented by animals, Koyomi relies on supernatural guidance from Oshino and, later, from Shinobu, the once-powerful blonde vampire who attacked him and later assumed the appearance of an eight-year-old girl.\n\nMost heroines have an item that symbolises their spectres, such as Hitagi's stapler (the claw of a crab), Mayoi's backpack (the shell of a snail), Suruga's arm (the arm of a monkey), Nadeko's hat and jacket (the head and skin of a snake), and Karen's [[Game of Death#Yellow-and-black tracksuit|black and yellow tracksuit]] (the colors of a bee).

written by [[Nisio Isin]] and illustrated by Vofan. The plot centers around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who survives a vampire attack and subsequently finds himself helping girls involved with a variety of apparitions, deities, ghosts, beasts, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena. Between November 2006 and April 2019, [[Kodansha]] published 25 volumes in the series under its [[Kodansha Box]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], with plans for at least three more volumes {{as of|2017|July|lc=y}}. Each of the series' 18 story arcs share the common title suffix {{Nihongo|''-monogatari''|\u7269\u8a9e}}.\n\n[[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] has animated the ''Monogatari'' series multiple times since 2009. The first season of the [[anime]] adaptation consists of 30 episodes, which were released in Japan between July 2009 and December 2012. The second season consists of 28 episodes released between July and December 2013, and the third and final season consists of 42 episodes released between December 2014 and June 2019. A prequel anime film trilogy, ''[[Kizumonogatari (film series)|Kizumonogatari]]'', was released in 2016 and 2017. A [[manga]] series illustrated by [[Oh! great]] adapting the series' first arc, ''Bakemonogatari'', began serialization in Kodansha's ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' in March 2018.\n\n==Plot and setting==\n{{see also|List of Monogatari characters}}\nThe ''Monogatari'' series revolves around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who has almost restored his humanity after briefly becoming a vampire during spring break. One day, a classmate of his, the reclusive Hitagi Senj\u014dgahara, falls down a flight of stairs at school into Koyomi's arms. To his surprise, he discovers that Hitagi weighs almost nothing, in defiance of physics. Despite being threatened to keep away, Koyomi offers his help and introduces her to Meme Oshino, a strange middle-aged man living in an abandoned [[cram school]] who helped reverse his vampirism. Once Koyomi helps solve Hitagi's problem, she decides to become his girlfriend.\n\nAs the series progresses, Koyomi finds himself involved with other girls afflicted by {{Nihongo|\"oddities\"|\u602a\u7570|kaii|{{lit}} \"strangeness\"}}: the ghost of a child named Mayoi Hachikuji; his underclassman Suruga Kanbaru; Nadeko Sengoku, a friend of his sisters; his classmate Tsubasa Hanekawa; and his own younger sisters Karen and Tsukihi. To deal with the apparitions, which feed on human emotions and often take forms symbolically represented by animals, Koyomi relies on supernatural guidance from Oshino and, later, from Shinobu, the once-powerful blonde vampire who attacked him and later assumed the appearance of an eight-year-old girl.\n\nMost heroines have an item that symbolises their spectres, such as Hitagi's stapler (the claw of a crab), Mayoi's backpack (the shell of a snail), Suruga's arm (the arm of a monkey), Nadeko's hat and jacket (the head and skin of a snake), and Karen's [[Game of Death#Yellow-and-black tracksuit|black and yellow tracksuit]] (the colors of a bee). Although it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror, and action, the series primarily focuses on relationships and conversations between its characters, which make heavy use of [[Nisio Isin]]'s signature [[word play]] and [[metahumor]].\n\n==Media==\n\n===Light novels===\n{{main|List of Monogatari novels}}\nThe ''Monogatari'' series was first written by [[Nisio Isin]] as a series of short stories for [[Kodansha]]'s literary magazine [[Mephisto Prize#Mephisto (magazine)|''Mephisto'']].

His father Wangquan Baye(\u738b\u6743\u9738\u4e1a), who was the host of the family, asked him to kill any spirits and could not get out of mansion. But when a spider spirit came to his mansion, he didn't kill her. The spirit knew he couldn't go anywhere so she used her arachnoid to weave paintings which showed beautiful scenery outside of his mansion. Unfortunately, Wangquan Fugui's shimei, Feng Tingyun(\u98ce\u5ead\u4e91) knew what happened and told everything to Wangquan Baye. Baye asked Fugui to kill the spirit at once, but Fugui didn't follow him and ready to get out of the mansion with the spirit. He was badly wounded in the yard. However, Dongfang Yuechu came here in time and saved him, while Tushan Honghong fighting against 500 guards out of the mansion.\n\nIn modern time, Qingtong wanted to find her love continuation man in this life. She knew that Susu had a book called Chunai Tianpian(\u7eaf\u7231\u5929\u7bc7, a book which can tell fox spirits some information about love continuation between spirit and human, each fox spirit has only one book in their whole life. The books in other fox spirits have no name but Chunai Tianpian is the only one which has it's name written by Dongfang Yuechu because this book belongs to Tushan Honghong before). When she approached the book, Tushan Yaya came and asked Susu to return the book. Susu refused, so Yaya was angry and wanted to kill Susu. Suddenly, Bai used his tears to stopped her. Wang Fugui and other people came. The book was robbed and Bai used his tears again to stopped them from escaping but unfortunately the book was cut in half. After that, they came to Tushan.

When he shot his tears, Susu ran in front of him, shot by the tear and disappeared. everyone thought she died except Fugui' grandfather. He calculated the position where Susu would appear. When Bai shot again, Susu appeared, becoming Honghong and kissed him. She helped him recover. Yaya finally believed that Susu was Honghong herself. At that moment, leaves and flowers fell everywhere, people all knew that she who they missed had came back.\n\n=== Yuehong Chapter (Season 3) ===\nEpisode: 28-48(including Beishan Yaodi Chapter)\n\nOP: Ruodang Laishi(\u82e5\u5f53\u6765\u4e16, means if we meet in next life)\n\nED: Lingzhou(\u94c3\u821f, means bell rings and boat floats)   Junlu(\u541b\u8def, means the way you walk, in Beishan Yaodi Chapter)\n\nThis is one of the most important chapters. It tells about the love between Dongfang Yuechu and Tushan Honghong. Tushan Honghong was the Queen of Tushan. Dongfang Yuechu came from Dongfang family, whose members could use magic kill-spirit fire, Chunzhi Yangyan(\u7eaf\u8d28\u9633\u708e, means pure sun fire). His parents were killed by Huhe Shuangxian(\u864e\u9e64\u53cc\u4ed9, a two-spirits group) so he ran to Tushan and was saved by Tushan Honghong. After that, Tushan was attacked by Jinmian Huoshen(\u91d1\u9762\u706b\u795e, God of fire, real name is Jin Renfeng(\u91d1\u4eba\u51e4)). Jin's Chunzhi Yangyan was so strong that Tushan couldn't fight against him. However, Dongfang Yuechu asked Tushan Honghong to use her hand through his heart and he kissed her immediately. Honghong got strong spirit power from that and finally Jin failed. After the attack. Yuechu used his diluted blood to wash her hands so that she was not afraid of Chunzhi Yangyan. Yuechu loved Honghong so much that he was ready to confess to her on Double Seventh Festival which day that Niulang and Zhinu meet each other every year in Chinese traditional legend. After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival. When Yuechu arrived there, he just saw Honghong walked into an icy cave and sat in front of a dead little Taoist body. Honghong knew he was nearby and said something to him on propose. Then Yuechu knew that she and Rongrong were caught by two Taoists when they were young. But while the elder one sleeping, the little one wanted to save these two fox spirits. Honghong remaineded of something that be told by an elder fox spirit, she just thought the little one would kill her so she uesd her hand through his heart but she understood his real motivation at that moment. The little Taoist told her his thoughts and died soon. Honghong was very guilty and it left a shadow in her heart. She couldn't do what she wanted even couldn't love others. Yuechu was distressed after knowing the fact and left Tushan for 50 years.\n\nIn these years, the friendship between human beings and spirits became worse than before. Yuechu experienced something important and became much stronger. He became the host of Yiqi Taoist League. At that time, people still thought Tushan fox spirits often killed people. Only Yuechu and Wangquan Fugui knew the fact: the black fox spirits(\u9ed1\u72d0) broke the peace. Yuechu and Fugui talked about how to let people belive the fact. Yuechu pretended to believe black fox spirits' plan and fight Honghong in order to lure black fox spirit to show up. But he knew the end clearly, it's a bet of his whole life. After fighting, the Queen of balck fox spirit showed up. Honghong finally realized his real idea and was moved. Yuechu left Tushan 50 years ago just wanted to achieve her dream, a dream about the peace between humans and spirits. Until this moment, Honghong expressed her love to Yuechu and Yuechu got his magic item, Xukong Zhilei(\u865a\u7a7a\u4e4b\u6cea, means the tears of void) because of his guilt. The Queen really wanted to get it, she seriously hurt Yuechu. But the magic item had been become Yuechu and Honghong's magic item of love continuation in their heart. The Queen couldn't kill them if she wanted the complete item. Honghong started the love continuation, making a wish that meet each other in next life. Dongfang Yuechu was dead and Tushan Honghong lost her spirit power and memory, become Tushan Susu.\n\nIn Tushan Theater, people knew what happened 500 years ago in Bai Yuechu's reincarnation and Tushan Susu. But Tushan was attacked by black fox spirits, Beishan Yaodi(real name is Shi Kuan(\u77f3\u5bbd)) and Tushan Meimei(\u6d82\u5c71\u7f8e\u7f8e, a member of black fox spirits). Tushan Susu became Honghong temporarily but was controlled by Meimei. To save her, Bai and Rongrong came into her dream and finally saw Honghong and Dongfang Yuechu's soul. Susu became back. With the help of Bai and Susu's help, Shi Kuan was back to normal and accepted a girl whose reincarnation was the Princess of Yuyao Guo(\u5fa1\u5996\u56fd) and Shi was her lover in their former life.\n\nAll of spirits in Tushan and people in Yiqi Taoist League wanted Tushan Honghong could really be back, so Tushan Yaya asked Bai to marry Susu. At the wedding ceremony. Bai sightly asked Susu whether she wanted to be a real excellent matchmaker or not.
