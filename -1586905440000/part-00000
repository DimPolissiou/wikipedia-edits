Unlike [[quad skates]], which have two front and two rear wheels, inline skates typically have two to five wheels arranged in a single line. Some, especially those for recreation, have a rubber \"stop\" or \"brake\" block attached to the rear of one or occasionally both of the skates so that the skater can slow down or stop by leaning back on the foot with the brake skate.\n\nThe modern style of inline skates was developed as a substitute for ice skates, for use by a Russian athlete{{who|date=October 2017}} training on solid ground for [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[speed skating|long track speed skating]] events{{CN|date=October 2017}}.

To the boot is attached a ''frame'', which holds the ''wheels'' in place.  ''[[bearing (mechanical)|Bearings]]'' allow the wheels to rotate freely around an axle. Finally, the rubber ''brake'' typically attaches to the frame of the right foot.\n\nThere are different types of inline skates for different types of skating such as [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]], [[Inline speed skating|speed skating]], [[inline hockey]] and [[Artistic roller skating|artistic inline skating]]. Those differ in the boots, frames and wheels that are used.\n\n===Boot===\nFor most skating a high boot is used, which provides more ankle support and is easier to skate in, particularly for beginners. Speed skaters often use a [[carbon fiber]] boot which provides greater support with a lower cut allowing more ankle flexion.\nFor recreational skating a soft boot is used for greater comfort, but many other disciplines prefer a harder boot, either to protect the foot against impact or for better control of the skate. The boot may also contain shock absorbent padding for comfort.  Downhill skaters often use boots that are heat-molded to the shape of the foot, with a foam liner.<ref name=Downhill>{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Nick|title=Downhill in-line skating|year=2000|publisher=Capstone Books|location=Mankato, Minn.|isbn=978-0-7368-0482-0|pages=20\u201321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvTejtf-JkMC&pg=PA13}}</ref>\n\nMost aggressive skates use a hard boot or a hard/soft boot for increased support.\n\n===Frame===\n[[Image:Inline skate wheels.jpg|thumb|The frame and wheels of an inline skate]]\n\nTypical recreational skates use frames built out of high-grade [[polyurethane]] (plastic). Low-end department or toy store skate frames may be composed of other types of plastic. Speed skate frames are usually built out of [[carbon fiber]] or [[extrusion|extruded]] [[aluminum]] (more expensive but more solid), magnesium, or even pressed aluminium, which is then folded into a frame (cheaper but less sturdy).\n\nCarbon fiber frames are expensive but generally more flexible, making for a smoother ride at the expense of worse power transfer between the leg and the wheels. In general, carbon fiber frames weigh about {{convert|160|-|180|g}}. Recently, high-end carbon fiber frames with a monocoque construction have been introduced. They offer the same level of stiffness as aluminum frames while weighing only around {{cvt|130|g}}. Aluminum can weigh from {{convert|170|to|24|g}}. Frame length ranges from 2 wheel framed freestyle wheels (used in [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]])  to around {{cvt|230|mm}} for short-framed four wheel skates (used in most inline designs), up to about {{cvt|325|mm}} for a five-wheel racing frame.\n\n===Bearings===\n[[Image:Inline skate bearings.jpg|thumb|[[Axle]]s, bearings and spacers]]\n\n[[Ball bearing]]s allow the wheels to rotate freely and smoothly. Bearings are usually rated on the [[ABEC scale]], a measure of the manufactured precision tolerance, ranging from 1 (worst) to 9 (best) in odd numbers. The ABEC standards were originally intended for high-speed machinery, not skating applications, and do not account for the quality of steel used, which is very important for how long bearings last. While higher rated bearings are generally better in overall quality, whether they automatically translate to more speed is questionable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skatefaq.com/articles/abec-hype.html|title=ABEC = HYPE?|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> Since at least 2007, Rollerblade brand amongst others have begun using their own rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fitness.inlinewarehouse.com/showthread.php?t=1274|title=Fitness|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222431/http://fitness.inlinewarehouse.com/showthread.php?t=1274|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>  For instance, Rollerblade brand is currently using a SG1 to SG9 rating system, whereas TwinCam brand is using its own \"ILQ\" ('''I'''n'''L'''ine '''Q'''ualified) rating system and Bones brand is using its own \"Skate Rated\" rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonesbearings.com/support/abec/|title=Abec vs. Skate Rated\u2122 - Support - Bones Bearings|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nA mistake that is often made in purchasing bearings is that spending more translates to more speed.  Generally, clean inline skate bearings contribute about 2% of the rolling resistance that the best urethane inline skate wheels produce, so there is very little opportunity in improving speed by spending more money on bearings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Newer bearings on the market have been offered that use ceramic ball bearings instead of steel, which are more expensive than traditional steel bearings but made of harder material.\n\nTwo bearings are used per wheel. The bearings slip into openings molded into each side of the wheel hub, and a flange molded into the wheel hub holds the bearings the correct distance apart. Additionally there is an axle spacer either machined into the axle or that slides over the axle (depending on the axle system used). Since the outer race of the bearing contacts the wheel spacer and the inner race of the bearing contacts the axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct. If the wheel spacer is wider than the axle spacer the bearings will bind when the axle bolt (or bolts) are tightened.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Wheels===\n[[Image:Inline Skate Wheels.svg|thumb|Inline skate wheels with different diameters and profiles]]\n\nWheel sizes vary depending on the skating style. Note carefully that the skater's age factors in. The wheel size an adult uses shall not really be the same as a child's:\n* {{cvt|44|-|72|mm|2}} for [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]].\n* {{cvt|47|-|80|mm|2}} for [[roller hockey]] skating.\n* {{cvt|68|-|72|mm|2}} for artistic inline skating.\n* {{cvt|72|-|80|mm|2}} for [[freestyle slalom skating]] and downhill skating.\n* {{cvt|70|-|90|mm|2}} for urban skating.\n* {{cvt|72|-|100|mm|2}} for general recreational skating.\n* {{cvt|80|-|90|mm|2}} for downhill inline skating.\n* {{cvt|100|-|125|mm|2}} for tri-skating, mushroom blading, and speed skating.\n* {{cvt|125|-|150|mm|2}} tires for off-road skating.\n\nWheels are nowadays almost universally made of [[polyurethane]] (a kind of durable plastic). Most other plastics and rubber either wear down too quickly or have too much [[rolling resistance]]. In general, the bigger the wheel, the faster the skate. A bigger wheel rolls over road imperfections smoothly thus the less bumpy the skating. On top of that, an inline skater trips far less on large wheels. However, large wheels take more energy to start rolling. Smaller wheels allow faster acceleration, maneuverability, and a lower center of gravity. \n\nWheel hardness is measured on the A scale (see [[Durometer]]) and usually ranges between 72A-93A (lower numbers are softer, higher numbers are harder). Harder wheels are not necessarily faster but tend to be more durable; soft wheels may have better grip and are generally less affected by road bumps. Harder wheels (which grant minimal elastic hysteresis energy absorption) maintain rolling speed far better while softer wheels (because they grip the surface) accelerate more straightforwardly when striding. In the 1990s, wheel rolling resistance (CRR \u2013 coefficient of rolling resistance) tended to be minimized with wheel hardness in the 78A durometer range, with rolling resistance dramatically increasing below 75A durometer and above 85A durometer. In the early 2000s, urethane compounds improved significantly, allowing skaters to use harder compounds to get better wheel life, and get the lowest rolling resistance in the 82A\u201384A durometer range.  \n\nWheel profiles and thickness again vary by application. Elliptic profiles were thought to minimize friction for a faster ride; however, they were intended to mimic the knife-like properties of an ice blade.They helped define the inner, central and outer edges. Elliptic profiles made the wheel quite maneuverable when turning or otherwise crossing over. More rounded profiles provided lower rolling resistance due to the greater \"belly\" or tire that increased resilience (or \"rebound\"); and these wheels were perceived as having better grip and being more stable (less like an ice blade), but were heavier than elliptical-profiled wheels and were often used in downhill racing (such as the Hyper Downhill racing wheels) and in recreational skates. Another advantage of rounded profile wheels is longer wear life due to the increased urethane amount on the tire.  To increase stability at high speed, skates intended for downhill skating usually have five or six wheels, in contrast with recreational skates, which typically have four wheels.<ref name=Downhill />  This advantage of more wheels having less rolling resistance has been largely negated by the {{cvt|100|-|110|mm}} diameter wheels with 4-wheel trucks. A flat profile allowed the wheel to be even far stabler than the rounded profile. This profile is almost exclusively used on aggressive skate wheels. On the flip-side, the squared-off shape caused cornering to be tremendously harder, seeing how edges are non-existent with a flat profile. In fact, a flat profile has only a center edge preventing the skater from leaning over.\n\nThe core's general design i.e. material, shape, and flexibility/sturdiness degree at the wheel's hub determine the wheel's properties as well. In a classical point of view, wheels on older skate models (during the 1980s and early 1990s) contained no core feature whatsoever. The core is a result of the gradual technological improvement inline skating underwent. Above all else, a wheel lacking a core is prone to deformation. This deformation is a hindrance to the skater's striding ability since in such a case it minimizes the skater's top speed. The core is inserted to hold the polyurethane firmly in place. Despite the setback, markets still distribute special wheels without a core. Core designs vary among open, full or semi-open. 'Spokes' are an element seen in wheels whose cores are open which generally increase overall wheel lightness. These are inserted into the hubs of wheels for inline speed skates, fitness skates, recreational skates, some slalom skates and artistic/figure inline skates. Apart from spokes, other open-cores can be hollowed out internally. The main disadvantage about an open core is that their design does not permit sturdiness hence they are highly likely to snap under too much pressure i.e. when jumping. Another trade-off with open cores is the lesser amount of polyurethane around it to compensate for the spoked or hollow shape meaning they last shorter. Full cores are entirely solid, akin to a pipe's cross-section. This core design is mostly favored amongst aggressive skaters whose leaps off higher levels strain the wheels when landing. Of course, these cores (alongside the extra polyurethane) tend to add weight on the wheel. Some even disfavor the full core design for its rigidity that feels uncomfortable. The question still stands on whether a full core improves power transfer. Semi-open cores are a hybrid between the two previously mentioned cores seen on wheels for urban skates, slalom skates and inline hockey skates. Minuscule holes are typically punctured into these solid cores to provide a semi-open design.\n\n===Heel brakes or toe stops===\n[[File:Heel brake.jpg|thumb|right|Heel brake]]\nA hard rubber brake attached to the heel of the frame allows the skater to stop by lifting the toes of the skate, forcing the brake onto the ground. Learning how to use the heel brake is very important for beginners, as it is the easiest way to stop in emergencies and to control speed on downhills. Also, with practise, beginners realise if the heel brakes are better placed for them on the left/right foot.\n\nHeel brakes can interfere with a useful technique called a crossover turn, in which a skater crosses one leg over another to make a sharp turn without losing much speed; for this reason, most intermediate to advanced users prefer not to use heel brakes. Skaters in the [[freestyle slalom]] and [[aggressive inline skating]] disciplines do not use heel brakes, since they limit the skater's ability to perform tricks effectively. Aggressive inline skates and racing skates generally have no heel brake, thereby permitting extra speed and control.\n\nInline skaters lacking a heel brake can use various other methods to stop, such as the T-stop in which the skater moves one skate perpendicular to the other, making a \"T\" shape to increase friction and reduce speed, or the more advanced maneuver of a [[hockey stop]]/[[snow plow stop]], in which the skater quickly moves both skates perpendicular to the path of motion.\n\nFor [[artistic roller skating]] purposes, [[inline figure skating|inline figure skates]] can also feature a \"toe stop\" which aids in performing [[figure skating jumps]].\n\n==Setups==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\n{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Flat Setup===\nA flat setup is the most common setup used on inline skates. Almost all non-aggressive inline skates are sold with a flat wheel setup. Flat means that all the wheels touch the ground at the same time when resting on flat ground. Flat setups are not the most maneuverable but what they lack in maneuverability they make up for in speed. Flat setups tend to be the fastest setups, compared to setups such as the Hi-Lo or anti-rocker. The presence of two middle wheels matching the diametrical size of the rest increases contact points with any surface.  They also minimize the rate at which the skater's loading weight deforms the wheels. This minimizes the wheel's footprint thereby minimizing rolling resistance. [[Inline speed skating|Speed skaters]] and marathon skaters normally use flat setups. As a side note on skating technique, due to the setup maximizing contact, a daring inline skater is capable of gliding down a flight of stairs whether backwards naturally or forwards. This has been termed 'bashing'. One other advantageous consideration with this setup is the [[Powerslide (inline skating)|powerslide]], an advanced braking method.\n\nAggressive skates are sometimes sold with flat setups, but with a small space in the middle for grinding. With aggressive skates, the flat setup obviously leads to better control on the ground when either accelerating on a push or decelerating on a drag because of increased traction. What's more it grants a faster speed, translating to faster grinds, more powerful pumps in a skate ramp and/or higher heights ('airs') off the edge of a vert ramp. Indeed, flat setups are quick save for the likelihood that they will be heavier and the two standard central wheels tend to 'bite' when grinding. Similar to skateboarding in certain respects, 'biting' is a common hindrance during grinding whereby friction between the wheel(s) and surface it comes into contact causes the wheel(s) then entire boot to suddenly reach a halt and the momentum throws the aggressive inline skater off the rail or ledge. Again, the aspect of wheel profile is key here. A harder wheel on a flat setup will slide and 'bite' less than a softer wheel. Likewise an elliptical profile (Undercover's Dustin Werbeski 'super bullet' wheels for example) possesses less surface area hence it will not bite as much either. Adjusting to a flat setup can even out shock when landing jumps. In doing so, an inline skater's hardware like wheels, bearings, axles and the frame itself are twice as much to be spared damage.\n\n[[image:Flat inline.svg|frame|200px|center|A 'flat' inline setup]]\n\nIt is worth noting that having a flat setup is just one factor in a fast skate setup. A long frame, low resistance bearings, and good technique all contribute greatly to a skater's speed.\n\n===Full 'crescent/banana' Rocker===\nFull rockers are used by skaters who favor maneuverability when skating on flat ground. Freestyle skaters, [[freestyle slalom skaters]] and artistic inline skaters tend to use this setup. Inline hockey players no less can customize their wheels to implement this setup (especially those who favor nimble change in direction over sheer speed during a match). This setup is called \"crescent\" or \"banana\" because it is curved, and mimics a curved ice blade profile. On flat ground this setup will only have 1\u20132 wheels touching the ground at any one time. This makes the skate much easier to pivot but lacks stability so it is harder to balance on. To attain balance when learning to skate a full rocker, it is recommended that pressure and weight are deposited on either the two middle wheels or the two wheels in the back. Avoid applying pressure on the two front wheels when taking strides since this is what will cause instability. In addition, a full rocker is slower than a flat setup in terms of top speed. Worst of all at high speeds, skates with a full rocker setup can experience a speed wobble, where they oscillate uncontrollably. The skater may lose control and crash to the ground.\n[[image:Full Rocker.svg|frame|200px|center|A full 'crescent/banana' rocker inline setup]]\n\nFlat setups generally wear into a 'natural' rocker. This is because the front and back wheels seem to receive the vast majority of wear on inline skates.\n\nHaving a short frame ({{cvt|230|\u2013|245|mm|disp=sqbr}}) in combination with a full rocker is optimum for achieving the highest maneuverability when skating.\n\n===Front Rocker===\nFront rockers are often used by street skaters who want to combine the ability of a full rocker to handle imperfections in the ground with a flat setup's sheer speed. Having a smaller wheel at the front encourages the front wheel to guide the rest of the skate over ground imperfections, rather than digging in and tripping up the less experienced skater. Maintaining a flat profile at the back allows the skater to transfer power through the rear of the skate efficiently to maintain a good speed.\n\n[[image:Front Rocker.svg|frame|200px|center|A front rocker inline setup]]\n\n===\u2018Hi-Lo\u2019 Setup===\nSome hockey skates like Bauer, Mission, Alkali and CCM brands, fitness skates like K2's VO2 100 X Pro and inline speed skates include a Hi-Lo setup. Hi-Lo setups resemble a flat setup in that all 4 wheels touch the ground at the same time. Unlike a flat setup, however, different wheel sizes are used. The front two wheels will be smaller than the back two wheels. This is possible because of the location of the axles on the frame itself. One example is a Bauer frame that has two wheels in the front that are {{cvt|76|mm}} and two wheels in the back that are {{cvt|80|mm}}. Another example is a {{cvt|74|-|76|-|78|-|80|mm}} wheel arrangement. This drastically changed the pace at which inline hockey players accelerated. Furthermore, by transferring weight forward, the skater could sprint explosively off the toe section and reduce instances of falling backwards. If the hockey skate is used recreationally outside the arena, the skater will find climbing slopes much easier than on a flat setup. Owing to the fact that inline hockey skate manufacturers design frames with varying axle hole placements or even raise the frame's back bolt to be higher than the front bolt nowadays, wheels of the same diameter (like {{cvt|80|mm|disp=sqbr}}) can be used entirely.\n\nBeyond inline hockey, the Hi-Lo setup was an experimental component seen on K2's VO2 100 X Pro where the manufacturers believed that the two smaller wheels ({{cvt|90|mm|disp=sqbr}} each) in front would increase stability and rate of acceleration while the two bigger wheels ({{cvt|100|mm|disp=sqbr}} each) in the back would maintain high speeds. Essentially this K2 skate model married both wheel size properties. A Hi-Lo configuration on an inline speed skate employs three large sized wheels and a smaller sized wheel between the first and third wheels beneath the ball part of the foot (see [[Inline speed skating|speed skates]]). An example is a {{cvt|110|-|100|-|110|-|110|mm}} arrangement beginning front to back. This increases efficiency now that the foot pushes on a smaller wheel. The smaller wheel lowers deck height off the ground improving stability and keeps the frame length shorter improving maneuverability and comfort amongst speed skaters having a smaller foot size. This is desirable seeing how wheels on inline speed skates are enormous enough to occupy a lot of room in frames. Unfortunately, top speed for a Hi-Lo setup is far less than that for a flat setup where same sized large wheels are used.\n\n==='TriDi' Hi-Lo Setup===\nAnother variant of the setup in which there are three diameters of wheels. It is supposed to emphasize the same benefits as the HiLo system but with greater maneuverability due to the smaller front wheels. The configuration is {{cvt|72|mm|2}}, {{cvt|76|mm|2}}, {{cvt|80|mm|2}}, {{cvt|76|mm|2}}. It allows one to pivot on the third wheel similar to the brand Wizard Skates. This system is also used by some hockey skaters as it pitches the foot slightly forward.\n\n===Aggressive Hi-Lo Setup===\nA few aggressive skate frames (most notably Rollerblade's Switch Frame, Ground Control's Bullet Frame, and Oysi Frame) are designed so that there are two big outer wheels, and two small inner wheels, rockered so that they all touch the ground. This gives the benefits of a flat setup, while giving the rollerblader more space to grind on the H-block between the wheels.\n\n===Anti-rocker===\nAnti-rocker is the most popular setup for aggressive skaters. An anti-rocker wheel is a small hard wheel that replaces the two middle wheels.  Anti-rocker wheels almost never touch the ground except in cases where the terrain is uneven, such as skating over a ramp. Anti-rockers can be made of plastic, or high density polyurethane. Some use bearings so that they can spin. As they can spin, the anti-rockers wear out more evenly when grinding. Anti-rockers containing bearings can effectively roll over uneven ground or features like steps, lessening tripping hazards. Others do not use bearings so that they're lighter. The anti-rockers themselves lock the H-block onto the ledge or rail a skater grinds. There is a minor nuisance to anti-rocker hardware in which the items emit a loud noise upon fastening into a grind that some aggressive skaters find unbearable. The anti-rocker setup altogether makes maneuvering harder (since the standard wheels slip more), wheel life shorter, overall speed slower, a rougher ride, and a wider turning radius, but because of the extra space in the middle, it makes grinding objects much easier than with a flat setup.\n\n===Freestyle===\nThe freestyle frame is another setup used by aggressive skaters. This setup simply has only two wheels \u2013 one in the front and one in the back. In between the two wheels is an area of solid material, resembling a large \"H Block\", which is used for grinding. Freestyle frames have nearly identical advantages to the Anti-rocker. Since large space is freed up in the middle, the skater can not only grind wider surface areas like an entire ledge but also the frame's weight is lighter. Likewise, the Freestyle frame shares its disadvantages with its Anti-rocker cousin already listed. As opposed to anti-rockers which securely lock grinds, aggressive skaters should train themselves to remain balanced when sliding across narrow rails or edges on a Freestyle frame. Worse still when not observing carefulness, a Freestyle setup can easily hook on vertical surfaces including steps, coping and funbox edges if you roll over them, leading to tripping incidents. This is why the technique to 'bash' (see ''Flat Setup'') a staircase is almost impossible on a Freestyle setup. Freestyle frames can be purchased, although removing the two inner wheels of a flat or anti-rocker frame technically makes it freestyle, however this would not be very durable due to the lack of  solid grinding material. Originally invented by Fifty-50 (an aggressive inline skate frame company), Juice Blocks allow the skater to convert their flat or anti-rocker frames into proper freestyle frames. Juice Blocks are simply solid grind blocks inserted into the axle holes where two middle wheels or anti-rockers are found.\n\n===Tri-rocker===\nTri-rocker (not to be confused with the 3-wheeled frame/chassis seen on Tri-Skates) is used by some aggressive skaters. It is another method of making grinds easier. A frame with a tri-rocker setup has only one wheel in the middle, either in the second wheel position or in the third wheel position, depending on what kinds of grinds the skater plans on doing. The remaining axle has an anti-rocker wheel, a special grind block, or is just left empty.\n\nThe purpose of a tri-rocker setup is to give the skater good speed and maneuverability, like on a flat setup.

Some, especially those for recreation, have a rubber \"stop\" or \"brake\" block attached to the rear of one or occasionally both of the skates so that the skater can slow down or stop by leaning back on the foot with the brake skate.\n[[Image:USD Classic Throne Sean Aggressive-Skates.jpg|thumb|right|Aggressive inline skates]]\nThe modern style of inline skates was developed as a substitute for ice skates, for use by a Russian athlete{{who|date=October 2017}} training on solid ground for [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[speed skating|long track speed skating]] events{{CN|date=October 2017}}.

To the boot is attached a ''frame'', which holds the ''wheels'' in place.  ''[[bearing (mechanical)|Bearings]]'' allow the wheels to rotate freely around an axle. Finally, the rubber ''brake'' typically attaches to the frame of the right foot.\n\nThere are different types of inline skates for different types of skating such as [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]], [[Inline speed skating|speed skating]], [[inline hockey]] and [[Artistic roller skating|artistic inline skating]]. Those differ in the boots, frames and wheels that are used.\n\n===Boot===\nFor most skating a high boot is used, which provides more ankle support and is easier to skate in, particularly for beginners. Speed skaters often use a [[carbon fiber]] boot which provides greater support with a lower cut allowing more ankle flexion.\nFor recreational skating a soft boot is used for greater comfort, but many other disciplines prefer a harder boot, either to protect the foot against impact or for better control of the skate. The boot may also contain shock absorbent padding for comfort.  Downhill skaters often use boots that are heat-molded to the shape of the foot, with a foam liner.<ref name=Downhill>{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Nick|title=Downhill in-line skating|year=2000|publisher=Capstone Books|location=Mankato, Minn.|isbn=978-0-7368-0482-0|pages=20\u201321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvTejtf-JkMC&pg=PA13}}</ref>\n\nMost aggressive skates use a hard boot or a hard/soft boot for increased support.\n\n===Frame===\n[[Image:Inline skate wheels.jpg|thumb|The frame and wheels of an inline skate]]\n\nTypical recreational skates use frames built out of high-grade [[polyurethane]] (plastic). Low-end department or toy store skate frames may be composed of other types of plastic. Speed skate frames are usually built out of [[carbon fiber]] or [[extrusion|extruded]] [[aluminum]] (more expensive but more solid), magnesium, or even pressed aluminium, which is then folded into a frame (cheaper but less sturdy).\n\nCarbon fiber frames are expensive but generally more flexible, making for a smoother ride at the expense of worse power transfer between the leg and the wheels. In general, carbon fiber frames weigh about {{convert|160|-|180|g}}. Recently, high-end carbon fiber frames with a monocoque construction have been introduced. They offer the same level of stiffness as aluminum frames while weighing only around {{cvt|130|g}}. Aluminum can weigh from {{convert|170|to|24|g}}. Frame length ranges from 2 wheel framed freestyle wheels (used in [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]])  to around {{cvt|230|mm}} for short-framed four wheel skates (used in most inline designs), up to about {{cvt|325|mm}} for a five-wheel racing frame.\n\n===Bearings===\n[[Image:Inline skate bearings.jpg|thumb|[[Axle]]s, bearings and spacers]]\n\n[[Ball bearing]]s allow the wheels to rotate freely and smoothly. Bearings are usually rated on the [[ABEC scale]], a measure of the manufactured precision tolerance, ranging from 1 (worst) to 9 (best) in odd numbers. The ABEC standards were originally intended for high-speed machinery, not skating applications, and do not account for the quality of steel used, which is very important for how long bearings last. While higher rated bearings are generally better in overall quality, whether they automatically translate to more speed is questionable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skatefaq.com/articles/abec-hype.html|title=ABEC = HYPE?|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> Since at least 2007, Rollerblade brand amongst others have begun using their own rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fitness.inlinewarehouse.com/showthread.php?t=1274|title=Fitness|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222431/http://fitness.inlinewarehouse.com/showthread.php?t=1274|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>  For instance, Rollerblade brand is currently using a SG1 to SG9 rating system, whereas TwinCam brand is using its own \"ILQ\" ('''I'''n'''L'''ine '''Q'''ualified) rating system and Bones brand is using its own \"Skate Rated\" rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonesbearings.com/support/abec/|title=Abec vs. Skate Rated\u2122 - Support - Bones Bearings|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nA mistake that is often made in purchasing bearings is that spending more translates to more speed.  Generally, clean inline skate bearings contribute about 2% of the rolling resistance that the best urethane inline skate wheels produce, so there is very little opportunity in improving speed by spending more money on bearings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Newer bearings on the market have been offered that use ceramic ball bearings instead of steel, which are more expensive than traditional steel bearings but made of harder material.\n\nTwo bearings are used per wheel. The bearings slip into openings molded into each side of the wheel hub, and a flange molded into the wheel hub holds the bearings the correct distance apart. Additionally there is an axle spacer either machined into the axle or that slides over the axle (depending on the axle system used). Since the outer race of the bearing contacts the wheel spacer and the inner race of the bearing contacts the axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct. If the wheel spacer is wider than the axle spacer the bearings will bind when the axle bolt (or bolts) are tightened.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Wheels===\n[[Image:Inline Skate Wheels.svg|thumb|Inline skate wheels with different diameters and profiles]]\n\nWheel sizes vary depending on the skating style. Note carefully that the skater's age factors in. The wheel size an adult uses shall not really be the same as a child's:\n* {{cvt|44|-|72|mm|2}} for [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]].\n* {{cvt|47|-|80|mm|2}} for [[roller hockey]] skating.\n* {{cvt|68|-|72|mm|2}} for artistic inline skating.\n* {{cvt|72|-|80|mm|2}} for [[freestyle slalom skating]] and downhill skating.\n* {{cvt|70|-|90|mm|2}} for urban skating.\n* {{cvt|72|-|100|mm|2}} for general recreational skating.\n* {{cvt|80|-|90|mm|2}} for downhill inline skating.\n* {{cvt|100|-|125|mm|2}} for tri-skating, mushroom blading, and speed skating.\n* {{cvt|125|-|150|mm|2}} tires for off-road skating.\n\nWheels are nowadays almost universally made of [[polyurethane]] (a kind of durable plastic). Most other plastics and rubber either wear down too quickly or have too much [[rolling resistance]]. In general, the bigger the wheel, the faster the skate. A bigger wheel rolls over road imperfections smoothly thus the less bumpy the skating. On top of that, an inline skater trips far less on large wheels. However, large wheels take more energy to start rolling. Smaller wheels allow faster acceleration, maneuverability, and a lower center of gravity. \n\nWheel hardness is measured on the A scale (see [[Durometer]]) and usually ranges between 72A-93A (lower numbers are softer, higher numbers are harder). Harder wheels are not necessarily faster but tend to be more durable; soft wheels may have better grip and are generally less affected by road bumps. Harder wheels (which grant minimal elastic hysteresis energy absorption) maintain rolling speed far better while softer wheels (because they grip the surface) accelerate more straightforwardly when striding. In the 1990s, wheel rolling resistance (CRR \u2013 coefficient of rolling resistance) tended to be minimized with wheel hardness in the 78A durometer range, with rolling resistance dramatically increasing below 75A durometer and above 85A durometer. In the early 2000s, urethane compounds improved significantly, allowing skaters to use harder compounds to get better wheel life, and get the lowest rolling resistance in the 82A\u201384A durometer range.  \n\nWheel profiles and thickness again vary by application. Elliptic profiles were thought to minimize friction for a faster ride; however, they were intended to mimic the knife-like properties of an ice blade.They helped define the inner, central and outer edges. Elliptic profiles made the wheel quite maneuverable when turning or otherwise crossing over. More rounded profiles provided lower rolling resistance due to the greater \"belly\" or tire that increased resilience (or \"rebound\"); and these wheels were perceived as having better grip and being more stable (less like an ice blade), but were heavier than elliptical-profiled wheels and were often used in downhill racing (such as the Hyper Downhill racing wheels) and in recreational skates. Another advantage of rounded profile wheels is longer wear life due to the increased urethane amount on the tire.  To increase stability at high speed, skates intended for downhill skating usually have five or six wheels, in contrast with recreational skates, which typically have four wheels.<ref name=Downhill />  This advantage of more wheels having less rolling resistance has been largely negated by the {{cvt|100|-|110|mm}} diameter wheels with 4-wheel trucks. A flat profile allowed the wheel to be even far stabler than the rounded profile. This profile is almost exclusively used on aggressive skate wheels. On the flip-side, the squared-off shape caused cornering to be tremendously harder, seeing how edges are non-existent with a flat profile. In fact, a flat profile has only a center edge preventing the skater from leaning over.\n\nThe core's general design i.e. material, shape, and flexibility/sturdiness degree at the wheel's hub determine the wheel's properties as well. In a classical point of view, wheels on older skate models (during the 1980s and early 1990s) contained no core feature whatsoever. The core is a result of the gradual technological improvement inline skating underwent. Above all else, a wheel lacking a core is prone to deformation. This deformation is a hindrance to the skater's striding ability since in such a case it minimizes the skater's top speed. The core is inserted to hold the polyurethane firmly in place. Despite the setback, markets still distribute special wheels without a core. Core designs vary among open, full or semi-open. 'Spokes' are an element seen in wheels whose cores are open which generally increase overall wheel lightness. These are inserted into the hubs of wheels for inline speed skates, fitness skates, recreational skates, some slalom skates and artistic/figure inline skates. Apart from spokes, other open-cores can be hollowed out internally. The main disadvantage about an open core is that their design does not permit sturdiness hence they are highly likely to snap under too much pressure i.e. when jumping. Another trade-off with open cores is the lesser amount of polyurethane around it to compensate for the spoked or hollow shape meaning they last shorter. Full cores are entirely solid, akin to a pipe's cross-section. This core design is mostly favored amongst aggressive skaters whose leaps off higher levels strain the wheels when landing. Of course, these cores (alongside the extra polyurethane) tend to add weight on the wheel. Some even disfavor the full core design for its rigidity that feels uncomfortable. The question still stands on whether a full core improves power transfer. Semi-open cores are a hybrid between the two previously mentioned cores seen on wheels for urban skates, slalom skates and inline hockey skates. Minuscule holes are typically punctured into these solid cores to provide a semi-open design.\n\n===Heel brakes or toe stops===\n[[File:Heel brake.jpg|thumb|right|Heel brake]]\nA hard rubber brake attached to the heel of the frame allows the skater to stop by lifting the toes of the skate, forcing the brake onto the ground. Learning how to use the heel brake is very important for beginners, as it is the easiest way to stop in emergencies and to control speed on downhills. Also, with practise, beginners realise if the heel brakes are better placed for them on the left/right foot.\n\nHeel brakes can interfere with a useful technique called a crossover turn, in which a skater crosses one leg over another to make a sharp turn without losing much speed; for this reason, most intermediate to advanced users prefer not to use heel brakes. Skaters in the [[freestyle slalom]] and [[aggressive inline skating]] disciplines do not use heel brakes, since they limit the skater's ability to perform tricks effectively. Aggressive inline skates and racing skates generally have no heel brake, thereby permitting extra speed and control.\n\nInline skaters lacking a heel brake can use various other methods to stop, such as the T-stop in which the skater moves one skate perpendicular to the other, making a \"T\" shape to increase friction and reduce speed, or the more advanced maneuver of a [[hockey stop]]/[[snow plow stop]], in which the skater quickly moves both skates perpendicular to the path of motion.\n\nFor [[artistic roller skating]] purposes, [[inline figure skating|inline figure skates]] can also feature a \"toe stop\" which aids in performing [[figure skating jumps]].\n\n==Setups==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}\n{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Flat Setup===\nA flat setup is the most common setup used on inline skates. Almost all non-aggressive inline skates are sold with a flat wheel setup. Flat means that all the wheels touch the ground at the same time when resting on flat ground. Flat setups are not the most maneuverable but what they lack in maneuverability they make up for in speed. Flat setups tend to be the fastest setups, compared to setups such as the Hi-Lo or anti-rocker. The presence of two middle wheels matching the diametrical size of the rest increases contact points with any surface.  They also minimize the rate at which the skater's loading weight deforms the wheels. This minimizes the wheel's footprint thereby minimizing rolling resistance. [[Inline speed skating|Speed skaters]] and marathon skaters normally use flat setups. As a side note on skating technique, due to the setup maximizing contact, a daring inline skater is capable of gliding down a flight of stairs whether backwards naturally or forwards. This has been termed 'bashing'. One other advantageous consideration with this setup is the [[Powerslide (inline skating)|powerslide]], an advanced braking method.\n\nAggressive skates are sometimes sold with flat setups, but with a small space in the middle for grinding. With aggressive skates, the flat setup obviously leads to better control on the ground when either accelerating on a push or decelerating on a drag because of increased traction. What's more it grants a faster speed, translating to faster grinds, more powerful pumps in a skate ramp and/or higher heights ('airs') off the edge of a vert ramp. Indeed, flat setups are quick save for the likelihood that they will be heavier and the two standard central wheels tend to 'bite' when grinding. Similar to skateboarding in certain respects, 'biting' is a common hindrance during grinding whereby friction between the wheel(s) and surface it comes into contact causes the wheel(s) then entire boot to suddenly reach a halt and the momentum throws the aggressive inline skater off the rail or ledge. Again, the aspect of wheel profile is key here. A harder wheel on a flat setup will slide and 'bite' less than a softer wheel. Likewise an elliptical profile (Undercover's Dustin Werbeski 'super bullet' wheels for example) possesses less surface area hence it will not bite as much either. Adjusting to a flat setup can even out shock when landing jumps. In doing so, an inline skater's hardware like wheels, bearings, axles and the frame itself are twice as much to be spared damage.\n\n[[image:Flat inline.svg|frame|200px|center|A 'flat' inline setup]]\n\nIt is worth noting that having a flat setup is just one factor in a fast skate setup. A long frame, low resistance bearings, and good technique all contribute greatly to a skater's speed.\n\n===Full 'crescent/banana' Rocker===\nFull rockers are used by skaters who favor maneuverability when skating on flat ground. Freestyle skaters, [[freestyle slalom skaters]] and artistic inline skaters tend to use this setup. Inline hockey players no less can customize their wheels to implement this setup (especially those who favor nimble change in direction over sheer speed during a match). This setup is called \"crescent\" or \"banana\" because it is curved, and mimics a curved ice blade profile. On flat ground this setup will only have 1\u20132 wheels touching the ground at any one time. This makes the skate much easier to pivot but lacks stability so it is harder to balance on. To attain balance when learning to skate a full rocker, it is recommended that pressure and weight are deposited on either the two middle wheels or the two wheels in the back. Avoid applying pressure on the two front wheels when taking strides since this is what will cause instability. In addition, a full rocker is slower than a flat setup in terms of top speed. Worst of all at high speeds, skates with a full rocker setup can experience a speed wobble, where they oscillate uncontrollably. The skater may lose control and crash to the ground.\n[[image:Full Rocker.svg|frame|200px|center|A full 'crescent/banana' rocker inline setup]]\n\nFlat setups generally wear into a 'natural' rocker. This is because the front and back wheels seem to receive the vast majority of wear on inline skates.\n\nHaving a short frame ({{cvt|230|\u2013|245|mm|disp=sqbr}}) in combination with a full rocker is optimum for achieving the highest maneuverability when skating.\n\n===Front Rocker===\nFront rockers are often used by street skaters who want to combine the ability of a full rocker to handle imperfections in the ground with a flat setup's sheer speed. Having a smaller wheel at the front encourages the front wheel to guide the rest of the skate over ground imperfections, rather than digging in and tripping up the less experienced skater. Maintaining a flat profile at the back allows the skater to transfer power through the rear of the skate efficiently to maintain a good speed.\n\n[[image:Front Rocker.svg|frame|200px|center|A front rocker inline setup]]\n\n===\u2018Hi-Lo\u2019 Setup===\nSome hockey skates like Bauer, Mission, Alkali and CCM brands, fitness skates like K2's VO2 100 X Pro and inline speed skates include a Hi-Lo setup. Hi-Lo setups resemble a flat setup in that all 4 wheels touch the ground at the same time. Unlike a flat setup, however, different wheel sizes are used. The front two wheels will be smaller than the back two wheels. This is possible because of the location of the axles on the frame itself. One example is a Bauer frame that has two wheels in the front that are {{cvt|76|mm}} and two wheels in the back that are {{cvt|80|mm}}. Another example is a {{cvt|74|-|76|-|78|-|80|mm}} wheel arrangement. This drastically changed the pace at which inline hockey players accelerated. Furthermore, by transferring weight forward, the skater could sprint explosively off the toe section and reduce instances of falling backwards. If the hockey skate is used recreationally outside the arena, the skater will find climbing slopes much easier than on a flat setup. Owing to the fact that inline hockey skate manufacturers design frames with varying axle hole placements or even raise the frame's back bolt to be higher than the front bolt nowadays, wheels of the same diameter (like {{cvt|80|mm|disp=sqbr}}) can be used entirely.\n\nBeyond inline hockey, the Hi-Lo setup was an experimental component seen on K2's VO2 100 X Pro where the manufacturers believed that the two smaller wheels ({{cvt|90|mm|disp=sqbr}} each) in front would increase stability and rate of acceleration while the two bigger wheels ({{cvt|100|mm|disp=sqbr}} each) in the back would maintain high speeds. Essentially this K2 skate model married both wheel size properties. A Hi-Lo configuration on an inline speed skate employs three large sized wheels and a smaller sized wheel between the first and third wheels beneath the ball part of the foot (see [[Inline speed skating|speed skates]]). An example is a {{cvt|110|-|100|-|110|-|110|mm}} arrangement beginning front to back. This increases efficiency now that the foot pushes on a smaller wheel. The smaller wheel lowers deck height off the ground improving stability and keeps the frame length shorter improving maneuverability and comfort amongst speed skaters having a smaller foot size. This is desirable seeing how wheels on inline speed skates are enormous enough to occupy a lot of room in frames. Unfortunately, top speed for a Hi-Lo setup is far less than that for a flat setup where same sized large wheels are used.\n\n==='TriDi' Hi-Lo Setup===\nAnother variant of the setup in which there are three diameters of wheels. It is supposed to emphasize the same benefits as the HiLo system but with greater maneuverability due to the smaller front wheels. The configuration is {{cvt|72|mm|2}}, {{cvt|76|mm|2}}, {{cvt|80|mm|2}}, {{cvt|76|mm|2}}. It allows one to pivot on the third wheel similar to the brand Wizard Skates. This system is also used by some hockey skaters as it pitches the foot slightly forward.\n\n===Aggressive Hi-Lo Setup===\nA few aggressive skate frames (most notably Rollerblade's Switch Frame, Ground Control's Bullet Frame, and Oysi Frame) are designed so that there are two big outer wheels, and two small inner wheels, rockered so that they all touch the ground. This gives the benefits of a flat setup, while giving the rollerblader more space to grind on the H-block between the wheels.\n\n===Anti-rocker===\nAnti-rocker is the most popular setup for aggressive skaters. An anti-rocker wheel is a small hard wheel that replaces the two middle wheels.  Anti-rocker wheels almost never touch the ground except in cases where the terrain is uneven, such as skating over a ramp. Anti-rockers can be made of plastic, or high density polyurethane. Some use bearings so that they can spin. As they can spin, the anti-rockers wear out more evenly when grinding. Anti-rockers containing bearings can effectively roll over uneven ground or features like steps, lessening tripping hazards. Others do not use bearings so that they're lighter. The anti-rockers themselves lock the H-block onto the ledge or rail a skater grinds. There is a minor nuisance to anti-rocker hardware in which the items emit a loud noise upon fastening into a grind that some aggressive skaters find unbearable. The anti-rocker setup altogether makes maneuvering harder (since the standard wheels slip more), wheel life shorter, overall speed slower, a rougher ride, and a wider turning radius, but because of the extra space in the middle, it makes grinding objects much easier than with a flat setup.\n\n===Freestyle===\nThe freestyle frame is another setup used by aggressive skaters. This setup simply has only two wheels \u2013 one in the front and one in the back. In between the two wheels is an area of solid material, resembling a large \"H Block\", which is used for grinding. Freestyle frames have nearly identical advantages to the Anti-rocker. Since large space is freed up in the middle, the skater can not only grind wider surface areas like an entire ledge but also the frame's weight is lighter. Likewise, the Freestyle frame shares its disadvantages with its Anti-rocker cousin already listed. As opposed to anti-rockers which securely lock grinds, aggressive skaters should train themselves to remain balanced when sliding across narrow rails or edges on a Freestyle frame. Worse still when not observing carefulness, a Freestyle setup can easily hook on vertical surfaces including steps, coping and funbox edges if you roll over them, leading to tripping incidents. This is why the technique to 'bash' (see ''Flat Setup'') a staircase is almost impossible on a Freestyle setup. Freestyle frames can be purchased, although removing the two inner wheels of a flat or anti-rocker frame technically makes it freestyle, however this would not be very durable due to the lack of  solid grinding material. Originally invented by Fifty-50 (an aggressive inline skate frame company), Juice Blocks allow the skater to convert their flat or anti-rocker frames into proper freestyle frames. Juice Blocks are simply solid grind blocks inserted into the axle holes where two middle wheels or anti-rockers are found.\n\n===Tri-rocker===\nTri-rocker (not to be confused with the 3-wheeled frame/chassis seen on Tri-Skates) is used by some aggressive skaters. It is another method of making grinds easier. A frame with a tri-rocker setup has only one wheel in the middle, either in the second wheel position or in the third wheel position, depending on what kinds of grinds the skater plans on doing. The remaining axle has an anti-rocker wheel, a special grind block, or is just left empty.\n\nThe purpose of a tri-rocker setup is to give the skater good speed and maneuverability, like on a flat setup. But because of the extra space, grinding is also a little easier than a flat setup.\n\n==See also==\nForms of inline skating:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Aggressive inline skating]]\n* [[Artistic roller skating]]\n* [[Freestyle slalom skating]]\n*[[Ice skates]]\n* [[Inline figure skating]]\n* [[Inline hockey]]\n* [[Inline speed skating]]\n* Recreational skating\n*[[Roller shoe]]\n* [[Road skating]]\n* [[Roller skates]]\n* [[Vert skating]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Inline skates}}\n* [http://www.bigwheelblading.com Big Wheel Blading Online Magazine is the source for all things on Big Wheel inline skates]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130629235737/http://www.londonskaters.com/article_rockering.htm The Londonskaters guide to rockering inline skates]\n* [http://skating.thierstein.net/Knowledge/Inline_Skating_Rollerblading_Knowledge_Rockering.html Markus Thierstein's original article]\n* [https://duefuse.com/best-inline-skates Inline skates buyer guide]\n* [http://The%20National%20Museum%20of%20Roller%20Skating The National Museum of Roller Skating]\n\n{{Inline skating}}\n{{Human-powered vehicles}}\n{{footwear}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Inline Skates}}\n[[Category:Roller skates]]\n[[Category:Roller skating equipment]]\n[[Category:1980s fads and trends]]\n", "name_user": "Super ninja2", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:image moved to top", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_skates"}

Written by Bieber, [[Poo Bear]], [[James Abrahart]], [[Andreas Schuller]], [[Thomas Troelsen]], James Wong and [[Leroy Clampitt]], the song was produced by [[Axident]], Gladius, Big Taste and co-produced by Boyd. It was released to American [[rhythmic contemporary]] and [[contemporary hit radio]] stations on March 8, 2016 as the album's fourth and final single. It is an [[electropop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, with [[bass guitar]], [[guitar]] and [[percussion]] in its instrumentation. Lyrically, \"Company\" talks about looking forward to getting to know someone attractive, but also sets some healthy boundaries for doing so.\n\nAs an album track, it reached the top-forty in the majority of the countries it charted. When it was released as a single, the song managed to reach the top-forty in Australia and peaked at number 53 in the United States. Bieber performed the track on the [[2016 iHeartRadio Music Awards|3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards]] and [[2016 Billboard Music Awards|2016 ''Billboard'' Music Awards]], as well as on his [[Purpose World Tour]]. Two music videos were made for the song: the video which is part of the \"Purpose: The Movement\" narrative, released on November 14, 2015, and the official music video released on June 8, 2016.\n\n== Background and release ==\n[[File:Jungle City Studios.jpeg|thumb|left|This song was recorded at [[Jungle City Studios]] (pictured)]]\n\nWhile working on the album, Bieber invited his personal friend, American songwriter and producer [[Poo Bear]], to collaborate on the record \u2013 both had previously worked on Bieber's second compilation album, ''[[Journals (album)|Journals]]'', in 2013. They collaborated on the record, writing a lot of songs, until his label tried to set up writing camps for Bieber, but he declined and kept on working with Boyd. As declared by Boyd during an interview for ''[[The Fader]]'', \"We're just thinking about making sure that [the music] it's not negative, but uplifting. Even the music that talks about his relationships, it's feel-good music. It's nothing that will make you depressed. [...] We're so in tune with each other, that it's easy to know what we're both gonna love, what he would love to sing. We worked really hard on this project.

Written by Bieber, [[Poo Bear]], [[James Abrahart]], [[Andreas Schuller]], [[Thomas Troelsen]], James Wong and [[Leroy Clampitt]], the song was produced by [[Axident]], Gladius, Big Taste and co-produced by Boyd. It was released to American [[rhythmic contemporary]] and [[contemporary hit radio]] stations on March 8, 2016 as the album's fourth and final single. It is an [[electropop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, with [[bass guitar]], [[guitar]] and [[percussion]] in its instrumentation. Lyrically, \"Company\" talks about looking forward to getting to know someone attractive, but also sets some healthy boundaries for doing so.\n\nAs an album track, it reached the top-forty in the majority of the countries it charted. When it was released as a single, the song managed to reach the top-forty in Australia and peaked at number 53 in the United States. Bieber performed the track on the [[2016 iHeartRadio Music Awards|3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards]] and [[2016 Billboard Music Awards|2016 ''Billboard'' Music Awards]], as well as on his [[Purpose World Tour]]. Two music videos were made for the song: the video which is part of the \"Purpose: The Movement\" narrative, released on November 14, 2015, and the official music video released on June 8, 2016.\n\n== Background and release ==\n[[File:Jungle City Studios.jpeg|thumb|left|This song was recorded at [[Jungle City Studios]] (pictured)]]\n\nWhile working on the album, Bieber invited his personal friend, American songwriter and producer [[Poo Bear]], to collaborate on the record \u2013 both had previously worked on Bieber's second compilation album, ''[[Journals (album)|Journals]]'', in 2013. They collaborated on the record, writing a lot of songs, until his label tried to set up writing camps for Bieber, but he declined and kept on working with Boyd. As declared by Boyd during an interview for ''[[The Fader]]'', \"We're just thinking about making sure that [the music] it's not negative, but uplifting. Even the music that talks about his relationships, it's feel-good music. It's nothing that will make you depressed. [...] We're so in tune with each other, that it's easy to know what we're both gonna love, what he would love to sing. We worked really hard on this project.

It is unsure whether or not he existed, but some historians believe he was in fact [[\u0110ura\u0111 II]] Stracimirovi\u0107 Bal\u0161i\u0107 of [[Principality of Zeta|Zeta]], whose grandfather-in-law was [[Jug Bogdan]].<ref>[http://www.besplatniseminarskiradovi.com/KNJIZEVNOST/Analiza-pesme-Banovic-Strahinja.htm Analysis of the Poem 'Banovic Strahinja'] </ref>\n\nAs stated in the poem, Strahinja ruled a small territory near Kosovo (''Kraj Kosova'') prior to the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389).\nHis wife An\u0111elija, daughter of noble [[Jug Bogdan]] gets kidnapped by [[Bashi-bazouk]] [[Vlah Alija]] after Turks ravaged absent Strahinja's castle. \nStrahinja asks Jug Bogdan if he and An\u0111elija's brothers (the [[Jugovi\u0107 brothers|Jugovi\u0107i]]) could help him rescue her, but [[Jug Bogdan]] refuses, presuming that An\u0111elija had slept with the kidnapper, which is a great shame to the family. On his own, Strahinja seeks for An\u0111elija in the fictional Gole\u010d mountain, where Vlah Alija is stationed. \nStrahinja finally finds them, but An\u0111elija openly betrays him for Vlah Alija. \n\nStrahinja slices Vlah Alija's throat with his teeth, as a wolf would kill a sheep and returns to his father-in-law's estate with his wife where her brothers wait to kill her. Strahinja steps in front and tells them that he had forgiven his wife.\n\nThe greatest significance of the song is in the contrasts that arise between traditional and human: \nRepresentatives of traditional morality in the poem are members of the Jugovi\u0107 family (brothers and father of the abducted Andjelija), while Strahinja is a figure that goes beyond the limits of the laid down norms and relies only on his own humanity.\nWhether the adultery was intentionally committed or the woman was abducted and raped, the penalty for the adulteress has traditionally been death. Banovi\u0107 Strahinja condemns the inhumanity and primitiveness of such understanding, and shows a deep knowledge of the human psyche seeing that his wife has betrayed him not because of the love of the kidnapper, but out of fear for her own life, knowing the traditional punishment.\n\n1981 movie ''[[Banovi\u0107 Strahinja (film)|Banovi\u0107 Strahinja]]'' is based on the poem.\n\nOther poems of the [[Serbian_epic_poetry#The_Kosovo_cycle|Kosovo Cycle]] also mention Strahinja, such as \"Three Good Heroes\" and \"[[Lazar of Serbia|Tsar Lazar]] and [[Princess Milica of Serbia|Tsaritsa Milica]]\", the latter of which mentions that he supposedly died in the [[Battle of Kosovo]].

The album's lead single, it was released on September 10, 2010. [[Crystal Nicole|Crystal Johnson]] wrote the song in collaboration with producers [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]] and [[Sandy Vee]]. Rihanna contacted Stargate before ''Loud''<nowiki/>'s production and asked them to create lively, uptempo music. \"Only Girl (In the World)\" was the first song composed for the album, and the singer decided to include it on the track list before she recorded her vocals. Backed by strong [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[synthesizer]], it is a [[Eurodance]] and [[Rave music|rave]] [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song that has an electronic composition. In its lyrics, Rihanna demands physical attention from her lover.\n\nCritical response to \"Only Girl (In the World)\" was positive; a number of critics praised its composition and Rihanna's decision to move away from the dark themes of her previous album, ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' (2009). The song reached number one on the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart two weeks after ''Loud''<nowiki/>'s second single, \"[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]\", peaked at number one. It was the first time in the chart's history that an album's lead single reached number one after its second single. In the United Kingdom the song spent two weeks at number one and is the 19th-bestselling single of all time by a female artist, with over a million copies sold. The song peaked at number one in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland, and reached the top five in France, Germany and Switzerland.\n\nRihanna performed \"Only Girl (In the World)\" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the United States, ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in the United Kingdom and a shortened version at the [[2011 Brit Awards|31st Brit Awards]]. [[Anthony Mandler]] directed the song's music video, in which Rihanna is alone in an open natural landscape. The video suggests that she is the only female in the world, echoing the song's title and lyrics, and critics praised its bright, colorful theme. \"Only Girl (In the World)\" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording]] at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2011.\n\n==Concept and development==\n[[File:Sandy Vee RETOUCHED IMG 9213 FINAL.jpg|thumb|upright=0.99|right|Sandy Vee ''(pictured)'' co-wrote and produced \"Only Girl (In the World)\".|alt=A man in a grey T-shirt, looking to his right]]\n\"Only Girl (In the World)\" was written by [[Crystal Nicole|Crystal Johnson]] with the song's producers, [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]] and [[Sandy Vee]].<ref name=\"LoudNotes\">{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]|date=2010-11-12|others=[[Rihanna]]|type=Inlay cover|work=[[Def Jam Recordings]], SRP Records}}</ref> Rihanna had previously worked with Stargate on the singles \"[[Hate That I Love You]]\", \"[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]\" and \"[[Rude Boy (Rihanna song)|Rude Boy]]\".<ref name=\"Seacrest Premiere\">{{cite web|last=Dinh|first=James|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1647138/rihanna-set-premiere-only-girl-world.jhtml|title=Rihanna Set To Premiere 'Only Girl (In The World)'|work=[[MTV News]]|date=September 3, 2010|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> In February 2011, Stargate said that Rihanna approached the Norwegian production duo before she began recording the then-untitled project, saying that she wanted to have fun and produce happy, uptempo songs.<ref name=\"Vibe StarGate\">{{cite web|last=Fresh|first=Mikey|url=http://www.vibe.com/posts/grammy-recap-stargate-talks-rihannas-only-girl-world-winning-best-dance-recording|title=Grammy Recap: Stargate Talks Rihanna's 'Only Girl (In The World)' Winning 'Best Dance Recording'|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> According to Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate, \"Only Girl (In the World)\" was the first song created for ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' and Rihanna decided to include it on the album before recording her vocals.<ref name=\"Vibe StarGate\"/> In a webchat with fans, Rihanna said that she wanted to take the next step as an artist:<ref name=\"Rihanna Daily Webchat\">{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-09-07/entertainment/27074755_1_new-man-domestic-abuse-months-of-community-labor|title=Rihanna's 'Only Girl (In the World),' first single off new album, 'Loud,' asks new man to love her|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=September 7, 2010|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> \"I didn\u2019t want to go backward and remake ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]''.

The album's lead single, it was released on September 10, 2010. [[Crystal Nicole|Crystal Johnson]] wrote the song in collaboration with producers [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]] and [[Sandy Vee]]. Rihanna contacted Stargate before ''Loud''<nowiki/>'s production and asked them to create lively, uptempo music. \"Only Girl (In the World)\" was the first song composed for the album, and the singer decided to include it on the track list before she recorded her vocals. Backed by strong [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[synthesizer]], it is a [[Eurodance]] and [[Rave music|rave]] [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song that has an electronic composition. In its lyrics, Rihanna demands physical attention from her lover.\n\nCritical response to \"Only Girl (In the World)\" was positive; a number of critics praised its composition and Rihanna's decision to move away from the dark themes of her previous album, ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' (2009). The song reached number one on the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart two weeks after ''Loud''<nowiki/>'s second single, \"[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]\", peaked at number one. It was the first time in the chart's history that an album's lead single reached number one after its second single. In the United Kingdom the song spent two weeks at number one and is the 19th-bestselling single of all time by a female artist, with over a million copies sold. The song peaked at number one in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland, and reached the top five in France, Germany and Switzerland.\n\nRihanna performed \"Only Girl (In the World)\" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the United States, ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in the United Kingdom and a shortened version at the [[2011 Brit Awards|31st Brit Awards]]. [[Anthony Mandler]] directed the song's music video, in which Rihanna is alone in an open natural landscape. The video suggests that she is the only female in the world, echoing the song's title and lyrics, and critics praised its bright, colorful theme. \"Only Girl (In the World)\" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording]] at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2011.\n\n==Concept and development==\n[[File:Sandy Vee RETOUCHED IMG 9213 FINAL.jpg|thumb|upright=0.99|right|Sandy Vee ''(pictured)'' co-wrote and produced \"Only Girl (In the World)\".|alt=A man in a grey T-shirt, looking to his right]]\n\"Only Girl (In the World)\" was written by [[Crystal Nicole|Crystal Johnson]] with the song's producers, [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]] and [[Sandy Vee]].<ref name=\"LoudNotes\">{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]|date=2010-11-12|others=[[Rihanna]]|type=Inlay cover|work=[[Def Jam Recordings]], SRP Records}}</ref> Rihanna had previously worked with Stargate on the singles \"[[Hate That I Love You]]\", \"[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]\" and \"[[Rude Boy (Rihanna song)|Rude Boy]]\".<ref name=\"Seacrest Premiere\">{{cite web|last=Dinh|first=James|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1647138/rihanna-set-premiere-only-girl-world.jhtml|title=Rihanna Set To Premiere 'Only Girl (In The World)'|work=[[MTV News]]|date=September 3, 2010|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> In February 2011, Stargate said that Rihanna approached the Norwegian production duo before she began recording the then-untitled project, saying that she wanted to have fun and produce happy, uptempo songs.<ref name=\"Vibe StarGate\">{{cite web|last=Fresh|first=Mikey|url=http://www.vibe.com/posts/grammy-recap-stargate-talks-rihannas-only-girl-world-winning-best-dance-recording|title=Grammy Recap: Stargate Talks Rihanna's 'Only Girl (In The World)' Winning 'Best Dance Recording'|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> According to Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate, \"Only Girl (In the World)\" was the first song created for ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' and Rihanna decided to include it on the album before recording her vocals.<ref name=\"Vibe StarGate\"/> In a webchat with fans, Rihanna said that she wanted to take the next step as an artist:<ref name=\"Rihanna Daily Webchat\">{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-09-07/entertainment/27074755_1_new-man-domestic-abuse-months-of-community-labor|title=Rihanna's 'Only Girl (In the World),' first single off new album, 'Loud,' asks new man to love her|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=September 7, 2010|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> \"I didn\u2019t want to go backward and remake ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]''.

In 1998, select members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/fleetwood-mac?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhojzBRC3ARIsAGtNtHVsP3PFYQKLI_o9-KGlmSZ56Nw6foYOMt3C1_tqXAAmi9gc-teMyIYaAkuUEALw_wcB|title=Fleetwood Mac Hall of Fame|work=rockhall.com}}</ref> and received the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1998|title=History|website=BRIT Awards|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nFleetwood Mac was founded by guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]] and guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]]. Bassist [[John McVie]] completed the lineup for their [[Fleetwood Mac (1968 album)|self-titled debut album]]. [[Danny Kirwan]] joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist [[Christine McVie|Christine Perfect]], who contributed as a session musician from the second album, married McVie and joined in 1970. At this time it was primarily a [[British blues]] band, scoring a UK number one with \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Fleetwood Mac Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/fleetwood-mac/biography|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> and also had other hits such as the singles \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\" and \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\". All three guitarists left in succession during the early 1970s, to be replaced by guitarists [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] and [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]] and vocalist [[Dave Walker]]. By 1974, all three had either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist.\n\nIn late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he was introduced to folk-rock duo [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]]. Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the band. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more [[pop rock]] sound, and their 1975 self-titled album, ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'', reached No. 1 in the United States. ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in various countries around the world and won a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1978. ''Rumours'' has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the [[list of best-selling albums|eighth-highest-selling album in history]]. The band went through personal turmoil while recording the album, as both the romantic partnerships in the band (one being John and Christine McVie, and the other being Buckingham and Nicks) separated while continuing to make music together.\n\nThe band's personnel remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks each left the band, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists and vocalists.  A 1993 one-off performance for the [[first inauguration of Bill Clinton]] featured the lineup of Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham back together for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and the group released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' (1997), a live compilation of their work. Christine McVie left the band in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. Meanwhile, the group remained together as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'', in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined the band full-time in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-fires-lindsey-buckingham-w518925|title=Fleetwood Mac Fires Lindsey Buckingham|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], formerly of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and [[Neil Finn]] of [[Split Enz]] and [[Crowded House]].\n\n==History==\n===1967\u20131970: Formation and early years===\n[[File:Fleetwood mac peter green 2.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Green, 18 March 1970]]\nFleetwood Mac were formed in July 1967 in London, England, when Peter Green left the [[British blues]] band [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]].

Mayall gave Green free recording time as a gift, in which Fleetwood, McVie and Green recorded five songs. The fifth song was an instrumental that Green named after the rhythm section, \"Fleetwood Mac\" (\"Mac\" being short for McVie).\n\nSoon after this, Green suggested to Fleetwood that they form a new band. The pair wanted McVie on bass guitar and named the band 'Fleetwood Mac' to entice him, but McVie opted to keep his steady income with Mayall rather than take a risk with a new band. In the meantime Peter Green and Mick Fleetwood had teamed up with slide guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]] and bassist [[Bob Brunning]]. Brunning was in the band on the understanding that he would leave if McVie agreed to join. The Green, Fleetwood, Spencer, Brunning version of the band made its debut on 13 August 1967 at the Windsor Jazz and Blues Festival as 'Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, also featuring Jeremy Spencer'.

He was recruited from the South London blues trio Boilerhouse, which consisted of Kirwan on guitar, Trevor Stevens on bass and Dave Terrey on drums.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rawlings|first=Terry|title=Then, now and rare British Beat 1960\u20131969|year=2002|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-9094-8|page=77}}</ref> Green and Fleetwood had watched Boilerhouse rehearse in a basement boiler-room, and Green had been so impressed that he invited the band to play support slots for Fleetwood Mac. Green wanted Boilerhouse to become a professional band but Stevens and Terrey were not prepared to turn professional, so Green tried to find another rhythm section for Kirwan by placing an ad in [[Melody Maker]]. There were over 300 applicants, but when Green and Fleetwood ran auditions at the Nag's Head in Battersea (home of the [[Mike Vernon (producer)|Mike Vernon]] [[Blue Horizon]] Club) the hard-to-please Green could not find anyone good enough. Fleetwood invited Kirwan to join Fleetwood Mac as a third guitarist.<ref name=\"Brunning p18\" />\n\nGreen had been frustrated that Jeremy Spencer did not contribute to his songs. Kirwan, a talented self-taught guitarist, had a signature vibrato and a unique style that added a new dimension to the band's sound. In November 1968, with Kirwan in the band, they released their first number one single in Europe, \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\", on which Kirwan duetted with Green. Green said later that the success of 'Albatross' was thanks to Kirwan. \"If it wasn't for Danny, I would never had had a number one hit record.\" <ref name=\"vaudeville\">{{cite AV media notes|author= Fleetwood Mac |title= The Vaudeville Years |titlelink= The Vaudeville Years |type= CD booklet notes |year= 1998 |publisher= Receiver Records }}</ref> Around this time they released the compilation album ''[[English Rose (album)|English Rose]]'', which contained half of ''Mr Wonderful'' plus new songs from Kirwan. Their second compilation album,''[[The Pious Bird of Good Omen]]'', contained a collection of singles, B-sides and a selection of work the band had done with [[Eddie Boyd]].\n\nOn tour in the US in January 1969, the band recorded an album at the soon-to-close [[Chess Records]] Studio with some of the blues legends of Chicago, including [[Willie Dixon]], [[Buddy Guy]] and [[Otis Spann]]. These were Fleetwood Mac's last all-blues recordings. Along with the change of style the band was also going through label changes. Up until that point they had been on the Blue Horizon label, but with Kirwan in the band the musical possibilities had become too diverse for a blues-only label. The band signed with [[Immediate Records]] and released the single \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\", which became another British and European hit. For the B-side Spencer fronted Fleetwood Mac as \"Earl Vince and the Valiants\" and recorded \"[[Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonite]]\", typifying the more raucous rock 'n' roll side of the band. Immediate Records was in bad shape, however, and the band shopped around for a new deal. [[The Beatles]] wanted the band on [[Apple Records]] (Mick Fleetwood and [[George Harrison]] were brothers-in-law), but the band's manager [[Clifford Davis (musician)|Clifford Davis]] decided to go with [[Warner Bros. Records]] (through [[Reprise Records]], a [[Frank Sinatra]]-founded label), the label they have stayed with ever since.\n\nUnder the wing of Reprise, Fleetwood Mac released their third studio album, ''[[Then Play On]]'', in September 1969. Although the initial pressing of the American release of this album was the same as the British version, it was altered to contain the song \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\", which featured consistently in live performances from the time of its release through 1997 and again starting in 2009. ''Then Play On'', the band's first rock album, featured only the songs of Kirwan and Green. Jeremy Spencer, meanwhile, had recorded a [[Jeremy Spencer (album)|solo album]] of 1950s-style rock and roll songs, backed by the rest of the band except Green.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/jeremy-spencer-mw0000849643|title=Jeremy Spencer \u2013  Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nBy 1970 Peter Green, the frontman of the band, had developed a dependency on [[LSD]]. During the band's European tour, Green experienced a bad acid trip at a hippie commune in Munich. Clifford Davis, the band's manager, singled out this incident as the crucial point in Green's mental decline.<ref>{{cite book| last = Celmins| first = Martin| title = Peter Green: Founder of Fleetwood Mac| publisher = Castle| isbn = 1-898141-13-4}}</ref> He said: \"The truth about Peter Green and how he ended up how he did is very simple. We were touring Europe in late 1969. When we were in Germany, Peter told me he had been invited to a party. I knew there were going to be a lot of drugs around and I suggested that he didn't go. But he went anyway and I understand from him that he took what turned out to be very bad, impure LSD.

The band held a few meetings with Welch and decided to hire him, without actually playing with him, after they heard a tape of his songs.<ref name=\"Brunning, B 1998 p37\">Brunning, B (1998): Fleetwood Mac \u2013 The First 30 Years. London: Omnibus Press p37</ref>\n\nIn September 1971 the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Future Games]]''. As a result of Welch's arrival and Spencer's departure, the album was different from anything they had done previously. While it became the band's first studio album to miss the charts in the UK, it helped to expand the band's appeal in the United States. In Europe CBS released Fleetwood Mac's first [[Greatest Hits (1971 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]] album, which mostly consisted of songs by Peter Green, with one song by Spencer and one by Kirwan.\n\nIn 1972, six months after the release of ''Future Games'', the band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Bare Trees]]''. Mostly composed by Kirwan, ''Bare Trees'' featured the Welch-penned single \"[[Sentimental Lady]]\", which would be a much bigger hit for Welch five years later when he re-recorded it for his solo album ''[[French Kiss (Bob Welch album)|French Kiss]]'', backed by Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie. ''Bare Trees'' also featured \"Spare Me a Little of Your Love\", a bright Christine McVie song that became a staple of the band's live act throughout the early to mid-1970s.\n\nWhile the band was doing well in the studio, their tours started to be problematic. By 1972 Danny Kirwan had developed an alcohol dependency and was becoming alienated from Welch and the McVies. When Kirwan smashed his Gibson [[Les Paul Custom]] guitar before a concert on a US tour in August 1972, refused to go on stage and criticised the band afterwards, Fleetwood fired him.<ref name=\"brunning\">{{cite book | authorlink=Bob Brunning | first=Bob | last=Brunning | title=Fleetwood Mac: Behind the Masks | publisher=New English Library | year=1990 | location=London | isbn=0-450-53116-3 | oclc=22242160}}</ref> Fleetwood said later that the pressure had become too much for Kirwan, and he had suffered a breakdown.<ref name=\"Farber\">{{cite web |last1=Farber |first1=Jim |title=Fleetwood Mac's Forgotten Hero |url= https://web.musicaficionado.com/main.html#!/article/fleetwood_macs_forgotten_hero_by_jimfarber |website=Music Aficionado |accessdate= 5 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the three albums they released in this period they constantly changed line-ups. In September 1972 the band added guitarist [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]] and vocalist [[Dave Walker]], formerly of [[Savoy Brown]] and [[The Idle Race|Idle Race]].<ref name=\"Music Legends\">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-walker-interview-black-sabbath/|title=Dave Walker Interview| accessdate=6 May 2013|date=30 December 2011|last=Saulnier|first=Jason}}</ref> Bob Weston was well known as a slide guitarist and had known the band from his touring period with [[Long John Baldry]]. Fleetwood Mac also hired Savoy Brown's road manager, John Courage. Fleetwood, The McVies, Welch, Weston and Walker recorded the band's seventh studio album, ''[[Penguin (album)|Penguin]]'', which was released in January 1973. After the tour the band fired Walker because they felt his vocal style and attitude did not fit well with the rest of the band.<ref>{{cite web |title=Happy 45th: Fleetwood Mac, Penguin|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/happy-45th-fleetwood-mac-penguin |website=Rhino |accessdate=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining five members carried on and recorded the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Mystery to Me]]'', six months later. This album contained Welch's song \"[[Hypnotized (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hypnotized]]\", which received a great amount of airplay on the radio and became one of the band's most successful songs to date in the US. The band was proud of the new album and anticipated that it would be a smash hit. While it did eventually go Gold, personal problems within the band emerged. The McVies' marriage was under a lot of stress, which was aggravated by their constant working with each other and by John McVie's considerable [[alcohol abuse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\"McVie, John.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed.|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/epm/18632|website=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> Subsequent lack of touring meant that the album was unable to chart as high as the previous one.\n\nDuring the 1973 US tour to promote ''Mystery to Me'', Weston had an affair with Fleetwood's wife [[Jenny Boyd|Jenny Boyd Fleetwood]], sister of [[Pattie Boyd|Pattie Boyd Harrison]].

He realised that the original Fleetwood Mac was being neglected by Warner Bros and that they would need to change their base of operation from England to America, to which the rest of the band agreed. Rock promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] wrote a letter to Warner Bros to convince them that the real Fleetwood Mac was, in fact, Fleetwood, Welch, and the McVies. This did not end the legal battle but the band was able to record as Fleetwood Mac again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/12/listen-to-fleetwood-mac-play-black-magic-woman-in.html|title=Here's the \"Real\" Fleetwood Mac Playing \"Black Magic Woman\" in 1974|website=pastemagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref> Instead of hiring another manager, Fleetwood Mac, having re-formed, decided to manage themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn September 1974, Fleetwood Mac signed a new recording contract with Warner Bros, but remained on the Reprise label. The band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Heroes Are Hard to Find]],'' in September 1974 and, for the first time in its history, the band had only one guitarist. While on tour they added a second keyboardist, Doug Graves, who had been an engineer on ''Heroes Are Hard to Find''. In late 1974 Graves was preparing to become a permanent member of the band by the end of their US tour. He said:\n\n{{quote|\"I'm looking forward to adding something to this already great band. I helped engineer their album 'Heroes Are Hard to Find' and got to know each member well. It came to me as a shock when Mick asked me to join but I am enjoying playing live with the band, and hopefully will start a new studio album with the band soon.\"}}\n\nHowever, Graves did not ultimately join full-time. In 1980, Christine McVie explained the decision:\n\n{{quote| \"He (Doug Graves) was there to back me up, but I think it was decided after the first two or three concerts that I was better off without him.

Neither musician proved to be a long-term addition to the line-up. Welch left soon after the tour ended (on 5 December 1974 at Cal State University), having grown tired of touring and legal struggles. Nevertheless, the tour had enabled the ''Heroes'' album to reach a higher position on the American charts than any of the band's previous records.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/discog.php?pid=80|title=Heroes Are Hard To Find \u2013  Fleetwood Mac|last=Adelson|first=Martin E.|website=discog.fleetwoodmac.net|access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===1975\u20131987: Addition of Buckingham and Nicks, and mainstream success===\nAfter Welch announced that he was leaving the band, Fleetwood began searching for a replacement. While Fleetwood was checking out [[Sound City Studios]] in Los Angeles, the house engineer, [[Keith Olsen]], played him a track he had recorded in the studio, \"Frozen Love\", from the album ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]'' (1973). Fleetwood liked it and was introduced to the guitarist from the band, [[Lindsey Buckingham]], who was at Sound City that day recording demos. Fleetwood asked him to join Fleetwood Mac and Buckingham agreed, on the condition that his music partner and girlfriend, [[Stevie Nicks]], be included. Buckingham and Nicks joined the band on New Year's Eve 1974, within four weeks of the previous incarnation splitting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lindsey Buckingham|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/lindsey.htm|publisher=Fleetwoodmac.net|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Music Remastered: Fleetwood Mac|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/behind-the-music-remastered/full-episodes/behind-the-music-remastered-fleetwood-mac/1654105/playlist.jhtml|publisher=VH1|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the new line-up released [[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|another self-titled album]], their tenth studio album. The album was a breakthrough for the band and became a huge hit, reaching No.1 in the US and selling over 7 million copies. Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie's \"[[Over My Head (Fleetwood Mac song)|Over My Head]]\" and \"[[Say You Love Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Say You Love Me]]\" and Stevie Nicks's \"[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]\", as well as the much-played album track \"[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]\", a live rendition of which became a hit twenty years later on ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' album.\n{{Listen|filename=Landslide by Fleetwood Mac.ogg|title=\"Landslide\" (Fleetwood Mac)|description=17 second sample from Fleetwood Mac's song \"Landslide\".| format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nIn 1976, the band was suffering from severe stress. With success came the end of John and Christine McVie's marriage, as well as Buckingham and Nicks's long-term romantic relationship. Fleetwood, meanwhile, was in the midst of divorce proceedings from his wife, Jenny. The pressure on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-up album, combined with their new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions which were allegedly fuelled by high consumption of drugs and alcohol.<ref name=\"Rock Nuns\">{{cite web |last1=Jonze |first1=Tim |title=Fleetwood Mac's Stevie and Christine: 'We were like rock'n'roll nuns' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/12/fleetwood-mac-stevie-nicks-christine-mcvie-nuns |website=The Guardian |accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe band's eleventh studio album, ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (the band's first release on the main Warner label after Reprise was retired and all of its acts were reassigned to the parent label), was released in the spring of 1977. In this album, the band members laid bare the emotional turmoil they were experiencing at the time. ''Rumours'' was critically acclaimed and won the [[Grammy]] Award for Album of the Year in 1977. The album generated multiple Top Ten singles, including Buckingham's \"[[Go Your Own Way]]\", Nicks's US No. 1 \"[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]\" and Christine McVie's \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\" and \"[[You Make Loving Fun]]\". Buckingham's \"[[Second Hand News]]\", Nicks's \"[[Gold Dust Woman]]\" and \"[[The Chain]]\" (the only song written by all five band members) also received significant radio airplay. By 2003 ''Rumours'' had sold over 19 million copies in the US alone (certified as a [[diamond album]] by the [[RIAA]]) and a total of 40 million copies worldwide, bringing it to eighth on the [[list of best-selling albums]]. Fleetwood Mac supported the album with a lucrative tour.\n\nOn 10 October 1979, Fleetwood Mac were honoured with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their contributions to the music industry at 6608 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/fleetwood-mac|title=Fleetwood Mac {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/fleetwood-mac/|title=Fleetwood Mac|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nBuckingham convinced Fleetwood to let his work on their next album be more experimental, and to be allowed to work on tracks at home before bringing them to the rest of the band in the studio. The result of this, the band's twelfth studio album ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', was a 20-track double album released in 1979. It produced three hit singles: Lindsey Buckingham's \"[[Tusk (song)|Tusk]]\" (US No. 8), which featured the [[Spirit of Troy|USC Trojan Marching Band]], Christine McVie's \"[[Think About Me]]\" (US No. 20), and Stevie Nicks's six-and-a-half minute opus \"[[Sara (Fleetwood Mac song)|Sara]]\" (US No. 7). \"Sara\" was cut to four-and-a-half minutes for both the hit single and the first CD-release of the album, but the unedited version has since been restored on the [[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|1988 greatest hits compilation]], the 2004 reissue of ''Tusk''  and Fleetwood Mac's 2002 release of ''[[The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac]]''. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions of ''Tusk'' although his playing, on the Christine McVie track \"Brown Eyes\", is not credited on the album.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac| url=https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet| url-access=registration|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet/page/214 214]}}</ref> In an interview in 2019 Fleetwood described ''Tusk'' as his \"personal favourite\" and said, \u201cKudos to Lindsey ... for us not doing a replica of ''Rumours''.\"<ref>{{cite news|work= Independent |url=  https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/fleetwood-mac-interview-tour-uk-wembley |title= Fleetwood Mac: We\u2019ll Burn in Hell if We Don\u2019t Play Glastonbury One Day: Chris Harvey |date= 27 April 2019  |accessdate= 30 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n''Tusk'' sold four million copies worldwide. Fleetwood blamed the album's relative lack of commercial success on the [[RKO General|RKO]] radio chain having played the album in its entirety prior to release, thereby allowing mass home taping.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac| url=https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet| url-access=registration|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet/page/219 219]}}</ref>\n\nThe band embarked on an 11-month tour to support and promote ''Tusk''. They travelled across the world, including the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, they shared the bill with reggae superstar [[Bob Marley]]. On this world tour, the band recorded music for their first [[Live (Fleetwood Mac album)|live album]], which was released at the end of 1980.\n\nThe band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'', was released in 1982. Following 1981 solo albums by Nicks (''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]''), Fleetwood (''[[The Visitor (Mick Fleetwood album)|The Visitor]]''), and Buckingham (''[[Law and Order (album)|Law and Order]]''), there was a return to a more conventional approach. Buckingham had been chided by critics, fellow band members and music business managers for the lesser commercial success of ''Tusk''. Recorded at [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] in France and produced by [[Richard Dashut]], ''Mirage'' was an attempt to recapture the huge success of ''Rumours''. Its hits included Christine McVie's \"[[Hold Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hold Me]]\" and \"[[Love in Store]]\" (co-written by [[Robbie Patton]] and Jim Recor, respectively), Stevie Nicks's \"[[Gypsy (Fleetwood Mac song)|Gypsy]]\", and Lindsey Buckingham's \"[[Oh Diane]]\", which made the Top 10 in the UK. A minor hit was also scored by Buckingham's \"Eyes Of The World\" and \"[[Can't Go Back (Fleetwood Mac song)|Can't Go Back]]\".\n\nIn contrast to the [[Tusk Tour]] the band embarked on only a short tour of 18 American cities, the [[Los Angeles]] show being recorded and released on video. They also headlined the first [[US Festival]], on 5 September 1982, for which the band was paid $500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1982|r=0}}}} today). ''Mirage'' was certified double platinum in the US.\n\nFollowing ''Mirage'' the band went on hiatus, which allowed members to pursue solo careers. Stevie Nicks released two more solo albums (1983's ''[[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]]'' and 1985's ''[[Rock a Little]]''). Lindsey Buckingham issued ''[[Go Insane (album)|Go Insane]]'' in 1984, the same year that Christine McVie made an [[Christine McVie (album)|eponymous album]] (yielding the Top 10 hit \"[[Got a Hold on Me]]\" and the Top 40 hit \"[[Love Will Show Us How]]\"). All three met with success, Nicks being the most popular. During this period Mick Fleetwood had filed for bankruptcy, Nicks was admitted to the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] for addiction problems and John McVie had suffered an addiction-related seizure, all of which were attributed to the lifestyle of excess afforded to them by their worldwide success. It was rumoured that Fleetwood Mac had disbanded, but Buckingham commented that he was unhappy to allow ''Mirage'' to remain as the band's last effort.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=785&c=18 |title=Fleetwood Mac: Return Without Leaving |work=[[Creem]] |last=Kordosh |first=J. |date=September 1987}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Rumours'' line-up of Fleetwood Mac recorded one more album, their fourteenth studio album, ''[[Tango in the Night]]'', in 1987. As with various other Fleetwood Mac albums, the material started off as a Buckingham solo album before becoming a group project. The album went on to become their best-selling release since ''Rumours'', especially in the UK where it hit No. 1 three times in the following year. The album sold three million copies in the US and contained four hits: Christine McVie's \"[[Little Lies]]\" and \"[[Everywhere (Fleetwood Mac song)|Everywhere]]\" ('Little Lies' being co-written with McVie's new husband Eddy Quintela), [[Sandy Stewart (musician)|Sandy Stewart]] and Stevie Nicks's \"[[Seven Wonders (song)|Seven Wonders]]\", and Lindsey Buckingham's \"[[Big Love (Fleetwood Mac song)|Big Love]]\". \"[[Family Man (Fleetwood Mac song)|Family Man]]\" (Buckingham and [[Richard Dashut]]), and \"[[Isn't It Midnight]]\" (Christine McVie), were also released as singles, with less success.\n\n===1987\u20131995: Departure of Buckingham and Nicks===\nWith a ten-week tour scheduled, Buckingham held back at the last minute, saying he felt his creativity was being stifled. A group meeting at Christine McVie's house on 7 August 1987 resulted in turmoil. Tensions were coming to a head. Mick Fleetwood said in his autobiography that there was a physical altercation between Buckingham and Nicks. Buckingham left the band the following day.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} After Buckingham's departure Fleetwood Mac added two new guitarists to the band, [[Billy Burnette]] and [[Rick Vito]], again without auditions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ressner|first1=Jeffrey|title=Lindsey Buckingham Leaves Fleetwood Mac|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lindsey-buckingham-leaves-fleetwood-mac-19870924|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nBurnette was the son of [[Dorsey Burnette]] and nephew of [[Johnny Burnette]], both of [[The Rock and Roll Trio]]. He had already worked with Mick Fleetwood in Zoo, with Christine McVie as part of her solo band, had done some session work with Stevie Nicks, and backed Lindsey Buckingham on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Fleetwood and Christine McVie had played on his ''Try Me'' album in 1985. Vito, a Peter Green admirer, had played with many artists from [[Bonnie Raitt]] to John Mayall, and worked with John McVie on two Mayall albums.\n\nThe 1987\u201388 \"Shake the Cage\" tour was the first outing for this line-up. It was successful enough to warrant the release of a concert video, entitled \"Tango in the Night\", which was filmed at San Francisco's [[Cow Palace]] arena in December 1987.\n\nCapitalising on the success of ''Tango in the Night'', the band released a ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in 1988. It featured singles from the 1975\u20131988 era and included two new compositions, \"[[No Questions Asked (Fleetwood Mac song)|No Questions Asked]]\" written by Nicks and \"[[As Long as You Follow]]\", written by McVie and Quintela. 'As Long as You Follow' was released as a single in 1988 but only made No. 43 in the US and No.66 in the UK, although it reached No.1 on the US Adult Contemporary charts. The ''Greatest Hits'' album, which peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US (though it has since sold over 8 million copies there) was dedicated by the band to Buckingham, with whom they were now reconciled.\n\nIn 1990, Fleetwood Mac released their fifteenth studio album, ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]''. With this album the band veered away from the stylised sound that Buckingham had evolved during his tenure in the band (which was also evident in his solo work) and developed a more [[adult contemporary]] style with producer [[Greg Ladanyi]]. The album yielded only one Top 40 hit, McVie's \"[[Save Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Save Me]]\". ''Behind the Mask'' only achieved [[RIAA certification|Gold]] album status in the US, peaking at No. 18 on the ''Billboard'' album chart, though it entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1. It received mixed reviews and was seen by some music critics as a low point for the band in the absence of Lindsey Buckingham (who had actually made a guest appearance playing on the title track). But ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine said that Vito and Burnette were \"the best thing to ever happen to Fleetwood Mac\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/behind-the-mask-19900531|title=''Behind the Mask'' review|last=Berger|first=Arion|date=31 May 1990|magazine=Rolling Stone|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref> The subsequent \"Behind the Mask\" tour saw the band play sold-out shows at London's Wembley Stadium. In the final show in Los Angeles, Buckingham joined the band on stage. The two women of the band, McVie and Nicks, had decided that the tour would be their last (McVie's father had died during the tour), although both stated that they would still record with the band. In 1991, however, Nicks and Rick Vito announced they were leaving Fleetwood Mac altogether.\n\nIn 1992, Mick Fleetwood arranged a 4-disc box set, spanning highlights from the band's 25-year history, entitled ''[[25 Years \u2013 The Chain]]'' (an edited 2-disc set was also available). A notable inclusion in the box set was \"[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]\", a Stevie Nicks composition that was recorded during the ''Rumours'' sessions but was omitted from the album and used as the B-side of \"Go Your Own Way\". Nicks had requested use of this track for her 1991 best-of compilation ''TimeSpace'', but Fleetwood had refused as he had planned to include it in this collection as a rarity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The disagreement between Nicks and Fleetwood garnered press coverage and was believed to have been the main reason for Nicks leaving the band in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spanos |first1=Brittany |title=\u2018Silver Springs\u2019: Inside Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Great Lost Breakup Anthem |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref> The box set also included a new Stevie Nicks/Rick Vito composition, \"[[Paper Doll (Fleetwood Mac song)|Paper Doll]]\", which was released in the US as a single and produced by Lindsey Buckingham and Richard Dashut.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boehm|first1=Mike|title=Life After Mac|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-10/news/ol-2617_1_fleetwood-mac/3|website=Los Angelis Times|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}</ref> There were also two new Christine McVie compositions, \"Heart of Stone\" and [[Love Shines (song)|\"Love Shines]]\". \"Love Shines\" was released as a single in the UK and elsewhere. Lindsey Buckingham also contributed a new song, \"Make Me a Mask\". Mick Fleetwood also released a deluxe hardcover companion book to coincide with the release of the box set, titled ''My 25 Years in Fleetwood Mac''. The volume featured notes written by Fleetwood detailing the band's 25-year history and many rare photographs.\n\nThe Buckingham/Nicks/McVie/McVie/Fleetwood line-up reunited in 1993 at the request of US President [[Bill Clinton]] for his first [[United States presidential inaugural balls|Inaugural Ball]]. Clinton had made Fleetwood Mac's \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\" his campaign theme song. His request for it to be performed at the Inauguration Ball was met with enthusiasm by the band, although this line-up had no intention of reuniting again.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Andy|title=Flashback: Fleetwood Mac Reunite for Bill Clinton's Inauguration|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-fleetwood-mac-reunite-for-bill-clintons-inauguration-20130122|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nInspired by the new interest in the band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Christine McVie recorded another album as Fleetwood Mac, with Billy Burnette taking lead guitar duties. Burnette left in March 1993 to record a country album and pursue an acting career and [[Bekka Bramlett]], who had worked a year earlier with Mick Fleetwood's Zoo, was recruited to take his place. Solo singer-songwriter/guitarist and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] member [[Dave Mason]], who had worked with Bekka's parents [[Delaney & Bonnie]] twenty-five years earlier, was subsequently added. In March 1994 Billy Burnette, a good friend and co-songwriter with [[Delaney Bramlett]], returned to the band with Fleetwood's blessing.\n\nThe band, minus Christine McVie, toured in 1994, opening for [[Crosby, Stills, & Nash]] and in 1995 as part of a package with [[REO Speedwagon]] and [[Pat Benatar]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeRiso |first1=Nick |title=Dave Mason on Traffic, Fleetwood Mac and going his own way |url=http://somethingelsereviews.com/2014/02/12/something-else-interview-dave-mason-on-traffic-fleetwood-mac-going-his-own-way/ |website=Something Else! |accessdate=September 22, 2018}}</ref> This tour saw the band perform classic Fleetwood Mac songs from their 1967\u20131974 era. In 1995, at a concert in Tokyo, the band was greeted by former member Jeremy Spencer, who performed a few songs with them.\n\nOn 10 October 1995, Fleetwood Mac released their sixteenth studio album, ''[[Time (Fleetwood Mac album)|Time]]'', which was not a success. Although it hit the UK Top 60 for one week, the album had zero impact in the US. It failed to graze the ''Billboard'' Top 200 albums chart, a reversal for a band that had been a mainstay on that chart for most of the previous two decades. Shortly after the album's release, Christine McVie informed the band that the album would be her last. Bramlett and Burnette subsequently formed a [[country music]] duo, [[Bekka & Billy]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fleetwood Mac: The Definitive History|last=Evans|first=Mike|publisher=Sterling|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4027-8630-3|location=New York|pages=267}}</ref>\n\n===1995\u20131997: Re-formation===\nJust weeks after disbanding Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood announced that he was working with Lindsey Buckingham again. John McVie was added to the sessions, and later Christine McVie. Stevie Nicks also enlisted Lindsey Buckingham to produce a song for a soundtrack.\n\nIn May 1996 Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Stevie Nicks performed together at a private party in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], prior to the [[Kentucky Derby]], with [[Steve Winwood]] filling in for Lindsey Buckingham. A week later the ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' film soundtrack was released, which featured the Stevie Nicks-Lindsey Buckingham duet \"[[Twisted (Stevie Nicks song)|Twisted]]\", with Mick Fleetwood on drums. This eventually led to a full reunion of the ''Rumours'' line-up, which officially reformed in March 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/mick-fleetwood-fleetwood-mac-is-the-most-abused-franchise-in-the-business|title=Mick Fleetwood: \"Fleetwood Mac is the most abused franchise in the business\"|last=October 2017|first=Dave Everley02|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132007: Reunion and Christine McVie's departure===\nThe regrouped Fleetwood Mac performed a live concert on a soundstage at [[Warner Bros.]] [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California, on 22 May 1997. The concert was recorded, and from this performance came the 1997 live album ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'', which brought Fleetwood Mac back to the top of the US album charts for the first time in 10 years. ''The Dance'' returned Fleetwood Mac to a superstar status they had not enjoyed since ''Tango in the Night''. The album was certified 5 million units by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Fleetwood+Mac%22|title=RIAA - Gold and Platinum Searchable Database|publisher=riaa.com|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref> An arena tour followed the [[MTV]] premiere of ''The Dance'' and kept the reunited Fleetwood Mac on the road throughout much of 1997, the 20th anniversary of ''Rumours''. With additional musicians Neale Heywood on guitar, Brett Tuggle on keyboards, Lenny Castro on percussion and Sharon Celani (who had toured with Fleetwood Mac in the late 1980s) and Mindy Stein on backing vocals, this would be the final appearance of the classic line-up including Christine McVie for 16 years. Neale Heywood and Sharon Celani remain touring members to this day.\n\n[[File:Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.jpg|right|thumb|Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham on the ''Say You Will'' Tour, 2003]]\nIn 1998 Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Members inducted included the original band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan, and ''Rumours''-era members Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. Bob Welch was not included, despite his key role in keeping the band alive during the early 1970s. The ''Rumours''-era version of the band performed both at the induction ceremony and at the Grammy Awards programme that year. Peter Green attended the induction ceremony but did not perform with his former bandmates, opting instead to perform his composition \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\" with [[Santana (band)|Santana]], who were inducted the same night. Neither Jeremy Spencer nor Danny Kirwan attended. Fleetwood Mac also received the \"Outstanding Contribution to Music\" award at the [[Brit Awards]] (British Phonographic Industry Awards) the same year.\n\nIn 1998 Christine McVie left the band. Her departure left Buckingham and Nicks to sing all the lead vocals for the band's seventeenth album, ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'', released in 2003, although Christine contributed some backing vocals and keyboards. The album debuted at No.3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart (No. 6 in the UK) and yielded chart hits with \"[[Peacekeeper (Fleetwood Mac song)|Peacekeeper]]\" and the title track, and a successful [[Say You Will Tour|world arena tour]] which lasted through 2004. The tour grossed $27,711,129 and was ranked No. 21 in the top 25 grossing tours of 2004.\n\nAround 2004\u201305 there were rumours of a reunion of the early line-up of Fleetwood Mac involving Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer.

They have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling bands]]. In 1998, select members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/fleetwood-mac?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhojzBRC3ARIsAGtNtHVsP3PFYQKLI_o9-KGlmSZ56Nw6foYOMt3C1_tqXAAmi9gc-teMyIYaAkuUEALw_wcB|title=Fleetwood Mac Hall of Fame|work=rockhall.com}}</ref> and received the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1998|title=History|website=BRIT Awards|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nFleetwood Mac was founded by guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]] and guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]]. Bassist [[John McVie]] completed the lineup for their [[Fleetwood Mac (1968 album)|self-titled debut album]]. [[Danny Kirwan]] joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist [[Christine McVie|Christine Perfect]], who contributed as a session musician from the second album, married McVie and joined in 1970. At this time it was primarily a [[British blues]] band, scoring a UK number one with \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Fleetwood Mac Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/fleetwood-mac/biography|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> and also had other hits such as the singles \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\" and \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\". All three guitarists left in succession during the early 1970s, to be replaced by guitarists [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] and [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]] and vocalist [[Dave Walker]]. By 1974, all three had either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist.\n\nIn late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he was introduced to folk-rock duo [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]]. Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the band. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more [[pop rock]] sound, and their 1975 self-titled album, ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'', reached No. 1 in the United States. ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in various countries around the world and won a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1978. ''Rumours'' has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the [[list of best-selling albums|eighth-highest-selling album in history]]. The band went through personal turmoil while recording the album, as both the romantic partnerships in the band (one being John and Christine McVie, and the other being Buckingham and Nicks) separated while continuing to make music together.\n\nThe band's personnel remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks each left the band, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists and vocalists.  A 1993 one-off performance for the [[first inauguration of Bill Clinton]] featured the lineup of Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham back together for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and the group released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' (1997), a live compilation of their work. Christine McVie left the band in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. Meanwhile, the group remained together as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'', in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined the band full-time in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-fires-lindsey-buckingham-w518925|title=Fleetwood Mac Fires Lindsey Buckingham|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], formerly of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and [[Neil Finn]] of [[Split Enz]] and [[Crowded House]].\n\n==History==\n===1967\u20131970: Formation and early years===\n[[File:Fleetwood mac peter green 2.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Green, 18 March 1970]]\nFleetwood Mac were formed in July 1967 in London, England, when Peter Green left the [[British blues]] band [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]].

London: Omnibus Press. p18</ref> John Mayall agreed and Fleetwood joined the Bluesbreakers.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers then consisted of Green, Fleetwood, [[John McVie]] and Mayall. Mayall gave Green free recording time as a gift, in which Fleetwood, McVie and Green recorded five songs. The fifth song was an instrumental that Green named after the rhythm section, \"Fleetwood Mac\" (\"Mac\" being short for McVie).\n\nSoon after this, Green suggested to Fleetwood that they form a new band. The pair wanted McVie on bass guitar and named the band 'Fleetwood Mac' to entice him, but McVie opted to keep his steady income with Mayall rather than take a risk with a new band. In the meantime Peter Green and Mick Fleetwood had teamed up with slide guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]] and bassist [[Bob Brunning]]. Brunning was in the band on the understanding that he would leave if McVie agreed to join. The Green, Fleetwood, Spencer, Brunning version of the band made its debut on 13 August 1967 at the Windsor Jazz and Blues Festival as 'Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, also featuring Jeremy Spencer'. Brunning played only a few gigs with Fleetwood Mac.<ref name=\"McStravickRoos2001\">{{cite book|author1=Summer McStravick|author2=John Roos|title=Blues-rock Explosion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLoQAQAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Old Goat Publishing|isbn=978-0-9701332-7-4}}</ref> Within weeks of this show, John McVie agreed to join the band as permanent bassist.<ref name=\"Darlington2001\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Darlington|title=I was Elvis Presley's Bastard Love-child & Other Stories of Rock'n'roll Excess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQtyBSE6risC&pg=PA67|year=2001|publisher=Critical Vision|isbn=978-1-900486-17-0|pages=67\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Petersen2011\">{{cite book|author=Holger Petersen|title=Talking Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ9GlMzNNVwC&pg=PA93|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Insomniac Press|isbn=978-1-55483-058-9|pages=93\u2013}}</ref>\n\nFleetwood Mac's [[Fleetwood Mac (1968 album)|self-titled debut album]] was a no-frills blues album and was released by the [[Blue Horizon]] label in February 1968.<ref name=\"Inc.1969\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KygEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4|date=24 May 1969|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=4\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> There were no other players on the album (except on the song \"Long Grey Mare\", which was recorded with Brunning on bass).

He was recruited from the South London blues trio Boilerhouse, which consisted of Kirwan on guitar, Trevor Stevens on bass and Dave Terrey on drums.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rawlings|first=Terry|title=Then, now and rare British Beat 1960\u20131969|year=2002|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-9094-8|page=77}}</ref> Green and Fleetwood had watched Boilerhouse rehearse in a basement boiler-room, and Green had been so impressed that he invited the band to play support slots for Fleetwood Mac. Green wanted Boilerhouse to become a professional band but Stevens and Terrey were not prepared to turn professional, so Green tried to find another rhythm section for Kirwan by placing an ad in [[Melody Maker]]. There were over 300 applicants, but when Green and Fleetwood ran auditions at the Nag's Head in Battersea (home of the [[Mike Vernon (producer)|Mike Vernon]] [[Blue Horizon]] Club) the hard-to-please Green could not find anyone good enough. Fleetwood invited Kirwan to join Fleetwood Mac as a third guitarist.<ref name=\"Brunning p18\" />\n\nGreen had been frustrated that Jeremy Spencer did not contribute to his songs. Kirwan, a talented self-taught guitarist, had a signature vibrato and a unique style that added a new dimension to the band's sound. In November 1968, with Kirwan in the band, they released their first number one single in Europe, \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\", on which Kirwan duetted with Green. Green said later that the success of 'Albatross' was thanks to Kirwan. \"If it wasn't for Danny, I would never had had a number one hit record.\" <ref name=\"vaudeville\">{{cite AV media notes|author= Fleetwood Mac |title= The Vaudeville Years |titlelink= The Vaudeville Years |type= CD booklet notes |year= 1998 |publisher= Receiver Records }}</ref> Around this time they released the compilation album ''[[English Rose (album)|English Rose]]'', which contained half of ''Mr Wonderful'' plus new songs from Kirwan. Their second compilation album,''[[The Pious Bird of Good Omen]]'', contained a collection of singles, B-sides and a selection of work the band had done with [[Eddie Boyd]].\n\nOn tour in the US in January 1969, the band recorded an album at the soon-to-close [[Chess Records]] Studio with some of the blues legends of Chicago, including [[Willie Dixon]], [[Buddy Guy]] and [[Otis Spann]]. These were Fleetwood Mac's last all-blues recordings. Along with the change of style the band was also going through label changes. Up until that point they had been on the Blue Horizon label, but with Kirwan in the band the musical possibilities had become too diverse for a blues-only label. The band signed with [[Immediate Records]] and released the single \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\", which became another British and European hit. For the B-side Spencer fronted Fleetwood Mac as \"Earl Vince and the Valiants\" and recorded \"[[Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonite]]\", typifying the more raucous rock 'n' roll side of the band. Immediate Records was in bad shape, however, and the band shopped around for a new deal. [[The Beatles]] wanted the band on [[Apple Records]] (Mick Fleetwood and [[George Harrison]] were brothers-in-law), but the band's manager [[Clifford Davis (musician)|Clifford Davis]] decided to go with [[Warner Bros. Records]] (through [[Reprise Records]], a [[Frank Sinatra]]-founded label), the label they have stayed with ever since.\n\nUnder the wing of Reprise, Fleetwood Mac released their third studio album, ''[[Then Play On]]'', in September 1969. Although the initial pressing of the American release of this album was the same as the British version, it was altered to contain the song \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\", which featured consistently in live performances from the time of its release through 1997 and again starting in 2009. ''Then Play On'', the band's first rock album, featured only the songs of Kirwan and Green. Jeremy Spencer, meanwhile, had recorded a [[Jeremy Spencer (album)|solo album]] of 1950s-style rock and roll songs, backed by the rest of the band except Green.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/jeremy-spencer-mw0000849643|title=Jeremy Spencer \u2013  Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nBy 1970 Peter Green, the frontman of the band, had developed a dependency on [[LSD]]. During the band's European tour, Green experienced a bad acid trip at a hippie commune in Munich. Clifford Davis, the band's manager, singled out this incident as the crucial point in Green's mental decline.<ref>{{cite book| last = Celmins| first = Martin| title = Peter Green: Founder of Fleetwood Mac| publisher = Castle| isbn = 1-898141-13-4}}</ref> He said: \"The truth about Peter Green and how he ended up how he did is very simple. We were touring Europe in late 1969. When we were in Germany, Peter told me he had been invited to a party. I knew there were going to be a lot of drugs around and I suggested that he didn't go. But he went anyway and I understand from him that he took what turned out to be very bad, impure LSD.

The San Bernardino show on 20 February was taped.\n\nIn the summer of 1971 the band held auditions for a replacement guitarist at their large country home, \"Benifold\", which they had jointly bought with their manager Davis for \u00a323,000 ({{Inflation|UK|23000|1970|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) prior to the ''Kiln House'' tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/benifold.htm|title=Benifold|website=fleetwoodmac.net|access-date=8 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927041715/http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/benifold.htm|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> A friend of the band, Judy Wong, recommended her high school friend [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]], who was living in [[Paris]], France, at the time. The band held a few meetings with Welch and decided to hire him, without actually playing with him, after they heard a tape of his songs.<ref name=\"Brunning, B 1998 p37\">Brunning, B (1998): Fleetwood Mac \u2013 The First 30 Years. London: Omnibus Press p37</ref>\n\nIn September 1971 the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Future Games]]''. As a result of Welch's arrival and Spencer's departure, the album was different from anything they had done previously. While it became the band's first studio album to miss the charts in the UK, it helped to expand the band's appeal in the United States. In Europe CBS released Fleetwood Mac's first [[Greatest Hits (1971 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]] album, which mostly consisted of songs by Peter Green, with one song by Spencer and one by Kirwan.\n\nIn 1972, six months after the release of ''Future Games'', the band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Bare Trees]]''. Mostly composed by Kirwan, ''Bare Trees'' featured the Welch-penned single \"[[Sentimental Lady]]\", which would be a much bigger hit for Welch five years later when he re-recorded it for his solo album ''[[French Kiss (Bob Welch album)|French Kiss]]'', backed by Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie. ''Bare Trees'' also featured \"Spare Me a Little of Your Love\", a bright Christine McVie song that became a staple of the band's live act throughout the early to mid-1970s.\n\nWhile the band was doing well in the studio, their tours started to be problematic. By 1972 Danny Kirwan had developed an alcohol dependency and was becoming alienated from Welch and the McVies. When Kirwan smashed his Gibson [[Les Paul Custom]] guitar before a concert on a US tour in August 1972, refused to go on stage and criticised the band afterwards, Fleetwood fired him.<ref name=\"brunning\">{{cite book | authorlink=Bob Brunning | first=Bob | last=Brunning | title=Fleetwood Mac: Behind the Masks | publisher=New English Library | year=1990 | location=London | isbn=0-450-53116-3 | oclc=22242160}}</ref> Fleetwood said later that the pressure had become too much for Kirwan, and he had suffered a breakdown.<ref name=\"Farber\">{{cite web |last1=Farber |first1=Jim |title=Fleetwood Mac's Forgotten Hero |url= https://web.musicaficionado.com/main.html#!/article/fleetwood_macs_forgotten_hero_by_jimfarber |website=Music Aficionado |accessdate= 5 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the three albums they released in this period they constantly changed line-ups. In September 1972 the band added guitarist [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]] and vocalist [[Dave Walker]], formerly of [[Savoy Brown]] and [[The Idle Race|Idle Race]].<ref name=\"Music Legends\">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-walker-interview-black-sabbath/|title=Dave Walker Interview| accessdate=6 May 2013|date=30 December 2011|last=Saulnier|first=Jason}}</ref> Bob Weston was well known as a slide guitarist and had known the band from his touring period with [[Long John Baldry]]. Fleetwood Mac also hired Savoy Brown's road manager, John Courage. Fleetwood, The McVies, Welch, Weston and Walker recorded the band's seventh studio album, ''[[Penguin (album)|Penguin]]'', which was released in January 1973. After the tour the band fired Walker because they felt his vocal style and attitude did not fit well with the rest of the band.<ref>{{cite web |title=Happy 45th: Fleetwood Mac, Penguin|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/happy-45th-fleetwood-mac-penguin |website=Rhino |accessdate=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining five members carried on and recorded the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Mystery to Me]]'', six months later. This album contained Welch's song \"[[Hypnotized (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hypnotized]]\", which received a great amount of airplay on the radio and became one of the band's most successful songs to date in the US. The band was proud of the new album and anticipated that it would be a smash hit. While it did eventually go Gold, personal problems within the band emerged. The McVies' marriage was under a lot of stress, which was aggravated by their constant working with each other and by John McVie's considerable [[alcohol abuse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\"McVie, John.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed.|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/epm/18632|website=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> Subsequent lack of touring meant that the album was unable to chart as high as the previous one.\n\nDuring the 1973 US tour to promote ''Mystery to Me'', Weston had an affair with Fleetwood's wife [[Jenny Boyd|Jenny Boyd Fleetwood]], sister of [[Pattie Boyd|Pattie Boyd Harrison]].

He realised that the original Fleetwood Mac was being neglected by Warner Bros and that they would need to change their base of operation from England to America, to which the rest of the band agreed. Rock promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] wrote a letter to Warner Bros to convince them that the real Fleetwood Mac was, in fact, Fleetwood, Welch, and the McVies. This did not end the legal battle but the band was able to record as Fleetwood Mac again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/12/listen-to-fleetwood-mac-play-black-magic-woman-in.html|title=Here's the \"Real\" Fleetwood Mac Playing \"Black Magic Woman\" in 1974|website=pastemagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref> Instead of hiring another manager, Fleetwood Mac, having re-formed, decided to manage themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn September 1974, Fleetwood Mac signed a new recording contract with Warner Bros, but remained on the Reprise label. The band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Heroes Are Hard to Find]],'' in September 1974 and, for the first time in its history, the band had only one guitarist. While on tour they added a second keyboardist, Doug Graves, who had been an engineer on ''Heroes Are Hard to Find''. In late 1974 Graves was preparing to become a permanent member of the band by the end of their US tour. He said:\n\n{{quote|\"I'm looking forward to adding something to this already great band. I helped engineer their album 'Heroes Are Hard to Find' and got to know each member well. It came to me as a shock when Mick asked me to join but I am enjoying playing live with the band, and hopefully will start a new studio album with the band soon.\"}}\n\nHowever, Graves did not ultimately join full-time. In 1980, Christine McVie explained the decision:\n\n{{quote| \"He (Doug Graves) was there to back me up, but I think it was decided after the first two or three concerts that I was better off without him. The band wanted me to expand my role and have a little more freedom, so he played some organ behind me, but he didn't play the same way I did.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Doerschuk|first1=Bob|title=Contemporary Keyboard (10/1980), Christine McVie|url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=11&c=2|website=The Blue Letter Archives|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nRobert (\"Bobby\") Hunt, who had been in the band Head West with Bob Welch back in 1970, replaced Graves. Neither musician proved to be a long-term addition to the line-up. Welch left soon after the tour ended (on 5 December 1974 at Cal State University), having grown tired of touring and legal struggles. Nevertheless, the tour had enabled the ''Heroes'' album to reach a higher position on the American charts than any of the band's previous records.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/discog.php?pid=80|title=Heroes Are Hard To Find \u2013  Fleetwood Mac|last=Adelson|first=Martin E.|website=discog.fleetwoodmac.net|access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===1975\u20131987: Addition of Buckingham and Nicks, and mainstream success===\nAfter Welch announced that he was leaving the band, Fleetwood began searching for a replacement. While Fleetwood was checking out [[Sound City Studios]] in Los Angeles, the house engineer, [[Keith Olsen]], played him a track he had recorded in the studio, \"Frozen Love\", from the album ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]'' (1973). Fleetwood liked it and was introduced to the guitarist from the band, [[Lindsey Buckingham]], who was at Sound City that day recording demos. Fleetwood asked him to join Fleetwood Mac and Buckingham agreed, on the condition that his music partner and girlfriend, [[Stevie Nicks]], be included. Buckingham and Nicks joined the band on New Year's Eve 1974, within four weeks of the previous incarnation splitting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lindsey Buckingham|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/lindsey.htm|publisher=Fleetwoodmac.net|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Music Remastered: Fleetwood Mac|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/behind-the-music-remastered/full-episodes/behind-the-music-remastered-fleetwood-mac/1654105/playlist.jhtml|publisher=VH1|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the new line-up released [[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|another self-titled album]], their tenth studio album. The album was a breakthrough for the band and became a huge hit, reaching No.1 in the US and selling over 7 million copies. Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie's \"[[Over My Head (Fleetwood Mac song)|Over My Head]]\" and \"[[Say You Love Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Say You Love Me]]\" and Stevie Nicks's \"[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]\", as well as the much-played album track \"[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]\", a live rendition of which became a hit twenty years later on ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' album.\n{{Listen|filename=Landslide by Fleetwood Mac.ogg|title=\"Landslide\" (Fleetwood Mac)|description=17 second sample from Fleetwood Mac's song \"Landslide\".| format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nIn 1976, the band was suffering from severe stress. With success came the end of John and Christine McVie's marriage, as well as Buckingham and Nicks's long-term romantic relationship. Fleetwood, meanwhile, was in the midst of divorce proceedings from his wife, Jenny. The pressure on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-up album, combined with their new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions which were allegedly fuelled by high consumption of drugs and alcohol.<ref name=\"Rock Nuns\">{{cite web |last1=Jonze |first1=Tim |title=Fleetwood Mac's Stevie and Christine: 'We were like rock'n'roll nuns' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/12/fleetwood-mac-stevie-nicks-christine-mcvie-nuns |website=The Guardian |accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe band's eleventh studio album, ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (the band's first release on the main Warner label after Reprise was retired and all of its acts were reassigned to the parent label), was released in the spring of 1977. In this album, the band members laid bare the emotional turmoil they were experiencing at the time. ''Rumours'' was critically acclaimed and won the [[Grammy]] Award for Album of the Year in 1977. The album generated multiple Top Ten singles, including Buckingham's \"[[Go Your Own Way]]\", Nicks's US No. 1 \"[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]\" and Christine McVie's \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\" and \"[[You Make Loving Fun]]\". Buckingham's \"[[Second Hand News]]\", Nicks's \"[[Gold Dust Woman]]\" and \"[[The Chain]]\" (the only song written by all five band members) also received significant radio airplay. By 2003 ''Rumours'' had sold over 19 million copies in the US alone (certified as a [[diamond album]] by the [[RIAA]]) and a total of 40 million copies worldwide, bringing it to eighth on the [[list of best-selling albums]]. Fleetwood Mac supported the album with a lucrative tour.\n\nOn 10 October 1979, Fleetwood Mac were honoured with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their contributions to the music industry at 6608 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/fleetwood-mac|title=Fleetwood Mac {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/fleetwood-mac/|title=Fleetwood Mac|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nBuckingham convinced Fleetwood to let his work on their next album be more experimental, and to be allowed to work on tracks at home before bringing them to the rest of the band in the studio. The result of this, the band's twelfth studio album ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', was a 20-track double album released in 1979. It produced three hit singles: Lindsey Buckingham's \"[[Tusk (song)|Tusk]]\" (US No. 8), which featured the [[Spirit of Troy|USC Trojan Marching Band]], Christine McVie's \"[[Think About Me]]\" (US No. 20), and Stevie Nicks's six-and-a-half minute opus \"[[Sara (Fleetwood Mac song)|Sara]]\" (US No. 7). \"Sara\" was cut to four-and-a-half minutes for both the hit single and the first CD-release of the album, but the unedited version has since been restored on the [[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|1988 greatest hits compilation]], the 2004 reissue of ''Tusk''  and Fleetwood Mac's 2002 release of ''[[The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac]]''. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions of ''Tusk'' although his playing, on the Christine McVie track \"Brown Eyes\", is not credited on the album.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac| url=https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet| url-access=registration|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet/page/214 214]}}</ref> In an interview in 2019 Fleetwood described ''Tusk'' as his \"personal favourite\" and said, \u201cKudos to Lindsey ... for us not doing a replica of ''Rumours''.\"<ref>{{cite news|work= Independent |url=  https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/fleetwood-mac-interview-tour-uk-wembley |title= Fleetwood Mac: We\u2019ll Burn in Hell if We Don\u2019t Play Glastonbury One Day: Chris Harvey |date= 27 April 2019  |accessdate= 30 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n''Tusk'' sold four million copies worldwide. Fleetwood blamed the album's relative lack of commercial success on the [[RKO General|RKO]] radio chain having played the album in its entirety prior to release, thereby allowing mass home taping.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac| url=https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet| url-access=registration|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet/page/219 219]}}</ref>\n\nThe band embarked on an 11-month tour to support and promote ''Tusk''. They travelled across the world, including the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, they shared the bill with reggae superstar [[Bob Marley]]. On this world tour, the band recorded music for their first [[Live (Fleetwood Mac album)|live album]], which was released at the end of 1980.\n\nThe band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'', was released in 1982. Following 1981 solo albums by Nicks (''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]''), Fleetwood (''[[The Visitor (Mick Fleetwood album)|The Visitor]]''), and Buckingham (''[[Law and Order (album)|Law and Order]]''), there was a return to a more conventional approach. Buckingham had been chided by critics, fellow band members and music business managers for the lesser commercial success of ''Tusk''. Recorded at [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] in France and produced by [[Richard Dashut]], ''Mirage'' was an attempt to recapture the huge success of ''Rumours''. Its hits included Christine McVie's \"[[Hold Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hold Me]]\" and \"[[Love in Store]]\" (co-written by [[Robbie Patton]] and Jim Recor, respectively), Stevie Nicks's \"[[Gypsy (Fleetwood Mac song)|Gypsy]]\", and Lindsey Buckingham's \"[[Oh Diane]]\", which made the Top 10 in the UK. A minor hit was also scored by Buckingham's \"Eyes Of The World\" and \"[[Can't Go Back (Fleetwood Mac song)|Can't Go Back]]\".\n\nIn contrast to the [[Tusk Tour]] the band embarked on only a short tour of 18 American cities, the [[Los Angeles]] show being recorded and released on video. They also headlined the first [[US Festival]], on 5 September 1982, for which the band was paid $500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1982|r=0}}}} today). ''Mirage'' was certified double platinum in the US.\n\nFollowing ''Mirage'' the band went on hiatus, which allowed members to pursue solo careers. Stevie Nicks released two more solo albums (1983's ''[[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]]'' and 1985's ''[[Rock a Little]]''). Lindsey Buckingham issued ''[[Go Insane (album)|Go Insane]]'' in 1984, the same year that Christine McVie made an [[Christine McVie (album)|eponymous album]] (yielding the Top 10 hit \"[[Got a Hold on Me]]\" and the Top 40 hit \"[[Love Will Show Us How]]\"). All three met with success, Nicks being the most popular. During this period Mick Fleetwood had filed for bankruptcy, Nicks was admitted to the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] for addiction problems and John McVie had suffered an addiction-related seizure, all of which were attributed to the lifestyle of excess afforded to them by their worldwide success. It was rumoured that Fleetwood Mac had disbanded, but Buckingham commented that he was unhappy to allow ''Mirage'' to remain as the band's last effort.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=785&c=18 |title=Fleetwood Mac: Return Without Leaving |work=[[Creem]] |last=Kordosh |first=J. |date=September 1987}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Rumours'' line-up of Fleetwood Mac recorded one more album, their fourteenth studio album, ''[[Tango in the Night]]'', in 1987. As with various other Fleetwood Mac albums, the material started off as a Buckingham solo album before becoming a group project. The album went on to become their best-selling release since ''Rumours'', especially in the UK where it hit No. 1 three times in the following year. The album sold three million copies in the US and contained four hits: Christine McVie's \"[[Little Lies]]\" and \"[[Everywhere (Fleetwood Mac song)|Everywhere]]\" ('Little Lies' being co-written with McVie's new husband Eddy Quintela), [[Sandy Stewart (musician)|Sandy Stewart]] and Stevie Nicks's \"[[Seven Wonders (song)|Seven Wonders]]\", and Lindsey Buckingham's \"[[Big Love (Fleetwood Mac song)|Big Love]]\". \"[[Family Man (Fleetwood Mac song)|Family Man]]\" (Buckingham and [[Richard Dashut]]), and \"[[Isn't It Midnight]]\" (Christine McVie), were also released as singles, with less success.\n\n===1987\u20131995: Departure of Buckingham and Nicks===\nWith a ten-week tour scheduled, Buckingham held back at the last minute, saying he felt his creativity was being stifled. A group meeting at Christine McVie's house on 7 August 1987 resulted in turmoil. Tensions were coming to a head. Mick Fleetwood said in his autobiography that there was a physical altercation between Buckingham and Nicks. Buckingham left the band the following day.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} After Buckingham's departure Fleetwood Mac added two new guitarists to the band, [[Billy Burnette]] and [[Rick Vito]], again without auditions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ressner|first1=Jeffrey|title=Lindsey Buckingham Leaves Fleetwood Mac|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lindsey-buckingham-leaves-fleetwood-mac-19870924|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nBurnette was the son of [[Dorsey Burnette]] and nephew of [[Johnny Burnette]], both of [[The Rock and Roll Trio]]. He had already worked with Mick Fleetwood in Zoo, with Christine McVie as part of her solo band, had done some session work with Stevie Nicks, and backed Lindsey Buckingham on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Fleetwood and Christine McVie had played on his ''Try Me'' album in 1985. Vito, a Peter Green admirer, had played with many artists from [[Bonnie Raitt]] to John Mayall, and worked with John McVie on two Mayall albums.\n\nThe 1987\u201388 \"Shake the Cage\" tour was the first outing for this line-up. It was successful enough to warrant the release of a concert video, entitled \"Tango in the Night\", which was filmed at San Francisco's [[Cow Palace]] arena in December 1987.\n\nCapitalising on the success of ''Tango in the Night'', the band released a ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in 1988. It featured singles from the 1975\u20131988 era and included two new compositions, \"[[No Questions Asked (Fleetwood Mac song)|No Questions Asked]]\" written by Nicks and \"[[As Long as You Follow]]\", written by McVie and Quintela. 'As Long as You Follow' was released as a single in 1988 but only made No. 43 in the US and No.66 in the UK, although it reached No.1 on the US Adult Contemporary charts. The ''Greatest Hits'' album, which peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US (though it has since sold over 8 million copies there) was dedicated by the band to Buckingham, with whom they were now reconciled.\n\nIn 1990, Fleetwood Mac released their fifteenth studio album, ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]''. With this album the band veered away from the stylised sound that Buckingham had evolved during his tenure in the band (which was also evident in his solo work) and developed a more [[adult contemporary]] style with producer [[Greg Ladanyi]]. The album yielded only one Top 40 hit, McVie's \"[[Save Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Save Me]]\". ''Behind the Mask'' only achieved [[RIAA certification|Gold]] album status in the US, peaking at No. 18 on the ''Billboard'' album chart, though it entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1. It received mixed reviews and was seen by some music critics as a low point for the band in the absence of Lindsey Buckingham (who had actually made a guest appearance playing on the title track). But ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine said that Vito and Burnette were \"the best thing to ever happen to Fleetwood Mac\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/behind-the-mask-19900531|title=''Behind the Mask'' review|last=Berger|first=Arion|date=31 May 1990|magazine=Rolling Stone|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref> The subsequent \"Behind the Mask\" tour saw the band play sold-out shows at London's Wembley Stadium. In the final show in Los Angeles, Buckingham joined the band on stage. The two women of the band, McVie and Nicks, had decided that the tour would be their last (McVie's father had died during the tour), although both stated that they would still record with the band. In 1991, however, Nicks and Rick Vito announced they were leaving Fleetwood Mac altogether.\n\nIn 1992, Mick Fleetwood arranged a 4-disc box set, spanning highlights from the band's 25-year history, entitled ''[[25 Years \u2013 The Chain]]'' (an edited 2-disc set was also available). A notable inclusion in the box set was \"[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]\", a Stevie Nicks composition that was recorded during the ''Rumours'' sessions but was omitted from the album and used as the B-side of \"Go Your Own Way\". Nicks had requested use of this track for her 1991 best-of compilation ''TimeSpace'', but Fleetwood had refused as he had planned to include it in this collection as a rarity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The disagreement between Nicks and Fleetwood garnered press coverage and was believed to have been the main reason for Nicks leaving the band in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spanos |first1=Brittany |title=\u2018Silver Springs\u2019: Inside Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Great Lost Breakup Anthem |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref> The box set also included a new Stevie Nicks/Rick Vito composition, \"[[Paper Doll (Fleetwood Mac song)|Paper Doll]]\", which was released in the US as a single and produced by Lindsey Buckingham and Richard Dashut.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boehm|first1=Mike|title=Life After Mac|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-10/news/ol-2617_1_fleetwood-mac/3|website=Los Angelis Times|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}</ref> There were also two new Christine McVie compositions, \"Heart of Stone\" and [[Love Shines (song)|\"Love Shines]]\". \"Love Shines\" was released as a single in the UK and elsewhere. Lindsey Buckingham also contributed a new song, \"Make Me a Mask\". Mick Fleetwood also released a deluxe hardcover companion book to coincide with the release of the box set, titled ''My 25 Years in Fleetwood Mac''. The volume featured notes written by Fleetwood detailing the band's 25-year history and many rare photographs.\n\nThe Buckingham/Nicks/McVie/McVie/Fleetwood line-up reunited in 1993 at the request of US President [[Bill Clinton]] for his first [[United States presidential inaugural balls|Inaugural Ball]]. Clinton had made Fleetwood Mac's \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\" his campaign theme song. His request for it to be performed at the Inauguration Ball was met with enthusiasm by the band, although this line-up had no intention of reuniting again.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Andy|title=Flashback: Fleetwood Mac Reunite for Bill Clinton's Inauguration|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-fleetwood-mac-reunite-for-bill-clintons-inauguration-20130122|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nInspired by the new interest in the band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Christine McVie recorded another album as Fleetwood Mac, with Billy Burnette taking lead guitar duties. Burnette left in March 1993 to record a country album and pursue an acting career and [[Bekka Bramlett]], who had worked a year earlier with Mick Fleetwood's Zoo, was recruited to take his place. Solo singer-songwriter/guitarist and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] member [[Dave Mason]], who had worked with Bekka's parents [[Delaney & Bonnie]] twenty-five years earlier, was subsequently added. In March 1994 Billy Burnette, a good friend and co-songwriter with [[Delaney Bramlett]], returned to the band with Fleetwood's blessing.\n\nThe band, minus Christine McVie, toured in 1994, opening for [[Crosby, Stills, & Nash]] and in 1995 as part of a package with [[REO Speedwagon]] and [[Pat Benatar]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeRiso |first1=Nick |title=Dave Mason on Traffic, Fleetwood Mac and going his own way |url=http://somethingelsereviews.com/2014/02/12/something-else-interview-dave-mason-on-traffic-fleetwood-mac-going-his-own-way/ |website=Something Else! |accessdate=September 22, 2018}}</ref> This tour saw the band perform classic Fleetwood Mac songs from their 1967\u20131974 era. In 1995, at a concert in Tokyo, the band was greeted by former member Jeremy Spencer, who performed a few songs with them.\n\nOn 10 October 1995, Fleetwood Mac released their sixteenth studio album, ''[[Time (Fleetwood Mac album)|Time]]'', which was not a success. Although it hit the UK Top 60 for one week, the album had zero impact in the US. It failed to graze the ''Billboard'' Top 200 albums chart, a reversal for a band that had been a mainstay on that chart for most of the previous two decades. Shortly after the album's release, Christine McVie informed the band that the album would be her last. Bramlett and Burnette subsequently formed a [[country music]] duo, [[Bekka & Billy]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fleetwood Mac: The Definitive History|last=Evans|first=Mike|publisher=Sterling|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4027-8630-3|location=New York|pages=267}}</ref>\n\n===1995\u20131997: Re-formation===\nJust weeks after disbanding Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood announced that he was working with Lindsey Buckingham again. John McVie was added to the sessions, and later Christine McVie. Stevie Nicks also enlisted Lindsey Buckingham to produce a song for a soundtrack.\n\nIn May 1996 Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Stevie Nicks performed together at a private party in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], prior to the [[Kentucky Derby]], with [[Steve Winwood]] filling in for Lindsey Buckingham. A week later the ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' film soundtrack was released, which featured the Stevie Nicks-Lindsey Buckingham duet \"[[Twisted (Stevie Nicks song)|Twisted]]\", with Mick Fleetwood on drums. This eventually led to a full reunion of the ''Rumours'' line-up, which officially reformed in March 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/mick-fleetwood-fleetwood-mac-is-the-most-abused-franchise-in-the-business|title=Mick Fleetwood: \"Fleetwood Mac is the most abused franchise in the business\"|last=October 2017|first=Dave Everley02|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132007: Reunion and Christine McVie's departure===\nThe regrouped Fleetwood Mac performed a live concert on a soundstage at [[Warner Bros.]] [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California, on 22 May 1997. The concert was recorded, and from this performance came the 1997 live album ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'', which brought Fleetwood Mac back to the top of the US album charts for the first time in 10 years. ''The Dance'' returned Fleetwood Mac to a superstar status they had not enjoyed since ''Tango in the Night''. The album was certified 5 million units by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Fleetwood+Mac%22|title=RIAA - Gold and Platinum Searchable Database|publisher=riaa.com|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref> An arena tour followed the [[MTV]] premiere of ''The Dance'' and kept the reunited Fleetwood Mac on the road throughout much of 1997, the 20th anniversary of ''Rumours''. With additional musicians Neale Heywood on guitar, Brett Tuggle on keyboards, Lenny Castro on percussion and Sharon Celani (who had toured with Fleetwood Mac in the late 1980s) and Mindy Stein on backing vocals, this would be the final appearance of the classic line-up including Christine McVie for 16 years. Neale Heywood and Sharon Celani remain touring members to this day.\n\n[[File:Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.jpg|right|thumb|Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham on the ''Say You Will'' Tour, 2003]]\nIn 1998 Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Members inducted included the original band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan, and ''Rumours''-era members Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. Bob Welch was not included, despite his key role in keeping the band alive during the early 1970s. The ''Rumours''-era version of the band performed both at the induction ceremony and at the Grammy Awards programme that year. Peter Green attended the induction ceremony but did not perform with his former bandmates, opting instead to perform his composition \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\" with [[Santana (band)|Santana]], who were inducted the same night. Neither Jeremy Spencer nor Danny Kirwan attended. Fleetwood Mac also received the \"Outstanding Contribution to Music\" award at the [[Brit Awards]] (British Phonographic Industry Awards) the same year.\n\nIn 1998 Christine McVie left the band. Her departure left Buckingham and Nicks to sing all the lead vocals for the band's seventeenth album, ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'', released in 2003, although Christine contributed some backing vocals and keyboards. The album debuted at No.3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart (No. 6 in the UK) and yielded chart hits with \"[[Peacekeeper (Fleetwood Mac song)|Peacekeeper]]\" and the title track, and a successful [[Say You Will Tour|world arena tour]] which lasted through 2004. The tour grossed $27,711,129 and was ranked No. 21 in the top 25 grossing tours of 2004.\n\nAround 2004\u201305 there were rumours of a reunion of the early line-up of Fleetwood Mac involving Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer.
