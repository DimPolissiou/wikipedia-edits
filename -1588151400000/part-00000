As radio communication with Earth will take about eight minutes in each direction, the ''Parker Solar Probe'' will have to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself. This will be done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct [[sunlight]] coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from [[reaction wheels]] to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again. According to project scientist Nicky Fox, the team describe it as \"the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown\".{{r|bbc22jl18}}\n\nThe primary power for the mission is a dual system of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] ([[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic arrays]]). A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside {{Val|0.25|u=au}}, is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach.

Second, even when the probe is not particularly near the Sun, when the angle between the probe and the Sun (as seen from Earth) is too small, the Sun's radiation will overwhelm the communication link.<ref name=\"mission design\"/>{{rp|11\u201314}}\n\n== Science goals ==\n[[File:Sun's Apparent Size as Seen From Earth vs From Solar Probe Plus's orbit.png|thumb|An apparent size of the Sun as seen from ''Parker Solar Probe'' at perihelion compared to its apparent size seen from Earth.]]\nThe goals of the mission are:<ref name=\"Fox 2016\">{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=N.J.|last2=Velli|first2=M.C.|last3=Bale|first3=S.D.|last4=Decker|first4=R.|last5=Driesman|first5=A.|last6=Howard|first6=R.A. |last7=Kasper|first7=J.C.|last8=Kinnison|first8=J.|last9=Kusterer|first9=M.|first10=D.|last10=Lario|first11=M.K.|last11=Lockwood|first12=D.J.|last12=McComas|first13=N.E.|last13=Raouafi|first14=A.|last14=Szabo|date=November 11, 2015|title=The Solar Probe Plus Mission: Humanity's First Visit to Our Star|journal=Space Science Reviews|language=en|volume=204|issue=1\u20134|pages=7\u201348|doi=10.1007/s11214-015-0211-6 |issn=0038-6308|bibcode=2016SSRv..204....7F|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n* Trace the flow of energy that heats the [[solar corona|corona]] and accelerates the [[solar wind]]\n* Determine the structure and dynamics of the [[Sun#Magnetic field|magnetic fields]] at the sources of solar wind\n* Determine what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles\n\n===Investigations===\n[[File:Parker Solar Probe preparation of the Energetic Particle Instrument-Low Energy (EPI-Lo).jpg|thumb|The EPI-Lo instrument for [[Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun|IS\u2609IS]] is prepared.]]\nTo achieve these goals, the mission will perform five major experiments or investigations:<ref name=\"Fox 2016\"/>\n* Electromagnetic Fields Investigation ('''[[FIELDS]]'''){{snd}}This investigation will make direct measurements of [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, radio waves, [[Poynting vector|Poynting flux]], absolute [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] density, and [[electron temperature]].

On the second flyby, the period shortens to 130 days. After less than two orbits (only 198 days later) it encounters Venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of Venus. This encounter shortens its period to half of that of Venus, or about 112.5 days. After two orbits it meets Venus a fourth time at about the same place, shortening its period to about 102 days. After 237 days it meets Venus for the fifth time and its period is shortened to about 96 days, three-sevenths that of Venus. It then makes seven orbits while Venus makes three. The sixth encounter, almost two years after the fifth, brings its period down to 92 days, two-fifths that of Venus. After five more orbits (two orbits of Venus) it meets Venus for the seventh and last time, decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the Sun.<ref name=the_mission>See data and figure at {{cite web |url=http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Journey-to-the-Sun |title=Solar Probe Plus: The Mission |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image |Velocity of Parker Solar Probe wide.svg |900px |The speed of the probe and distance from the Sun, from launch until 2026.

It will assess the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal plasma and magnetic field, the energy flow that heats the solar corona and impels the solar wind, and the mechanisms that accelerate energetic particles.\n\nThe spacecraft's systems are protected from the extreme heat and radiation near the [[Sun]] by a solar shield.

The spacecraft systems and [[scientific instruments]] are located in the central portion of the shield's shadow, where direct radiation from the Sun is fully blocked. If the shield were not between the spacecraft and the Sun, the probe would be damaged and become inoperative within tens of seconds. As radio communication with Earth will take about eight minutes in each direction, the ''Parker Solar Probe'' will have to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself. This will be done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct [[sunlight]] coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from [[reaction wheels]] to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again. According to project scientist Nicky Fox, the team describe it as \"the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown\".{{r|bbc22jl18}}\n\nThe primary power for the mission is a dual system of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] ([[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic arrays]]). A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside {{Val|0.25|u=au}}, is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach. This secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain [[operating temperature]] of the solar panels and instrumentation.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090004577.pdf|title=Solar Power System Design for the Solar Probe+ Mission|conference=6th International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference |location=Cleveland, Ohio.|first1=Geoffrey A.|last1=Landis|first2=Paul C.|last2=Schmitz|first3=James|last3=Kinnison|first4=Martin|last4=Fraeman|first5=Lew|last5=Roufberg|first6=Steve|last6=Vernon |first7=Melissa |last7=Wirzburger|display-authors=1|date=July 28\u201330, 2008|id=AIAA 2008-5712}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techexplorist.com/traveling-sun-parker-solar-probe-melt/15586/ |title=Traveling to the Sun: Why won't Parker Solar Probe melt?|first=Pranjal|last=Mehar|website=Tech Explorist|date=July 20, 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Trajectory ==\n[[File:Animation of Parker Solar Probe trajectory.gif|thumb|right|An animation of ''Parker Solar Probe''{{'s}} trajectory from August 7, 2018 to August 29, 2025:<br/>{{legend2|magenta|''Parker Solar Probe''}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Yellow|[[Sun]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Lime|[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|[[Venus]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|RoyalBlue|[[Earth]]}}<br/>For more detailed animation, see [[:File:Animation of Parker Solar Probe trajectory.webm|this video.]]]]\n\nThe ''Parker Solar Probe'' mission design uses repeated [[gravity assist]]s at Venus to incrementally decrease its orbital [[perihelion]] to achieve a final altitude (above the surface) of approximately 8.5 solar radii, or about {{cvt|6|e6km|e6mi+au}}.<ref name=jhuapl>{{cite web|title=Solar Probe Plus: A NASA Mission to Touch the Sun|url=http://solarprobe.jhuapl.edu/|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory|date=September 4, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref> The spacecraft trajectory will include seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its elliptical orbit around the Sun, for a total of 24 orbits.{{r|extreme}} The near Sun radiation environment is predicted to cause spacecraft charging effects, radiation damage in materials and electronics, and communication interruptions, so the orbit will be highly elliptical with short times spent near the Sun.{{r|Fox 2016}}\n\nThe trajectory requires high launch energy, so the probe was launched on a [[Delta IV Heavy]] class [[launch vehicle]] and an upper stage based on the [[STAR-48|STAR 48BV]] solid rocket motor.{{r|Fox 2016}} Interplanetary [[gravity assist]]s will provide further deceleration relative to its [[heliocentric orbit]], which will result in a heliocentric speed record at [[perihelion]].{{r|Delta 4}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scharf|first1=Caleb A.|title=The Fastest Spacecraft Ever?|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-fastest-spacecraft-ever/|website=Scientific American Blog Network|language=en}}</ref> As the probe passes around the [[Sun]], it will achieve a velocity of up to {{cvt|200|km/s}}, which will temporarily make it the fastest human-made object, almost three times as fast as the previous record holder, [[Helios (spacecraft)#Helios-B|Helios-2]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0023.shtml|title=Aircraft Speed Records|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2014 |website=Aerospaceweb.org|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66135-fastest-spacecraft-speed|title=Fastest spacecraft speed|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2015|website=guinnessworldrecords.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219024804/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66135-fastest-spacecraft-speed |archive-date=December 19, 2016 |url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Parker Solar Probe \u2013 Check123, Video Encyclopedia|url=https://www.check123.com/videos/13450-parker-solar-probe|language=en|accessdate=June 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810211059/https://www.check123.com/videos/13450-parker-solar-probe|archive-date=August 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Like every object in an orbit, due to gravity the spacecraft will accelerate as it nears perihelion, then slow down again afterward until it reaches its [[aphelion]].\n\n==Mission==\n[[File:Parker Solar Probe Launch (NHQ201808120013).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Launch of ''Parker Solar Probe'' in 2018.]]\n[[File:Magnificent CME Erupts on the Sun - August 31.jpg|thumb|The overall goal is to increase understanding of Earth's star, the Sun{{mdash}} an astronomical body of immense impact on the Earth and the Solar System due to its release of light and solar wind, in addition to its large gravity.

On the second flyby, the period shortens to 130 days. After less than two orbits (only 198 days later) it encounters Venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of Venus. This encounter shortens its period to half of that of Venus, or about 112.5 days. After two orbits it meets Venus a fourth time at about the same place, shortening its period to about 102 days. After 237 days it meets Venus for the fifth time and its period is shortened to about 96 days, three-sevenths that of Venus. It then makes seven orbits while Venus makes three. The sixth encounter, almost two years after the fifth, brings its period down to 92 days, two-fifths that of Venus. After five more orbits (two orbits of Venus) it meets Venus for the seventh and last time, decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the Sun.<ref name=the_mission>See data and figure at {{cite web |url=http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Journey-to-the-Sun |title=Solar Probe Plus: The Mission |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image |Velocity of Parker Solar Probe wide.svg |900px |The speed of the probe and distance from the Sun, from launch until 2026.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], Diesel (D), Mixed traffic (M) engine, 2nd generation (2). They entered service in 1962. A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive until its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still retain \"operational status\" on the mainline as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. \n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. Therefore required building a large number of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco.html#class|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives - General Information - I|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|288x288px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with locomotive number 18040<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3571?list_type=preserved|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster National Railway Museum, Delhi (NRM) WDM-2 18040 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Images|first=Historical Railway|title=India Railways - Indian Government Railways Class WDM2 (DL560C) diesel locomotive Nr. 18041 (Alco 84199 / 1962)|date=2019-12-31|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/124446949@N06/49306888842/|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> being the first WDM-2 of India.

Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created.

The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as gooty(GY) in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed as Erode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed as Ratlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 has a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by ALCO. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locomotives can haul both vacuum and air brake wagons. Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes.

But these locomotives proved to be not that useful as the locomotive pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbo locomotives were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service life.

A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Diesel and Electric Locomotive Specifications|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still retain \"operational status\" on the mainline as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. \n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|288x288px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. \n\nThe first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3732|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Mughalsarai (MGS) WDM-2 18233 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> and the first fully-built WDM-2 from DLW was 18299<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3798|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Bondamunda (BNDM) WDM-2 18299 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n[[File:Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|289x289px|Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi]]\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many Broad Gauge countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by [[Diesel-Loco Modernisation Works|Diesel Loco Modernization Works]] (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram [[Dynamic braking|DBR]]'s.\n\n== Service History ==\nKatni(KTE) was the first shed to hold WDM2. The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as gooty(GY) in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed as Erode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed as Ratlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 had a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by ALCO. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locos have dual braking capacity.Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locos from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  to were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locos proved to be not that useful as the loco pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbos were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service life. These locos can be easily recognized by '0' at the beginning of their road number. These WDM-2 locos are relegated to do Shunting or occasionally haul Departmental works trains.Some WDM-2 remain in classification for many years before they are scrapped.  \n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=60em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Former Sheds ==\n\n*[[Andal Junction railway station|Andal]] (UDL)\n*[[Bardhaman railway station|Bardhaman]] (BWN)\n*[[Bokaro Steel City railway station|Bokaro Steel City]] (BKSC)\n*[[Bondamunda railway station|Bondamunda]] (BNDM)\n*[[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]] (ERS)- The very last WDM-2 (18701) was removed from service on june, 2019 after being in the shed for 38 years.\n*[[Diesel loco shed, Erode|Erode]] (ED)\n*[[Gondal railway station|Gonda]] (GD)\n*[[Diesel Loco Shed, Gooty|Gooty]] (GY)\n*[[Diesel Loco Shed, Guntakal|Guntakal]] (GTL)\n*[[Howrah Junction railway station|Howrah]] (HWH)\n*[[Itarsi Junction railway station|Itarsi]] (ET)\n*[[Izzatnagar railway station|Izzatnagar Loco Shed]] (IZN)\n*[[Kalyan Junction railway station|Kalyan]] (KYN)\n*[[Kazipet railway station|Kazipet]] (KZJ)\n*[[Kharagpur Junction railway station|Kharagpur]] (KGP)\n*[[Krishnarajapuram railway station|Krishnarajapuram]] (KJM)\n*[[Lucknow Charbagh railway station|Lucknow]] (LKO)\n*[[Ludhiana Junction railway station|Ludhiana]] (LDH)\n*[[Moula Ali Railway Station|Moula Ali]] (MLY)\n*[[Diesel Loco Shed, Pune|Pune]] (PUNE)\n*[[Patratu railway station|Loco Shed Patratu]] (PTRU)\n*[[Diesel Loco Shed, Ratlam|Ratlam]] (RTM)\n*[[Diesel Loco Shed, Samastipur|Samastipur]] (SPJ)\n*[[Tughlakabad railway station|Tughlakabad]] (TKD)\n*[[Diesel Loco Shed, Vatva|Vatva]] (VTA)\n*[[Visakhapatnam railway station|Visakhapatnam]] (VSKP)\n\n== Liveries ==\n\n* TNP: Light and dark blue bottom.

The class was manufactured till end of 2015. All the older locomotives built by DLW had regular WDM-2 type square short hood profile and control stand position. The [[Bogie|Bogies]] of WDM-2 have been replaced by High adhesion Fabricated bogies for better traction and Stability.\n\nThey are hugely successful with about 1163 units of this class have been produced.They can be found all over [[Indian Railways|India]] doing all kinds of duties like hauling freight and passenger service to [[Switcher|shunting]] and departmental works.\n\n=== WDM-7 ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-7}}\n[[File:WDM7 BioDiesel.JPG|left|thumb|238x238px|A [[Indian locomotive class WDM-7|WDM-7]] can be recognized by lack of grilles on the short hood]]\nThey are lower powered('''2000 hp instead of 2600 hp)''' version of the WDM-2.

A few were at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]] earlier but later all were transferred to [[Tondiarpet railway station|Tondiarpet]] seen shunting at Chennai Central or for light passenger haulage. Some are at the thermal power station, Chennai.\n\nThese Co-Co diesel-electrics were designed for branch-line duties (top speed 105 km/h). They have two 3-axle bogies and are similar to the WDM-2 in appearance. The power-pack is a 12-cylinder ALCO 251B unit. They were formerly housed at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Erode|Erode]] and [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] also. They are reliable and rugged locomotives even though low powered. They can be easily recognized by the lack of grilles on the short hood. Two locos are running on a mixture of bio-diesel and diesel.
