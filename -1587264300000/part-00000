The monastery itself contains an [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren|Evangelical seminary]] in the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberger tradition]] and a boarding school.\n\nAn average of 235,000 persons visit the monastery per annum.{{sfn|City of Maulbronn: Stadtgeschichte Maulbronn}}\n\n==History==\n{{Infobox former country\n|native_name=''Reichskloster Maulbronn''\n|conventional_long_name=Imperial Monastery of Maulbronn\n|status=Imperial Abbey\n|empire=Holy Roman Empire\n|event_start=Founded as [[Imperial abbey]]\n|date_start=1147\n|event1=Placed under Imperial [[Vogt|protection]]\n|date_event1=1156\n|event2=Seized by [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_event2=1504\n|event3=Monastery alternates between Protestantism and [[Cistercians]]\n|date_event3=1534\u20131651\n|event4=[[Peace of Westphalia]] settles monastery to Protestantism\n|date_event4=1648\n|event_end=[[German Mediatisation|Secularized]] to [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_end=1806\n|event_post=Seminary merged with that of [[Bebenhausen Abbey|Bebenhausen]]\n|date_post=1818\n|p1=Bishopric of Speyer\n|flag_p1=Coat of Arms of the Bishopric of Speyer.svg\n|s1=Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_s1=Flagge K\u00f6nigreich W\u00fcrttemberg.svg\n|image_coat=Wolleber Chorographia Mh6-1 0062 Wappen.jpg\n|image_map=KlosterMaulbronn.jpg\n}}\n\nAs early as 1138, the [[Cistercians]] had established a religious community in Eckenweihar (now [[Eckenweiler]]), a plot of land donated by a [[free knight]] named [[Walter von Lomersheim]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Milestones}} Twelve [[monks]] and an unspecified number of [[lay brothers]], from [[Neubourg Abbey]] in [[Alsace]],{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Eckenweiher}} arrived at Eckenweihar on 23 March 1138.{{sfn|Klunzinger|1854|p=12}} The site was soon abandoned, however, as it was found by the monks to have water and pasture space in poor quality and quantity.{{sfn|Gillich|2017|p=275}} {{ill|G\u00fcnther von Henneberg|de}}, [[Bishop of Speyer]], deeded the fiefdom of Mulinbrunn from [[Hirsau Abbey]] to the Eckenweihar community and moved the latter community there in 1147.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: WUB Band II, #355}}{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Maulbronn}}{{efn|While the move from Eckenweiler to [[Maulbronn]] occurred in 1147, the deed confirming the ceding of Maulbronn from [[Hirsau Abbey]] was crafted and confirmed a decade later.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: WUB Band II, #355}}}} Local legend tells that the Cistercians decided to use a [[mule]] to locate water, and built the monastery at its present location when it found water. The [[etymology]] of the name \"Mulenbrunnen,\" the root of [[Maulbronn]] (\"Maul\" is [[German language|German]] for \"[[Mule]]\"), reveals that the monastery was likely founded at the site of a spring and a [[watermill]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Founding Legend}}\n\n===Development===\nFrom 1156, the monastery was a [[Vogt#Holy Roman Empire|Vogtei]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was confirmed in 1332. However, the abbey continued chose to be under the protection of the [[List of bishops of Speyer|Bishop of Speyer]], who awarded the title as a sub-Vogt to his minister Heinrich von Enzberg, who would from 1236 appear in documentation as the protector of the abbey. Over the following decades, Maulbronn monastery would struggle, sometimes violently, with the {{ill|House of Enzberg|de|Enzberg (Adelsgeschlecht)|lt=von Enzbergs}} who tried to use their protection of the monastery to expand their own power base. From 1325 onward the [[Electoral Palatinate|Rhenish Palatine]] Counts were entrusted with the Vogt title.\n\nIn 1525, during the [[German Peasants' War]], the monastery was looted by rebel forces. Their leader, {{ill|J\u00e4cklein Rohrbach|de}}, stayed at Maulbronn for a time and complained to {{ill|Hans Wunderer|de}} of the disorganization of the peasant force who were unable to decide whether to demolish or ransom the abbey. Due to Rohrbach's intercession, Maulbronn Abbey still exists today.\n\nBecause the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg became Protestant, the monks of the abbey were no longer tolerated by the political authority of the state. The monastery was at first intended to be a collection monastery ({{lang-de|Sammelkloster}}) for retired monks from all the remaining monasteries in W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1537, the abbot and the convent moved to [[Pairis Abbey]] in [[Alsace]], the abbot died 1547 in [[Einsiedeln]]. After the defeat of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], Ulrich had to return the monastery to the Cistercians in 1546-47.\n\nThe [[Peace of Augsburg]] gave the Duke the right to decide on the faith of his subjects. In 1556 he issued the W\u00fcrttemberger Klosterordnung, a decree that would form the basis for a regulated education system in all the remaining monasteries for men in W\u00fcrttemberg. The conversion of the monastery into a school remained legally disputed for a long time, the Emperor trying twice to reverse this development. During the Interims from 1548\u20131555 and 1630\u20131649 due to the Imperial restitution edicts, monks could return to the monastery due to the temporary political situation of the time.\n\nThe possessions of the Abbey grew first and foremost through donations and endowments. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the abbey's possessions were realigned via purchase so as to make its boundaries more compact. At the end of this development, the monastery's possessions included 20 villages, called ''Klosterflecken''. Besides the income provided by the abbey's immediate surroundings, there were also [[cottage industries]] in [[Illingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Illingen]], [[Knittlingen]], and {{ill|Unter\u00f6wisheim|de}} and 6000 acres of forest, spread out over 25 villages, that were administered by the abbey. Land privileges were loaned out for additional income in addition to the tithe, giving the abbey enormous income as a result, illustrated by the size of the abbey's [[granary]]. To manage this income, the abbey had seven {{ill|Pfleghof|de|lt=Pflegh\u00f6fe}}, located in Illingen, [[Kirchheim am Neckar]], Knittlingen, [[\u00d6tisheim]], [[Speyer]], Unter\u00f6wisheim and [[Wiernsheim]].\n\n[[Ulrich, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]] became the owner of Maulbronn in 1504.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Refectories}} After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] began in the year 1517, Ulrich built his hunting lodge and stables here. The monastery was pillaged repeatedly: first by the knights under [[Franz von Sickingen]] in 1519, then again during the [[German Peasants' War]] six years later. In 1534, Duke Ulrich secularized the monastery, but the Cistercians regained control \u2014 and Imperial recognition \u2014 under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s [[Augsburg Interim]].\n\nIn 1556, [[Christoph, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], established a [[Protestant]] [[seminary]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Buildings}} with {{ill|Valentin Vannius|de}} becoming its first [[abbot]] two years later although the Reformation banned religious orders and abbots; [[Johannes Kepler]] studied there 1586\u201389.\n\nIn 1630, the abbey was returned to the Cistercians by force of arms, with Christoph Schaller von Sennheim becoming abbot. This restoration was short-lived, however, as [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] forced the monks to leave again two years later, with a Protestant abbot returning in 1633; the seminary reopened the following year, however the Cistercians under Schaller also returned in 1634. Under the [[Peace of Westphalia]], in 1648, the confession of the monastery was settled in favor of Protestantism; with abbot Buchinger withdrawing in process. A Protestant abbacy was re-established in 1651, with the seminary reopening five years later. In 1692, the seminarians were removed to safety when [[Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas, Comte de M\u00e9lac]], torched the school, which remained closed for a decade.\n\nThe monastery was secularized by King [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the course of the [[German Mediatisation]] in 1807, forever removing its political quasi-independence; the seminary merged with that of [[Bebenhausen Abbey|Bebenhausen]] the following year, now known as the [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren]].\n\nThe monastery, which features prominently in [[Hermann Hesse]]'s novel ''[[Beneath the Wheel]]'', was inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1993. The justification for the inscription was as follows: \"The Maulbronn complex is the most complete survival of a Cistercian monastic establishment in Europe, in particular because of the survival of its extensive water-management system of reservoirs and channels\". Hesse himself attended the seminary before fleeing in 1891 after a suicide attempt, and a failed attempt to save Hesse from his personal religious crisis by a well-known theologian and faith healer.\n\nThe Paradise and the fountain in the lavatorium appear on the 2013 [[German euro coins#\u20ac2 commemorative coins|German Bundesl\u00e4nder series]] 2 euro coin.{{sfn|European Union Journal, 28 December 2013}} 30 million of these coins were minted in [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Karlsruhe]], and [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: 2-Euro Coin}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Lageplan Kloster Maulbronn.png|thumb|right|alt=This is a map of the monastery complex|Map of the monastery complex]]\n\nMaulbronn was constructed in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: History of Design}} then native to Swabia. Motifs of the \"[[Hirsau Abbey|Hirsau]] style\" are uniform pillars and the rectangular frames around the Romanesque arches, as at Maulbronn. Near the end of the 12th century the architecture of the [[Cistercians]] became influenced by [[Gothic architecture]], which required less stone than the Romanesque style, and the order began disseminating it from northeastern [[France]]. An anonymous architect trained in [[Paris]] erected the first example of Gothic architecture in [[Germany]] at Maulbronn's [[narthex]], the southern portion of its [[cloister]], and the monks' [[refectory]].{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|pp=77, 78\u201379}}{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: World Heritage Site}} The Late Gothic came to Maulbronn from the late 13th century to the mid-14th century, and again in the [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] era of the late 19th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: History of Design}}\n\nAlthough little of the 12th century work, such as the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] and its original doors, have been preserved,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: History of Design}} the monastery as a whole survives due mostly to the [[Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg]], who obtained ownership of it in the 16th century.{{sfn|Jeep|2001|p=508}} The architectural history of the complex is still not fully understood.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}}\n\n===Water system===\nAs was customary with Cistercian monasteries,{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=69}} Maulbronn stands on top of a sophisticated water management system.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Kloster Maulbronn}} By draining the wetlands around the monastery and digging a series of canals,{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=69}} the monks created some 20 ponds and lakes. A local stream, the Salzach, was diverted to flow under the monastery to form its [[sewerage]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Water Management}} The water levels in these lakes could be controlled, allowing Maulbronn's monks to power their [[Watermill|mill]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Surrounding Area}} but also to raise fish and [[eels]] for consumption or [[commerce]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fish Farming}}{{efn|[[Cistercians]] were forbidden from eating meat, but consuming fish was allowable as they were classified as \"river vegetables.\" Maulbronn's monks raised fish, most notably the [[mirror carp]], in different bodies of water depending on their species, size, and age, then sold them to surrounding communities.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fish Farming}}}} In one of these ponds, the [[Aalkistensee]], the monks could raise up to 5000 carp.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Cookbook}} Much of the system remains in use and is part of Maulbronn's [[UNESCO]] inscription.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Water Management}}{{sfn|UNESCO: Maulbronn Monastery Complex}} The water system has been the subject of study for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's {{ill|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Office for the Preservation of Monuments|de|Landesamt f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|lt=Office for the Preservation of Monuments}} since 1989.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: UNESCO-Welterbest\u00e4tte Kloster Maulbronn}}\n\n==Monastery complex==\n[[File:Maulbronn Kloster - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of the gate (left of center, background) and flanking buildings. The closest, on the right, is the Fr\u00fchmesserhaus.|Entrance area, western courtyard]]\n\nThe monastery was protected by stone wall, a [[drawbridge]] gate, and five towers.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=75}} The complex is still entered through the gatehouse, at its southwest corner, though the drawbridge is no longer present. The [[half-timber]] building on the back of the gatehouse was built around 1600, and the present roof is Baroque, built in 1751. Just behind the gatehouse is another the [[pharmacy]], originally an [[inn]] and also built in the Baroque style. Also attached to the old pharmacy is the Fr\u00fchmesserhaus (Early morning house), residence of the monk responsible for early morning mass for monastery guests.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: West Entrance}} The interior of the building is divided into a large, open fireplace and the entrance hall.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kitchens}} Also attached to the old pharmacy is a 19th century [[carriage house]], now a museum, standing on top of a chapel built around 1480. The foundation for the choir of this chapel are still extant behind the carriage house, as are the remains of a Romanesque gate demolished in 1813. The [[lead pipe]] in the locality suggests that there used to be a [[well]] in the area.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: West Entrance}} East of the gate is the Fruchtkasten, today a concert hall. It was built in the 13th century and then totally rebuilt and enlarged in 1580 for the storage and use of wine-making equipment.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Courtyard and Outbuildings}}\n\nTo the north of the gate is the monastery's administrative and economic buildings. Along the western wall of the monastery are what used to be the blacksmithy [[wheelwright]]'s workshop. East of the blacksmithy is the former [[mews]], which has been [[Maulbronn]]'s [[city hall]] since the early 19th century. The building was converted in 1600 from its original Gothic appearance into the present [[Renaissance style]] structure. Just north of the city hall is the Haberkasten, used as a [[granary]], and adjacent to that is the workplace and residence of the monastery's chief baker. Finally, there are three half-timber buildings. The first is the Speisemeisterei, next to the sawmill, and the third is the Bursarium, built in 1742 as the cemetery office but used as a [[police station]] and [[notary]] as of 2019. The middle building, built in 1550, was a servant's quarters and is now an Italian restaurant.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Courtyard and Outbuildings}}\n\n[[File:Kloster-Maulbronn-Schloss.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Louis III]]'s hunting lodge.]]\n\nThe Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg came to own Maulbronn in 1504.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Refectories}} In 1588, [[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Louis III]] built a ''[[lustschloss]]'' over the cellar of an earlier building, likely the abbot's residence. During the existence of the {{ill|Oberamt Maulbronn|de}}, Louis III's ''lustschloss'' was its administrative office. Nearby are the ruins of the Pfr\u00fcndhaus, where donors who had bought a life pension from the monastery resided. The building was erected in 1430 and used as a [[poorhouse]] in the 19th century until it was destroyed by fire in January 1892.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Eastern Courtyard}} In the southeast corner of the complex is the Faustturm, the tower where [[Faust]] is alleged to have lived while staying at the monastery in 1516.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Doctor Faustus}}\n\nTo operate their monasteries the Cistercian Order was allowed to own property such as bodies of water, vineyards, and forests. At the beginning of the 12th century, 17 [[monastic grange]]s surrounded Maulbronn, operated by [[lay brothers]]. Also nearby is a portion of the [[Eppingen lines]] built by [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] from 1695 to 1697.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Surrounding Area}}\n\nThe gardens around the monastery, in its cloister and east of the church, grew fruits and medicinal herbs.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Gardens}}\n\n===Abbey===\n[[File:08 Maulbronn 00.02 Lage 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Map of the monastery engraved on a metal plaque|Plan of the monastery.

This was so even in the church,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}} which is divided into sections for the former and the latter by a choir wall. There are two [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciboriums]], decorated with toads, lizards, and [[Memento mori|skulls]] and a number of medieval works on both sides of the choir wall.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Monastery Church}} In front of this wall on the lay brother's side is a large image of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ crucified]], carved around 1473 from a single block of stone.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Crucifix}} At the end of the lay brother's section is the organ, installed by {{ill|Gerhard Grenzing|de}} in 2013.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Grenzing Organ}} In the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] is a [[Madonna and Child]], the ''Maulbronner Madonna'', crafted somewhere between 1307 and 1317.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Madonna}} In the [[chancel]] below is a set of 15th century of choir stalls and abbot's chair to seat 92 monks. They were carved by an unknown master, possibly [[Hans Multscher]], who covered them in biblical scenes and mythical creatures.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Choir Stalls}} The [[frescoes]] within the church depict the [[Adoration of the Magi]], the entrance of Maulbronn's founder [[Walter von Lomersheim]] into the monastery as a lay brother. Also present are the [[coats of arms]] of nobles who donated to the monastery's construction.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=81}} The donor chapels and vaulted Gothic roof, replacing the original flat and timber roof, were added when the church was renovated in the late 15th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Monastery Church}} The [[altar]], likely of South German make, depicts the [[Passion of Jesus]] was once gilded and painted. Those pieces of the set that remain have since 1978 sat on a standstone slab in the chapel.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: High altar reliefs}}\n\nThe church's narthex is Germany's oldest example of Gothic architecture \u2013 the \"Paradise\",{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=79}} built around 1220. The portal into the lay brothers' church contain the oldest datable doors in Germany, fashioned from [[fir wood]] in 1178. The door was decorated with wrought iron and parchment that would have been glued onto the door and painted red.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Paradise}} Immediately north of the abbey church is the cloister, the southern portion of which was built by the Master of the Paradise's workshop from 1210 to 1220.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Cloister}} Lay brothers could enter or leave the cloister from a corridor on its west side.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}} This leads to a flight of stairs to the lay brothers' dormitory, and the lay refectory on the ground floor. The [[groin vaults]] are supported by seven slender double-column pillars installed in 1869.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Refectories}} Opposite the corridor to the cloister from the lay refectory is the [[cellarium]], now a display of stonemasonry paraphernalia.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}}\n\nOn the north side of the cloister is the [[lavatorium]], where monks washed before meals and for [[Ablution in Christianity|ablution]]. The majority of the fountain within dates to 1878; only the base bowl is original. The five Gothic windows were added from 1340 to 1350 and the half-timber structure above the lavatorium was built around 1611 in a style similar to that of {{ill|Heinrich Schickhardt|de}}.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fountain House}} The vaults of the lavatorium were painted with a depiction of Maulbronn's founding myth.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Founding Legend}} Across from the fountain house is the monks' refectory,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fountain House}} where the full brothers ate their meals and listened to a reading of the [[Bible]]. This building was possibly also built by the Master of the Paradise, as evidenced by the Early Gothic elements of its interior. The ribbing of the vaults was painted red in the 16th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Refectories}} The kitchen that supplied the two refectories is located between them, but arranged such to keep smoke and odors away from the rest of the monastery.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kitchens}}\n\nAlthough the Cistercian Order banned heated rooms,{{sfn|Jeep|2001|p=508}} Maulbronn has a [[calefactory]] that was heated by lighting a fire in a vaulted chamber underneath the calefactory. Smoke was funneled outside and the heat rose into the calefactory through the 20 holes in its floor.{{sfn|Kinder|2002|p=279}} It was the only heated room in the monastery.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}}\n\n[[File:Kloster Maulbronn - panoramio - Andy Mendyk (2).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Panoramic photograph of the chapter house, east wall|Chapter house, east wall]]\n\nAttached to the center of the eastern side of the cloister is the [[chapter house]]. Three pillars hold up the room's [[Lierne (vault)|star vault]], capped with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]] depicting the [[Four Evangelists]], the [[Lamb of God]], and an [[Angels in Christianity|angel]] blowing a trumpet.

The connecting building is decorated with a mural depicting [[Benedict of Nursia]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] kneeling before the [[Virgin Mary]]. From the symbolism, it is thought this space was used as a Marian chapel, a [[scriptorium]], or a [[library]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Cloister}} After Maulbronn's acquisition by the Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg, the hospital was renovated as the abbot's residence and gained its name from the abbot's title, \"Ephorus\".{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Eastern Courtyard}}\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Model of Maulbronn Monastery Complex - Maulbronn - Germany 2017.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Pictured here is a scale model of the monastery complex|Scale model of the monastery complex in the monastery museum]]\n\nThe [[Cooper (profession)|cooperage]], near the gatehouse, is the visitor center.

The monastery complex is one of the best-preserved in Europe. The monastery's narthex, called \"the Paradise\", is the oldest example of [[Gothic architecture]] in [[Germany]].\n\nIt is part of the [[Northern Black Forest]] Monastery Route with [[Alpirsbach Abbey|Alpirsbach]], [[Hirsau Abbey|Hirsau]], and {{ill|Reuthin Abbey|de|Kloster Reuthin|lt=Reuthin}} monasteries.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Klosterroute Nordschwarzwald}}\n\nThe complex, surrounded by turreted walls and a tower gate, today houses the Maulbronn town hall and other administrative offices, a police station, and several restaurants. The monastery itself contains an [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren|Evangelical seminary]] in the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberger tradition]] and a boarding school.\n\nAn average of 235,000 persons visit the monastery per annum.{{sfn|City of Maulbronn: Stadtgeschichte Maulbronn}}\n\n==History==\n{{Infobox former country\n|native_name=''Reichskloster Maulbronn''\n|conventional_long_name=Imperial Monastery of Maulbronn\n|status=Imperial Abbey\n|empire=Holy Roman Empire\n|event_start=Founded as [[Imperial abbey]]\n|date_start=1147\n|event1=Placed under Imperial [[Vogt|protection]]\n|date_event1=1156\n|event2=Seized by [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_event2=1504\n|event3=Monastery alternates between Protestantism and [[Cistercians]]\n|date_event3=1534\u20131651\n|event4=[[Peace of Westphalia]] settles monastery to Protestantism\n|date_event4=1648\n|event_end=[[German Mediatisation|Secularized]] to [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_end=1806\n|event_post=Seminary merged with that of [[Bebenhausen Abbey|Bebenhausen]]\n|date_post=1818\n|p1=Bishopric of Speyer\n|flag_p1=Coat of Arms of the Bishopric of Speyer.svg\n|s1=Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_s1=Flagge K\u00f6nigreich W\u00fcrttemberg.svg\n|image_coat=Wolleber Chorographia Mh6-1 0062 Wappen.jpg\n|image_map=KlosterMaulbronn.jpg\n}}\n\nAs early as 1138, the [[Cistercians]] had established a religious community in Eckenweihar (now [[Eckenweiler]]), a plot of land donated by a [[free knight]] named [[Walter von Lomersheim]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Milestones}} Twelve [[monks]] and an unspecified number of [[lay brothers]], from [[Neubourg Abbey]] in [[Alsace]],{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Eckenweiher}} arrived at Eckenweihar on 23 March 1138.{{sfn|Klunzinger|1854|p=12}} The site was soon abandoned, however, as it was found by the monks to have water and pasture space in poor quality and quantity.{{sfn|Gillich|2017|p=275}} {{ill|G\u00fcnther von Henneberg|de}}, [[Bishop of Speyer]], deeded the fiefdom of Mulinbrunn from [[Hirsau Abbey]] to the Eckenweihar community and moved the latter community there in 1147.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: WUB Band II, #355}}{{sfn|Kl\u00f6ster in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Maulbronn}}{{efn|While the move from Eckenweiler to [[Maulbronn]] occurred in 1147, the deed confirming the ceding of Maulbronn from [[Hirsau Abbey]] was crafted and confirmed a decade later.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Archive: WUB Band II, #355}}}} Local legend tells that the Cistercians decided to use a [[mule]] to locate water, and built the monastery at its present location when it found water. The [[etymology]] of the name \"Mulenbrunnen,\" the root of [[Maulbronn]] (\"Maul\" is [[German language|German]] for \"[[Mule]]\"), reveals that the monastery was likely founded at the site of a spring and a [[watermill]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Founding Legend}}\n\n===Development===\nFrom 1156, the monastery was a [[Vogt#Holy Roman Empire|Vogtei]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was confirmed in 1332. However, the abbey continued chose to be under the protection of the [[List of bishops of Speyer|Bishop of Speyer]], who awarded the title as a sub-Vogt to his minister Heinrich von Enzberg, who would from 1236 appear in documentation as the protector of the abbey. Over the following decades, Maulbronn monastery would struggle, sometimes violently, with the {{ill|House of Enzberg|de|Enzberg (Adelsgeschlecht)|lt=von Enzbergs}} who tried to use their protection of the monastery to expand their own power base. From 1325 onward the [[Electoral Palatinate|Rhenish Palatine]] Counts were entrusted with the Vogt title.\n\nIn 1525, during the [[German Peasants' War]], the monastery was looted by rebel forces. Their leader, {{ill|J\u00e4cklein Rohrbach|de}}, stayed at Maulbronn for a time and complained to {{ill|Hans Wunderer|de}} of the disorganization of the peasant force who were unable to decide whether to demolish or ransom the abbey. Due to Rohrbach's intercession, Maulbronn Abbey still exists today.\n\nBecause the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg became Protestant, the monks of the abbey were no longer tolerated by the political authority of the state. The monastery was at first intended to be a collection monastery ({{lang-de|Sammelkloster}}) for retired monks from all the remaining monasteries in W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1537, the abbot and the convent moved to [[Pairis Abbey]] in [[Alsace]], the abbot died 1547 in [[Einsiedeln]]. After the defeat of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], Ulrich had to return the monastery to the Cistercians in 1546-47.\n\nThe [[Peace of Augsburg]] gave the Duke the right to decide on the faith of his subjects. In 1556 he issued the W\u00fcrttemberger Klosterordnung, a decree that would form the basis for a regulated education system in all the remaining monasteries for men in W\u00fcrttemberg. The conversion of the monastery into a school remained legally disputed for a long time, the Emperor trying twice to reverse this development. During the Interims from 1548\u20131555 and 1630\u20131649 due to the Imperial restitution edicts, monks could return to the monastery due to the temporary political situation of the time.\n\nThe possessions of the Abbey grew first and foremost through donations and endowments. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the abbey's possessions were realigned via purchase so as to make its boundaries more compact. At the end of this development, the monastery's possessions included 20 villages, called ''Klosterflecken''. Besides the income provided by the abbey's immediate surroundings, there were also [[cottage industries]] in [[Illingen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Illingen]], [[Knittlingen]], and {{ill|Unter\u00f6wisheim|de}} and 6000 acres of forest, spread out over 25 villages, that were administered by the abbey. Land privileges were loaned out for additional income in addition to the tithe, giving the abbey enormous income as a result, illustrated by the size of the abbey's [[granary]]. To manage this income, the abbey had seven {{ill|Pfleghof|de|lt=Pflegh\u00f6fe}}, located in Illingen, [[Kirchheim am Neckar]], Knittlingen, [[\u00d6tisheim]], [[Speyer]], Unter\u00f6wisheim and [[Wiernsheim]].\n\n[[Ulrich, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]] became the owner of Maulbronn in 1504.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Refectories}} After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] began in the year 1517, Ulrich built his hunting lodge and stables here. The monastery was pillaged repeatedly: first by the knights under [[Franz von Sickingen]] in 1519, then again during the [[German Peasants' War]] six years later. In 1534, Duke Ulrich secularized the monastery, but the Cistercians regained control \u2014 and Imperial recognition \u2014 under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s [[Augsburg Interim]].\n\nIn 1556, [[Christoph, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], established a [[Protestant]] [[seminary]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Buildings}} with {{ill|Valentin Vannius|de}} becoming its first [[abbot]] two years later although the Reformation banned religious orders and abbots; [[Johannes Kepler]] studied there 1586\u201389.\n\nIn 1630, the abbey was returned to the Cistercians by force of arms, with Christoph Schaller von Sennheim becoming abbot. This restoration was short-lived, however, as [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] forced the monks to leave again two years later, with a Protestant abbot returning in 1633; the seminary reopened the following year, however the Cistercians under Schaller also returned in 1634. Under the [[Peace of Westphalia]], in 1648, the confession of the monastery was settled in favor of Protestantism; with abbot Buchinger withdrawing in process. A Protestant abbacy was re-established in 1651, with the seminary reopening five years later. In 1692, the seminarians were removed to safety when [[Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas, Comte de M\u00e9lac]], torched the school, which remained closed for a decade.\n\nThe monastery was secularized by King [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the course of the [[German Mediatisation]] in 1807, forever removing its political quasi-independence; the seminary merged with that of [[Bebenhausen Abbey|Bebenhausen]] the following year, now known as the [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren]].\n\nThe monastery, which features prominently in [[Hermann Hesse]]'s novel ''[[Beneath the Wheel]]'', was inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1993. The justification for the inscription was as follows: \"The Maulbronn complex is the most complete survival of a Cistercian monastic establishment in Europe, in particular because of the survival of its extensive water-management system of reservoirs and channels\". Hesse himself attended the seminary before fleeing in 1891 after a suicide attempt, and a failed attempt to save Hesse from his personal religious crisis by a well-known theologian and faith healer.\n\nThe Paradise and the fountain in the lavatorium appear on the 2013 [[German euro coins#\u20ac2 commemorative coins|German Bundesl\u00e4nder series]] 2 euro coin.{{sfn|European Union Journal, 28 December 2013}} 30 million of these coins were minted in [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Karlsruhe]], and [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: 2-Euro Coin}}\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Lageplan Kloster Maulbronn.png|thumb|right|alt=This is a map of the monastery complex|Map of the monastery complex]]\n\nMaulbronn was constructed in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: History of Design}} then native to Swabia. Motifs of the \"[[Hirsau Abbey|Hirsau]] style\" are uniform pillars and the rectangular frames around the Romanesque arches, as at Maulbronn. Near the end of the 12th century the architecture of the [[Cistercians]] became influenced by [[Gothic architecture]], which required less stone than the Romanesque style, and the order began disseminating it from northeastern [[France]]. An anonymous architect trained in [[Paris]] erected the first example of Gothic architecture in [[Germany]] at Maulbronn's [[narthex]], the southern portion of its [[cloister]], and the monks' [[refectory]].{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|pp=77, 78\u201379}}{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: World Heritage Site}} The Late Gothic came to Maulbronn from the late 13th century to the mid-14th century, and again in the [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] era of the late 19th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: History of Design}}\n\nAlthough little of the 12th century work, such as the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] and its original doors, have been preserved,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: History of Design}} the monastery as a whole survives due mostly to the [[Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg]], who obtained ownership of it in the 16th century.{{sfn|Jeep|2001|p=508}} The architectural history of the complex is still not fully understood.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}}\n\n===Water system===\nAs was customary with Cistercian monasteries,{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=69}} Maulbronn stands on top of a sophisticated water management system.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: Kloster Maulbronn}} By draining the wetlands around the monastery and digging a series of canals,{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=69}} the monks created some 20 ponds and lakes. A local stream, the Salzach, was diverted to flow under the monastery to form its [[sewerage]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Water Management}} The water levels in these lakes could be controlled, allowing Maulbronn's monks to power their [[Watermill|mill]],{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Surrounding Area}} but also to raise fish and [[eels]] for consumption or [[commerce]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fish Farming}}{{efn|[[Cistercians]] were forbidden from eating meat, but consuming fish was allowable as they were classified as \"river vegetables.\" Maulbronn's monks raised fish, most notably the [[mirror carp]], in different bodies of water depending on their species, size, and age, then sold them to surrounding communities.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fish Farming}}}} In one of these ponds, the [[Aalkistensee]], the monks could raise up to 5000 carp.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Cookbook}} Much of the system remains in use and is part of Maulbronn's [[UNESCO]] inscription.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Water Management}}{{sfn|UNESCO: Maulbronn Monastery Complex}} The water system has been the subject of study for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's {{ill|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Office for the Preservation of Monuments|de|Landesamt f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|lt=Office for the Preservation of Monuments}} since 1989.{{sfn|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: UNESCO-Welterbest\u00e4tte Kloster Maulbronn}}\n\n==Monastery complex==\n[[File:Maulbronn Kloster - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of the gate (left of center, background) and flanking buildings. The closest, on the right, is the Fr\u00fchmesserhaus.|Entrance area, western courtyard]]\n\nThe monastery was protected by stone wall, a [[drawbridge]] gate, and five towers.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=75}} The complex is still entered through the gatehouse, at its southwest corner, though the drawbridge is no longer present. The [[half-timber]] building on the back of the gatehouse was built around 1600, and the present roof is Baroque, built in 1751. Just behind the gatehouse is another the [[pharmacy]], originally an [[inn]] and also built in the Baroque style. Also attached to the old pharmacy is the Fr\u00fchmesserhaus (Early morning house), residence of the monk responsible for early morning mass for monastery guests.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: West Entrance}} The interior of the building is divided into a large, open fireplace and the entrance hall.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kitchens}} Also attached to the old pharmacy is a 19th century [[carriage house]], now a museum, standing on top of a chapel built around 1480. The foundation for the choir of this chapel are still extant behind the carriage house, as are the remains of a Romanesque gate demolished in 1813. The [[lead pipe]] in the locality suggests that there used to be a [[well]] in the area.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: West Entrance}} East of the gate is the Fruchtkasten, today a concert hall. It was built in the 13th century and then totally rebuilt and enlarged in 1580 for the storage and use of wine-making equipment.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Courtyard and Outbuildings}}\n\nTo the north of the gate is the monastery's administrative and economic buildings. Along the western wall of the monastery are what used to be the blacksmithy [[wheelwright]]'s workshop. East of the blacksmithy is the former [[mews]], which has been [[Maulbronn]]'s [[city hall]] since the early 19th century. The building was converted in 1600 from its original Gothic appearance into the present [[Renaissance style]] structure. Just north of the city hall is the Haberkasten, used as a [[granary]], and adjacent to that is the workplace and residence of the monastery's chief baker. Finally, there are three half-timber buildings. The first is the Speisemeisterei, next to the sawmill, and the third is the Bursarium, built in 1742 as the cemetery office but used as a [[police station]] and [[notary]] as of 2019. The middle building, built in 1550, was a servant's quarters and is now an Italian restaurant.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Courtyard and Outbuildings}}\n\n[[File:Kloster-Maulbronn-Schloss.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Louis III]]'s hunting lodge.]]\n\nThe Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg came to own Maulbronn in 1504.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Refectories}} In 1588, [[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Louis III]] built a ''[[lustschloss]]'' over the cellar of an earlier building, likely the abbot's residence. During the existence of the {{ill|Oberamt Maulbronn|de}}, Louis III's ''lustschloss'' was its administrative office. Nearby are the ruins of the Pfr\u00fcndhaus, where donors who had bought a life pension from the monastery resided. The building was erected in 1430 and used as a [[poorhouse]] in the 19th century until it was destroyed by fire in January 1892.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Eastern Courtyard}} In the southeast corner of the complex is the Faustturm, the tower where [[Faust]] is alleged to have lived while staying at the monastery in 1516.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Doctor Faustus}}\n\nTo operate their monasteries the Cistercian Order was allowed to own property such as bodies of water, vineyards, and forests. At the beginning of the 12th century, 17 [[monastic grange]]s surrounded Maulbronn, operated by [[lay brothers]]. Also nearby is a portion of the [[Eppingen lines]] built by [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] from 1695 to 1697.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Surrounding Area}}\n\nThe gardens around the monastery, in its cloister and east of the church, grew fruits and medicinal herbs.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Gardens}}\n\n===Abbey===\n[[File:08 Maulbronn 00.02 Lage 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Map of the monastery engraved on a metal plaque|Plan of the monastery.

[[Hospital]]]]\n\nAt the center of the monastery complex is the abbey, where the monks and lay brothers lived and prayed. The monastery had strict divisions between the two groups. This was so even in the church,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}} which is divided into sections for the former and the latter by a choir wall. There are two [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciboriums]], decorated with toads, lizards, and [[Memento mori|skulls]] and a number of medieval works on both sides of the choir wall.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Monastery Church}} In front of this wall on the lay brother's side is a large image of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ crucified]], carved around 1473 from a single block of stone.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Crucifix}} At the end of the lay brother's section is the organ, installed by {{ill|Gerhard Grenzing|de}} in 2013.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Grenzing Organ}} In the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] is a [[Madonna and Child]], the ''Maulbronner Madonna'', crafted somewhere between 1307 and 1317.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Madonna}} In the [[chancel]] below is a set of 15th century of choir stalls and abbot's chair to seat 92 monks. They were carved by an unknown master, possibly [[Hans Multscher]], who covered them in biblical scenes and mythical creatures.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Choir Stalls}} The [[frescoes]] within the church depict the [[Adoration of the Magi]], the entrance of Maulbronn's founder [[Walter von Lomersheim]] into the monastery as a lay brother. Also present are the [[coats of arms]] of nobles who donated to the monastery's construction.{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=81}} The donor chapels and vaulted Gothic roof, replacing the original flat and timber roof, were added when the church was renovated in the late 15th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Monastery Church}} The [[altar]], likely of South German make, depicts the [[Passion of Jesus]] was once gilded and painted. Those pieces of the set that remain have since 1978 sat on a standstone slab in the chapel.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: High altar reliefs}}\n\nThe church's narthex is Germany's oldest example of Gothic architecture \u2013 the \"Paradise\",{{sfn|Burton|Kerr|2011|p=79}} built around 1220. The portal into the lay brothers' church contain the oldest datable doors in Germany, fashioned from [[fir wood]] in 1178. The door was decorated with wrought iron and parchment that would have been glued onto the door and painted red.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Paradise}} Immediately north of the abbey church is the cloister, the southern portion of which was built by the Master of the Paradise's workshop from 1210 to 1220.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Cloister}} Lay brothers could enter or leave the cloister from a corridor on its west side.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}} This leads to a flight of stairs to the lay brothers' dormitory, and the lay refectory on the ground floor. The [[groin vaults]] are supported by seven slender double-column pillars installed in 1869.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Refectories}} Opposite the corridor to the cloister from the lay refectory is the [[cellarium]], now a display of stonemasonry paraphernalia.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}}\n\nOn the north side of the cloister is the [[lavatorium]], where monks washed before meals and for [[Ablution in Christianity|ablution]]. The majority of the fountain within dates to 1878; only the base bowl is original. The five Gothic windows were added from 1340 to 1350 and the half-timber structure above the lavatorium was built around 1611 in a style similar to that of {{ill|Heinrich Schickhardt|de}}.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fountain House}} The vaults of the lavatorium were painted with a depiction of Maulbronn's founding myth.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Founding Legend}} Across from the fountain house is the monks' refectory,{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Fountain House}} where the full brothers ate their meals and listened to a reading of the [[Bible]]. This building was possibly also built by the Master of the Paradise, as evidenced by the Early Gothic elements of its interior. The ribbing of the vaults was painted red in the 16th century.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Refectories}} The kitchen that supplied the two refectories is located between them, but arranged such to keep smoke and odors away from the rest of the monastery.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Kitchens}}\n\nAlthough the Cistercian Order banned heated rooms,{{sfn|Jeep|2001|p=508}} Maulbronn has a [[calefactory]] that was heated by lighting a fire in a vaulted chamber underneath the calefactory. Smoke was funneled outside and the heat rose into the calefactory through the 20 holes in its floor.{{sfn|Kinder|2002|p=279}} It was the only heated room in the monastery.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Hermitage and Church}}\n\n[[File:Kloster Maulbronn - panoramio - Andy Mendyk (2).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Panoramic photograph of the chapter house, east wall|Chapter house, east wall]]\n\nAttached to the center of the eastern side of the cloister is the [[chapter house]]. Three pillars hold up the room's [[Lierne (vault)|star vault]], capped with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]] depicting the [[Four Evangelists]], the [[Lamb of God]], and an [[Angels in Christianity|angel]] blowing a trumpet. Beneath these, and the frescoes painted in 1517, monks met and could break their vowed silence to discuss goings-on.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Chapter House}}\n\nA staircase on the east side of the cloister leads to the monks' dormitory.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Cloister}}\n\nA corridor on the eastern side of the cloister goes to a Late Gothic connecting building, built by lay brother Conrad von Schmie, leading to the monastery hospital, the Ephorat. The connecting building is decorated with a mural depicting [[Benedict of Nursia]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] kneeling before the [[Virgin Mary]]. From the symbolism, it is thought this space was used as a Marian chapel, a [[scriptorium]], or a [[library]].{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Cloister}} After Maulbronn's acquisition by the Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg, the hospital was renovated as the abbot's residence and gained its name from the abbot's title, \"Ephorus\".{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Eastern Courtyard}}\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Model of Maulbronn Monastery Complex - Maulbronn - Germany 2017.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Pictured here is a scale model of the monastery complex|Scale model of the monastery complex in the monastery museum]]\n\nThe [[Cooper (profession)|cooperage]], near the gatehouse, is the visitor center. On the ground floor is a [[diorama]] of the monastery complex and on the second floor is a museum room detailing post-monastic life at Maulbronn. The nearby Fr\u00fchmesserhaus displays a three-panel display made by the monks of Maulbronn documenting its foundation and attached circumstances.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Monastery Museums}}{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Founders Panel}}\n\nWithin the monastery complex is a three-part literary museum, \"Besuchen-Bilden-Schreiben\",{{sfn|City of Maulbronn: Besuchen-Bilden-Schreiben}} operated by the state of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The first of these, \"Visit\" exhibits Maulbronn's image in literature. Next is \"Learn\", dedicated to the monastery's use as a Protestant seminary and with a focus on notable alumni such as [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin]], and [[Herman Hesse]]. Finally, \"Write\" showcases the works of the monks at Maulbronn and a library spanning 800 years and 50 writers.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Literary Museum}}\n\nThe cellarium, in the monastery proper, is a [[lapidarium]] and exhibit detailing the construction methods used at Maulbronn.{{sfn|Maulbronn Monastery: Monastery Museums}}\n\n{{Panorama|image=File:MaulbronnPanorama.jpg|height=150px|caption=Panorama photograph of Maulbronn Monastery's western courtyard, facing the abbey}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commonscat|Maulbronn Monastery complex}}\n* [[Gothic architecture]]\n* [[Romanesque architecture]]\n* [[Salem Abbey]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Janet B.|last2=Kerr|first2=Julie|title=The Cistercians in the Middle Ages|volume=Volume 4|series=Monastic orders|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Boydell Press|date=2011|isbn=9781843836674|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adHIaVe-zBgC|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Gillich|first=Ante|title=Das Wassersystem des Klosters Maulbronn: Ein Projekt zur Bestandserfassung mit hochaufgel\u00f6sten Laserscandaten|language=de|url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/nbdpfbw/article/view/42796|journal={{ill|Journal for the Preservation of Monuments in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|de|Denkmalpflege in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg}}|year=2017|ref=harv|access-date=2019-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212015543/https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/nbdpfbw/article/view/42796|archive-date=2020-02-12|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780824076443|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4uHav3mZLsC&|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Kinder|first=Terryl M.|title=Cistercian Europe: Architecture of Contemplation|year=2002|publisher=Wm.

Most Jamaicans are of African descent, with minorities of Europeans, East Indians, Chinese, Middle Eastern and others or mixed ancestry. The bulk of the Jamaican diaspora resides in other [[Anglophone countries]], namely [[Jamaican Australians|Australia]], [[Jamaican Canadians|Canada]], [[Jamaican Americans|United States]] and the [[British Jamaican|United Kingdom]] and, to a lesser extent, other [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean countries]] and [[Commonwealth realms]]. Outside of Anglophone countries, the largest Jamaican diaspora community lives in [[Costa Rica]], where Jamaicans make up a significant percentage of the population.\n\nAccording to the official Jamaica Population Census of 1970, ethnic origins categories in Jamaica include: [[Afro-Jamaican|Black]]; [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]]; Mixed; [[Indo-Jamaicans|East Indian]]; [[White Jamaicans|White]]; and 'Other' (e.g.: Syrian or [[Lebanese Jamaicans|Lebanese]]).<ref>[https://issuu.com/digjamaica/docs/1_pdfsam_general_report_census_2011/112?ff 2011 Census of Population & Housing], Population by sex and Ethnic Origin by Parish (Page: 72) - Jamaica</ref>\n\nJamaicans of African or partial African descent made up 89.4% of the working population.

Most Jamaicans are of African descent, with minorities of Europeans, East Indians, Chinese, Middle Eastern and others or mixed ancestry. The bulk of the Jamaican diaspora resides in other [[Anglophone countries]], namely [[Jamaican Australians|Australia]], [[Jamaican Canadians|Canada]], [[Jamaican Americans|United States]] and the [[British Jamaican|United Kingdom]] and, to a lesser extent, other [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean countries]] and [[Commonwealth realms]]. Outside of Anglophone countries, the largest Jamaican diaspora community lives in [[Costa Rica]], where Jamaicans make up a significant percentage of the population.\n\nAccording to the official Jamaica Population Census of 1970, ethnic origins categories in Jamaica include: [[Afro-Jamaican|Black]]; [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]]; Mixed; [[Indo-Jamaicans|East Indian]]; [[White Jamaicans|White]]; and 'Other' (e.g.: Syrian or [[Lebanese Jamaicans|Lebanese]]).<ref>[https://issuu.com/digjamaica/docs/1_pdfsam_general_report_census_2011/112?ff 2011 Census of Population & Housing], Population by sex and Ethnic Origin by Parish (Page: 72) - Jamaica</ref>\n\nJamaicans of African or partial African descent made up 89.4% of the working population.

BSCP members such as [[Edgar Nixon|E. D. Nixon]] were among the leadership of local desegregation movements by virtue of their organizing experience, constant movement between communities, and freedom from economic dependence on local authorities.\n\n==The Pullman Company==\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the [[Pullman Company]] was one of the largest single employers of black people<ref name=\":0\" /> and had created an image for itself of enlightened benevolence via financial support for black churches, newspapers, and other organizations.  It also paid many porters well enough to have a middle-income lifestyle and prominence within their own communities.\n\nWorking for the Pullman Company was, however, less glamorous than the image the company promoted. Porters depended on tips for much of their income and thus on the generosity of white passengers who often referred to all porters as \"George\", the first name of [[George Pullman]], the company's founder (see also [[Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeping Car Porters \"George\"]]). The company required porters to travel 11,000 miles, nearly 400 hours, per month to earn a basic wage.  In 1934, porters on regular assignments worked an average of over 73 hours per week and earned 27.8 cents an hour while workers in manufacturing jobs averaged under 37 hours per week and earned an average of 54.8 cents per hour.<ref>{{cite news |last= Berman |first= Edward |date= August 21, 1935 |title= The Pullman Porters Win |work= The Nation |url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/great-depression/brotherhood-of-sleeping-car-porters-win-over-pullman-company/ |access-date= February 4, 2019 }}</ref>  They spent roughly ten percent of their time in unpaid \"preparatory\" and \"terminal\" set-up and clean-up duties, and they had to pay for their food, lodging, and uniforms, which could consume up to half of their wages.<ref name=\"valien\">{{cite journal |last1=Valien |first1=Preston |date=1940 |title=The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters |journal=Phylon |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=224\u2013238 |doi=10.2307/271990 |jstor=271990 |ref=harv}}</ref>  They were also charged whenever their passengers stole a towel or a water pitcher. Porters could ride at half fare on their days off \u2014 but not on Pullman coaches. They were not eligible for promotion to [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]], a job [[Order of Sleeping Car Conductors#History|reserved for whites]], despite frequently performing some of the  conductor duties.\n\nThe company had squelched any efforts they made to organize during the first decades of the 20th century by isolating or firing union leaders. Like many other large companies of the time, the company employed spies to keep tabs on their employees; in extreme cases, company agents assaulted union organizers.\n\nWhen 500 porters met in Harlem on August 25, 1925, they decided to make another effort to organize. During this meeting, they secretly launched their campaign, choosing Randolph, not employed by Pullman and thus beyond retaliation, to lead the effort. The union chose a motto to sum up their resentment over the working conditions: \"Fight or Be Slaves\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/great-depression/brotherhood-of-sleeping-car-porters-win-over-pullman-company/|title=Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters|date=2013-06-26|website=Social Welfare History Project|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==Organizing the union==\n[[File:PullmanPorter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Pullman Porter, photographed in Chicago in 1943.]]\n\nThe AFL, despite touting equal rights for workers, was actively discriminatory.<ref>Santino, J.

The Journal of American Folklore, 96 (382) pp 393-412. </ref> Furthermore, and foremost, white supremacy remained entrenched in almost every institution that existed in the US, and these racist beliefs, both subtle and overt, precluded the white labor movement from recognizing the black workers or their organized fronts.\n\nIn the 1920s, as some elements within the AFL began to lower these barriers, while groups as diverse as the [[Urban League]], the [[Socialist Party of America]] and [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] began to focus on the rights of black workers. Randolph himself was a prominent member of the Socialist Party. From its inception, the BSCP fought to open doors in the organized labor movement in the US for black workers, even though it faced staunch opposition and blatant racism.  As BSCP co-founder and First Vice President Milton Price Webster, put it, \"...any time we have an American institution composed of white people there is prejudice in it....In America, if we should stay out of everything that's prejudiced we wouldn't be in anything.\"\n\nAs early as 1900, efforts were put forth by various collectives of Pullman porters to organize the porters into a union, each effort having been crushed by Pullman.  In 1925, in the early days of organizing the BSP union, Randolph was invited, by BSCP union organizer Ashley Totten, to address the Porters Athletic Association, in New York City.  Exhibiting a sound understanding of the plight of the black worker and the need for a genuine labor union, Randolph was asked to undertake the job of organizing the porters into a bona fide labor union. The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was launched on the night of August 25, 1925.\n\nKey to the success of the union was to galvanize membership by way of a national membership drive, with three of the Pullman company's largest terminals being most important \u2014 Chicago, Oakland, and St. Louis. The man to see in Chicago was Milton Price Webster. He was the son of enslaved parents from Clarksville, Tennessee, who, after successfully purchasing their own freedom, eventually moved to Chicago, where Webster was raised.  A former Pullman Porter of twenty years, and a devoted husband (Louie Elizabeth Harris) and father of three, Webster had been fired by the company for attempting to organize porters in the Railroad Men's Benevolent Association.\n\nWebster was a man of strong convictions. As a Lincoln Republican and a tenured, highly respected captain of Chicago's Sixth Ward black Republican machine, Webster was a stern, but gregarious leader of men who was well connected throughout the Chicago politic.  Not the orator of Randolph's skill, and not college educated, Webster devoured books and the news of the day, and was a stalwart back room negotiator.  He captured his audience with his command of the subject, his keen wit and sharp intellect, and his commitment to alleviating the struggles of the working man.\n\n[[File:Pullman porter making an upper berth aboard the Capitol Limited bound for Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A Pullman Porter making the bed of an upper berth, 1942.]]\n\nAlthough skeptical of Randolph's socialist affiliations, on the recommendations of fellow union organizer John C. Mills of Chicago, Webster facilitated a series of public meetings for Randolph and Chicago porters, nightly for two weeks.  At the initial meeting, after hearing Randolph speak, Webster turned to Mills, agreeing that Randolph was the man to head the organization of the new union.  For the next two weeks, nightly meetings were held, with two speakers campaigning for Chicago chapter membership\u2014Milton Webster opening and A. Philip Randolph closing\u2014effectively launching the Chicago division of the Brotherhood.\n\nThe Pullman Company's response was to denounce, with support from the ministers and African American newspapers whom it had cultivated (or bought), the new union as an outside entity motivated by foreign ideologies, while sponsoring its own [[company union]], variously known as the Employee Representation Plan or the Pullman Porters and Maids Protective Association, to represent its loyal employees. Local authorities, such as [[E.H. Crump|Boss Crump]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee in some cases helped the company by interfering with or banning BSCP meetings.\n\nFor the first several years of its existence, the union continued fighting the Pullman Company, its allies in the black community, the white power structure, and rival unions within the AFL that were hostile to its members' job claims.  The BSCP also tried to involve the federal government in its fight with the Pullman Company: on September 7, 1927 the brotherhood filed a case with the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], requesting an investigation of Pullman rates, porters' wages, tipping practices, and other matters related to wages and working conditions; the ICC ruled that it did not have jurisdiction.\n\nWhile it had organized roughly half of the porters within the company, the union was seemingly no closer to obtaining recognition than it had been in 1925. By 1928 BSCP leaders decided that the only way to force the issue was to strike the company. The leadership was, however, divided on what a strike could accomplish: some rank-and-file leaders wanted to use the strike as a show of strength and an organizing tool, while Randolph was more cautious, hoping to use the threat of a strike as the lever to get the federal [[National Mediation Board]] established pursuant to the [[Railway Labor Act]] to bring the Pullman Company to the table while mobilizing support from supporters outside the industry.\n\nAfter secretly meeting with the Pullman Company, the NMB refused to follow precedent it had set in the case of a group of white railroad workers, and refused to act on behalf of the BSCP.  The NMB argued that the brotherhood was incapable of disrupting the Pullman sleeping car service.  Although the union had voted for a strike, the Pullman Company convinced the NMB that the union did not have the strength in numbers or resources to pull it off. In July 1928, the NMB formally retired the case and Randolph called off the strike just hours before it was scheduled to begin.  Randolph, Webster, and the leadership of the BSCP recognized, in the end, that a strike at that time would have seriously crippled the brotherhood, agreeing that the union was still not strong enough to carry off a strike against the powerful corporate giant like Pullman.\n\nThat provoked an internal crisis, deepened by the [[Great Depression]], paucity of funding for the union, and perpetual reprisals against the porters by the Pullman company, which led to a sharp drop in BSCP membership. The union might have disappeared altogether if it had not been for the vigilance and dedication of Randolph, Webster, Totten, Mills, C. L. Dellums, Bennie Smith, S. E. Grain, E. J. Bradley, Paul Caldwell, George Price, C. Francis Stratford and Roy Lancaster, who formed the initial organizers and board members of the BSCP.\n\nThe relationship between Randolph and Webster, the long-standing first vice president of the BSCP and the head of the Chicago Division, was centered on their common devotion to a common cause. Together they had a mutually aggressive and genuine commitment to the imperative that the black worker be organized to improve the working conditions, workers rights and the lives of black workers, their families and their communities.\n\nIn 1929, the American Federation of Labor granted affiliated status to individual chapters of the BSCP as local unions rather than to the international organization as a whole.  The locals were Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Fort Worth, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Oakland, St. Louis, St. Paul, and Washington D.C.{{sfn|Valien|1940|p=228}}\n\nBy 1933, BSCP membership dropped to 658, and the headquarters lost telephone and electric service because of nonpayment of bills.<ref name=\"lubell1956\">{{cite book | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | author=Lubell, Samuel | year=1956 | pages=232 | edition=2nd|ol = 6193934M}}</ref> In 1934 the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration amended the RLA, then passed the Wagner-Connery Act, which outlawed company unions and covered porters, the following year. The BSCP immediately demanded that the NMB certify it as the representative of these porters. The BSCP defeated the company union in the election held by the NMB and on June 1, 1935 was certified. \n\nNegotiations for increasing labor standards with the Pullman Company began but were repeatedly deadlocked. The BSCP requested the assistance of the National Mediation Board in April, 1937, a time when the company was still using informants to report on union meetings.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Report from Mrs. M.

It went into effect in October of 1937, raising the wages of porters and maids, establishing a basic 240-hour month, and providing time-and-a-half overtime pay after 260 hours.  Pullman claimed the wage increases would cost the company approximately $1,500,000 per year.  The company also agreed to pay for the uniforms of porters after they'd been employed for ten years.{{sfn|Valien|1940|p=231-232}}\n\n==Role of women==\nDuring the 20th century, women were largely excluded from meaningfully participating in labor movements throughout North America.<ref name=levine>Levine, S.

In the years before then, when the AFL refused to recognize the organization itself, Randolph accepted \"federal local\" status for a number of locals of the BSCP &mdash; an unsatisfactory compromise that assumed that these locals had no union of their own, and allowed them to affiliate directly with the AFL on that basis. That half-measure, however, allowed Randolph into AFL conventions and other meetings, where he advocated organization of black workers on an equal footing with whites. Randolph kept the BSCP in the AFL, where most of the railroad brotherhoods remained, after [[John L. Lewis]] led the split that resulted in the formation of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]].\n\nRandolph expanded his agenda once he became the leader of the foremost black labor organization in the U.S. Randolph was chosen as the leader of the [[National Negro Congress]], an umbrella organization founded in 1937 that united many of the major black civil rights organizations of the day. Randolph later resigned from the NNC in a dispute over policy with communist activists within it. The NNC went into eclipse, while Randolph's stature continued to grow.\n\nIn 1941 he used the threat of a march on Washington and support from the [[NAACP]], [[Fiorello La Guardia]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to force the administration to ban discrimination by defense contractors and establish the [[Fair Employment Practices Committee]] to enforce that order. Milton Webster, the BSCP's First Vice-President, worked to make the FEPC an effective tool in combatting employment discrimination<ref name=\":1\" />. Randolph achieved his other demand &mdash; the end of racial segregation within the military &mdash; seven years later, when President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9981]] banning it.\n\nBSCP members played a significant role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1940s and 1950s. [[E. D. Nixon]], a BSCP member and the most militant spokesperson for the rights of African Americans in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama for most of the 1940s and 1950s, exemplified the leadership that the union provided. Nixon could take advantage of his experience organizing under difficult circumstances and his immunity to economic reprisals from local businesses and authorities. BSCP members also helped spread information and create networks between the different communities their work took them to, bringing the newspapers and political ideas they picked up in the North back to their hometowns.\n\nRandolph helped negotiate the return of the CIO to the AFL in 1955. Randolph by that time had achieved elder statesman status within the civil rights movement, even as changes in the railroad industry were gradually displacing many of the union's members.\n\nRandolph and one of his chief lieutenants, [[Bayard Rustin]] &mdash; who, ironically, had bitterly criticized Randolph for calling off [[March on Washington Movement|the 1941 March on Washington]] &mdash; were the moving force behind the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]]. As Randolph said from the podium at that march:\n\n:Let the nation know the meaning of our numbers. We are not a pressure group. We are not an organization. We are not a mob. We are the advance guard of a massive moral revolution that is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies know that they are not free while we are not.\n\nIn 1953, when [[Violet King Henry]] became the first black woman lawyer in Canada (and the first black law graduate in Alberta) the union's president and vice-president traveled to Alberta to recognize her.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Violet King |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date=November 16, 2017 |publisher=Historica Canada |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/violet-king }}</ref>\n\n==Merger with BRAC==\nPassenger rail travel dropped sharply after its peak in the 1940s, when the BSCP had 15,000 members, to the 1960s, when only 3000 porters had regular runs.  After four decades of service as the first vice president of the BSCP, Milton Webster was designated to be Randolph's successor as president when Randolph retired.  That transition never occurred.  In February 1965, Webster suffered a fatal heart attack in the lobby of the Americana Hotel in Bal Harbour, Florida while he and Randolph were attending an AFL-CIO Convention.   C. L. Dellums replaced Randolph as president of the BSCP in 1968.\n\nThe BSCP merged with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks [[Transportation Communications International Union|BRAC]] a decade later.<ref name=\":1\">\"Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.\" Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History, 2006.

Shackelford, became president of BRAC's Sleeping Car Porters Division.  In 1984, the Sleeping Car Porters Division was combined, along with Amtrak clerical employees, into a new Amtrak Division of the union having approximately 5000 members, 3500 clerical and 1500 in on-board services, comprising the largest single unit of organized labor on the Amtrak system.\n\nUpon Mr. Shackelford's retirement in 1985, his position was not filled, its duties devolving upon the general chairman of the BRAC Amtrak Division, Michael J. Young, and his successors.  Thus ended the direct lineage of BSCP leadership, with Young becoming the first non-African American to lead the on-board group.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adams|first=Thomas Jessen|title=Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters|date=2009-02-09|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acref/9780195301731.013.45320|work=African American Studies Center|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530173-1|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe three unions representing Amtrak on-board service workers, BRAC, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees (HERE), and the Transport Workers Union (TWU) joined to form the Amtrak Service Workers Council (ASWC).

BSCP members such as [[Edgar Nixon|E. D.

It also paid many porters well enough to have a middle-income lifestyle and prominence within their own communities.\n\nWorking for the Pullman Company was, however, less glamorous than the image the company promoted. Porters depended on tips for much of their income and thus on the generosity of white passengers who often referred to all porters as \"George\", the first name of [[George Pullman]], the company's founder (see also [[Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeping Car Porters \"George\"]]). The company required porters to travel 11,000 miles, nearly 400 hours, per month to earn a basic wage.  In 1934, porters on regular assignments worked an average of over 73 hours per week and earned 27.8 cents an hour while workers in manufacturing jobs averaged under 37 hours per week and earned an average of 54.8 cents per hour.<ref>{{cite news |last= Berman |first= Edward |date= August 21, 1935 |title= The Pullman Porters Win |work= The Nation |url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/great-depression/brotherhood-of-sleeping-car-porters-win-over-pullman-company/ |access-date= February 4, 2019 }}</ref>  They spent roughly ten percent of their time in unpaid \"preparatory\" and \"terminal\" set-up and clean-up duties, and they had to pay for their food, lodging, and uniforms, which could consume up to half of their wages.<ref name=\"valien\">{{cite journal |last1=Valien |first1=Preston |date=1940 |title=The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters |journal=Phylon |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=224\u2013238 |doi=10.2307/271990 |jstor=271990 |ref=harv}}</ref>  They were also charged whenever their passengers stole a towel or a water pitcher. Porters could ride at half fare on their days off \u2014 but not on Pullman coaches. They were not eligible for promotion to [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]], a job [[Order of Sleeping Car Conductors#History|reserved for whites]], despite frequently performing some of the  conductor duties.\n\nThe company had squelched any efforts they made to organize during the first decades of the 20th century by isolating or firing union leaders. Like many other large companies of the time, the company employed spies to keep tabs on their employees; in extreme cases, company agents assaulted union organizers.\n\nWhen 500 porters met in Harlem on August 25, 1925, they decided to make another effort to organize. During this meeting, they secretly launched their campaign, choosing Randolph, not employed by Pullman and thus beyond retaliation, to lead the effort. The union chose a motto to sum up their resentment over the working conditions: \"Fight or Be Slaves\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/great-depression/brotherhood-of-sleeping-car-porters-win-over-pullman-company/|title=Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters|date=2013-06-26|website=Social Welfare History Project|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==Organizing the union==\n[[File:PullmanPorter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Pullman Porter, photographed in Chicago in 1943.]]\n\nThe AFL, despite touting equal rights for workers, was actively discriminatory.<ref>Santino, J. (1983). Miles of Smiles, Years of Struggle: The Negotiation of Black Occupational Identity Through Personal Experience Narrative. The Journal of American Folklore, 96 (382) pp 393-412. </ref> Furthermore, and foremost, white supremacy remained entrenched in almost every institution that existed in the US, and these racist beliefs, both subtle and overt, precluded the white labor movement from recognizing the black workers or their organized fronts.\n\nIn the 1920s, as some elements within the AFL began to lower these barriers, while groups as diverse as the [[Urban League]], the [[Socialist Party of America]] and [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] began to focus on the rights of black workers. Randolph himself was a prominent member of the Socialist Party. From its inception, the BSCP fought to open doors in the organized labor movement in the US for black workers, even though it faced staunch opposition and blatant racism.  As BSCP co-founder and First Vice President Milton Price Webster, put it, \"...any time we have an American institution composed of white people there is prejudice in it....In America, if we should stay out of everything that's prejudiced we wouldn't be in anything.\"\n\nAs early as 1900, efforts were put forth by various collectives of Pullman porters to organize the porters into a union, each effort having been crushed by Pullman.  In 1925, in the early days of organizing the BSP union, Randolph was invited, by BSCP union organizer Ashley Totten, to address the Porters Athletic Association, in New York City.  Exhibiting a sound understanding of the plight of the black worker and the need for a genuine labor union, Randolph was asked to undertake the job of organizing the porters into a bona fide labor union. The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was launched on the night of August 25, 1925.\n\nKey to the success of the union was to galvanize membership by way of a national membership drive, with three of the Pullman company's largest terminals being most important \u2014 Chicago, Oakland, and St. Louis. The man to see in Chicago was Milton Price Webster. He was the son of enslaved parents from Clarksville, Tennessee, who, after successfully purchasing their own freedom, eventually moved to Chicago, where Webster was raised.  A former Pullman Porter of twenty years, and a devoted husband (Louie Elizabeth Harris) and father of three, Webster had been fired by the company for attempting to organize porters in the Railroad Men's Benevolent Association.\n\nWebster was a man of strong convictions. As a Lincoln Republican and a tenured, highly respected captain of Chicago's Sixth Ward black Republican machine, Webster was a stern, but gregarious leader of men who was well connected throughout the Chicago politic.  Not the orator of Randolph's skill, and not college educated, Webster devoured books and the news of the day, and was a stalwart back room negotiator.  He captured his audience with his command of the subject, his keen wit and sharp intellect, and his commitment to alleviating the struggles of the working man.\n\n[[File:Pullman porter making an upper berth aboard the Capitol Limited bound for Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A Pullman Porter making the bed of an upper berth, 1942.]]\n\nAlthough skeptical of Randolph's socialist affiliations, on the recommendations of fellow union organizer John C. Mills of Chicago, Webster facilitated a series of public meetings for Randolph and Chicago porters, nightly for two weeks.  At the initial meeting, after hearing Randolph speak, Webster turned to Mills, agreeing that Randolph was the man to head the organization of the new union.  For the next two weeks, nightly meetings were held, with two speakers campaigning for Chicago chapter membership\u2014Milton Webster opening and A. Philip Randolph closing\u2014effectively launching the Chicago division of the Brotherhood.\n\nThe Pullman Company's response was to denounce, with support from the ministers and African American newspapers whom it had cultivated (or bought), the new union as an outside entity motivated by foreign ideologies, while sponsoring its own [[company union]], variously known as the Employee Representation Plan or the Pullman Porters and Maids Protective Association, to represent its loyal employees. Local authorities, such as [[E.H. Crump|Boss Crump]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee in some cases helped the company by interfering with or banning BSCP meetings.\n\nFor the first several years of its existence, the union continued fighting the Pullman Company, its allies in the black community, the white power structure, and rival unions within the AFL that were hostile to its members' job claims.  The BSCP also tried to involve the federal government in its fight with the Pullman Company: on September 7, 1927 the brotherhood filed a case with the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], requesting an investigation of Pullman rates, porters' wages, tipping practices, and other matters related to wages and working conditions; the ICC ruled that it did not have jurisdiction.\n\nWhile it had organized roughly half of the porters within the company, the union was seemingly no closer to obtaining recognition than it had been in 1925. By 1928 BSCP leaders decided that the only way to force the issue was to strike the company. The leadership was, however, divided on what a strike could accomplish: some rank-and-file leaders wanted to use the strike as a show of strength and an organizing tool, while Randolph was more cautious, hoping to use the threat of a strike as the lever to get the federal [[National Mediation Board]] established pursuant to the [[Railway Labor Act]] to bring the Pullman Company to the table while mobilizing support from supporters outside the industry.\n\nAfter secretly meeting with the Pullman Company, the NMB refused to follow precedent it had set in the case of a group of white railroad workers, and refused to act on behalf of the BSCP.  The NMB argued that the brotherhood was incapable of disrupting the Pullman sleeping car service.  Although the union had voted for a strike, the Pullman Company convinced the NMB that the union did not have the strength in numbers or resources to pull it off. In July 1928, the NMB formally retired the case and Randolph called off the strike just hours before it was scheduled to begin.  Randolph, Webster, and the leadership of the BSCP recognized, in the end, that a strike at that time would have seriously crippled the brotherhood, agreeing that the union was still not strong enough to carry off a strike against the powerful corporate giant like Pullman.\n\nThat provoked an internal crisis, deepened by the [[Great Depression]], paucity of funding for the union, and perpetual reprisals against the porters by the Pullman company, which led to a sharp drop in BSCP membership. The union might have disappeared altogether if it had not been for the vigilance and dedication of Randolph, Webster, Totten, Mills, C. L. Dellums, Bennie Smith, S. E. Grain, E. J. Bradley, Paul Caldwell, George Price, C. Francis Stratford and Roy Lancaster, who formed the initial organizers and board members of the BSCP.\n\nThe relationship between Randolph and Webster, the long-standing first vice president of the BSCP and the head of the Chicago Division, was centered on their common devotion to a common cause. Together they had a mutually aggressive and genuine commitment to the imperative that the black worker be organized to improve the working conditions, workers rights and the lives of black workers, their families and their communities.\n\nIn 1929, the American Federation of Labor granted affiliated status to individual chapters of the BSCP as local unions rather than to the international organization as a whole.  The locals were Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Fort Worth, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Oakland, St. Louis, St. Paul, and Washington D.C.{{sfn|Valien|1940|p=228}}\n\nBy 1933, BSCP membership dropped to 658, and the headquarters lost telephone and electric service because of nonpayment of bills.<ref name=\"lubell1956\">{{cite book | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | author=Lubell, Samuel | year=1956 | pages=232 | edition=2nd|ol = 6193934M}}</ref> In 1934 the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration amended the RLA, then passed the Wagner-Connery Act, which outlawed company unions and covered porters, the following year. The BSCP immediately demanded that the NMB certify it as the representative of these porters. The BSCP defeated the company union in the election held by the NMB and on June 1, 1935 was certified. \n\nNegotiations for increasing labor standards with the Pullman Company began but were repeatedly deadlocked. The BSCP requested the assistance of the National Mediation Board in April, 1937, a time when the company was still using informants to report on union meetings.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Report from Mrs. M. Butler to E. M.

It went into effect in October of 1937, raising the wages of porters and maids, establishing a basic 240-hour month, and providing time-and-a-half overtime pay after 260 hours.  Pullman claimed the wage increases would cost the company approximately $1,500,000 per year.  The company also agreed to pay for the uniforms of porters after they'd been employed for ten years.{{sfn|Valien|1940|p=231-232}}\n\n==Role of women==\nDuring the 20th century, women were largely excluded from meaningfully participating in labor movements throughout North America.<ref name=levine>Levine, S.

In the years before then, when the AFL refused to recognize the organization itself, Randolph accepted \"federal local\" status for a number of locals of the BSCP &mdash; an unsatisfactory compromise that assumed that these locals had no union of their own, and allowed them to affiliate directly with the AFL on that basis. That half-measure, however, allowed Randolph into AFL conventions and other meetings, where he advocated organization of black workers on an equal footing with whites. Randolph kept the BSCP in the AFL, where most of the railroad brotherhoods remained, after [[John L. Lewis]] led the split that resulted in the formation of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]].\n\nRandolph expanded his agenda once he became the leader of the foremost black labor organization in the U.S. Randolph was chosen as the leader of the [[National Negro Congress]], an umbrella organization founded in 1937 that united many of the major black civil rights organizations of the day. Randolph later resigned from the NNC in a dispute over policy with communist activists within it. The NNC went into eclipse, while Randolph's stature continued to grow.\n\nIn 1941 he used the threat of a march on Washington and support from the [[NAACP]], [[Fiorello La Guardia]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to force the administration to ban discrimination by defense contractors and establish the [[Fair Employment Practices Committee]] to enforce that order. Milton Webster, the BSCP's First Vice-President, worked to make the FEPC an effective tool in combatting employment discrimination<ref name=\":1\" />. Randolph achieved his other demand &mdash; the end of racial segregation within the military &mdash; seven years later, when President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9981]] banning it.\n\nBSCP members played a significant role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1940s and 1950s. [[E. D. Nixon]], a BSCP member and the most militant spokesperson for the rights of African Americans in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama for most of the 1940s and 1950s, exemplified the leadership that the union provided. Nixon could take advantage of his experience organizing under difficult circumstances and his immunity to economic reprisals from local businesses and authorities. BSCP members also helped spread information and create networks between the different communities their work took them to, bringing the newspapers and political ideas they picked up in the North back to their hometowns.\n\nRandolph helped negotiate the return of the CIO to the AFL in 1955. Randolph by that time had achieved elder statesman status within the civil rights movement, even as changes in the railroad industry were gradually displacing many of the union's members.\n\nRandolph and one of his chief lieutenants, [[Bayard Rustin]] &mdash; who, ironically, had bitterly criticized Randolph for calling off [[March on Washington Movement|the 1941 March on Washington]] &mdash; were the moving force behind the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]]. As Randolph said from the podium at that march:\n\n:Let the nation know the meaning of our numbers. We are not a pressure group. We are not an organization. We are not a mob. We are the advance guard of a massive moral revolution that is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies know that they are not free while we are not.\n\nIn 1953, when [[Violet King Henry]] became the first black woman lawyer in Canada (and the first black law graduate in Alberta) the union's president and vice-president traveled to Alberta to recognize her.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Violet King |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date=November 16, 2017 |publisher=Historica Canada |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/violet-king }}</ref>\n\n==Merger with BRAC==\nPassenger rail travel dropped sharply after its peak in the 1940s, when the BSCP had 15,000 members, to the 1960s, when only 3000 porters had regular runs.  After four decades of service as the first vice president of the BSCP, Milton Webster was designated to be Randolph's successor as president when Randolph retired.  That transition never occurred.  In February 1965, Webster suffered a fatal heart attack in the lobby of the Americana Hotel in Bal Harbour, Florida while he and Randolph were attending an AFL-CIO Convention.   C. L. Dellums replaced Randolph as president of the BSCP in 1968.\n\nThe BSCP merged with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks [[Transportation Communications International Union|BRAC]] a decade later.<ref name=\":1\">\"Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.\" Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History, 2006.

Shackelford, became president of BRAC's Sleeping Car Porters Division.  In 1984, the Sleeping Car Porters Division was combined, along with Amtrak clerical employees, into a new Amtrak Division of the union having approximately 5000 members, 3500 clerical and 1500 in on-board services, comprising the largest single unit of organized labor on the Amtrak system.\n\nUpon Mr. Shackelford's retirement in 1985, his position was not filled, its duties devolving upon the general chairman of the BRAC Amtrak Division, Michael J. Young, and his successors.  Thus ended the direct lineage of BSCP leadership, with Young becoming the first non-African American to lead the on-board group.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adams|first=Thomas Jessen|title=Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters|date=2009-02-09|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acref/9780195301731.013.45320|work=African American Studies Center|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530173-1|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe three unions representing Amtrak on-board service workers, BRAC, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees (HERE), and the Transport Workers Union (TWU) joined to form the Amtrak Service Workers Council (ASWC).

Residents of the town fled for [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] following the invasion of the town by [[ISIS]] in August 2014. The town was liberated by Iraqi Security Forces from ISIS rule on October 24, 2016 as part of the larger [[Battle of Mosul (2016)|Battle of Mosul]].\n\n==Population==\nUntil the ISIS occupation, there were between 600 and 650 families living in Karemlash. The vast majority of the population is ethnically [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]. Historically, the population was mostly part of the [[Church of the East]]; however, many converted to Catholicism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Today, the inhabitants of Karemlash are mainly members of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], but there are also members of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].\n\n==History==\n\nKaremlash is believed to be among the first human settlements. Hence, it was visited by almost all Mesopotamian archaeologists searching for the ruins of old Assyria and [[Babylon]]ia. The first person to excavate in the hills of Karemlash was the Englishman [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1846. Many relief sculptures with cuneiform scripts were found in Tel Ghanim and Tel Barbara (two of the hill surrounding Karemlash). On them were found the names of Assyrian Kings of Sargon and Shalmensar. The remains of an Assyrian temple were found at Tel Barbara, and the remains of an Assyrian palace were found at Tel Ghanim.\n\nKaremlash lost its important stature during the era of [[Shalmaneser III]] (859 \u2013 824 BC), whose son [[Assur-danin-pal]] led a rebellion against his father along with another 27 cities. His father empowered his other brother, [[Shamshi-Adad V]], the Governor of Kalah ([[Nimrud]]). The civil war lasted for four years, from 827 to 824 BC. With the end of the rebellion, however, Karemlash's neighbor Nimrud did not survive the ravages of the war. Karemlash was so impacted by that rebellion that its people left and it was given the name of \"Oro-Karmash\", meaning \"The Ruined City\". Karemlash is still referred to by its Assyrian neighbors as \"Karmash\". However, Karemlash was reinvigorated during the reigns of Kings [[Shalmaneser V]] (726 \u2013 722 BC) and [[Sargon II]] (722 \u2013 705 BC), who used it as his temporary capital.\n\n===The Battle of Karemlash 331 BC===\nThis great historical battle between the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Alexander of Macedonia]] and the [[Persia]]n Emperor [[Darius III]] ended with the defeat of the latter and the ushering of the Greek reign over the Near East. Karemlash at the time was called Ko-Komle (which meant in [[Aramaic]] \"The Camels' Square\") after the death of most of the camels of the Persian Emperor Daryos Dara I around the city due to their exhaustion. Hence, historically the Battle of Karamlish is known as the Battle of Ko-Komle.\n\n===Patriarchal seat of the Church of the East===\nKaremlash was the seat of the Nestorian patriarch [[Denha II]] (1336/7\u20131381/2) for at least part of his reign.  The continuator of the ''Ecclesiastical History'' of Bar Hebraeus mentions several contacts between Denha II and the Jacobite church in Karamlish between 1358 and 1364.  At this period Karemlash had Jacobite and Armenian communities alongside its Nestorian majority, and its village chiefs styled themselves 'emirs'.  The prosperity enjoyed by the village during the reign of Denha II presumably came to an end when the patriarchate was relocated to [[Mosul]] at an unknown date in the fourteenth or fifteenth century.<ref>Wilmshurst, ''EOCE'', 218\u201319</ref>\n\n===Karemlash as center of principality===\nDuring the fourteenth century, Karemlash became the center of a principality, earning it fame. It was mentioned in several books as a trade center of immense importance. Among some of the governors during this period were:\n#Prince Masoud (1317)\n#Prince Nasser El-Deen\n#Prince Hassan (1358)\n#Prince Matti (brother of Prince Hassan)\n#Prince Beyazeed (1364)\n#Prince Sahab Masoud (end of 14th century)\n\n===The destruction by Nader Shah===\nDuring the wars between the Persian and Ottoman Empires, [[Nader Shah]] of Persia decided in 1732 to attack and occupy Mesopotamia. After occupying Baghdad the same year, he sent a small part of his army (8,000 soldiers strong) to occupy Nineveh and its surroundings. However, his army was defeated. This angered Nader Shah, who decided in 1743 to go himself with 300,000 soldiers and 390 cannons. After occupying Kirkuk and Erbil, he moved to Nineveh and its villages. He decided to bomb Karemlash before entering it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Most of the houses of the village were ruined, in addition to Mar Yohanan Church and Beth Sahda \"Church of the Forty Martyrs\". Nader Shah stayed in Karemlash for four days. It was estimated that over 4,000 [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians were massacred during those four days.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Churches and monasteries==\n[[Image:Iraqvillagekaramlesh10.JPG|thumb|220ppx|Christianity is the main identity of the town today.]]\nHistorians kept the memories of many churches and monasteries of the Church of the East in Karemlash intact. These ancient churches include the monasteries of Mar Giwargis (St. George), Mar Yonan (St. Jonah), Mar Youkhanna (St. John), and Dair Banat Maryam (the Monastery of St. Mary's Daughters). The last two have long been forgotten; meanwhile, Mar Yonan became the grounds of a school in the early twentieth century. Below is a list of the known monasteries and churches in Karemlash:\n\n[[Image:Iraqvillagekaramlesh11.JPG|thumb|Mar Giwargis Monastery]]\n*Mar Giwargis Monastery \u2013 This Monastery was built in the northern parts of town by a monk named Giwargis in late sixth century. It continues to stand today. However, it is believed that it was turned into a cemetery after the [[Mongols]] invasion.\n*Mar Yonan Monastery \u2013 A monk named Yonan built this monastery in the seventh century. The monastery is mentioned in an unidentified Nestorian writer's fourteenth-century manuscript. It is believed that it was abandoned after the invasion of Nadir Shah in 1743.\n*Mar Youkhanna Monastery \u2013 There is nothing left of this monastery but a small hill known as the hill of monk Youkhanna (Tell rabban Youkhanna) situated in the southern parts of town. It was mentioned in A.D. 660 in the manuscript of Bar'aeeta, and it was populous in 1736 according to the manuscript of kitab dafanat al-Mowta (the book of the hidden treasures of the dead). It was destroyed completely during the invasion of Persian Nadir Shah on August 15, 1743.\n*Dair Banat Maryam \u2013 It was attached to Mar Giwargis Monastery and served as a monastery for the nuns. The monastery suffered tremendously at the hands of the Mongols in the thirteenth century and in the eighteenth century at the hands of Kurdish Ismail Pasha of Rawandos. It was referred to by [[Charles Watson Bradt]] during his visit to Karemlash on June 2, 1758.\n*The Church of the Forty Martyrs \u2013 The remains of this church are situated on a hill known as Beth Sahde (the Martyrs Home) southeast of the town. It was standing in 1236, when Karemlash was attacked by the Mongols. It was destroyed by [[Nadir Shah]] in 1743.\n*St. Barbara Church \u2013 The church is situated on the ruins of a hill by the same name west of town. It was built on the ruins of an ancient Assyrian temple for the god Banu. Excavations at the hill in 1852 uncovered two halls used by ancient Assyrians in their religious ceremonies as well as tools that were used during worship. The earth soil covers a [[ziggurat]] that was built by ancient Assyrians to serve as a temple. Barbara was the daughter of the pagan governor of the region. She converted to Christianity, with her servant Yulina, against the will of her father who imprisoned her. When they refused to change their mind and denounce Christianity, the pagan governor ordered their death. They were killed in a room attached to the temple, where the church stands today. The church was attacked by Nadir Shah; however, the residents renovated and rebuilt it in 1798.\n*[[Image:Iraqvillagekaramlesh12.JPG|thumb|Mar Addai Church]]The Church of the Virgin \u2013 It is a small, but beautiful church situated in the center of town. It was once the home of a lady who donated it to the public. It was established as a church in 1887 and enlarged in 1902.\n*Mar Addai Church \u2013 The church is situated in the northern parts of town. It is currently the biggest and most modern church in Karemlash. Construction began in 1937 and, after some delays, it was consecrated in 1963.\n\n==Post Iraq War==\nKaremlash was relatively calm following the US-led [[Iraq War]]. In late 2003, the town came briefly under the control of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (377th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion).<ref>\"U.S. Soldiers Adopt Assyrian Village with Educational Results\" - www.Gulf1.com, 28 December 2003; Spc. Joshua Hutcheson</ref>\n\nThe town showed strong support towards the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] during the parliamentary and local elections in 2005, 2007 and 2010.<ref>[http://www.zahrira.net/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=1391 \u0646\u062a\u0627\u0626\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0647\u0644 \u0646\u064a\u0646\u0648\u0649 Zahrira.net]</ref> The town also received thousands of Assyrian and other Christian refugees from other parts of the country after waves of violence against them. In response to this influx of refugees, [[Sarkis Aghajan]] and the Supreme committee of Christian affairs built and renovated new homes, churches, cemeteries, infrastructure and a complex for Armenian Refugees, among other improvements.<ref>http://www.ishtartv.com/en/viewarticle,35768.html</ref>\n\nOn August 6, 2014, [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]] took over the town, causing all of its inhabitants to flee to Erbil. During their occupation of the city, they burned an 80-year-old [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] woman to death for \"failing to comply with the strict laws of the Islamic State\"<ref>[http://www.basnews.com/en/news/2015/05/26/islamic-state-militants-burn-christian-woman-in-nineveh-village/ BasNews Islamic State Militants Burn Christian Woman in Nineveh Village]

spelled ''Karemles'', ''Karemlish'') is an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] town in northern [[Iraq]] located less than {{convert|18|mi|km}} south east of [[Mosul]].\n\nIt is surrounded by many hills that along with it made up the historical Akkadian city of Kar-Mullissi (written URU.kar-<sup>d</sup>NIN.L\u00cdL<ref>http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap3/cbd/qpn-x-places/qpn-x-places.x001961.html</ref>), which means \"the city of [[Ninlil|Mullissu]]\" in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. Residents of the town fled for [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] following the invasion of the town by [[ISIS]] in August 2014. The town was liberated by Iraqi Security Forces from ISIS rule on October 24, 2016 as part of the larger [[Battle of Mosul (2016)|Battle of Mosul]].\n\n==Population==\nUntil the ISIS occupation, there were between 600 and 650 families living in Karemlash. The vast majority of the population is ethnically [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]. Historically, the population was mostly part of the [[Church of the East]]; however, many converted to Catholicism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Today, the inhabitants of Karemlash are mainly members of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], but there are also members of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].\n\n==History==\n\nKaremlash is believed to be among the first human settlements. Hence, it was visited by almost all Mesopotamian archaeologists searching for the ruins of old Assyria and [[Babylon]]ia. The first person to excavate in the hills of Karemlash was the Englishman [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1846. Many relief sculptures with cuneiform scripts were found in Tel Ghanim and Tel Barbara (two of the hill surrounding Karemlash). On them were found the names of Assyrian Kings of Sargon and Shalmensar. The remains of an Assyrian temple were found at Tel Barbara, and the remains of an Assyrian palace were found at Tel Ghanim.\n\nKaremlash lost its important stature during the era of [[Shalmaneser III]] (859 \u2013 824 BC), whose son [[Assur-danin-pal]] led a rebellion against his father along with another 27 cities. His father empowered his other brother, [[Shamshi-Adad V]], the Governor of Kalah ([[Nimrud]]). The civil war lasted for four years, from 827 to 824 BC. With the end of the rebellion, however, Karemlash's neighbor Nimrud did not survive the ravages of the war. Karemlash was so impacted by that rebellion that its people left and it was given the name of \"Oro-Karmash\", meaning \"The Ruined City\". Karemlash is still referred to by its Assyrian neighbors as \"Karmash\". However, Karemlash was reinvigorated during the reigns of Kings [[Shalmaneser V]] (726 \u2013 722 BC) and [[Sargon II]] (722 \u2013 705 BC), who used it as his temporary capital.\n\n===The Battle of Karemlash 331 BC===\nThis great historical battle between the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Alexander of Macedonia]] and the [[Persia]]n Emperor [[Darius III]] ended with the defeat of the latter and the ushering of the Greek reign over the Near East. Karemlash at the time was called Ko-Komle (which meant in [[Aramaic]] \"The Camels' Square\") after the death of most of the camels of the Persian Emperor Daryos Dara I around the city due to their exhaustion. Hence, historically the Battle of Karamlish is known as the Battle of Ko-Komle.\n\n===Patriarchal seat of the Church of the East===\nKaremlash was the seat of the Nestorian patriarch [[Denha II]] (1336/7\u20131381/2) for at least part of his reign.  The continuator of the ''Ecclesiastical History'' of Bar Hebraeus mentions several contacts between Denha II and the Jacobite church in Karamlish between 1358 and 1364.  At this period Karemlash had Jacobite and Armenian communities alongside its Nestorian majority, and its village chiefs styled themselves 'emirs'.  The prosperity enjoyed by the village during the reign of Denha II presumably came to an end when the patriarchate was relocated to [[Mosul]] at an unknown date in the fourteenth or fifteenth century.<ref>Wilmshurst, ''EOCE'', 218\u201319</ref>\n\n===Karemlash as center of principality===\nDuring the fourteenth century, Karemlash became the center of a principality, earning it fame. It was mentioned in several books as a trade center of immense importance. Among some of the governors during this period were:\n#Prince Masoud (1317)\n#Prince Nasser El-Deen\n#Prince Hassan (1358)\n#Prince Matti (brother of Prince Hassan)\n#Prince Beyazeed (1364)\n#Prince Sahab Masoud (end of 14th century)\n\n===The destruction by Nader Shah===\nDuring the wars between the Persian and Ottoman Empires, [[Nader Shah]] of Persia decided in 1732 to attack and occupy Mesopotamia. After occupying Baghdad the same year, he sent a small part of his army (8,000 soldiers strong) to occupy Nineveh and its surroundings. However, his army was defeated. This angered Nader Shah, who decided in 1743 to go himself with 300,000 soldiers and 390 cannons. After occupying Kirkuk and Erbil, he moved to Nineveh and its villages. He decided to bomb Karemlash before entering it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Most of the houses of the village were ruined, in addition to Mar Yohanan Church and Beth Sahda \"Church of the Forty Martyrs\". Nader Shah stayed in Karemlash for four days. It was estimated that over 4,000 [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians were massacred during those four days.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Churches and monasteries==\n[[Image:Iraqvillagekaramlesh10.JPG|thumb|220ppx|Christianity is the main identity of the town today.]]\nHistorians kept the memories of many churches and monasteries of the Church of the East in Karemlash intact. These ancient churches include the monasteries of Mar Giwargis (St. George), Mar Yonan (St. Jonah), Mar Youkhanna (St. John), and Dair Banat Maryam (the Monastery of St. Mary's Daughters). The last two have long been forgotten; meanwhile, Mar Yonan became the grounds of a school in the early twentieth century. Below is a list of the known monasteries and churches in Karemlash:\n\n[[Image:Iraqvillagekaramlesh11.JPG|thumb|Mar Giwargis Monastery]]\n*Mar Giwargis Monastery \u2013 This Monastery was built in the northern parts of town by a monk named Giwargis in late sixth century. It continues to stand today. However, it is believed that it was turned into a cemetery after the [[Mongols]] invasion.\n*Mar Yonan Monastery \u2013 A monk named Yonan built this monastery in the seventh century. The monastery is mentioned in an unidentified Nestorian writer's fourteenth-century manuscript. It is believed that it was abandoned after the invasion of Nadir Shah in 1743.\n*Mar Youkhanna Monastery \u2013 There is nothing left of this monastery but a small hill known as the hill of monk Youkhanna (Tell rabban Youkhanna) situated in the southern parts of town. It was mentioned in A.D. 660 in the manuscript of Bar'aeeta, and it was populous in 1736 according to the manuscript of kitab dafanat al-Mowta (the book of the hidden treasures of the dead). It was destroyed completely during the invasion of Persian Nadir Shah on August 15, 1743.\n*Dair Banat Maryam \u2013 It was attached to Mar Giwargis Monastery and served as a monastery for the nuns. The monastery suffered tremendously at the hands of the Mongols in the thirteenth century and in the eighteenth century at the hands of Kurdish Ismail Pasha of Rawandos. It was referred to by [[Charles Watson Bradt]] during his visit to Karemlash on June 2, 1758.\n*The Church of the Forty Martyrs \u2013 The remains of this church are situated on a hill known as Beth Sahde (the Martyrs Home) southeast of the town. It was standing in 1236, when Karemlash was attacked by the Mongols. It was destroyed by [[Nadir Shah]] in 1743.\n*St. Barbara Church \u2013 The church is situated on the ruins of a hill by the same name west of town. It was built on the ruins of an ancient Assyrian temple for the god Banu. Excavations at the hill in 1852 uncovered two halls used by ancient Assyrians in their religious ceremonies as well as tools that were used during worship. The earth soil covers a [[ziggurat]] that was built by ancient Assyrians to serve as a temple. Barbara was the daughter of the pagan governor of the region. She converted to Christianity, with her servant Yulina, against the will of her father who imprisoned her. When they refused to change their mind and denounce Christianity, the pagan governor ordered their death. They were killed in a room attached to the temple, where the church stands today. The church was attacked by Nadir Shah; however, the residents renovated and rebuilt it in 1798.\n*[[Image:Iraqvillagekaramlesh12.JPG|thumb|Mar Addai Church]]The Church of the Virgin \u2013 It is a small, but beautiful church situated in the center of town. It was once the home of a lady who donated it to the public. It was established as a church in 1887 and enlarged in 1902.\n*Mar Addai Church \u2013 The church is situated in the northern parts of town. It is currently the biggest and most modern church in Karemlash. Construction began in 1937 and, after some delays, it was consecrated in 1963.\n\n==Post Iraq War==\nKaremlash was relatively calm following the US-led [[Iraq War]]. In late 2003, the town came briefly under the control of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (377th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion).<ref>\"U.S. Soldiers Adopt Assyrian Village with Educational Results\" - www.Gulf1.com, 28 December 2003; Spc. Joshua Hutcheson</ref>\n\nThe town showed strong support towards the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] during the parliamentary and local elections in 2005, 2007 and 2010.<ref>[http://www.zahrira.net/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=1391 \u0646\u062a\u0627\u0626\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0647\u0644 \u0646\u064a\u0646\u0648\u0649 Zahrira.net]</ref> The town also received thousands of Assyrian and other Christian refugees from other parts of the country after waves of violence against them. In response to this influx of refugees, [[Sarkis Aghajan]] and the Supreme committee of Christian affairs built and renovated new homes, churches, cemeteries, infrastructure and a complex for Armenian Refugees, among other improvements.<ref>http://www.ishtartv.com/en/viewarticle,35768.html</ref>\n\nOn August 6, 2014, [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]] took over the town, causing all of its inhabitants to flee to Erbil. During their occupation of the city, they burned an 80-year-old [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] woman to death for \"failing to comply with the strict laws of the Islamic State\"<ref>[http://www.basnews.com/en/news/2015/05/26/islamic-state-militants-burn-christian-woman-in-nineveh-village/ BasNews Islamic State Militants Burn Christian Woman in Nineveh Village] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527020806/http://www.basnews.com/en/news/2015/05/26/islamic-state-militants-burn-christian-woman-in-nineveh-village/ |date=2015-05-27 }}</ref> and destroyed a large portion of the historic [[Mar Behnam Monastery]].<ref>http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/isis-blows-famed-4th-century-mar-behnam-catholic-monastery-iraq-1492703</ref>\n\nOn October 24, 2016, the city was liberated by the Iraqi Army, which, on the same day, returned crosses to the domes of some of the main churches.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/Bassam_Nasralla/status/790560992975523840|title=\u0628\u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=2016-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Assyrian settlements]]\n*[[Assyrian homeland]]\n*[[Proposals for Assyrian autonomy in Iraq]]\n*[[Bartella]]\n*[[Bakhdida]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:Iraqvillagekaramlesh6.JPG|\nImage:Iraqvillagekaramlesh8.JPG|\nImage:Iraqvillagekaramlesh9.jpg|\nImage:Iraqvillagekaramlesh2.JPG|\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==References==\n''Originally based on an article by Habib Hannona and Fred Aprim on karemlash.com, licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License, used with permission.''\n<references/>\n\n{{Nineveh Plains}}\n\n[[Category:Assyrian communities in Iraq]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Nineveh Governorate]]\n[[Category:Shabak communities]]\n", "name_user": "Williamcarbone", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karemlash"}

Information about Mughniyeh is limited, but he is believed to have been Hezbollah's Chief of Staff and understood to have overseen Hezbollah's military, intelligence, and security apparatuses. He was one of the main founders of Hezbollah in the 1980s. He has been described as \"a brilliant military tactician and very elusive\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/who-was-imad-mughniyeh|title=Who Was Imad Mughniyeh?|website=www.washingtoninstitute.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref>\n\nU.S. and Israeli officials have long accused Mughniyeh of being directly and personally involved in terrorist attacks which has resulted in many suicide bombings, murders, kidnappings, and assassinations. It began with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|Beirut barracks bombing]] and [[1983 United States embassy bombing|US embassy bombings]], both of which took place in 1983 and killed over 350, as well as the kidnapping of dozens of foreigners in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was indicted in [[Argentina]] for his alleged role in the 1992 [[Israeli embassy attack in Buenos Aires]]. The highest-profile attacks for which it is claimed he is responsible took place in the early 1980s, shortly after the founding of Hezbollah, when Mughniyeh was in his early twenties. U.S. intelligence officials have accused him of killing more [[United States]] citizens than any other man prior to the [[September 11 attacks]], and the bombings and kidnappings he is alleged to have organized are credited with all but eliminating and completely removing the [[US military]] presence in Lebanon in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Lebanon&article=662|title=The Arab American News  \u2013 Mughnieh murder could trigger retaliation|work=arabamericannews.com}}</ref>\n\nMughniyeh was known by his ''nom de guerre'' Al-Hajj Radwan.

He participated in the defence of West Beirut, where he was wounded in the fighting. After the withdrawal of PLO forces from Beirut in September 1982, Mughniyeh acquired an important position in the nascent resistance to the Israeli occupation, due to his knowledge of arms caches left behind by the Palestinians.

Mughniyeh remained a member of Fatah until 1984, when he joined the newly created Islamic Resistance of [[Hezbollah]]. However, he remained close to Fatah leader [[Khalil al-Wazir]] (Abu Jihad) until the latter's death in 1988.
