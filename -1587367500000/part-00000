GVRR is owned and operated by the City of Grapevine.\n[[File:Fort Worth Stockyards June 2016 67 (Grapevine Vintage Railroad).jpg|200px|right|thumb|<span style=\"font-size:100%;\">The \"Vinny\" locomotive at the Stockyards</span>]]\n[[File:Grapevine Vintage Railroad - panoramio.jpg|200px|right|thumb|<span style=\"font-size:100%;\">The \"Puffy\" locomotive at the Stockyards displaying the old Tarantula branding</span>]]\n\n==History and description==\nThe railroad operates passenger excursion trains using an 1896-era 4-6-0 [[steam locomotive]] and sometimes a diesel engine (a [[GP7u]]) to pull its 1920s-era Victorian coaches. Passengers board at Grapevine's historic Main Street station and the train operates over a 21-mile (34 kilometer) route to the Fort Worth Stockyards on former trackage that was owned by the [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway]] (aka the \"Cotton Belt\").<ref>http://railfanning.org/2016/03/taking-the-grapevine-vintage-railroad-back-in-time/</ref> The main run starts in Grapevine and goes to the Fort Worth Stockyards. From its stop in the stockyards, the train then runs a separate excursion along the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] to the 8th Ave Yard of the [[Fort Worth and Western Railroad]], then returns to the stockyards. Upon return to the stockyards, the engine turns around via a turntable and runs around the train on a siding, then it departs back toward Grapevine.\n\nThe route was formerly operated by the FWWR and was known as the Tarantula train.  In 1999 and for a short period of time the FWWR contracted with [[Coe Rail, Inc.]] for operation of the Tarantula train.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/southwestshorts/fwwrbf.html|title=Ft.

Later that year the City of Grapevine expressed interest to FWWR owner William Davis in owning and operating the Tarantula train. After receiving an offer, the purchase was complete around 2005.\n\nThe city named their new operation the Grapevine Vintage Railroad (GVRR) with FRA reporting mark: GVRX. Grapevine operated the train under trackage agreements with FWWR. When [[Trinity Metro]] began operating their [[TEXRail]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.star-telegram.com/news/traffic/your-commute/article97566092.html | title=Finally, TEX Rail project underway from Fort Worth to Grapevine and DFW | publisher=Star-Telegram (Fort Worth) | accessdate=25 August 2016}}</ref> commuter line GVRR made arrangements for trackage rights on their right-of-way to Haltom City. From that point on GVRR uses FWWR trackage under the original agreement.\n\n== Special Excursions ==\nIn addition to the normal Grapevine-Fort Worth and Trinity River runs, GVRR offers many events and special excursions throughout the year.\n\n==== North Pole Express ====\nBy far the railroad's most popular event, the North Pole Express runs every year late-November through December. The station and the train are both decorated for the occasion. For this out-and-back run, the train runs part of the way down the line from Grapevine until it gets to 'Reindeer Ridge', and then reverses back to Grapevine.\n\nAs riders board the train, they are given a souvenir ticket, and Santa's Elves pass out hot chocolate in a souvenir mug. When the train gets to 'Reindeer Ridge', Mrs. Clause boards the train, and as the train heads back to Grapevine, each child is presented with a silver bell that says 'We Believe'. Back in Grapevine, riders get off the train and enter the North Pole, where they are greeted with a snowy forest path that leads them to Santa's Workshop. Once there, Santa, Mrs. Clause, and the elves perform a short musical, and afterwards guests are offered free pictures with Santa.\n\n==== [[Day out with Thomas|Day Out With Thomas]] ====\nAlthough it is a short 25-30 minute trip, it is extremely popular for families with small children. For one weekend each year, a replica of Thomas the Tank Engine comes to Grapevine and leads the train for a short out-and-back excursion. At the station, riders will find photo opportunities with Thomas and other characters from the show, as well as activities that vary from year to year. These activities can include but are not limited to the Thomas and Friends Imagination Station, magic shows, live performances, and storytelling.\n\n==== Kiss Me I'm Irish Express ====\nAnother out-and-back excursion, this ride is offered one Saturday in March, and offers riders 21 and older a souvenir Kiss Me I'm Irish mug, two free glasses of beer, and Irish-style hors d'oeuvres and desserts.\n\n==== Jazz Wine Train ====\nOn this out-and-back excursion in mid-March, riders 21 and older experience live jazz music in each coach. Guests receive meals and wine tastings provided by local Grapevine businesses, as well as bottled water and a souvenir wine glass.\n\n==== Witches Brew Train ====\nAnother 21 and older out-and-back trip, this excursion offers guests Halloween-themed food and entertainment, as well as two free glasses of craft beer in a souvenir stein. Costumes are highly encouraged on this run but not required.\n\n==== Trick 'r' Treat Trains ====\nA halloween themed excursion geared for the whole family.\n\n==== Additional Seasonal Excursions ====\nAlthough less popular, the Grapevine Vintage Railroad offers these themed excursions throughout the year: Christmas Wine Trains, After Christmas Trains, Spring Break Trains, Easter Bunny Train, Mother's Day Train, Memorial Day Train, Father's Day Train, Fourth of July Train, and Labor Day Train.\n\n==Locomotives<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grapevinetexasusa.com/grapevine-vintage-railroad/info/history/|title=Grapevine Vintage Railroad History {{!}} Historic Train Photos|website=www.grapevinetexasusa.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>==\n\n==== 'Vinny' #2199 ====\nVinny is a 1953 EMD GP7u diesel locomotive. Originally owned by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad]], it was purchased by the Grapevine Vintage Railroad in 2005. Vinny is the most used locomotive on the line while Puffy is out for repair.\n\n==== 'Puffy' #2248 ====\nBuilt by [[Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works|Cooke Locomotive Works]] in 1896, Puffy is the railroad's 4-6-0 steam locomotive. It was originally owned by the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] for mixed passenger and freight use in California. Later in her life, she was converted into a fire train, and eventually ended up as a ceremonial engine in a private collection. Although at one point Walt Disney was eyeing her for a project that never came to be, she ended up in the hands of the now-successful [[Texas State Railroad]] in 1976. In 1993 she joined the FWWR fleet.\n\nOver the past decade, Puffy has been plagued with issues, particularly with her cylinders. In the recent years, #2248 has been undergoing a complete rails-to-stack overhaul as part of her FRA inspection. Puffy is expected to return to service in 2020.\n\n==== #2014, #2016 ====\n<nowiki>#</nowiki>2014 and #2016 are two EMD FL9 diesel locomotives that have recently been acquired by the railroad.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

However, after the collapse of its domestic competitor Ansett Australia, it began a codeshare agreement with [[United Airlines]]. This allowed United customers to fly from the United States to any of Virgin Blue's Australian destinations that United did not already serve. In 2006, in an effort to compete with Qantas, Virgin Blue started exploring these relationships, forming frequent flyer agreements with [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Hawaiian Airlines]] and [[Malaysia Airlines]].

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

RED is fully touch-screen and handset controlled. There is no fee for use. RED features an extensive video on demand library that includes new release film, TV series and TV programmes. Destination guides are available. Other functions available through RED include music on demand (approx 200+ CD library) and video games. Seat-to-seat chat is available as well as in flight map and flight information.\n\nIn December 2012, Virgin Australia introduced an in-flight [[Wi-Fi]] system to provide music, movies and TV shows to tablets, smartphones, laptops and similar devices. The system, which does not offer internet access, is estimated to be fitted on all the airline's planes within 2 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.domesticflightaustralia.com/news/virgin-australia-to-provide-inflight-movies-music-via-on-board-wifi-20121224.php |title=Virgin Australia to Provide Inflight Movies, Music via On-Board WiFi |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Virgin Australia began upgrading the in-flight Wi-Fi system in order to offer wireless internet access.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). You also earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 'Program of the Year\" in the Middle East & Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddieawards.com/2015-annual-freddie-awards-27th/ |title=2015 Annual Freddie Awards (27th) Results |publisher=Freddie Awards |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete [[quadriplegia]] was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist.

It was the first of three Pacific voyages of which Cook was the commander. The aims of this first expedition were to observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun (3\u20134 of June  that year), and to seek evidence of the postulated ''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'' or \"undiscovered \nThe voyage was commissioned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and commanded by Lieutenant [[James Cook]], a junior naval officer with good skills in [[cartography]] and mathematics. Departing from [[Plymouth Dockyard]] in August 1768, the expedition crossed the Atlantic, rounded [[Cape Horn]] and reached [[Tahiti]] in time to observe the transit of Venus. Cook then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of [[Huahine]], [[Borabora]] and [[Raiatea]] to claim them for Great Britain,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and unsuccessfully attempting to land at [[Rurutu (Austral Islands)|Rurutu]]. In September 1769 the expedition reached [[New Zealand]], being the second Europeans to visit there, following the first European discovery by [[Abel Tasman]] 127 years earlier. Cook and his crew spent the following six months charting the New Zealand coast, before resuming their voyage westward across open sea. In April 1770 they became the first known Europeans to reach the east coast of [[Australia]], making landfall near present-day [[Point Hicks]], and then proceeding north to [[Botany Bay]].\n\nThe expedition continued northward along the Australian coastline, narrowly avoiding shipwreck on the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. In October 1770 the badly damaged ''Endeavour'' came into the port of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]], her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had discovered. They resumed their journey on 26 December, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] on 12 July. The voyage lasted almost three years.\n\nThe year following his return Cook set out on a [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]] of the Pacific, which lasted from 1772 to 1775. His [[Third voyage of James Cook|third and final voyage]] lasted from 1776 to 1779.\n\n==Conception==\nOn 16 February 1768 the [[Royal Society]] petitioned [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun to enable the measurement of the distance from the Earth to the Sun.<ref>{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=24}}</ref> Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the [[Admiralty]] elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (or \"unknown southern land\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Secret Instructions to Lieutenant Cook 30&nbsp;July 1768 (UK) |publisher=National Library of Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |accessdate=26 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721065703/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |archivedate=21 July 2008  }}</ref> The aims of the expedition were revealed in the press: \"To-morrow morning Mr. Banks, Dr. Solano [sic], with Mr. Green, the Astronomer, will set out for Deal, to embark on board the Endeavour, Capt.

The primary purpose of the observation was to obtain measurements that could be used to calculate more accurately the distance of [[Venus]] from the Sun. If this could be achieved, then the distances of the other planets could be worked out, based on their orbits. On the day of the transit observation, Cook recorded:\n\n<blockquote>Saturday {{not a typo|3<sup>rd</sup>}} This day prov'd as favourable to our purpose as we could wish, not a Clowd was to be seen the Whole day and the Air was perfectly clear, so that we had every advantage we could desire in Observing the whole of the passage of the Planet Venus over the Suns disk: we very distinctly saw an Atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the Planet which very much disturbed the times of the contacts particularly the two internal ones.

Their instrumentation was adequate by the standards of the time, but the resolution still could not eliminate the errors. When their results were later compared to those of the other observations of the same event made elsewhere for the exercise, the net result was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped.

However, they were [[Blown off course|forced to maintain a more northerly course owing to prevailing gales]], and sailed on until 19 April 1770 when land was sighted at 6&nbsp;a.m. The first land sighted near Present-day Point Hicks, was not, Cook's [[Point Hicks]]. Cook calculated that Van Diemen's Land ought to lie due south of their position, but having found the coastline trending to the south-west, recorded his doubt that this landmass was connected to it. This point was on the south-eastern coast of the [[Australia]]n continent, and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline. In his journal, Cook recorded the event thus:\n\n<blockquote>the Southermost Point of land we had in sight which bore from us W<small>1/4</small>S I judged to lay in the Latitude of 38\u00b0..0' S\u00b0 and in the Longitude of 211\u00b0..07' W<sup>&nbsp;t</sup> from the Meridian of Greenwich.

Cook's log used the nautical date, which, during the 18th&nbsp;century, assigned the same date to all ship's events from noon to noon, first p.m. and then a.m. That nautical date began twelve hours before the midnight beginning of the like-named civil date. Furthermore, Cook did not adjust his nautical date to account for circumnavigation of the globe until he had travelled a full 360\u00b0 relative to the [[longitude]] of his home British port, either toward the east or west. Because he travelled west on his first voyage, this a.m. nautical date was the morning of a civil date 14 hours slow relative to his home port (port\u221214h). Because the south-east coast of Australia is now regarded as being 10 hours ahead relative to Britain, that date is now called Friday, 20 April.<ref>Arthur R. Hinks, \"Nautical time and civil date\", ''The Geographical Journal'', '''86''' (1935) 153\u2013157.</ref>\n\nThe landmark of this sighting is generally reckoned to be a point lying about half-way between the present-day towns of [[Orbost, Victoria|Orbost]] and [[Mallacoota, Victoria|Mallacoota]] on the south-eastern coast of the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. A survey done in 1843 ignored or overlooked Cook's earlier naming of the point, giving it the name Cape Everard.

However, almost 18 years later, when Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] and the [[First Fleet]] arrived in early 1788 to establish an outpost and [[penal colony]], they found that the bay and surrounds did not live up to the promising picture that had been painted. Instead, Phillip gave orders to relocate to a harbour a few kilometres to the north, which Cook had named [[Port Jackson]] but had not further explored. It was in this harbour, at a place Phillip named [[Sydney Cove]], that the settlement of [[Sydney]] was established. The settlement was for some time afterwards still referred to generally as Botany Bay.

Without leaving the ship, he named it Cape York and departed the east coast. Turning west, he nursed the battered ship through the dangerously shallow waters of [[Torres Strait]], earlier navigated by [[Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres]] in 1606. Searching for a high vantage point, Cook saw a steep hill on a nearby island from the top of which he hoped to see \"a passage into the Indian Seas\". Cook named the island [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]], where he claimed the entire eastern coastline that he had just explored as British territory.<ref>Cook, James, Journal of the HMS Endeavour, 1768-1771, National Library of Australia, Manuscripts Collection, MS 1, 22 August 1770</ref>\n\nIn negotiating the [[Torres Strait]] past [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], Cook also put an end to the speculation that New Holland and [[New Guinea]] were part of the same land mass.<ref name=\"three\">G.

Adhering to Royal Navy policy introduced in 1747, <!-- Note. See our Scurvy article regarding this. --> Cook persuaded his men to eat foods such as [[citrus]] [[fruit]]s and [[sauerkraut]]. At that time it was known that poor diet caused scurvy but not specifically that a [[vitamin C]] deficiency was the culprit.\n\nSailors of the day were notoriously against innovation, and at first the men would not eat the sauerkraut.

Cook named [[Sp\u00f6ring Island]] off the coast of [[New Zealand]] to honour Herman Sp\u00f6ring and his work on the voyage.\n\nCook then rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and stopped at [[Saint Helena]]. On 10 July 1771 [[Nicholas Young (sailor)|Nicholas Young]], the boy who had first seen New Zealand, sighted England (specifically [[the Lizard]]) again for the first time, and ''Endeavour'' sailed up the [[English Channel]], passing [[Beachy Head]] at 6&nbsp;am on 12 July; that afternoon ''Endeavour'' anchored in [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]], and Cook went ashore at [[Deal, Kent]].

Hawkesworth edited the journals of Byron, Wallis and Carteret into separate accounts as volume I and then blended Cook's and Joseph Banks' journals with some of his own sentiments and produced a single first-person narrative that appeared to be the words of Cook, as Volume II.<ref>{{harvnb|Villiers |1967|p=151}}</ref> The book appeared in 1773 as three volumes with the title:\n\n{{quote|AN ACCOUNT OF THE VOYAGES undertaken by Order of His Present Majesty for making Discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere, and successively performed by Commodore Byron, Captain Wallis, Captain Carteret and Captain Cook, in the Dolphin, the Swallow and the Endeavour: Drawn up from the Journals which were kept by the several Commanders, and from the Papers of Joseph Banks, Esq.; by John Hawkesworth, LL.D.

It was the first of three Pacific voyages of which Cook was the commander. The aims of this first expedition were to observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun (3\u20134 of June  that year), and to seek evidence of the postulated ''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'' or \"undiscovered southern land\".\n\nThe voyage was commissioned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and commanded by Lieutenant [[James Cook]], a junior naval officer with good skills in [[cartography]] and mathematics. Departing from [[Plymouth Dockyard]] in August 1768, the expedition crossed the Atlantic, rounded [[Cape Horn]] and reached [[Tahiti]] in time to observe the transit of Venus. Cook then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of [[Huahine]], [[Borabora]] and [[Raiatea]] to claim them for Great Britain,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and unsuccessfully attempting to land at [[Rurutu (Austral Islands)|Rurutu]]. In September 1769 the expedition reached [[New Zealand]], being the second Europeans to visit there, following the first European discovery by [[Abel Tasman]] 127 years earlier. Cook and his crew spent the following six months charting the New Zealand coast, before resuming their voyage westward across open sea. In April 1770 they became the first known Europeans to reach the east coast of [[Australia]], making landfall near present-day [[Point Hicks]], and then proceeding north to [[Botany Bay]].\n\nThe expedition continued northward along the Australian coastline, narrowly avoiding shipwreck on the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. In October 1770 the badly damaged ''Endeavour'' came into the port of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]], her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had discovered. They resumed their journey on 26 December, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] on 12 July. The voyage lasted almost three years.\n\nThe year following his return Cook set out on a [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]] of the Pacific, which lasted from 1772 to 1775. His [[Third voyage of James Cook|third and final voyage]] lasted from 1776 to 1779.\n\n==Conception==\nOn 16 February 1768 the [[Royal Society]] petitioned [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun to enable the measurement of the distance from the Earth to the Sun.<ref>{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=24}}</ref> Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the [[Admiralty]] elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (or \"unknown southern land\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Secret Instructions to Lieutenant Cook 30&nbsp;July 1768 (UK) |publisher=National Library of Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |accessdate=26 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721065703/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |archivedate=21 July 2008  }}</ref> The aims of the expedition were revealed in the press: \"To-morrow morning Mr. Banks, Dr. Solano [sic], with Mr. Green, the Astronomer, will set out for Deal, to embark on board the Endeavour, Capt.

The transit was scheduled to occur on 3 June, and in the meantime he commissioned the building of a small [[Fortification|fort]] and [[observatory]] at what is now known as [[Point Venus]].\n\nThe [[astronomer]] appointed to the task was [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]], assistant to the recently appointed [[Astronomer Royal]], [[Nevil Maskelyne]]. The primary purpose of the observation was to obtain measurements that could be used to calculate more accurately the distance of [[Venus]] from the Sun. If this could be achieved, then the distances of the other planets could be worked out, based on their orbits. On the day of the transit observation, Cook recorded:\n\n<blockquote>Saturday {{not a typo|3<sup>rd</sup>}} This day prov'd as favourable to our purpose as we could wish, not a Clowd was to be seen the Whole day and the Air was perfectly clear, so that we had every advantage we could desire in Observing the whole of the passage of the Planet Venus over the Suns disk: we very distinctly saw an Atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the Planet which very much disturbed the times of the contacts particularly the two internal ones.

Their instrumentation was adequate by the standards of the time, but the resolution still could not eliminate the errors. When their results were later compared to those of the other observations of the same event made elsewhere for the exercise, the net result was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped.

However, they were [[Blown off course|forced to maintain a more northerly course owing to prevailing gales]], and sailed on until 19 April 1770 when land was sighted at 6&nbsp;a.m. The first land sighted near Present-day Point Hicks, was not, Cook's [[Point Hicks]]. Cook calculated that Van Diemen's Land ought to lie due south of their position, but having found the coastline trending to the south-west, recorded his doubt that this landmass was connected to it. This point was on the south-eastern coast of the [[Australia]]n continent, and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline. In his journal, Cook recorded the event thus:\n\n<blockquote>the Southermost Point of land we had in sight which bore from us W<small>1/4</small>S I judged to lay in the Latitude of 38\u00b0..0' S\u00b0 and in the Longitude of 211\u00b0..07' W<sup>&nbsp;t</sup> from the Meridian of Greenwich.

Cook's log used the nautical date, which, during the 18th&nbsp;century, assigned the same date to all ship's events from noon to noon, first p.m. and then a.m. That nautical date began twelve hours before the midnight beginning of the like-named civil date. Furthermore, Cook did not adjust his nautical date to account for circumnavigation of the globe until he had travelled a full 360\u00b0 relative to the [[longitude]] of his home British port, either toward the east or west. Because he travelled west on his first voyage, this a.m. nautical date was the morning of a civil date 14 hours slow relative to his home port (port\u221214h). Because the south-east coast of Australia is now regarded as being 10 hours ahead relative to Britain, that date is now called Friday, 20 April.<ref>Arthur R. Hinks, \"Nautical time and civil date\", ''The Geographical Journal'', '''86''' (1935) 153\u2013157.</ref>\n\nThe landmark of this sighting is generally reckoned to be a point lying about half-way between the present-day towns of [[Orbost, Victoria|Orbost]] and [[Mallacoota, Victoria|Mallacoota]] on the south-eastern coast of the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. A survey done in 1843 ignored or overlooked Cook's earlier naming of the point, giving it the name Cape Everard.

A little over a week later, they came across an extensive but shallow inlet, and upon entering it moored off a low headland fronted by sand dunes. James Cook and crew made their first landing on the continent, at a place now known as [[Botany Bay]], on [[Silver Beach (Kurnell)|Kurnell Peninsula]] and made contact of a hostile nature with the [[Gweagal]] Aborigines, on 29 April.{{Ref|date|[b]}} At first Cook bestowed the name \"Sting-Ray Harbour\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url= http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700506.html |title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries, 6 May 1770 |accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> to the inlet after the many such creatures found there; this was later changed to \"Botanist Bay\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and finally ''[[Botany Bay]]'' after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists [[Joseph Banks]], [[Daniel Solander]] and [[Herman Sp\u00f6ring]].\n\n[[File:Kurnell Cook Landing Plaque.JPG|thumb|upright|Captain Cook [[Kurnell, New South Wales|landing place plaque]]]]\nThis first landing site was later to be promoted (particularly by Joseph Banks) as a suitable candidate for situating a settlement and [[British colony|British colonial]] outpost. However, almost 18 years later, when Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] and the [[First Fleet]] arrived in early 1788 to establish an outpost and [[penal colony]], they found that the bay and surrounds did not live up to the promising picture that had been painted. Instead, Phillip gave orders to relocate to a harbour a few kilometres to the north, which Cook had named [[Port Jackson]] but had not further explored. It was in this harbour, at a place Phillip named [[Sydney Cove]], that the settlement of [[Sydney]] was established. The settlement was for some time afterwards still referred to generally as Botany Bay. The expedition's scientific members commenced the first European scientific documentation of [[Australian fauna]] and [[Australian flora|flora]].\n\nAt Cook's original landing contact was made with the local [[Australian Aboriginal]] inhabitants. As the ship sailed into the harbour, they noticed Aborigines on both of the headlands. At about 2 pm they put the anchor down near a group of six to eight huts.

Without leaving the ship, he named it Cape York and departed the east coast. Turning west, he nursed the battered ship through the dangerously shallow waters of [[Torres Strait]], earlier navigated by [[Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres]] in 1606. Searching for a high vantage point, Cook saw a steep hill on a nearby island from the top of which he hoped to see \"a passage into the Indian Seas\". Cook named the island [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]], where he claimed the entire eastern coastline that he had just explored as British territory.<ref>Cook, James, Journal of the HMS Endeavour, 1768-1771, National Library of Australia, Manuscripts Collection, MS 1, 22 August 1770</ref>\n\nIn negotiating the [[Torres Strait]] past [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], Cook also put an end to the speculation that New Holland and [[New Guinea]] were part of the same land mass.<ref name=\"three\">G.

Adhering to Royal Navy policy introduced in 1747, <!-- Note. See our Scurvy article regarding this. --> Cook persuaded his men to eat foods such as [[citrus]] [[fruit]]s and [[sauerkraut]]. At that time it was known that poor diet caused scurvy but not specifically that a [[vitamin C]] deficiency was the culprit.\n\nSailors of the day were notoriously against innovation, and at first the men would not eat the sauerkraut. Cook used a \"method I never once knew to fail with seamen.\"<ref name=\"Beaglehole74\">{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1968|p=74}}</ref> He ordered it served to himself and the officers, and left an option for crew who wanted some. Within a week of seeing their superiors set a value on it the demand was so great a ration had to be instituted.<ref name=\"Beaglehole74\"/> In other cases, however, Cook resorted to traditional naval discipline. \"Punished Henry Stephens, Seaman, and Thomas Dunster, Marine, with twelve lashes each for refusing to take their allowance of fresh beef.\"<ref>Wilcox, Ten Who Dared at 97 (Boston: Little, Brown & Co. 1977).</ref>\n\nCook's general approach was essentially empirical, encouraging as broad a diet as circumstances permitted, and collecting such [[Tetragonia tetragonoides|greens]] as could be had when making landfall. All onboard ate the same food, with Cook specifically dividing equally anything that could be divided (and indeed recommending that practice to any commander \u2013 journal 4 August 1770).\n\nTwo cases of scurvy did occur on board, astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]] and a [[Tahiti]] navigator [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]] were treated, but Cook was able to proudly record that upon reaching [[Jakarta|Batavia]] he had \"not one man upon the sick list\" (journal 15 October 1770), unlike so many voyages that reached that port with much of the crew suffering illness.\n\n==Homeward voyage==\n[[File:Track of Endeavour.jpg|thumb|Route of ''Endeavour'' from the Torres Strait to Java, August and September 1770]]\n''Endeavour'' then visited the island of [[Savu]], staying for three days before continuing on to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], the capital of the [[Dutch East Indies]], to put in for repairs. Batavia was known for its outbreaks of [[malaria]], and before they returned home in 1771 many in Cook's company succumbed to the disease and other ailments such as [[dysentery]], including the Tahitian [[Tupaia (priest)|Tupaia]], Banks' [[Finland|Finnish]] secretary and fellow scientist [[Herman Sp\u00f6ring]], astronomer Charles Green, and the illustrator [[Sydney Parkinson]]. Cook named [[Sp\u00f6ring Island]] off the coast of [[New Zealand]] to honour Herman Sp\u00f6ring and his work on the voyage.\n\nCook then rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and stopped at [[Saint Helena]]. On 10 July 1771 [[Nicholas Young (sailor)|Nicholas Young]], the boy who had first seen New Zealand, sighted England (specifically [[the Lizard]]) again for the first time, and ''Endeavour'' sailed up the [[English Channel]], passing [[Beachy Head]] at 6&nbsp;am on 12 July; that afternoon ''Endeavour'' anchored in [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]], and Cook went ashore at [[Deal, Kent]].

Hawkesworth edited the journals of Byron, Wallis and Carteret into separate accounts as volume I and then blended Cook's and Joseph Banks' journals with some of his own sentiments and produced a single first-person narrative that appeared to be the words of Cook, as Volume II.<ref>{{harvnb|Villiers |1967|p=151}}</ref> The book appeared in 1773 as three volumes with the title:\n\n{{quote|AN ACCOUNT OF THE VOYAGES undertaken by Order of His Present Majesty for making Discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere, and successively performed by Commodore Byron, Captain Wallis, Captain Carteret and Captain Cook, in the Dolphin, the Swallow and the Endeavour: Drawn up from the Journals which were kept by the several Commanders, and from the Papers of Joseph Banks, Esq.; by John Hawkesworth, LL.D.

In a September 2012 interview with Barbara Pyle and co-developer Nicholas Boxer, it was stated that the Hope Island was located near the [[Bahamas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://interviewly.com/i/barbara-pyle-sep-2012-reddit|title=We are Barbara Pyle and Nick Boxer, Co-creators and Exec.

It lasted for three seasons under the name ''Captain Planet and the Planeteers'' (produced by [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS Productions]] and [[DiC]]).\n\nThe show's intro theme was composed by Tom Worrall. The ending theme (maintained by both DIC and Hanna-Barbera's versions) is considered one of the most memorable parts of the series due to its catchy main chorus and rock track (\"''Captain Planet, he's our hero, gonna take pollution down to zero''\"). Its lyrics were written by show producer Nick Boxer<ref>[http://www.mnn.com/family/raising-a-family/mnntv/captain-planet/captain-planet-the-theme-song Captain Planet: The theme song] Mother Nature Network</ref> and is performed by Murray McFadden and Timothy Mulhollan. During the end credits, James Coburn, in character as Looten Plunder, utters the line \"You'll pay for this, Captain Planet.\". This is then followed by a rap from the voice actors of the Planeteers. It is akin to [[New Kids On The Block]]'s \"[[Step by Step (New Kids on the Block song)|Step By Step]]\".\n\n=== Hanna-Barbera history (1993\u20131996) ===\nIn 1993, the show saw a production company switch, changing the title to '''''The New Adventures of Captain Planet''''' (produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Cartoons]], which was acquired by Turner in 1991). During this time, it aired as part of TBS' '' Sunday Morning In Front Of The TV '' block, alongside fellow H-B toons ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'' and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''. This series revealed more of the past of each of the characters and expanded on it dramatically. The tone of these episodes was more mature than the initial series. The animation style was altered.\n\nThe DiC seasons' synth-rock soundtrack was replaced by a large number of orchestral pieces, and while the end credits theme was retained, the ending sequence now showcased footage from the Hanna-Barbera episodes. Full-time voice actors replaced most of the major celebrities that had voiced Gaia and the Eco-Villains during the DiC seasons. The opening narration was spoken by [[David Coburn (actor)|David Coburn]] (Captain Planet) rather than [[LeVar Burton]] (Kwame) and, in the final season, was replaced by a [[Rapping|rap]] by [[Fred Schneider]] of [[The B-52's]].\n\n=== Legacy ===\nThe ''Captain Planet Foundation (CPF)'' was founded in 1991, when series producer Barbara Pyle negotiated a percentage of the show's merchandising revenue to empower young people. The concept allowed schools and organizations around the world to present their environmental projects to the Foundation and receive seed money to grow their ideas. In 2001, [[Time Warner]] decided to shut down the CPF due to a challenging merger with [[AOL]]. Laura Seydel and her husband Rutherford Seydel worked with Time Warner to orchestrate the transition of the [[Private foundation (United States)|corporate foundation]] to a public charity - the Captain Planet Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://captainplanetfoundation.org|title=Captain Planet Foundation {{!}} Supporting Environmental Education|website=captainplanetfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=April 18, 2017}}</ref> In 2007, CPF acquired the rights to exhibit previous episodes of Captain Planet and the Planeteers online and on-air, thus \"allowing this valuable resource to reach out and educate the children of today!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://captainplanetfoundation.org/about/our-story/|title=Our Story|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Captain Planet Foundation|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the organization's board is chaired by Laura Turner Seydel, daughter of [[Ted Turner]]; the board includes [[Barbara Pyle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://captainplanetfoundation.org/board/|title=Board|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Captain Planet Foundation|accessdate=|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Educational goals ==\nVarious episodes were constructed to touch on relevant themes to a modern audience.\n* \"'''''Mind Pollution'''''\"\nThe episode titled \"Mind Pollution\" (1991) was notable<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ramblingbeachcat.com/2011/12/terrifying-moments-in-childrens.html|title=Terrifying moments in children's television|website=Rambling Beach Cat|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> for dealing with the issue of drug abuse. This was explained by the fact that the characters thought of drug addiction as \"pollution of the mind\". The episode revolved around an epidemic of a designer drug known as \"Bliss\" created by [[Verminous Skumm]]. It included a scene of Linka's cousin Boris jumping through a window and dying from a drug overdose.\n\n* \"'''''A Formula for Hate'''''\"\nThe episode titled \"A Formula for Hate\" (1992) was also unusual for the series in that it was the first episode in an American children's animated series to directly deal with the [[HIV/AIDS]] pandemic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-21/entertainment/ca-626_1_captain-planet|title='Capt.

Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five magic rings to five special young people: Kwame, from Africa, with the power of Earth... From North America, Wheeler, with the power of Fire... From the Soviet Union/Eastern Europe, Linka, with the power of Wind. From Asia, Gi, with the power of Water... and from South America, Ma-Ti, with the power of Heart. When the five powers combine, they summon Earth's greatest champion, Captain Planet.|Opening Narration}}\nEvery episode is followed up with at least one \"''Planeteer Alert''\" clip, often connected to the plot, where environmental-political and other social-political issues are discussed and how the viewer can contribute and be part of \"the solution\" rather than \"the pollution\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.fcc.gov/mediabureau/v01/tv/application/KidVid_72709.html|title=Children's Television Programming Report|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|language=English|date=December 30, 2006|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===Gaia===\n'''[[Gaia]]''' (voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] in 1990\u20131992, [[Margot Kidder]] in 1993\u20131996), the spirit of the planet, sends five magic rings, four with the power to control an [[Classical element#Classical elements in Greece|element of nature]] and one controlling the element of Heart, to five chosen youths across the globe. She claims to have been asleep for the entire 20th Century and awakens to see a more polluted world than when she was last awake, however this is contrasted with a flashback episode to the 1920s where people get guidance from Gaia.\n\nHer appearance seems to be a mixture of attractive women of all races, and is often seen as an intangible spirit. However, in cases of serious problems, Gaia gains corporeal form, which puts her in danger of death. In one episode where her rival Zarm had defeated her, Gaia was shown as an old, frail woman, with Zarm explaining that given the Earth's several billion years of existence, it would make sense for Gaia to be superannuated in appearance.\n\n===Captain Planet===\nIn situations that the Planeteers cannot resolve alone, they can combine their powers to summon the titular '''Captain Planet''' (voiced by [[David Coburn (actor)|David Coburn]]), a superhero who possesses all of their powers magnified. Once his work is done, Captain Planet returns to the planet, and leaves viewers with the message: \"The power is yours!\" Typically Planet only manifests to deal with the bigger crisis and then departs, but a few storylines have explored him existing beyond these moments, such as when he was summoned while Kwame and Ma-Ti were in space, with the result that the energy from their rings that created Planet could not return to its source, resulting in Planet being forced to operate on a human level, such as requiring a crowbar and handcuff keys to rescue the rest of the team.\n\n===Planeteers===\n[[Image:ThePlaneteers.JPG|thumb|The Planeteers. Clockwise from top left: Gai, Kwame, Linka, Ma-Ti, and Wheeler.]]\n* '''Kwame''' (voiced by [[LeVar Burton]]) - Hailing from [[Ghana]],<ref name=\"Captain Planet: Meet the characters\">[http://www.mnn.com/family/family-activities/mnntv/captain-planet/captain-planet-meet-the-characters Captain Planet: Meet the characters] Mother Nature Network</ref> [[Africa]], Kwame possesses the power of [[soil|Earth]]. The unofficial leader of the Planeteers.\n* '''Wheeler''' (voiced by [[Joey Dedio]]) - From [[New York City|New York]], [[United States|U.S.A]], Wheeler controls the power of [[fire]]. \n* '''Linka''' (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) - From the [[Soviet Union]] (in later episodes stated as being from [[Russia]] after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the communist regime's collapse]]), Linka has the power of [[wind]].\n* '''Gi''' (voiced by [[Janice Kawaye]]) - Hailing from [[South Korea]], Gi controls the power of [[water]]. \n* '''Ma-Ti''' (voiced by [[Scott Menville]]) - From the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] of [[Brazil]] Ma-Ti wields the power of [[Kindness|heart]].\n** '''Suchi''' (vocal effects provided by [[Frank Welker]]) - Ma-Ti's pet monkey.\n\nThese five are dubbed the ''Planeteers'' and are tasked with helping defend the planet from environmental disasters and making efforts to educate humankind to keep others from happening. In the beginning of the episodes, Gaia uses her \"Planet Vision\" in the Crystal Chamber to discover where the most devastating destruction is occurring (in most episodes one or more of the Eco-Villains is behind it) and sends the Planeteers to help solve the problem. The Planeteers use transportation (usually a flying machine called a Geo-Cruiser) based on [[solar power]] to avoid causing [[pollution]] themselves.\n\n===Villains===\n====Eco-Villains====\n[[Image:Eco-Villains_United.png|thumb|right|The Eco-Villains. Clockwise from left: Dr. Blight, Verminous Skumm, Duke Nukem, Hoggish Greedly, Zarm, Looten Plunder, and Sly Sludge as seen in \"Summit to Save Earth\" Pt. 1.]]\nThe '''Eco-Villains''' are a small group of antagonists who cause danger to the planet through pollution, deforestation, poaching, and other environmentally unsafe activities. They enjoy the destruction they cause to the planet and the harm they bring to obtain wealth, land, or power. They tend to work alone most of the time, although they're willing to work with one another when it suits their plans. Only in the two-part episode \"Summit to Save Earth\" did the entire ensemble of Eco-Villains work as a team, with Zarm as the leader. Each of these villains represents a specific way of thought that can cause ecological problems.\n\n* '''Hoggish Greedly''' (voiced by [[Ed Asner]]) \u2013 A [[pig]]-like human who represents the dangers of [[overconsumption]] and greed, Hoggish is the first villain Captain Planet and the Planeteers encounter. In the episode \"Smog Hog\", it's revealed Hoggish has a son named Hoggish Greedly Jr. (Voiced by Jacob Doughty) who appears only once. In the episode \"Hog Tide,\" it is revealed that he has a grandfather named Don Porkaloin (portrayed as a parody of [[Vito Corleone]] from ''[[The Godfather]]'') who in the past was defeated by another group of Planeteers. Unlike Hoggish Greedly, Porkaloin became environmentally friendly as shown in the episode \"The Ghost of Porkaloin Past\".\n** '''Rigger''' (voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]]) - Greedly's main henchman. He once claimed that the main reason he works for Greedly is because no one else would hire him. He does sometime question Greedly's orders and shows concern when Greedly's actions hurt the environment though it never has any effect on his boss, and Rigger, for the most part, remains loyal to Greedly. Rigger does all the leg-work while Greedly usually sits around and eats.\n* '''Verminous Skumm''' (voiced by [[Jeff Goldblum]] in 1990, [[Maurice LaMarche]] in 1991\u20131995) \u2013 The second villain to appear on the series, he is a part-human, part-[[rat]] creature; he represents urban blight, disease, and drug abuse. Skumm can control rats and has his own personal [[helicopter]] called The Scum O'Copter. Skumm is responsible for the death of Linka's cousin Boris via drugs in the episode \"Mind Pollution.\"\n** '''Rat Pack''' - A group of humanoid rats that work for Verminous Skumm.\n* '''Duke Nukem''' (voiced by [[Dean Stockwell]] in 1990\u20131992, [[Maurice LaMarche]] in 1993\u20131995) \u2013 A doctor who changed himself into a radioactive [[Mutants in fiction|mutant]] who represents the misuse of [[nuclear power]], and the third villain to appear. He is one of the few Eco-Villains, along with Zarm and Captain Pollution, able to battle Captain Planet one-on-one. Nukem generates radiation to fire off radioactive blasts from his hands and possesses X-Ray vision. [[3D Realms|Apogee]] temporarily renamed the eponymous character of the [[Duke Nukem (1991 video game)|Duke Nukem]] computer game franchise to 'Duke Nukum' so as to avoid any possible trademark claims they could face from the producers of Captain Planet. The character was later found to be under no trademark and the games were restored to their original titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/duke1/index.html |title=3D Realms Site: Duke Nukem I |publisher=3drealms.com |date=July 1, 1991 |accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref>\n** '''Leadsuit''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) - Duke Nukem's henchman, Leadsuit's name defines his appearance as he wears a full-bodied lead suit in order to withstand the radiation released by Duke Nukem's body. He revealed that he works for Duke Nukem because when Nukem takes over the world, he'll get to be second in command. Leadsuit is timid, rarely arguing with Nukem (and always losing if he objects to anything). Leadsuit is afraid of the dark, and usually gives in at the slightest trouble.\n* '''Dr. Blight''' (voiced by [[Meg Ryan]] in 1990-1991, [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in 1992\u20131996, Tessa Auberjonois in ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]'') \u2013 The fourth villain revealed, Dr. Blight is a [[mad scientist]] who represents the dangers of uncontrolled [[technology]] and unethical [[scientific experimentation]]. As a result of self-experimentation, the left half of her face is horribly scarred; this is usually hidden by her hair. In the episode \"Hog Tide,\" it is revealed that Dr. Blight had a grandmother named Betty Blight who assisted Don Porkaloin in his plot. In the episode \"Hollywaste\", it is revealed that Dr. Blight has a sister named Bambi (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]). Bambi calls Blight by her first name \"Babs\", a shortened form of \"Barbara\".\n** '''MAL 9000''' (voiced by [[David Rappaport]] in 1990, [[Tim Curry]] in 1991-1996) - Dr. Blight's [[Artificial intellligence|A.I.]] computer husband and henchman. He has the ability to hack into other computer systems, take over them and reprogram them mainly to Dr. Blight's specifications. MAL is often the control and main power source of everything in Dr. Blight's labs as well as the vehicles she travels in.\n* '''Looten Plunder''' (voiced by [[James Coburn]] in 1990\u20131992, [[Ed Gilbert]] in 1993\u20131996) \u2013 A wealthy [[Poaching|poacher]] and crooked businessman who represents the evils of unethical business actions. Looten is the sixth villain to appear on ''Captain Planet'' in the seventh episode, \"The Last of Her Kind\". He is also shown to have a nephew named Robin Plunder. His name was a play on the term \"Loot and Plunder\", and he was always in the ending credits of every episode when the singer mentioned \"Bad guys who like to...loot and plunder!\", taken from footage of one episode where a disshelved Plunder sees his scheme in ruins and screams \"You will pay for this, Captain Planet!\"\n** '''Argos Bleak''' (voiced by [[S. Scott Bullock]]) - Looten Plunder's main henchman and [[bodyguard]], he also functions as a [[mercenary]] and carries out most of Plunder's dirty work. He seems to have a military background as he is seen in many episodes flying helicopters or other aircraft, and is proficient in handling firearms. Argos even got his own episode \"The Preditor\", where he appeared without his boss to hunt down sharks. Another time where Plunder conspired with Hoggish Greedily, Argos Bleak was seen arguing with Rigger as to who was the better Eco-Villain.\n** '''Pinehead Brothers''' (voiced by [[Richard Gautier|Dick Gautier]] and [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Oakey and Dokey are two oversized [[lumberjack]]s that are Looten Plunder's henchmen in the final season of \"The New Adventures of Captain Planet.\"\n* '''Sly Sludge''' (voiced by [[Martin Sheen]] in 1990\u20131992, [[Jim Cummings]] in 1993\u20131995) \u2013 An unscrupulous [[waste collector]] who represents laziness, ignorance, and the dangers of apathy and short-term thinking. However, as many of his schemes involve waste management, which is a legitimate environmental issue, he often uses that to gain apparent respectability. Sludge is the last villain to be revealed. He is also the only villain to defect to the Planeteers where a recycling program of his makes a lot of money by the end of \"No Small Problem\" enabling Sludge to propose plans to mass-produce an affordable, eco-friendly way to safely dispose of waste.\n** '''Ooze''' (voiced by [[Cam Clarke]]) - Sly Sludge's henchman.\n** '''Tank Flusher III''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Sly Sludge's [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] servant who makes his debut in \"The New Adventures of Captain Planet\" episode \"A Mine is a Terrible Thing to Waste\" Pt. 1.\n* '''Zarm''' (voiced by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] in 1990\u20131992, [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] in 1993, [[Malcolm McDowell]] in 1994\u20131995) \u2013 A former spirit of the planet who left Gaia in search of other worlds and ended up laying other populous planets to ruin lacking Gaia to balance out his methods. He represents [[war]] and [[wikt:destroy|destruction]]. Even though Zarm does not have any henchmen of his own, he would often manipulate other people to do his bidding. He once united Hoggish Greedly, Looten Plunder, Sly Sludge, Duke Nukem, Verminous Skumm, and Dr. Blight under his leadership in the two-part episode \"Summit to Save Earth.\" Other times he recruits and manipulates others, even the Planeteers, to work for him. Zarm is the fifth Eco-Villain to appear in the series, having his first appearance in the sixth episode. Outside of war and destruction, Zarm promoted hatred and [[totalitarianism]], which he believed were the most dangerous pollutants to mankind, as evidenced by his acting as [[kingmaker]] to a dictator named Morgar. Zarm admits he has been a guiding force for every despot of the 20th Century, but admits one of them actually declined his help, and challenges the Planeteers to guess who, saying \"I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.\"\n\n====Captain Pollution====\nA polluting counterpart to Captain Planet named '''Captain Pollution''' (voiced by [[David Coburn (actor)|David Coburn]]) appears in the two-part episode \"Mission to Save Earth\" when Lic. Andres Gatti steals the Planeteers' rings, creates polluting duplicates of them, and distributes the duplicates to most of the other Eco-villains. Each Eco-villain received a specific ring:  captain Pollution was voiced by David Coburn, who voiced Captain Planet.\n\n* Duke Nukem has a Super Radiation Ring (counterpart of Fire).\n* Looten Plunder has a [[Deforestation]] Ring (counterpart of Earth).\n* Sly Sludge has a [[Smog]] Ring (counterpart of Wind).\n* Verminous Skumm has a [[Toxicity|Toxics]] Ring (counterpart of Water).\n* Dr. Blight has a [[Hatred|Hate]] Ring (counterpart of Heart).\n\nEach of the evil rings has malevolent faces on them, in contrast to the more element-themed Planeteer rings. Captain Pollution is weakened when he is in contact with pure elements such as clean water or sunlight, while he gains power from contact with pollutants, being able to absorb pollutant and emit radioactive rays (and is later shown to gain limitless power when in contact with pollutants after his resurrection). When he is summoned he says \"By your polluting powers combined, I am Captain Pollution! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!\", and when he disappears, he declares \"The polluting power is yours!\"\n\nIn his first appearance, he is sent by the Eco-villains to destroy the Planeteers but gets chased off by Commander Clash, and after a fight with Captain Planet, he returns to the evil rings causing them to explode. In the two-part episode \"A Mine is a Terrible Thing to Waste\", Captain Pollution is brought back to life by toxins of the five evil rings that seep into the planet.\n\nCaptain Pollution is Captain Planet's polar opposite in personality as well as power. In contrast to Planet's generous and altruistic nature, Pollution is lazy, vengeful, and arrogant, seeing himself as a god and his creators as servants rather than partners. Captain Planet sums up the difference in their outlook during their first battle by taunting that the Planeteers have no boss - they are a team - and this is why Pollution will always lose.\n\nCaptain Pollution resembles Captain Planet, but his skin is pale yellow and covered in brown lesions. His hair is red and styled in a [[Widow's peak]] and he has red eyes. His costume is the same color and style as Planet's, but the globe on his chest is torn in the middle. His voice has a [[California English|California]] [[Valleyspeak|Valley twang]] to it. Captain Pollution is defeated twice by Captain Planet; first in \"Mission to Save Earth\" by being rammed through earth, lava, air and water, and then again in \"A Mine is a Terrible Thing to Waste\" by being tricked into going into an underground magma chamber.\n\n===Other villains===\n* '''The Slaughters''' - A family of poachers who made their debut in \"The New Adventures of Captain Planet.\" The Slaughters represent the endangerment of animals and the evils of poaching and are often in direct monetary competition with Looten Plunder. Mame and her family once collaborated with Looten Plunder and Argos Bleak in the episode \"Horns A'Plenty\" when the Planeteers ruined each one's rhinoceros poaching.\n** '''Mame Slaughter''' (voiced by [[Theresa Saldana]] in the first appearance, [[Mitzi McCall]] in the second appearance) - The leader of the Slaughters\n** '''Stalker Slaughter''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) \u2013 One of Mame's sons and her second-in-command.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Captain Planet episodes}}\n\n==Franchise extension==\nPyle and Boxer demanded that the series' merchandise be made sustainably; because of this, several of the companies producing ''Captain Planet''-themed merchandise had to completely overhaul their means of production to manufacture recycled and recyclable products.\n\n===Toys===\nAs with many popular cartoons, ''Captain Planet'' had a line of action figures and vehicles. Released by [[Tiger Toys]] in 1990, the line ran for several years, long enough to tie into the ''New Adventures'' series. The toys were repackaged and sold by Grand Toys in Canada and [[Kenner]] throughout Europe. The toys were of average poseability, with the common five points&nbsp;\u2013 neck, shoulders, and hips.\n\nFinding a comprehensive list of what was released is difficult, since not all toys shown in the initial retailer catalog were even released. The collector's market is small, the toys being somewhat rare on [[eBay]]. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20170426161206/http://www.captainplanetfdn.org/ Captain Planet Foundation] still sells a small number of them online, however. There may have also been further foreign variations of certain toys which may be even more difficult to catalog. Various toys from the ''New Adventures'' waves are not as likely to be well known.\n\nThe five Planeteers, five Eco-Villains, Commander Clash, and several versions of Captain Planet, each with a different gimmick or paint scheme, were released, along with several vehicles. A toy ring with lights and sound and interchangeable lenses for the five elements was also released. Four small vehicles were also sold through a [[Burger King]] promotion.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Marvel Comics]] published a short-lived comic series for 12 issues to tie into the show; however, the comics were a separate continuity. While not effectively part of the [[Marvel Universe]], issue #4's cover was a parody of the cover to ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' issue #1.\n\n===Video games===\n{{main|Captain Planet and the Planeteers (video game)}}\n\nA video game based on the series was developed for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape]] called ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers (video game)|Captain Planet]]''. The game, which involved a good deal of shooting, received negative reviews from game critics and thus a [[Sega Mega Drive]] (Genesis) version of the game was cancelled. A separate side-scrolling game was developed by [[Novalogic]] for the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], but only saw release in Europe and Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/captain-planet-and-the-planeteers-|title=Captain Planet and the Planeteers on MobyGames|accessdate=August 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]] and Nick Bruty developed a [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] game using the license, a 3-level shoot 'em up. A game was also released in 1990 for the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]], written by [[Tony Crowther]]. This was a platform game and was briefly bundled with the [[Amiga 500]] \"Cartoon Classics\" pack released in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a7sH_jz1bg |title=Amiga Longplay Captain Planet and the Planeteers |publisher=YouTube |date=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref> A [[Commodore 64]] game was in development but never released.

In a September 2012 interview with Barbara Pyle and co-developer Nicholas Boxer, it was stated that the Hope Island was located near the [[Bahamas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://interviewly.com/i/barbara-pyle-sep-2012-reddit|title=We are Barbara Pyle and Nick Boxer, Co-creators and Exec. Producers of \"Captain Planet and the Planeteers.\" AMA!|date=15 September 2012|publisher=Interviewly|language=English|accessdate=15 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305004940/http://interviewly.com/i/barbara-pyle-sep-2012-reddit|archivedate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== DIC history (1990\u20131992) ===\nThe original series was the second longest running US-cartoon of the 1990s, producing 113 episodes. It lasted for three seasons under the name ''Captain Planet and the Planeteers'' (produced by [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS Productions]] and [[DiC]]).\n\nThe show's intro theme was composed by Tom Worrall. The ending theme (maintained by both DIC and Hanna-Barbera's versions) is considered one of the most memorable parts of the series due to its catchy main chorus and rock track (\"''Captain Planet, he's our hero, gonna take pollution down to zero''\"). Its lyrics were written by show producer Nick Boxer<ref>[http://www.mnn.com/family/raising-a-family/mnntv/captain-planet/captain-planet-the-theme-song Captain Planet: The theme song] Mother Nature Network</ref> and is performed by Murray McFadden and Timothy Mulhollan. During the end credits, James Coburn, in character as Looten Plunder, utters the line \"You'll pay for this, Captain Planet.\". This is then followed by a rap from the voice actors of the Planeteers. It is akin to [[New Kids On The Block]]'s \"[[Step by Step (New Kids on the Block song)|Step By Step]]\".\n\n=== Hanna-Barbera history (1993\u20131996) ===\nIn 1993, the show saw a production company switch, changing the title to '''''The New Adventures of Captain Planet''''' (produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Cartoons]], which was acquired by Turner in 1991). During this time, it aired as part of TBS' '' Sunday Morning In Front Of The TV '' block, alongside fellow H-B toons ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'' and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''. This series revealed more of the past of each of the characters and expanded on it dramatically. The tone of these episodes was more mature than the initial series. The animation style was altered.\n\nThe DiC seasons' synth-rock soundtrack was replaced by a large number of orchestral pieces, and while the end credits theme was retained, the ending sequence now showcased footage from the Hanna-Barbera episodes. Full-time voice actors replaced most of the major celebrities that had voiced Gaia and the Eco-Villains during the DiC seasons. The opening narration was spoken by [[David Coburn (actor)|David Coburn]] (Captain Planet) rather than [[LeVar Burton]] (Kwame) and, in the final season, was replaced by a [[Rapping|rap]] by [[Fred Schneider]] of [[The B-52's]].\n\n=== Legacy ===\nThe ''Captain Planet Foundation (CPF)'' was founded in 1991, when series producer Barbara Pyle negotiated a percentage of the show's merchandising revenue to empower young people. The concept allowed schools and organizations around the world to present their environmental projects to the Foundation and receive seed money to grow their ideas. In 2001, [[Time Warner]] decided to shut down the CPF due to a challenging merger with [[AOL]]. Laura Seydel and her husband Rutherford Seydel worked with Time Warner to orchestrate the transition of the [[Private foundation (United States)|corporate foundation]] to a public charity - the Captain Planet Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://captainplanetfoundation.org|title=Captain Planet Foundation {{!}} Supporting Environmental Education|website=captainplanetfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-18}}</ref> In 2007, CPF acquired the rights to exhibit previous episodes of Captain Planet and the Planeteers online and on-air, thus \"allowing this valuable resource to reach out and educate the children of today!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://captainplanetfoundation.org/about/our-story/|title=Our Story|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Captain Planet Foundation|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref> {{as of|2017}}, the organization's board is chaired by Laura Turner Seydel, daughter of [[Ted Turner]]; the board includes [[Barbara Pyle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://captainplanetfoundation.org/board/|title=Board|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Captain Planet Foundation|accessdate=|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Educational goals ==\nVarious episodes were constructed to touch on relevant themes to a modern audience.\n* \"'''''Mind Pollution'''''\"\nThe episode titled \"Mind Pollution\" (1991) was notable<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ramblingbeachcat.com/2011/12/terrifying-moments-in-childrens.html|title=Terrifying moments in children's television|website=Rambling Beach Cat|accessdate=11 May 2016}}</ref> for dealing with the issue of drug abuse. This was explained by the fact that the characters thought of drug addiction as \"pollution of the mind\". The episode revolved around an epidemic of a designer drug known as \"Bliss\" created by [[Verminous Skumm]]. It included a scene of Linka's cousin Boris jumping through a window and dying from a drug overdose.\n\n* \"'''''A Formula for Hate'''''\"\nThe episode titled \"A Formula for Hate\" (1992) was also unusual for the series in that it was the first episode in an American children's animated series to directly deal with the [[HIV/AIDS]] pandemic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-21/entertainment/ca-626_1_captain-planet|title='Capt.

Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer stand the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five magic rings to five special young people: Kwame, from Africa, with the power of Earth... From North America, Wheeler, with the power of Fire... From the Soviet Union/Eastern Europe, Linka, with the power of Wind. From Asia, Gi, with the power of Water... and from South America, Ma-Ti, with the power of Heart. When the five powers combine, they summon Earth's greatest champion, Captain Planet.|Opening Narration}}\nEvery episode is followed up with at least one \"''Planeteer Alert''\" clip, often connected to the plot, where environmental-political and other social-political issues are discussed and how the viewer can contribute and be part of \"the solution\" rather than \"the pollution\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.fcc.gov/mediabureau/v01/tv/application/KidVid_72709.html|title=Children's Television Programming Report|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|language=English|date=30 December 2006|accessdate=14 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===Gaia===\n'''[[Gaia]]''' (voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] in 1990\u20131992, [[Margot Kidder]] in 1993\u20131996), the spirit of the planet, sends five magic rings, four with the power to control an [[Classical element#Classical elements in Greece|element of nature]] and one controlling the element of Heart, to five chosen youths across the globe. She claims to have been asleep for the entire 20th Century and awakens to see a more polluted world than when she was last awake, however this is contrasted with a flashback episode to the 1920s where people get guidance from Gaia.\n\nHer appearance seems to be a mixture of attractive women of all races, and is often seen as an intangible spirit. However, in cases of serious problems, Gaia gains corporeal form, which puts her in danger of death. In one episode where her rival Zarm had defeated her, Gaia was shown as an old, frail woman, with Zarm explaining that given the Earth's several billion years of existence, it would make sense for Gaia to be superannuated in appearance.\n\n===Captain Planet===\nIn situations that the Planeteers cannot resolve alone, they can combine their powers to summon the titular '''Captain Planet''' (voiced by [[David Coburn (actor)|David Coburn]]), a superhero who possesses all of their powers magnified. Once his work is done, Captain Planet returns to the planet, and leaves viewers with the message: \"The power is yours!\" Typically Planet only manifests to deal with the bigger crisis and then departs, but a few storylines have explored him existing beyond these moments, such as when he was summoned while Kwame and Ma-Ti were in space, with the result that the energy from their rings that created Planet could not return to its source, resulting in Planet being forced to operate on a human level, such as requiring a crowbar and handcuff keys to rescue the rest of the team.\n\n===Planeteers===\n[[Image:ThePlaneteers.JPG|thumb|The Planeteers. Clockwise from top left: Gai, Kwame, Linka, Ma-Ti, and Wheeler.]]\n* '''Kwame''' (voiced by [[LeVar Burton]]) - Hailing from [[Ghana]],<ref name=\"Captain Planet: Meet the characters\">[http://www.mnn.com/family/family-activities/mnntv/captain-planet/captain-planet-meet-the-characters Captain Planet: Meet the characters] Mother Nature Network</ref> [[Africa]], Kwame possesses the power of [[soil|Earth]]. The unofficial leader of the Planeteers.\n* '''Wheeler''' (voiced by [[Joey Dedio]]) - From [[New York City|New York]], [[United States|U.S.A]], Wheeler controls the power of [[fire]]. \n* '''Linka''' (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) - From the [[Soviet Union]] (in later episodes stated as being from [[Russia]] after [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the communist regime's collapse]]), Linka has the power of [[wind]].\n* '''Gi''' (voiced by [[Janice Kawaye]]) - Hailing from [[South Korea]], Gi controls the power of [[water]]. \n* '''Ma-Ti''' (voiced by [[Scott Menville]]) - From the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] of [[Brazil]] Ma-Ti wields the power of [[Kindness|heart]].\n** '''Suchi''' (vocal effects provided by [[Frank Welker]]) - Ma-Ti's pet monkey.\n\nThese five are dubbed the ''Planeteers'' and are tasked with helping defend the planet from environmental disasters and making efforts to educate humankind to keep others from happening. In the beginning of the episodes, Gaia uses her \"Planet Vision\" in the Crystal Chamber to discover where the most devastating destruction is occurring (in most episodes one or more of the Eco-Villains is behind it) and sends the Planeteers to help solve the problem. The Planeteers use transportation (usually a flying machine called a Geo-Cruiser) based on [[solar power]] to avoid causing [[pollution]] themselves.\n\n===Villains===\n====Eco-Villains====\n[[Image:Eco-Villains_United.png|thumb|right|The Eco-Villains. Clockwise from left: Dr. Blight, Verminous Skumm, Duke Nukem, Hoggish Greedly, Zarm, Looten Plunder, and Sly Sludge as seen in \"Summit to Save Earth\" Pt. 1.]]\nThe '''Eco-Villains''' are a small group of antagonists who cause danger to the planet through pollution, deforestation, poaching, and other environmentally unsafe activities. They enjoy the destruction they cause to the planet and the harm they bring to obtain wealth, land, or power. They tend to work alone most of the time, although they're willing to work with one another when it suits their plans. Only in the two-part episode \"Summit to Save Earth\" did the entire ensemble of Eco-Villains work as a team, with Zarm as the leader. Each of these villains represents a specific way of thought that can cause ecological problems.\n\n* '''Hoggish Greedly''' (voiced by [[Ed Asner]]) \u2013 A [[pig]]-like human who represents the dangers of [[overconsumption]] and greed, Hoggish is the first villain Captain Planet and the Planeteers encounter. In the episode \"Smog Hog\", it's revealed Hoggish has a son named Hoggish Greedly Jr. (Voiced by Jacob Doughty) who appears only once. In the episode \"Hog Tide,\" it is revealed that he has a grandfather named Don Porkaloin (portrayed as a parody of [[Vito Corleone]] from ''[[The Godfather]]'') who in the past was defeated by another group of Planeteers. Unlike Hoggish Greedly, Porkaloin became environmentally friendly as shown in the episode \"The Ghost of Porkaloin Past\".\n** '''Rigger''' (voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]]) - Greedly's main henchman. He once claimed that the main reason he works for Greedly is because no one else would hire him. He does sometime question Greedly's orders and shows concern when Greedly's actions hurt the environment though it never has any effect on his boss, and Rigger, for the most part, remains loyal to Greedly. Rigger does all the leg-work while Greedly usually sits around and eats.\n* '''Verminous Skumm''' (voiced by [[Jeff Goldblum]] in 1990, [[Maurice LaMarche]] in 1991\u20131995) \u2013 The second villain to appear on the series, he is a part-human, part-[[rat]] creature; he represents urban blight, disease, and drug abuse. Skumm can control rats and has his own personal [[helicopter]] called The Scum O'Copter. Skumm is responsible for the death of Linka's cousin Boris via drugs in the episode \"Mind Pollution.\"\n** '''Rat Pack''' - A group of humanoid rats that work for Verminous Skumm.\n* '''Duke Nukem''' (voiced by [[Dean Stockwell]] in 1990\u20131992, [[Maurice LaMarche]] in 1993\u20131995) \u2013 A doctor who changed himself into a radioactive [[Mutants in fiction|mutant]] who represents the misuse of [[nuclear power]], and the third villain to appear. He is one of the few Eco-Villains, along with Zarm and Captain Pollution, able to battle Captain Planet one-on-one. Nukem generates radiation to fire off radioactive blasts from his hands and possesses X-Ray vision. [[3D Realms|Apogee]] temporarily renamed the eponymous character of the [[Duke Nukem (1991 video game)|Duke Nukem]] computer game franchise to 'Duke Nukum' so as to avoid any possible trademark claims they could face from the producers of Captain Planet. The character was later found to be under no trademark and the games were restored to their original titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/duke1/index.html |title=3D Realms Site: Duke Nukem I |publisher=3drealms.com |date=1991-07-01 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref>\n** '''Leadsuit''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) - Duke Nukem's henchman, Leadsuit's name defines his appearance as he wears a full-bodied lead suit in order to withstand the radiation released by Duke Nukem's body. He revealed that he works for Duke Nukem because when Nukem takes over the world, he'll get to be second in command. Leadsuit is timid, rarely arguing with Nukem (and always losing if he objects to anything). Leadsuit is afraid of the dark, and usually gives in at the slightest trouble.\n* '''Dr. Blight''' (voiced by [[Meg Ryan]] in 1990-1991, [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in 1992\u20131996, Tessa Auberjonois in ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]'') \u2013 The fourth villain revealed, Dr. Blight is a [[mad scientist]] who represents the dangers of uncontrolled [[technology]] and unethical [[scientific experimentation]]. As a result of self-experimentation, the left half of her face is horribly scarred; this is usually hidden by her hair. In the episode \"Hog Tide,\" it is revealed that Dr. Blight had a grandmother named Betty Blight who assisted Don Porkaloin in his plot. In the episode \"Hollywaste\", it is revealed that Dr. Blight has a sister named Bambi (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]). Bambi calls Blight by her first name \"Babs\", a shortened form of \"Barbara\".\n** '''MAL 9000''' (voiced by [[David Rappaport]] in 1990, [[Tim Curry]] in 1991-1996) - Dr. Blight's [[Artificial intellligence|A.I.]] computer husband and henchman. He has the ability to hack into other computer systems, take over them and reprogram them mainly to Dr. Blight's specifications. MAL is often the control and main power source of everything in Dr. Blight's labs as well as the vehicles she travels in.\n* '''Looten Plunder''' (voiced by [[James Coburn]] in 1990\u20131992, [[Ed Gilbert]] in 1993\u20131996) \u2013 A wealthy [[Poaching|poacher]] and crooked businessman who represents the evils of unethical business actions. Looten is the sixth villain to appear on ''Captain Planet'' in the seventh episode, \"The Last of Her Kind\". He is also shown to have a nephew named Robin Plunder. His name was a play on the term \"Loot and Plunder\", and he was always in the ending credits of every episode when the singer mentioned \"Bad guys who like to...loot and plunder!\", taken from footage of one episode where a disshelved Plunder sees his scheme in ruins and screams \"You will pay for this, Captain Planet!\"\n** '''Argos Bleak''' (voiced by [[S. Scott Bullock]]) - Looten Plunder's main henchman and [[bodyguard]], he also functions as a [[mercenary]] and carries out most of Plunder's dirty work. He seems to have a military background as he is seen in many episodes flying helicopters or other aircraft, and is proficient in handling firearms. Argos even got his own episode \"The Preditor\", where he appeared without his boss to hunt down sharks. Another time where Plunder conspired with Hoggish Greedily, Argos Bleak was seen arguing with Rigger as to who was the better Eco-Villain.\n** '''Pinehead Brothers''' (voiced by [[Richard Gautier|Dick Gautier]] and [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Oakey and Dokey are two oversized [[lumberjack]]s that are Looten Plunder's henchmen in the final season of \"The New Adventures of Captain Planet.\"\n* '''Sly Sludge''' (voiced by [[Martin Sheen]] in 1990\u20131992, [[Jim Cummings]] in 1993\u20131995) \u2013 An unscrupulous [[waste collector]] who represents laziness, ignorance, and the dangers of apathy and short-term thinking. However, as many of his schemes involve waste management, which is a legitimate environmental issue, he often uses that to gain apparent respectability. Sludge is the last villain to be revealed. He is also the only villain to defect to the Planeteers where a recycling program of his makes a lot of money by the end of \"No Small Problem\" enabling Sludge to propose plans to mass-produce an affordable, eco-friendly way to safely dispose of waste.\n** '''Ooze''' (voiced by [[Cam Clarke]]) - Sly Sludge's henchman.\n** '''Tank Flusher III''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) \u2013 Sly Sludge's [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] servant who makes his debut in \"The New Adventures of Captain Planet\" episode \"A Mine is a Terrible Thing to Waste\" Pt. 1.\n* '''Zarm''' (voiced by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] in 1990\u20131992, [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] in 1993, [[Malcolm McDowell]] in 1994\u20131995) \u2013 A former spirit of the planet who left Gaia in search of other worlds and ended up laying other populous planets to ruin lacking Gaia to balance out his methods. He represents [[war]] and [[wikt:destroy|destruction]]. Even though Zarm does not have any henchmen of his own, he would often manipulate other people to do his bidding. He once united Hoggish Greedly, Looten Plunder, Sly Sludge, Duke Nukem, Verminous Skumm, and Dr. Blight under his leadership in the two-part episode \"Summit to Save Earth.\" Other times he recruits and manipulates others, even the Planeteers, to work for him. Zarm is the fifth Eco-Villain to appear in the series, having his first appearance in the sixth episode. Outside of war and destruction, Zarm promoted hatred and [[totalitarianism]], which he believed were the most dangerous pollutants to mankind, as evidenced by his acting as [[kingmaker]] to a dictator named Morgar. Zarm admits he has been a guiding force for every despot of the 20th Century, but admits one of them actually declined his help, and challenges the Planeteers to guess who, saying \"I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.\"\n\n====Captain Pollution====\nA polluting counterpart to Captain Planet named '''Captain Pollution''' (voiced by [[David Coburn (actor)|David Coburn]]) appears in the two-part episode \"Mission to Save Earth\" when Lic. Andres Gatti steals the Planeteers' rings, creates polluting duplicates of them, and distributes the duplicates to most of the other Eco-villains. Each Eco-villain received a specific ring:  captain Pollution was voiced by David Coburn, who voiced Captain Planet.\n\n* Duke Nukem has a Super Radiation Ring (counterpart of Fire).\n* Looten Plunder has a [[Deforestation]] Ring (counterpart of Earth).\n* Sly Sludge has a [[Smog]] Ring (counterpart of Wind).\n* Verminous Skumm has a [[Toxicity|Toxics]] Ring (counterpart of Water).\n* Dr. Blight has a [[Hatred|Hate]] Ring (counterpart of Heart).\n\nEach of the evil rings has malevolent faces on them, in contrast to the more element-themed Planeteer rings. Captain Pollution is weakened when he is in contact with pure elements such as clean water or sunlight, while he gains power from contact with pollutants, being able to absorb pollutant and emit radioactive rays (and is later shown to gain limitless power when in contact with pollutants after his resurrection). When he is summoned he says \"By your polluting powers combined, I am Captain Pollution! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!\", and when he disappears, he declares \"The polluting power is yours!\"\n\nIn his first appearance, he is sent by the Eco-villains to destroy the Planeteers but gets chased off by Commander Clash, and after a fight with Captain Planet, he returns to the evil rings causing them to explode. In the two-part episode \"A Mine is a Terrible Thing to Waste\", Captain Pollution is brought back to life by toxins of the five evil rings that seep into the planet.\n\nCaptain Pollution is Captain Planet's polar opposite in personality as well as power. In contrast to Planet's generous and altruistic nature, Pollution is lazy, vengeful, and arrogant, seeing himself as a god and his creators as servants rather than partners. Captain Planet sums up the difference in their outlook during their first battle by taunting that the Planeteers have no boss - they are a team - and this is why Pollution will always lose.\n\nCaptain Pollution resembles Captain Planet, but his skin is pale yellow and covered in brown lesions. His hair is red and styled in a [[Widow's peak]] and he has red eyes. His costume is the same color and style as Planet's, but the globe on his chest is torn in the middle. His voice has a [[California English|California]] [[Valleyspeak|Valley twang]] to it. Captain Pollution is defeated twice by Captain Planet; first in \"Mission to Save Earth\" by being rammed through earth, lava, air and water, and then again in \"A Mine is a Terrible Thing to Waste\" by being tricked into going into an underground magma chamber.\n\n===Other villains===\n* '''The Slaughters''' - A family of poachers who made their debut in \"The New Adventures of Captain Planet.\" The Slaughters represent the endangerment of animals and the evils of poaching and are often in direct monetary competition with Looten Plunder. Mame and her family once collaborated with Looten Plunder and Argos Bleak in the episode \"Horns A'Plenty\" when the Planeteers ruined each one's rhinoceros poaching.\n** '''Mame Slaughter''' (voiced by [[Theresa Saldana]] in the first appearance, [[Mitzi McCall]] in the second appearance) - The leader of the Slaughters\n** '''Stalker Slaughter''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) \u2013 One of Mame's sons and her second-in-command.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Captain Planet episodes}}\n\n==Franchise extension==\nPyle and Boxer demanded that the series' merchandise be made sustainably; because of this, several of the companies producing ''Captain Planet''-themed merchandise had to completely overhaul their means of production to manufacture recycled and recyclable products.\n\n===Toys===\nAs with many popular cartoons, ''Captain Planet'' had a line of action figures and vehicles. Released by [[Tiger Toys]] in 1990, the line ran for several years, long enough to tie into the ''New Adventures'' series. The toys were repackaged and sold by Grand Toys in Canada and [[Kenner]] throughout Europe. The toys were of average poseability, with the common five points&nbsp;\u2013 neck, shoulders, and hips.\n\nFinding a comprehensive list of what was released is difficult, since not all toys shown in the initial retailer catalog were even released. The collector's market is small, the toys being somewhat rare on [[eBay]]. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20170426161206/http://www.captainplanetfdn.org/ Captain Planet Foundation] still sells a small number of them online, however. There may have also been further foreign variations of certain toys which may be even more difficult to catalog. Various toys from the ''New Adventures'' waves are not as likely to be well known.\n\nThe five Planeteers, five Eco-Villains, Commander Clash, and several versions of Captain Planet, each with a different gimmick or paint scheme, were released, along with several vehicles. A toy ring with lights and sound and interchangeable lenses for the five elements was also released. Four small vehicles were also sold through a [[Burger King]] promotion.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Marvel Comics]] published a short-lived comic series for 12 issues to tie into the show; however, the comics were a separate continuity. While not effectively part of the [[Marvel Universe]], issue #4's cover was a parody of the cover to ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' issue #1.\n\n===Video games===\n{{main|Captain Planet and the Planeteers (video game)}}\n\nA video game based on the series was developed for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape]] called ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers (video game)|Captain Planet]]''. The game, which involved a good deal of shooting, received negative reviews from game critics and thus a [[Sega Mega Drive]] (Genesis) version of the game was cancelled. A separate side-scrolling game was developed by [[Novalogic]] for the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], but only saw release in Europe and Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/captain-planet-and-the-planeteers-|title=Captain Planet and the Planeteers on MobyGames|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref>\n\n[[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]] and Nick Bruty developed a [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] game using the license, a 3-level shoot 'em up. A game was also released in 1990 for the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]], written by [[Tony Crowther]]. This was a platform game and was briefly bundled with the [[Amiga 500]] \"Cartoon Classics\" pack released in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a7sH_jz1bg |title=Amiga Longplay Captain Planet and the Planeteers |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref> A [[Commodore 64]] game was in development but never released.

Since its creation the Bluetooth standard has gone through many generations each adding different features. Bluetooth 1.2 allowed for faster speed up to \u2248700 kbit/s. Bluetooth 2.0 improved on this for speeds up to 3 Mbit/s. Bluetooth 2.1 improved device pairing speed and security. Bluetooth 3.0 again improved transfer speed up to 24 Mbit/s. In 2010 Bluetooth 4.0 (Low Energy) was released with its main focus being reduced power consumption. Before Bluetooth 4.0 the majority of connections using Bluetooth were two way, both devices listen and talk to each other. Although this two way communication is still possible with Bluetooth 4.0, one way communication is also possible. This one way communication allows a bluetooth device to transmit information but not listen for it. These one way \"beacons\" do not require a paired connection like previous Bluetooth devices so they have new useful applications.\n\n==Design==\n\n===Battery powered===\n[[File:An assortment of iBeacon from different vendors.jpg|thumb|An assortment of iBeacons from different vendors]]\n\n[[File:New Battery Life of iBeacons.png|thumb|300px|right|upright|Comparison of 16 major beacon hardware of battery life in months (higher is better) by Aislelabs' The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/ |title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs |publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-11-03|accessdate=2014-11-03}}</ref>]]\n\nBluetooth beacons operate using the Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy standard so battery powered devices are possible.

These small USB beacons can be powered by a standard USB port which makes them ideal for long term permanent installations.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Advertising===\nBluetooth beacons can be used to send a packet of information that contains a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). This UUID is used to trigger events specific to that beacon. In the case of Apple's iBeacon the UUID will be recognized by an app on the user device that will trigger an event. This event is fully customizable by the app developer but in the case of advertising the event might be a push notification with an ad. However, with a UID based system the users device must connect to an online server which is capable of understanding the beacons UUID. Once the UUID is sent to the server the appropriate message action is sent to a users device.\n\nOther methods of advertising are also possible with beacons, URIBeacon and Google's Eddystone  allow for a URI transmission mode that unlike iBeacons UID doesn't require an outside server for recognition. The URI beacons transmit a URI which could be a link to a webpage and the user will see that URI directly on their phone.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===Indoor navigation===\nIndoor positioning with beacons falls into three categories. Implementations with many beacons per room, implementations with one beacon per room, and implementations with a few beacons per building. Indoor navigation with Bluetooth is still in its infancy but attempts have been made to find a working solution.\n\n===Notification and interaction===\nBeacons can be associated with the artpieces in a museum to encourage further interaction. For example, a notification can be sent to user's mobile device when user is in the proximity to a particular artpiece. By sending user the notification, user is alerted with the artpiece in his proximity, and if user indicates their further interest, a specific app can be installed to interact with the encountered artpiece.<ref>P. C. Ng, J. She and S. Park, \"Notify-and-interact: A beacon-smartphone interaction for user engagement in galleries,\" 2017 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), Hong Kong, 2017, pp. 1069-1074.\ndoi: 10.1109/ICME.2017.8019467\n[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019467/]</ref> \nIn general, a native app is needed for a mobile device to interact with the beacon if the beacon uses iBeacon protocol; whereas if Eddystone is employed, user can interact with the artpiece through a physical web URL broadcast by the Eddystone.\n\n==== Many beacons per room ====\nWith multiple beacons per room [[trilateration]] can be used to estimate a users' position to within about 2 meters.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Mazan|first=Filip|date=2015|title=A Study of Devising Neural Network Based Indoor Localization Using Beacons: First Results|url=|journal=Computing & Information Systems |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=15|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Bluetooth beacons are capable of transmitting their Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value in addition to other data. This RSSI value is calibrated by the manufacturer of the beacon to be the signal strength of the beacon at a known distance, typically one meter. Using the known output signal strength of the beacon and the signal strength observed by the receiving device an approximation can be made about the distance between the beacon and the device. However this approximation is not very reliable, so for more accurate position tracking other methods are preferred. Since its release in 2010 many studies have been connected using Bluetooth beacons for tracking.  A few methods have been tested to find the best way of combining the RSSI values for tracking.  Neural networks have been proposed as a good way of reducing the error in estimation.<ref name=\":9\" /> A [[Stigmergic]] approach has also been tested, this method uses an intensity map to estimate a users location.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palumbo Filippo|first=Barsocchi Paolo|date=2015\n |title=A stigmergic approach to indoor localization using Bluetooth Low Energy beacons|url=\n |journal=IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance |pages=1\u20136|doi=10.1109/AVSS.2015.7301734 |pmid=|access-date=|isbn=978-1-4673-7632-7|title-link=Stigmergy}}</ref>\n\n====One beacon per room==== \nWith only one beacon per room, a user can use their known room position in conjunction with a virtual map of all the rooms in a building to navigate a building. A building with many separate rooms may need a different beacon configuration for navigation. With one beacon in each room a user can use an app to know the room they are in, and a simple shortest path algorithm can be used to give them the best route to the room they are looking for. This configuration requires a digital map of the building but attempts have been made to make this map creation easier.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bobek|first=Szymon|date=2015|title=Indoor Microlocation with BLE Beacons and Incremental Rule Learning|url=|journal=IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cybernetics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Few beacons per building====\n\nBeacons can be used in conjunction with [[pedestrian dead reckoning]] techniques to add checkpoints to a large open space.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=LI|first=XI|date=2015|title=A Bluetooth/PDR Integration Algorithm for an Indoor Positioning System|url=|journal=Sensors |volume=15 |issue=10|pages=24862\u201324885|doi=10.3390/s151024862|pmid=26404277|pmc=4634470|access-date=}}</ref> PDR uses a known last location in conjunction with direction and speed information provided by the user to estimate a person's location. This technique can be used to estimate a person's location as they walk through a building. Using Bluetooth beacons as checkpoints the user's location can be recalculated to reduce error. In this way a few Bluetooth beacons can be used to cover a large area like a mall.\n\n===Healthcare===\nUsing the device tracking capabilities of Bluetooth beacons, in-home patient monitoring is possible. Using bluetooth beacons a person's movements and activities can be tracked in their home.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De|first=Debraj|date=September 2015|title=Multimodal Wearable Sensing For Fine-Grained Activity Recognition In Healthcare|url=|journal=IEEE Internet Computing |volume=19 |issue=5|pages=26\u201335|doi=10.1109/MIC.2015.72|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Bluetooth beacons are a good alternative to in house cameras due to their increased level of privacy. Additionally bluetooth beacons can be used in hospitals or other workplaces to ensure workers meet certain standards. For example, a beacon may be placed at a hand sanitizer dispenser in a hospital, the beacons can help ensure employees are using the station regularly.\n\n=== Tracker ===\nOne use of Beacons is as a \"[[Key finder]]\" where a beacon is attached to (for example) a keyring and a smartphone app can be used to track the last time the device came in range.\n\nAnother similar use is to track pets, objects or people. The precision and range of BLE doesn't match GPS, but beacons are significantly less expensive. Several commercial and free solutions exist, which are based on proximity detection, not precise positioning. For example, Nivea launched the \"kid-tracker\" campaign in Brazil back in 2014.{{cite web |url=https://adage.com/article/special-report-cannes-lions/nivea-ad-turns-kid-tracker-wins-mobile-grand-prix/293745 |title=Nivea Ad That Turns into a Kid-Tracker Wins Mobile Grand Prix |date=June 17, 2014 |website=adage.com |publisher=Shareen Pathak}}\n\n==Beacon protocols==\n\n===iBeacon=== \nIn mid-2013, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced [[iBeacon]]s and experts wrote about how it is designed to help the retail industry by simplifying payments and enabling on-site offers.

The telemetry information is sent along with the UID data. The beacon information available includes battery voltage, beacon temperature, number of packets sent since last startup, and beacon uptime.<ref name=\":8\" /> Using Eddystone protocol, Google had built Google Nearby that allowed Android users to receive beacon notifications without an app.\n\n==Comparable technologies==\nAlthough the [[Near field communication]] (NFC) environment is very different and has many non-overlapping applications, it is still compared with iBeacons.\n* NFC range is up to 20&nbsp;cm (7.87 inches) but the optimal range is < 4&nbsp;cm (1.57 inches). iBeacons have a significantly larger range.\n* NFC can be either passive or active.

Indoor navigation with Bluetooth is still in its infancy but attempts have been made to find a working solution.\n\n===Notification and interaction===\nBeacons can be associated with the artpieces in a museum to encourage further interaction. For example, a notification can be sent to user's mobile device when user is in the proximity to a particular artpiece. By sending user the notification, user is alerted with the artpiece in his proximity, and if user indicates their further interest, a specific app can be installed to interact with the encountered artpiece.<ref>P. C. Ng, J. She and S. Park, \"Notify-and-interact: A beacon-smartphone interaction for user engagement in galleries,\" 2017 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), Hong Kong, 2017, pp. 1069-1074.\ndoi: 10.1109/ICME.2017.8019467\n[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019467/]</ref> \nIn general, a native app is needed for a mobile device to interact with the beacon if the beacon uses iBeacon protocol; whereas if Eddystone is employed, user can interact with the artpiece through a physical web URL broadcast by the Eddystone.\n\n==== Many beacons per room ====\nWith multiple beacons per room [[trilateration]] can be used to estimate a users' position to within about 2 meters.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Mazan|first=Filip|date=2015|title=A Study of Devising Neural Network Based Indoor Localization Using Beacons: First Results|url=|journal=Computing & Information Systems |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=15|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Bluetooth beacons are capable of transmitting their Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value in addition to other data. This RSSI value is calibrated by the manufacturer of the beacon to be the signal strength of the beacon at a known distance, typically one meter. Using the known output signal strength of the beacon and the signal strength observed by the receiving device an approximation can be made about the distance between the beacon and the device. However this approximation is not very reliable, so for more accurate position tracking other methods are preferred. Since its release in 2010 many studies have been connected using Bluetooth beacons for tracking.  A few methods have been tested to find the best way of combining the RSSI values for tracking.  Neural networks have been proposed as a good way of reducing the error in estimation.<ref name=\":9\" /> A [[Stigmergic]] approach has also been tested, this method uses an intensity map to estimate a users location.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palumbo Filippo|first=Barsocchi Paolo|date=2015\n |title=A stigmergic approach to indoor localization using Bluetooth Low Energy beacons|url=\n |journal=IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance |pages=1\u20136|doi=10.1109/AVSS.2015.7301734 |pmid=|access-date=|isbn=978-1-4673-7632-7|title-link=Stigmergy}}</ref>\n\n====One beacon per room==== \nWith only one beacon per room, a user can use their known room position in conjunction with a virtual map of all the rooms in a building to navigate a building. A building with many separate rooms may need a different beacon configuration for navigation. With one beacon in each room a user can use an app to know the room they are in, and a simple shortest path algorithm can be used to give them the best route to the room they are looking for. This configuration requires a digital map of the building but attempts have been made to make this map creation easier.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bobek|first=Szymon|date=2015|title=Indoor Microlocation with BLE Beacons and Incremental Rule Learning|url=|journal=IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cybernetics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Few beacons per building====\n\nBeacons can be used in conjunction with [[pedestrian dead reckoning]] techniques to add checkpoints to a large open space.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=LI|first=XI|date=2015|title=A Bluetooth/PDR Integration Algorithm for an Indoor Positioning System|url=|journal=Sensors |volume=15 |issue=10|pages=24862\u201324885|doi=10.3390/s151024862|pmid=26404277|pmc=4634470|access-date=}}</ref> PDR uses a known last location in conjunction with direction and speed information provided by the user to estimate a person's location. This technique can be used to estimate a person's location as they walk through a building. Using Bluetooth beacons as checkpoints the user's location can be recalculated to reduce error. In this way a few Bluetooth beacons can be used to cover a large area like a mall.\n\n===Healthcare===\nUsing the device tracking capabilities of Bluetooth beacons, in-home patient monitoring is possible. Using bluetooth beacons a person's movements and activities can be tracked in their home.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De|first=Debraj|date=September 2015|title=Multimodal Wearable Sensing For Fine-Grained Activity Recognition In Healthcare|url=|journal=IEEE Internet Computing |volume=19 |issue=5|pages=26\u201335|doi=10.1109/MIC.2015.72|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Bluetooth beacons are a good alternative to in house cameras due to their increased level of privacy. Additionally bluetooth beacons can be used in hospitals or other workplaces to ensure workers meet certain standards. For example, a beacon may be placed at a hand sanitizer dispenser in a hospital, the beacons can help ensure employees are using the station regularly.\n\n=== Tracker ===\nOne use of Beacons is as a \"[[Key finder]]\" where a beacon is attached to (for example) a keyring and a smartphone app can be used to track the last time the device came in range.\n\nAnother similar use is to track pets, objects or people. The precision and range of BLE doesn't match GPS, but beacons are significantly less expensive. Several commercial and free solutions exist, which are based on proximity detection, not precise positioning. For example, Nivea launched the \"kid-tracker\" campaign in Brazil back in 2014.{{cite web |url=https://adage.com/article/special-report-cannes-lions/nivea-ad-turns-kid-tracker-wins-mobile-grand-prix/293745 |title=Nivea Ad That Turns into a Kid-Tracker Wins Mobile Grand Prix |date=June 17, 2014 |website=adage.com |publisher=Shareen Pathak}}\n\n==Beacon protocols==\n\n===iBeacon=== \nIn mid-2013, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced [[iBeacon]]s and experts wrote about how it is designed to help the retail industry by simplifying payments and enabling on-site offers.

The telemetry information is sent along with the UID data. The beacon information available includes battery voltage, beacon temperature, number of packets sent since last startup, and beacon uptime.<ref name=\":8\" /> Using Eddystone protocol, Google had built Google Nearby that allowed Android users to receive beacon notifications without an app.\n\n==Comparable technologies==\nAlthough the [[Near field communication]] (NFC) environment is very different and has many non-overlapping applications, it is still compared with iBeacons.\n* NFC range is up to 20&nbsp;cm (7.87 inches) but the optimal range is < 4&nbsp;cm (1.57 inches). iBeacons have a significantly larger range.\n* NFC can be either passive or active. When using passive mode, the power is sent from the reader device. Although Passif (bought by [[Apple Inc.]]) has worked on reducing the energy consumption, a battery pack is still needed inside iBeacon tags at this time.\n* Most Android smart devices ship with both [[Bluetooth]] 4.0 LE and NFC support.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.pushmote.com/10-most-frequently-asked-questions-about-ibeacons.html |title=10 most frequently asked questions about iBeacons |work=Pushmote Blog |access-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071207/https://blog.pushmote.com/10-most-frequently-asked-questions-about-ibeacons.html |archive-date=6 October 2014 |df= }}</ref> On September 19, 2014 also Apple released the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus, supporting the NFC standard, but only limited to payments <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/|title=Apple - iPhone - Compare Models|work=Apple|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Eddystone (Google)|Eddystone]]\n* [[Facebook Bluetooth Beacon]]\n* [[Electric beacon]]\n* [[Pseudolite]]\n* [[Nearables]]\n* [[iBeacon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bluetooth]]\n[[Category:Geolocation]]\n[[Category:Radio-frequency identification]]\n[[Category:Radio navigation]]\n[[Category:Tracking]]\n[[Category:Indoor positioning system]]\n[[Category:Wireless locating]]\n", "name_user": "2001:5b0:4bc4:6c48:81c6:43fe:f59a:df3a", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(no edit)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy_beacon"}

The shortest common outdoor running distance, it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the [[sport of athletics]]. It has been contested at the [[Summer Olympics]] since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women. The [[100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|World Championships 100 metres]] has been contested since 1983.\n\n[[File:Women's 100M Final - 28th Summer Universiade 2015 Gwangju.webm|thumbnail|Women's 100M Final \u2013 28th Summer Universiade 2015]]\n\nThe reigning [[100 metres at the Olympics|100&nbsp;m Olympic]] or world champion is often named \"the fastest man or woman in the world\". [[Christian Coleman]] and [[Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce]] are the reigning [[World Championships in Athletics|world champions]]; [[Usain Bolt]] and [[Elaine Thompson]] are the men's and women's [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] champions.\n\nOn an outdoor [[400 metres]] [[running track]], the 100&nbsp;m is run on the [[home straight]], with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race. There are three instructions given to the runners immediately before and at the beginning of the race: ready, set, and the firing of the [[starter's pistol]]. The runners move to the [[starting blocks]] when they hear the 'ready' instruction. The following instruction, to adopt the 'set' position, allows them to adopt a more efficient starting posture and [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preload]] their muscles: this will help them to start faster. A race-official then fires the starter's pistol to signal the race beginning and the sprinters stride forwards from the blocks. Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 and 60&nbsp;m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line.\n\nThe [[10-second barrier]] has historically been a barometer of fast men's performances, while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race. The current men's [[List of world records in athletics|world record]] is 9.58&nbsp;seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women's world record of 10.49&nbsp;seconds set by American [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] in 1988 remains unbroken.{{efn|name=10.49}}\n\nThe 100&nbsp;m (109.361 yards) emerged from the metrication of the [[100-yard dash|100&nbsp;yards]] (91.44 m), a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries. The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100&nbsp;m straight.\n\nUS athletes have won the men's Olympic 100 metres title more times than any other country, 16 out of the 28 times that it has been run. US women have also dominated the event winning 9 out of 21 times.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Race dynamics==\n===Start===\n[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|right|Male sprinters await the starter's instructions]]\n\nAt the start, some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the [[starting blocks]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bob Harris|author2=Ramela Mills|author3=Shanon Parker-Bennett|title=BTEC First Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2apWjFFg94C&pg=PA35|date=22 June 2004|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-45460-9|page=35}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19830123&id=uwMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1446,4230157 The Day \u2013 23 January 1983]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.athleticsweekly.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3893 |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729032958/http://www.athleticsweekly.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3893 |archive-date=29 July 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nAt high level meets, the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically, via sensors built in the gun and the blocks. A reaction time less than 0.1&nbsp;s is considered a [[false start]]. The 0.2-second interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter's pistol to reach the runners' ears, and the time they take to react to it.\n\nFor many years a sprinter was disqualified if responsible for two false starts individually. However, this rule allowed some major races to be restarted so many times that the sprinters started to lose focus. The next iteration of the rule, introduced in February 2003, meant that one false start was allowed among the field, but anyone responsible for a subsequent false start was disqualified.\n\nThis rule led to some sprinters deliberately false-starting to gain a psychological advantage: an individual with a slower [[reaction time]] might false-start, forcing the faster starters to wait and be sure of hearing the gun for the subsequent start, thereby losing some of their advantage. To avoid such abuse and to improve spectator enjoyment, the [[IAAF]] implemented a further change in the 2010 season \u2013 a false starting athlete now receives immediate disqualification.<ref>{{cite news |title=IAAF keeps one false-start rule |publisher=BBC  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/4433815.stm |accessdate=15 August 2008 | date=3 August 2005}}</ref> This proposal was met with objections when first raised in 2005, on the grounds that it would not leave any room for innocent mistakes.

When the placing of the athletes is not obvious, a [[photo finish]] is used to distinguish which runner was first to cross the line.\n\n===Climatic conditions===\n{{see also|wind assistance}}\n\nClimatic conditions, in particular air resistance, can affect performances in the 100 m. A strong head wind is very detrimental to performance, while a tail wind can improve performances significantly. For this reason, a maximum tail wind of 2.0&nbsp;m/s is allowed for a 100&nbsp;m performance to be considered eligible for records, or \"wind legal\".\n\nFurthermore, sprint athletes perform a better run at high altitudes because of the thinner air, which provides less air resistance. In theory, the thinner air would also make breathing slightly more difficult (due to the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen being lower), but this difference is negligible for sprint distances where all the oxygen needed for the short dash is already in the muscles and bloodstream when the race starts. While there are no limitations on altitude, performances made at altitudes greater than 1000&nbsp;m above sea level are marked with an \"A\".<ref name=IAAF>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=4666.html 100 metres] IAAF</ref>\n\n==10-second barrier==\n{{main|10-second barrier}}\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Race and sports}}\n\nOnly male sprinters have beaten the 100&nbsp;m [[10-second barrier]], majority of them being of [[West African]] descent.

[[sprint (running)|sprint race]] in [[track and field]] competitions. The shortest common outdoor running distance, it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the [[sport of athletics]]. It has been contested at the [[Summer Olympics]] since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women. The [[100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|World Championships 100 metres]] has been contested since 1983.\n\n[[File:Women's 100M Final - 28th Summer Universiade 2015 Gwangju.webm|thumbnail|Women's 100M Final \u2013 28th Summer Universiade 2015]]\n\nThe reigning [[100 metres at the Olympics|100&nbsp;m Olympic]] or world champion is often named \"the fastest man or woman in the world\". [[Christian Coleman]] and [[Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce]] are the reigning [[World Championships in Athletics|world champions]]; [[Usain Bolt]] and [[Elaine Thompson]] are the men's and women's [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] champions.\n\nOn an outdoor [[400 metres]] [[running track]], the 100&nbsp;m is run on the [[home straight]], with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race. There are three instructions given to the runners immediately before and at the beginning of the race: ready, set, and the firing of the [[starter's pistol]]. The runners move to the [[starting blocks]] when they hear the 'ready' instruction. The following instruction, to adopt the 'set' position, allows them to adopt a more efficient starting posture and [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preload]] their muscles: this will help them to start faster. A race-official then fires the starter's pistol to signal the race beginning and the sprinters stride forwards from the blocks. Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 and 60&nbsp;m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line.\n\nThe [[10-second barrier]] has historically been a barometer of fast men's performances, while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race. The current men's [[List of world records in athletics|world record]] is 9.58&nbsp;seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women's world record of 10.49&nbsp;seconds set by American [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] in 1988 remains unbroken.{{efn|name=10.49}}\n\nThe 100&nbsp;m (109.361 yards) emerged from the metrication of the [[100-yard dash|100&nbsp;yards]] (91.44 m), a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries. The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100&nbsp;m straight.\n\nUS athletes have won the men's Olympic 100 metres title more times than any other country, 16 out of the 28 times that it has been run. US women have also dominated the event winning 9 out of 21 times.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Race dynamics==\n===Start===\n[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|right|Male sprinters await the starter's instructions]]\n\nAt the start, some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the [[starting blocks]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bob Harris|author2=Ramela Mills|author3=Shanon Parker-Bennett|title=BTEC First Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2apWjFFg94C&pg=PA35|date=22 June 2004|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-45460-9|page=35}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19830123&id=uwMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1446,4230157 The Day \u2013 23 January 1983]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.athleticsweekly.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3893 |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729032958/http://www.athleticsweekly.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3893 |archive-date=29 July 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nAt high level meets, the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically, via sensors built in the gun and the blocks. A reaction time less than 0.1&nbsp;s is considered a [[false start]]. The 0.2-second interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter's pistol to reach the runners' ears, and the time they take to react to it.\n\nFor many years a sprinter was disqualified if responsible for two false starts individually. However, this rule allowed some major races to be restarted so many times that the sprinters started to lose focus. The next iteration of the rule, introduced in February 2003, meant that one false start was allowed among the field, but anyone responsible for a subsequent false start was disqualified.\n\nThis rule led to some sprinters deliberately false-starting to gain a psychological advantage: an individual with a slower [[reaction time]] might false-start, forcing the faster starters to wait and be sure of hearing the gun for the subsequent start, thereby losing some of their advantage. To avoid such abuse and to improve spectator enjoyment, the [[IAAF]] implemented a further change in the 2010 season \u2013 a false starting athlete now receives immediate disqualification.<ref>{{cite news |title=IAAF keeps one false-start rule |publisher=BBC  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/4433815.stm |accessdate=15 August 2008 | date=3 August 2005}}</ref> This proposal was met with objections when first raised in 2005, on the grounds that it would not leave any room for innocent mistakes.

When the placing of the athletes is not obvious, a [[photo finish]] is used to distinguish which runner was first to cross the line.\n\n===Climatic conditions===\n{{see also|wind assistance}}\n\nClimatic conditions, in particular air resistance, can affect performances in the 100 m. A strong head wind is very detrimental to performance, while a tail wind can improve performances significantly. For this reason, a maximum tail wind of 2.0&nbsp;m/s is allowed for a 100&nbsp;m performance to be considered eligible for records, or \"wind legal\".\n\nFurthermore, sprint athletes perform a better run at high altitudes because of the thinner air, which provides less air resistance. In theory, the thinner air would also make breathing slightly more difficult (due to the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen being lower), but this difference is negligible for sprint distances where all the oxygen needed for the short dash is already in the muscles and bloodstream when the race starts. While there are no limitations on altitude, performances made at altitudes greater than 1000&nbsp;m above sea level are marked with an \"A\".<ref name=IAAF>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=4666.html 100 metres] IAAF</ref>\n\n==10-second barrier==\n{{main|10-second barrier}}\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Race and sports}}\n\nOnly male sprinters have beaten the 100&nbsp;m [[10-second barrier]], majority of them being of [[West African]] descent.

While relaxing in the park, Nodoka suddenly witnesses a monster attack and upon hearing of a dog in trouble, goes off to find it. Nodoka finds the dog along with three Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran. The Animals explain that the dog is named Princess Latte and that they all come from the Healing Garden, a place in the center of the Earth that helps keep the planet healthy. However the garden is under a threat from the Bj\u00f6gens, who wants to infect the world with disease. The Bj\u00f6gen General Daruizen created the monster, known as a MegaBj\u00f6gen, by infecting an elemental spirit. The Animals were asked by Latte's mother, Queen Tiatine, to find those destined to be their partners and become the Legendary Precure and fight the Bj\u00f6gens.
