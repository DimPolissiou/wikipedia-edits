[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. He most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th century French priest and traveller [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]] also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to the species.<ref name=kinzelbach>{{cite journal |last1=Kinzelbach |first1=Ragnar K. |title=Pre-Linnaean pictures of the secretarybird, ''Sagittarius serpentarius'' (J.

The earliest [[fossil]]s associated with the family are two species from the genus ''[[Pelargopappus]]''. The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. He most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th century French priest and traveller [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]] also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to the species.<ref name=kinzelbach>{{cite journal |last1=Kinzelbach |first1=Ragnar K. |title=Pre-Linnaean pictures of the secretarybird, ''Sagittarius serpentarius'' (J.

The earliest [[fossil]]s associated with the family are two species from the genus ''[[Pelargopappus]]''. The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France.

Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

In general there may be many different product measures on ''X''&times;''Y''. Fubini's theorem and Tonelli's theorem both need technical conditions to avoid this complication; the most common way is to assume all measure spaces are [[\u03c3-finite measure|\u03c3-finite]], in which case there is a unique product measure on ''X''&times;''Y''. There is always a unique maximal product measure on ''X''&times;''Y'', where the measure of a measurable set is the infimum of the measures of sets containing it that are countable unions of products of measurable sets.  The maximal product measure can be constructed by applying [[Carath\u00e9odory's extension theorem]] to the additive function \u03bc such that \u03bc(''A''&times;''B'')=\u03bc<sub>1</sub>(''A'')\u03bc<sub>2</sub>(''B'') on the ring of sets generated by products of measurable sets. (Carath\u00e9odory's extension theorem gives a measure on a measure space that in general contains more measurable sets than the measure space ''X''&times;''Y'', so strictly speaking the measure should be restricted to the [[\u03c3-algebra]] generated by the products ''A''&times;''B'' of measurable subsets of ''X'' and ''Y''.)\n\nThe product of two [[complete measure space]]s is not usually complete. For example, the product of the [[Lebesgue measure]] on the unit interval ''I'' with itself is not the Lebesgue measure on the square ''I''&times;''I''. There is a variation of Fubini's theorem for complete measures, which uses the completion of the product of measures rather than the uncompleted product.\n\n==For integrable functions==\nSuppose ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[sigma-finite measure|\u03c3-finite]] measure spaces, and suppose that ''X&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Y'' is given the product measure (which is unique as ''X'' and ''Y'' are \u03c3-finite). Fubini's theorem states that if ''f'' is ''X&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Y'' integrable, meaning that ''f'' is a [[measurable function]] and\n:<math>\\int_{X\\times Y} |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}(x,y)<\\infty,</math>\nthen\n\n:<math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x=\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y=\\int_{X\\times Y} f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}(x,y).</math>\n\nThe first two integrals are iterated integrals with respect to two measures, respectively, and the third is an integral with respect to the product measure. The partial integrals <math>\\int_Y f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}y</math> and <math>\\int_X f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}x</math> need not be defined everywhere, but this does not matter as the points where they are not defined form a set of measure 0.\n\nIf the above integral of the absolute value is not finite, then the two iterated integrals may have different values.  See [[#Rearranging a conditionally convergent iterated integral|below]] for an illustration of this possibility.\n\nThe condition that ''X'' and ''Y'' are \u03c3-finite is usually harmless because in practice almost all measure spaces one wishes to use Fubini's theorem for are \u03c3-finite.\nFubini's theorem has some rather technical extensions to the case when ''X'' and ''Y'' are not assumed to be \u03c3-finite {{harv|Fremlin|2003}}. The main extra complication in this case is that there may be more than one product measure on ''X''&times;''Y''. Fubini's theorem continues to hold for the maximal product measure, but can fail for other product measures. For example, there is a product measure and a non-negative measurable function ''f'' for which the double integral of |''f''| is zero but the two iterated integrals have different values; see the section on counterexamples below for an example of this. Tonelli's theorem and the Fubini\u2013Tonelli theorem (stated below) can fail on non \u03c3-finite spaces even for the maximal product measure.\n\n==Tonelli's theorem for non-negative measurable function==\n'''Tonelli's theorem''' (named after [[Leonida Tonelli]]) is a successor of Fubini's theorem. The conclusion of Tonelli's theorem is identical to that of Fubini's theorem, but the assumption that <math>|f|</math> has a finite integral is replaced by the assumption that <math>f</math> is non-negative measurable function.\n\nTonelli's theorem states that if (''X'', ''A'', \u03bc) and (''Y'', ''B'', \u03bd) are [[Sigma-finite measure|\u03c3-finite measure spaces]], while ''f'' from ''X\u00d7Y'' to [0,\u221e] is non-negative measurable function, then\n: <math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x=\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y=\\int_{X\\times Y} f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}(x,y).</math>\n\nA special case of Tonelli's theorem is in the interchange of the summations, as in <math>\\sum_x \\sum_y a_{xy}=\\sum_y \\sum_x a_{xy}</math>, where <math>a_{xy}</math> are non-negative for all ''x'' and ''y''. The crux of the theorem is that the interchange of order of summation holds even if the series diverges. In effect, the only way a change in order of summation can change the sum is when there exist some subsequences that diverge to <math>+\\infty</math> '''and''' others diverging to <math>-\\infty</math>. With all elements non-negative, this does not happen in the stated example.\n\nWithout the condition that the measure spaces are \u03c3-finite it is possible for all three of these integrals to have different values. \nSome authors give generalizations of Tonelli's theorem to some measure spaces that are not \u03c3-finite but these generalizations often add conditions that immediately reduce the problem to the \u03c3-finite case.  For example, one could take the \u03c3-algebra on ''A''&times;''B'' to be that generated by the product of subsets of finite measure, rather than that generated by all products of measurable subsets, though this has the undesirable consequence that the projections from the product to its factors ''A'' and ''B''  are not measurable. Another way is to add the condition that the support of ''f'' is contained in a countable union of products of sets of finite measure. {{harvtxt|Fremlin|2003}} gives some rather technical extensions of Tonelli's theorem to some non \u03c3-finite spaces. None of these generalizations have found any significant applications outside abstract measure theory, largely because almost all measure spaces of practical interest are \u03c3-finite.\n\n==Fubini\u2013Tonelli theorem==\nCombining Fubini's theorem with Tonelli's theorem gives\nthe Fubini\u2013Tonelli theorem (often just called Fubini's theorem), which states that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[\u03c3-finite measure]] spaces, and if ''f'' is a measurable function, then\n: <math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x=\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y=\\int_{X\\times Y} |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}(x,y)</math>\nBesides if any one of the three integrals\n: <math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x</math>\n: <math>\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y</math>\n: <math>\\int_{X\\times Y} |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}(x,y)</math>\nis finite\nthen\n: <math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x=\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y=\\int_{X\\times Y} f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}(x,y).</math>\n\nThe absolute value of ''f'' in the conditions above can be replaced by either the positive or the negative part of ''f''; these forms include Tonelli's theorem as a special case as the negative part of a non-negative function is zero and so has finite integral. Informally all these conditions say that the double integral of ''f'' is well defined, though possibly infinite.\n\nThe advantage of the Fubini\u2013Tonelli over Fubini's theorem is that the repeated integrals of the absolute value of |''f''| may be easier to study than the double integral. As in Fubini's theorem, the single integrals may fail to be defined on a measure 0 set.\n\n==For complete measures==\nThe versions of Fubini's and Tonelli's theorems above do not apply to integration on the product of the real line '''R''' with itself with Lebesgue measure.  The problem is that Lebesgue measure on '''R'''&times;'''R''' is not the product of Lebesgue measure on '''R''' with itself, but rather the completion of this: a product of two complete measure spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is not in general complete.  For this reason one sometimes uses versions of Fubini's theorem for complete measures: roughly speaking one just replaces all measures by their completions.  The various versions of Fubini's theorem are similar to the versions above, with the following minor differences:\n*Instead of taking a product ''X''&times;''Y'' of two measure spaces, one takes the completion of some product.\n*If ''f'' is a measurable on the completion of ''X''&times;''Y'' then its restrictions to vertical or horizontal lines may be non-measurable for a measure zero subset of lines, so one has to allow for the possibility that the vertical or horizontal integrals are undefined on a set of measure 0 because they involve integrating non-measurable functions. This makes little difference, because they can already be undefined due to the functions not being integrable. \n*One generally also assumes that the measures on ''X'' and ''Y'' are complete, otherwise the two partial integrals along vertical or horizontal lines may be well-defined but not measurable. For example, if ''f'' is the characteristic function of a product of a measurable set and a non-measurable set contained in a measure 0 set then its single integral is well defined everywhere but non-measurable.\n\n==Proofs==\n\nProofs of the Fubini and Tonelli theorems are necessarily somewhat technical, as they have to use a hypothesis related to \u03c3-finiteness. Most proofs involve building up to the full theorems by proving them for increasingly complicated functions as follows.\n*Step 1. Use the fact that the measure on the product is a product measure to prove the theorems for the characteristic functions of rectangles. \n*Step 2. Use the condition that the spaces are \u03c3-finite (or some related condition) to prove the theorem for the characteristic functions of measurable sets. This also covers the case of simple measurable functions (measurable functions taking only a finite number of values).\n*Step 3. Use the condition that the functions are measurable to prove the theorems for positive measurable functions by approximating them by simple measurable functions.  This proves Tonelli's theorem.\n*Step 4. Use the condition that the functions are integrable to write them as the difference of two positive integrable functions, and apply Tonelli's theorem to each of these. This proves Fubini's theorem.\n\n==Counterexamples==\n\nThe following examples show how Fubini's theorem and Tonelli's theorem can fail if any of their hypotheses are omitted.\n\n===Failure of Tonelli's theorem for non \u03c3-finite spaces===\n\nSuppose that ''X'' is the unit interval with the Lebesgue measurable sets and Lebesgue measure, and ''Y'' is the unit interval with all subsets measurable and the [[counting measure]], so that ''Y'' is not \u03c3-finite. If ''f'' is the characteristic function of the diagonal of ''X''&times;''Y'', then integrating ''f'' along ''X'' gives the 0 function on ''Y'', but integrating ''f'' along ''Y'' gives the function 1 on ''X''. So the two iterated integrals are different. This shows that Tonelli's theorem can fail for spaces that are not \u03c3-finite no matter what product measure is chosen. The measures are both [[decomposable measure|decomposable]], showing that Tonelli's theorem fails for decomposable measures (which are slightly more general than \u03c3-finite measures).\n\n===Failure of Fubini's theorem for non-maximal product measures===\n\nFubini's theorem holds for spaces even if they are not assumed to be \u03c3-finite provided one uses the maximal product measure.\nIn the example above, for the maximal product measure, the diagonal has infinite measure so the double integral of |''f''| is infinite, and Fubini's theorem holds vacuously.\nHowever, if we give ''X''&times;''Y'' the product measure such that the measure of a set is the sum of the Lebesgue measures of its horizontal sections, then the double integral of |''f''| is zero, but the two iterated integrals still have different values. This gives an example of a product measure where Fubini's theorem fails.\n\nThis gives an example of two different product measures on the same product of two measure spaces. For products of two \u03c3-finite measure spaces, there is only one product measure.\n\n===Failure of Tonelli's theorem for non-measurable functions===\n\nSuppose that ''X'' is the first uncountable ordinal, with the finite measure where the measurable sets are either countable (with measure 0) or the sets of countable complement (with measure 1). The (non-measurable) subset ''E'' of ''X''&times;''X'' given by pairs (''x'',''y'') with ''x''<''y'' is countable on every horizontal line and has countable complement on every vertical line. If ''f'' is the characteristic function of ''E'' then the two iterated integrals of ''f'' are defined and have different values 1 and 0. The function ''f'' is not measurable.

In general there may be many different product measures on ''X''&times;''Y''. Fubini's theorem and Tonelli's theorem both need technical conditions to avoid this complication; the most common way is to assume all measure spaces are [[\u03c3-finite measure|\u03c3-finite]], in which case there is a unique product measure on ''X''&times;''Y''. There is always a unique maximal product measure on ''X''&times;''Y'', where the measure of a measurable set is the inf of the measures of sets containing it that are countable unions of products of measurable sets.  The maximal product measure can be constructed by applying [[Carath\u00e9odory's extension theorem]] to the additive function \u03bc such that \u03bc(''A''&times;''B'')=\u03bc<sub>1</sub>(''A'')\u03bc<sub>2</sub>(''B'') on the ring of sets generated by products of measurable sets. (Carath\u00e9odory's extension theorem gives a measure on a measure space that in general contains more measurable sets than the measure space ''X''&times;''Y'', so strictly speaking the measure should be restricted to the [[\u03c3-algebra]] generated by the products ''A''&times;''B'' of measurable subsets of ''X'' and ''Y''.)\n\nThe product of two [[complete measure space]]s is not usually complete. For example, the product of the [[Lebesgue measure]] on the unit interval ''I'' with itself is not the Lebesgue measure on the square ''I''&times;''I''. There is a variation of Fubini's theorem for complete measures, which uses the completion of the product of measures rather than the uncompleted product.\n\n==For integrable functions==\nSuppose ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[sigma-finite measure|\u03c3-finite]] measure spaces, and suppose that ''X&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Y'' is given the product measure (which is unique as ''X'' and ''Y'' are \u03c3-finite). Fubini's theorem states that if ''f'' is ''X&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Y'' integrable, meaning that ''f'' is a [[measurable function]] and\n:<math>\\int_{X\\times Y} |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}(x,y)<\\infty,</math>\nthen\n\n:<math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x=\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y=\\int_{X\\times Y} f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}(x,y).</math>\n\nThe first two integrals are iterated integrals with respect to two measures, respectively, and the third is an integral with respect to the product measure. The partial integrals <math>\\int_Y f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}y</math> and <math>\\int_X f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}x</math> need not be defined everywhere, but this does not matter as the points where they are not defined form a set of measure 0.\n\nIf the above integral of the absolute value is not finite, then the two iterated integrals may have different values.  See [[#Rearranging a conditionally convergent iterated integral|below]] for an illustration of this possibility.\n\nThe condition that ''X'' and ''Y'' are \u03c3-finite is usually harmless because in practice almost all measure spaces one wishes to use Fubini's theorem for are \u03c3-finite.\nFubini's theorem has some rather technical extensions to the case when ''X'' and ''Y'' are not assumed to be \u03c3-finite {{harv|Fremlin|2003}}. The main extra complication in this case is that there may be more than one product measure on ''X''&times;''Y''. Fubini's theorem continues to hold for the maximal product measure, but can fail for other product measures. For example, there is a product measure and a non-negative measurable function ''f'' for which the double integral of |''f''| is zero but the two iterated integrals have different values; see the section on counterexamples below for an example of this. Tonelli's theorem and the Fubini\u2013Tonelli theorem (stated below) can fail on non \u03c3-finite spaces even for the maximal product measure.\n\n==Tonelli's theorem for non-negative measurable function==\n'''Tonelli's theorem''' (named after [[Leonida Tonelli]]) is a successor of Fubini's theorem. The conclusion of Tonelli's theorem is identical to that of Fubini's theorem, but the assumption that <math>|f|</math> has a finite integral is replaced by the assumption that <math>f</math> is non-negative measurable function.\n\nTonelli's theorem states that if (''X'', ''A'', \u03bc) and (''Y'', ''B'', \u03bd) are [[Sigma-finite measure|\u03c3-finite measure spaces]], while ''f'' from ''X\u00d7Y'' to [0,\u221e] is non-negative measurable function, then\n: <math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x=\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y=\\int_{X\\times Y} f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}(x,y).</math>\n\nA special case of Tonelli's theorem is in the interchange of the summations, as in <math>\\sum_x \\sum_y a_{xy}=\\sum_y \\sum_x a_{xy}</math>, where <math>a_{xy}</math> are non-negative for all ''x'' and ''y''. The crux of the theorem is that the interchange of order of summation holds even if the series diverges. In effect, the only way a change in order of summation can change the sum is when there exist some subsequences that diverge to <math>+\\infty</math> '''and''' others diverging to <math>-\\infty</math>. With all elements non-negative, this does not happen in the stated example.\n\nWithout the condition that the measure spaces are \u03c3-finite it is possible for all three of these integrals to have different values. \nSome authors give generalizations of Tonelli's theorem to some measure spaces that are not \u03c3-finite but these generalizations often add conditions that immediately reduce the problem to the \u03c3-finite case.  For example, one could take the \u03c3-algebra on ''A''&times;''B'' to be that generated by the product of subsets of finite measure, rather than that generated by all products of measurable subsets, though this has the undesirable consequence that the projections from the product to its factors ''A'' and ''B''  are not measurable. Another way is to add the condition that the support of ''f'' is contained in a countable union of products of sets of finite measure. {{harvtxt|Fremlin|2003}} gives some rather technical extensions of Tonelli's theorem to some non \u03c3-finite spaces. None of these generalizations have found any significant applications outside abstract measure theory, largely because almost all measure spaces of practical interest are \u03c3-finite.\n\n==Fubini\u2013Tonelli theorem==\nCombining Fubini's theorem with Tonelli's theorem gives\nthe Fubini\u2013Tonelli theorem (often just called Fubini's theorem), which states that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[\u03c3-finite measure]] spaces, and if ''f'' is a measurable function, then\n: <math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x=\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y=\\int_{X\\times Y} |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}(x,y)</math>\nBesides if any one of the three integrals\n: <math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x</math>\n: <math>\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y</math>\n: <math>\\int_{X\\times Y} |f(x,y)|\\,\\text{d}(x,y)</math>\nis finite\nthen\n: <math>\\int_X\\left(\\int_Y f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}y\\right)\\,\\text{d}x=\\int_Y\\left(\\int_X f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}x\\right)\\,\\text{d}y=\\int_{X\\times Y} f(x,y)\\,\\text{d}(x,y).</math>\n\nThe absolute value of ''f'' in the conditions above can be replaced by either the positive or the negative part of ''f''; these forms include Tonelli's theorem as a special case as the negative part of a non-negative function is zero and so has finite integral. Informally all these conditions say that the double integral of ''f'' is well defined, though possibly infinite.\n\nThe advantage of the Fubini\u2013Tonelli over Fubini's theorem is that the repeated integrals of the absolute value of |''f''| may be easier to study than the double integral. As in Fubini's theorem, the single integrals may fail to be defined on a measure 0 set.\n\n==For complete measures==\nThe versions of Fubini's and Tonelli's theorems above do not apply to integration on the product of the real line '''R''' with itself with Lebesgue measure.  The problem is that Lebesgue measure on '''R'''&times;'''R''' is not the product of Lebesgue measure on '''R''' with itself, but rather the completion of this: a product of two complete measure spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is not in general complete.  For this reason one sometimes uses versions of Fubini's theorem for complete measures: roughly speaking one just replaces all measures by their completions.  The various versions of Fubini's theorem are similar to the versions above, with the following minor differences:\n*Instead of taking a product ''X''&times;''Y'' of two measure spaces, one takes the completion of some product.\n*If ''f'' is a measurable on the completion of ''X''&times;''Y'' then its restrictions to vertical or horizontal lines may be non-measurable for a measure zero subset of lines, so one has to allow for the possibility that the vertical or horizontal integrals are undefined on a set of measure 0 because they involve integrating non-measurable functions. This makes little difference, because they can already be undefined due to the functions not being integrable. \n*One generally also assumes that the measures on ''X'' and ''Y'' are complete, otherwise the two partial integrals along vertical or horizontal lines may be well-defined but not measurable. For example, if ''f'' is the characteristic function of a product of a measurable set and a non-measurable set contained in a measure 0 set then its single integral is well defined everywhere but non-measurable.\n\n==Proofs==\n\nProofs of the Fubini and Tonelli theorems are necessarily somewhat technical, as they have to use a hypothesis related to \u03c3-finiteness. Most proofs involve building up to the full theorems by proving them for increasingly complicated functions as follows.\n*Step 1. Use the fact that the measure on the product is a product measure to prove the theorems for the characteristic functions of rectangles. \n*Step 2. Use the condition that the spaces are \u03c3-finite (or some related condition) to prove the theorem for the characteristic functions of measurable sets. This also covers the case of simple measurable functions (measurable functions taking only a finite number of values).\n*Step 3. Use the condition that the functions are measurable to prove the theorems for positive measurable functions by approximating them by simple measurable functions.  This proves Tonelli's theorem.\n*Step 4. Use the condition that the functions are integrable to write them as the difference of two positive integrable functions, and apply Tonelli's theorem to each of these. This proves Fubini's theorem.\n\n==Counterexamples==\n\nThe following examples show how Fubini's theorem and Tonelli's theorem can fail if any of their hypotheses are omitted.\n\n===Failure of Tonelli's theorem for non \u03c3-finite spaces===\n\nSuppose that ''X'' is the unit interval with the Lebesgue measurable sets and Lebesgue measure, and ''Y'' is the unit interval with all subsets measurable and the [[counting measure]], so that ''Y'' is not \u03c3-finite. If ''f'' is the characteristic function of the diagonal of ''X''&times;''Y'', then integrating ''f'' along ''X'' gives the 0 function on ''Y'', but integrating ''f'' along ''Y'' gives the function 1 on ''X''. So the two iterated integrals are different. This shows that Tonelli's theorem can fail for spaces that are not \u03c3-finite no matter what product measure is chosen. The measures are both [[decomposable measure|decomposable]], showing that Tonelli's theorem fails for decomposable measures (which are slightly more general than \u03c3-finite measures).\n\n===Failure of Fubini's theorem for non-maximal product measures===\n\nFubini's theorem holds for spaces even if they are not assumed to be \u03c3-finite provided one uses the maximal product measure.\nIn the example above, for the maximal product measure, the diagonal has infinite measure so the double integral of |''f''| is infinite, and Fubini's theorem holds vacuously.\nHowever, if we give ''X''&times;''Y'' the product measure such that the measure of a set is the sum of the Lebesgue measures of its horizontal sections, then the double integral of |''f''| is zero, but the two iterated integrals still have different values. This gives an example of a product measure where Fubini's theorem fails.\n\nThis gives an example of two different product measures on the same product of two measure spaces. For products of two \u03c3-finite measure spaces, there is only one product measure.\n\n===Failure of Tonelli's theorem for non-measurable functions===\n\nSuppose that ''X'' is the first uncountable ordinal, with the finite measure where the measurable sets are either countable (with measure 0) or the sets of countable complement (with measure 1). The (non-measurable) subset ''E'' of ''X''&times;''X'' given by pairs (''x'',''y'') with ''x''<''y'' is countable on every horizontal line and has countable complement on every vertical line. If ''f'' is the characteristic function of ''E'' then the two iterated integrals of ''f'' are defined and have different values 1 and 0. The function ''f'' is not measurable. This shows that Tonelli's theorem can fail for non-measurable functions.\n\n===Failure of Fubini's theorem for non-measurable functions===\n\nA variation of the example above shows that Fubini's theorem can fail for non-measurable functions even if |''f''| is integrable and both repeated integrals are well defined: if we take ''f'' to be 1 on ''E'' and \u20131 on the complement of ''E'', then |''f''| is integrable on the product with integral 1, and both repeated integrals are well defined, but have different values 1 and \u20131.\n\nAssuming the continuum hypothesis, one can identify ''X'' with the unit interval ''I'', so there is a bounded non-negative function on ''I''&times;''I''  whose two iterated integrals (using Lebesgue measure) are both defined but unequal.

He was offensive line coach{{sfn|Maraniss|1999|p=96, 99}} under legendary head coach [[Earl Blaik|Earl \"Colonel Red\" Blaik]]. \"As integral as religion was to [Lombardi's] sense of self, it was not until he reached West Point and combined his spiritual discipline with Blaik's military discipline that his coaching persona began to take its mature form.\"{{sfn|Maraniss|1999|p=101}} Blaik's emphasis on execution{{sfn|Maraniss|1999|p=100}} would become a trademark of Lombardi's coaching.{{sfn|MacCambridge|2004, 2005|p=291}} Lombardi coached at West Point for five seasons, with varying results. The [[1949 Army Cadets football team|1949]] and [[1950 Army Cadets football team|1950]] seasons were successful, but the [[1951 Army Cadets football team|1951]] and [[1952 Army Cadets football team|1952]] were not, due to the aftermath of a cadet [[Cheating|cribbing]] scandal (a violation of the [[Cadet Honor Code]]{{sfn|Maraniss|1999|p=129}}) which was revealed in the spring of 1951.

The [[Uttar Pradesh]] Bhishti are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]], marrying close kin. They speak [[Urdu]], as well as regional dialects such as [[Khari boli]].

The Church Divinity School of the Pacific gave her an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity]] in 2001. [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] awarded her an honorary degree in 2007, as did [[The University of the South]] in [[Sewanee, Tennessee]] the following year. (Most Episcopal seminaries award an honorary doctorate to alumni who become bishops.)  {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2006, Jefferts Schori was elected to serve a nine-year term as [[List of presiding bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Presiding Bishop]].\n\n==Election as Presiding Bishop==\n[[File:Katharine Jefferts Schori 2008-09-22 001.jpg|thumb|left|Jefferts Schori in 2008]]\nThe Episcopal Church met in General Convention in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], in June 2006. Jefferts Schori was elected to serve a nine-year term as Presiding Bishop by the [[House of Bishops]], on June 18, from among seven nominees on the fifth ballot with 95 of the 188 votes cast. The House of Deputies, consisting of [[deacon#Anglicanism|deacons]], [[Episcopal priest|priests]] and [[laity]], overwhelmingly approved the House of Bishops' election later that day. Jefferts Schori was the first woman [[primate (bishop)|primate]] in the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States|26th]] [[Presiding Bishop]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\nAlthough Jefferts Schori's election was an indication of widespread support in the Episcopal Church in the United States for [[Ordination of women#Anglicanism|ordaining women]] to the [[historical episcopate]], the [[Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (Episcopal Church)|Diocese of Fort Worth]], which opposed women in [[holy orders]], asked the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] for \"alternative primatial oversight\"- a previously unknown ministry analogous to the \"alternative episcopal oversight\" suggested in the [[Windsor Report]]. Several other conservative dioceses affiliated with the [[Anglican Communion Network]], including some that do ordain women, made similar requests. As not all churches in the Anglican Communion uphold the [[ordination of women]], the [[Ordination of women#Anglican Communion|election of a woman]] as [[primate (bishop)|primate]] also proved controversial in some other provinces.\n\nJefferts Schori voted to consent to the election of [[Gene Robinson]], an openly [[gay]] and partnered man, as [[Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire|Bishop of New Hampshire]] in 2003,<ref>https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/breakdown-bishops-vote-robinson</ref> to which some [[Anglican realignment|conservative Episcopalians]] objected strenuously.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/06/us/gay-bishop-wins-in-episcopal-vote-split-threatened.html</ref>\n\nAt a news conference on June 18, 2006, the Presiding Bishop-elect articulated a willingness to work with conservatives. She expressed her hope to lead the church in the reign of God, rooted in imagery from [[Isaiah]] and including such [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] as eradicating poverty and hunger: \"The poor are fed, the [[gospel|Good News]] is preached, those who are ostracized and in prison are set free, the blind receive sight.\"\n\n[[File:Katharine Jefferts Schori 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Schori as presiding bishop in 2010]]\nJefferts Schori remained as Bishop of Nevada until taking up the position of Presiding Bishop officially on November 1, 2006; her [[investiture]] was held on November 4 at the [[Washington National Cathedral]]. Her official seating was held the following day, also at the National Cathedral.

The Church Divinity School of the Pacific gave her an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity]] in 2001. [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] awarded her an honorary degree in 2007, as did [[The University of the South]] in [[Sewanee, Tennessee]] the following year. (Most Episcopal seminaries award an honorary doctorate to alumni who become bishops.)  {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2006, Jefferts Schori was elected to serve a nine-year term as [[List of presiding bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Presiding Bishop]].\n\n==Election as Presiding Bishop==\n[[File:Katharine Jefferts Schori 2008-09-22 001.jpg|thumb|left|Jefferts Schori in 2008]]\nThe Episcopal Church met in General Convention in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], in June 2006. Jefferts Schori was elected to serve a nine-year term as Presiding Bishop by the [[House of Bishops]], on June 18, from among seven nominees on the fifth ballot with 95 of the 188 votes cast. The House of Deputies, consisting of [[deacon#Anglicanism|deacons]], [[Episcopal priest|priests]] and [[laity]], overwhelmingly approved the House of Bishops' election later that day. Jefferts Schori was the first woman [[primate (bishop)|primate]] in the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States|26th]] [[Presiding Bishop]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].\n\nAlthough Jefferts Schori's election was an indication of widespread support in the Episcopal Church in the United States for [[Ordination of women#Anglicanism|ordaining women]] to the [[historical episcopate]], the [[Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (Episcopal Church)|Diocese of Fort Worth]], which opposed women in [[holy orders]], asked the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] for \"alternative primatial oversight\"- a previously unknown ministry analogous to the \"alternative episcopal oversight\" suggested in the [[Windsor Report]]. Several other conservative dioceses affiliated with the [[Anglican Communion Network]], including some that do ordain women, made similar requests. As not all churches in the Anglican Communion uphold the [[ordination of women]], the [[Ordination of women#Anglican Communion|election of a woman]] as [[primate (bishop)|primate]] also proved controversial in some other provinces.\n\nJefferts Schori voted to consent to the election of [[Gene Robinson]], an openly [[gay]] and partnered man, as [[Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire|Bishop of New Hampshire]] in 2003,<ref>https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/breakdown-bishops-vote-robinson</ref> to which some [[Anglican realignment|conservative Episcopalians]] objected strenuously.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/06/us/gay-bishop-wins-in-episcopal-vote-split-threatened.html</ref>\n\nAt a news conference on June 18, 2006, the Presiding Bishop-elect articulated a willingness to work with conservatives. She expressed her hope to lead the church in the reign of God, rooted in imagery from [[Isaiah]] and including such [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] as eradicating poverty and hunger: \"The poor are fed, the [[gospel|Good News]] is preached, those who are ostracized and in prison are set free, the blind receive sight.\"\n\n[[File:Katharine Jefferts Schori 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Schori as presiding bishop in 2010]]\nJefferts Schori remained as Bishop of Nevada until taking up the position of Presiding Bishop officially on November 1, 2006; her [[investiture]] was held on November 4 at the [[Washington National Cathedral]]. Her official seating was held the following day, also at the National Cathedral. An Episcopal Presiding Bishop's term typically lasts for nine years, running in three-year cycles in conjunction with General Convention.\n\nJefferts Schori was the [[List of Episcopal bishops|963rd bishop]] consecrated in the Episcopal Church.

The name  refers to the red flags that the communists used. The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States which are referred to by this name. The [[First Red Scare]], which occurred immediately after [[World War I]], revolved around a perceived threat from the [[Labor history of the United States|American labor movement]], [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchist]] [[revolution]] and [[political radicalism]]. The [[McCarthyism|Second Red Scare]], which occurred immediately after [[World War II]], was preoccupied with the perception that national or foreign communists were [[espionage|infiltrating]] or [[subversion|subverting]] U.S. society and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].\n\n==First Red Scare (1917\u20131920)==\n{{anchor|First Red Scare}}\n{{main|First Red Scare}}\n[[File:1919 Political Cartoon (14759129762) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Political cartoon from 1919 depicting the Russian revolution's impact on the [[Paris Peace itcrap jhrsConference, 1919|Paris peace talks]]]]\nThe first Red  basketballScare began following the [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the intensely patriotic years of World War I as anarchist and left-wing social agitation aggravated national, social, and political tensions. Political scientist, and former member of the Communist Party [[Murray Levin|Murray B.

[[hyphenated-Americans]]). The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), also known as the Wobblies, backed several [[Strike action|labor strike]]s in 1916 and 1917. These wartime strikes covered a wide gambit of industries including steel working, shipbuilding, coal mining, copper mining, as well as other industries necessary to make wartime necessities. After World War I ended the number of strikes increased to record levels in 1919 with more than 3,600 separate strikes that spanned from steel workers, to railroad shop workers, to the Boston police department.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/labour_movements_trade_unions_and_strikes_usa |title=Labour Movements, Trade Unions and Strikes (USA) {{!}} International Encyclopedia of the First World War (WW1) |website=encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net |access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The press portrayed them as \"radical threats to American society\" inspired by \"left-wing, foreign ''agents provocateurs''\".

McCarthyism coincided with an increased and popular fear of communist [[espionage]] that was consequent of the increasing tension in the Cold War through the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation of [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948\u201349), the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the confessions of spying for the Soviet Union that were made by several high-ranking U.S. government officials, and the outbreak of the [[Korean War]].\n\n===Internal causes of the anti-communist fear===\nThe events of the late 1940s, the early 1950s \u2014 the trial of [[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]] (1953), the [[Whittaker Chambers#Hiss case|trial]] of [[Alger Hiss]], the [[Iron Curtain]] (1945\u20131991) around [[Eastern Europe]], and the [[Soviet Union]]'s first [[Nuclear testing|nuclear weapon test]] in 1949 ([[RDS-1]]) \u2014 surprised the American public, influencing popular opinion about U.S. National Security, which, in turn, was connected to the fear that the Soviet Union would hydrogen-bomb the United States, and fear of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party of the United States of America]] (CPUSA).\n\nIn Canada, the 1946 [[Kellock\u2013Taschereau Commission]] investigated espionage after top secret documents concerning [[RDX]], [[radar]] and other weapons were handed over to the Soviets by a domestic spy-ring.<ref>Canada.

Other U.S. citizen spies confessed to their acts of espionage in situations where the statute of limitations on prosecuting them had run out. In 1949, anti\u2013communist fear, and fear of American traitors, was aggravated by the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] winning the [[Chinese Civil War]] against the Western-sponsored [[Kuomintang]], their founding of the [[People's Republic of China]], and later [[Korean war#Chinese intervention|Chinese intervention]] in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) against U.S. ally [[South Korea]].\n\nA few of the events during the Red Scare were also due to a power struggle between director of FBI [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Hoover had instigated and aided some of the investigations of members of the CIA with \"leftist\" history, like [[Cord Meyer]].<ref>[https://spartacus-educational.com/JFKmockingbird.htm Mocking Bird] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619050903/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKmockingbird.htm |date=2006-06-19 }}, John Simkin, Spartacus Schoolnet</ref> This conflict could also be traced back to the conflict between Hoover and [[William J.

Although principally deployed against communists, the Smith Act was also used against [[right-wing]] political threats such as the [[German-American Bund]], and the perceived racial disloyalty of the [[Japanese-American]] population, (''cf.'' [[hyphenated-Americans]]).\n\nAfter the non-aggression pact was signed between Hitler and Stalin in 1939 the communist party in the United States took an anti-war approach and were consequently treated with more hostility than they had been previously by the public because they were seen as to be working with the Nazis, however in 1941, after [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Soviet Union, the CPUSA's official position became pro-war, opposing [[labor strike]]s in the weapons industry and supporting the U.S. war effort against the [[Axis Powers]].

Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9835]], creating the \"Federal Employees Loyalty Program\" establishing political-loyalty review boards who determined the \"Americanism\" of Federal Government employees, and requiring that all federal employees to take an oath of loyalty to the United States government. It then recommended termination of those who had confessed to spying for the Soviet Union, as well as some suspected of being \"Un-American\". This led to more than 2,700 dismissals and 12,000 resignations from the years 1947 to 1956.<ref name=\":2\" /> It also was the template for several state legislatures' loyalty acts, such as California's [[Levering Act]].

The HUAC held a large interest in investigating those in the entertainment industry in Hollywood. They interrogated actors, writers, and producers. The people who cooperated in the investigations got to continue working as they had been, but people who refused to cooperate were blacklisted.\n\nSenator Joseph McCarthy stirred up further fear in the United States of communists infiltrating the country by saying that communist spies were omnipresent, and he was America's only salvation, using this fear to increase his own influence. In 1950 Joseph McCarthy addressed the senate, citing 81 separate cases, and made accusations against suspected communists. Although he provided little or no evidence, this prompted the senate to call for a full investigation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/53a.asp |title=McCarthyism [ushistory.org] |website=www.ushistory.org |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nSenator McCarran introduced the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] of 1950 that was passed by the U.S. Congress and which modified a great deal of law to restrict civil liberties in the name of security. President Truman declared the act a \"mockery of the Bill of Rights\" and a \"long step toward totalitarianism\" because it represented a government restriction on the freedom of opinion.

Its later characterizations may be seen as contributory to works of feared communist espionage, such as the film ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952), about parent's suspicions their son is a spy. Abundant accounts in narrative forms contained themes of the infiltration, subversion, invasion, and destruction of American society by un\u2013American ''thought''. Even a baseball team, the [[Cincinnati Reds]], temporarily renamed themselves the \"Cincinnati Redlegs\" to avoid the money-losing and career-ruining connotations inherent in being ball-playing \"Reds\" (communists).\n\nIn 1954 congress passed the [[Communist Control Act of 1954]] which prevented members of the communist party in America from holding office in labor unions and other labor organizations.\n\n==== Wind Down ====\nIn 1954, after accusing the army, including war heroes, Senator Joseph McCarthy lost credibility in the eyes of the American public.

The name  refers to the red flags that the communists used. The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States which are referred to by this name. The [[First Red Scare]], which occurred immediately after [[World War I]], revolved around a perceived threat from the [[Labor history of the United States|American labor movement]], [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchist]] [[revolution]] and [[political radicalism]]. The [[McCarthyism|Second Red Scare]], which occurred immediately after [[World War II]], was preoccupied with the perception that national or foreign communists were [[espionage|infiltrating]] or [[subversion|subverting]] U.S. society and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].\n\n==First Red Scare (1917\u20131920)==\n{{anchor|First Red Scare}}\n{{main|First Red Scare}}\n[[File:1919 Political Cartoon (14759129762) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Political cartoon from 1919 depicting the Russian revolution's impact on the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris peace talks]]]]\nThe first Red Scare began following the [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the intensely patriotic years of World War I as anarchist and left-wing social agitation aggravated national, social, and political tensions.

McCarthyism coincided with an increased and popular fear of communist [[espionage]] that was consequent of the increasing tension in the Cold War through the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation of [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948\u201349), the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the confessions of spying for the Soviet Union that were made by several high-ranking U.S. government officials, and the outbreak of the [[Korean War]].\n\n===Internal causes of the anti-communist fear===\nThe events of the late 1940s, the early 1950s \u2014 the trial of [[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]] (1953), the [[Whittaker Chambers#Hiss case|trial]] of [[Alger Hiss]], the [[Iron Curtain]] (1945\u20131991) around [[Eastern Europe]], and the [[Soviet Union]]'s first [[Nuclear testing|nuclear weapon test]] in 1949 ([[RDS-1]]) \u2014 surprised the American public, influencing popular opinion about U.S. National Security, which, in turn, was connected to the fear that the Soviet Union would hydrogen-bomb the United States, and fear of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party of the United States of America]] (CPUSA).\n\nIn Canada, the 1946 [[Kellock\u2013Taschereau Commission]] investigated espionage after top secret documents concerning [[RDX]], [[radar]] and other weapons were handed over to the Soviets by a domestic spy-ring.<ref>Canada.

Other U.S. citizen spies confessed to their acts of espionage in situations where the statute of limitations on prosecuting them had run out. In 1949, anti\u2013communist fear, and fear of American traitors, was aggravated by the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] winning the [[Chinese Civil War]] against the Western-sponsored [[Kuomintang]], their founding of the [[People's Republic of China]], and later [[Korean war#Chinese intervention|Chinese intervention]] in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) against U.S. ally [[South Korea]].\n\nA few of the events during the Red Scare were also due to a power struggle between director of FBI [[J.

Kennedy]],<ref name=\"NYUhistory\">{{Cite web |url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/history.html |title=The Hiss Case in History |year=2009 |website=The Hiss Case in Story |publisher=[[Harvard]], [[NYU]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514090830/http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/history.html |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |access-date=2010-07-28}}</ref> as well as that of Joseph McCarthy. The HUAC held a large interest in investigating those in the entertainment industry in Hollywood. They interrogated actors, writers, and producers. The people who cooperated in the investigations got to continue working as they had been, but people who refused to cooperate were blacklisted.\n\nSenator Joseph McCarthy stirred up further fear in the United States of communists infiltrating the country by saying that communist spies were omnipresent, and he was America's only salvation, using this fear to increase his own influence. In 1950 Joseph McCarthy addressed the senate, citing 81 separate cases, and made accusations against suspected communists. Although he provided little or no evidence, this prompted the senate to call for a full investigation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/53a.asp |title=McCarthyism [ushistory.org] |website=www.ushistory.org |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nSenator McCarran introduced the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] of 1950 that was passed by the U.S. Congress and which modified a great deal of law to restrict civil liberties in the name of security. President Truman declared the act a \"mockery of the Bill of Rights\" and a \"long step toward totalitarianism\" because it represented a government restriction on the freedom of opinion. He vetoed the act but his veto was overridden by Congress.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/americanprivacy40000lane |url-access=registration |quote=long step toward totalitarianism. |title=American Privacy: The 400-year History of Our Most Contested Right |last=Lane |first=Frederick S. |publisher=Beacon Press |year=2009 |isbn=0-8070-4441-5 |location=Boston |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanprivacy40000lane/page/130 130] |access-date=May 3, 2011}}</ref> Much of the bill eventually was repealed.\n\nThe Second Red Scare profoundly altered the temper of American society. Its later characterizations may be seen as contributory to works of feared communist espionage, such as the film ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952), about parent's suspicions their son is a spy. Abundant accounts in narrative forms contained themes of the infiltration, subversion, invasion, and destruction of American society by un\u2013American ''thought''. Even a baseball team, the [[Cincinnati Reds]], temporarily renamed themselves the \"Cincinnati Redlegs\" to avoid the money-losing and career-ruining connotations inherent in being ball-playing \"Reds\" (communists).\n\nIn 1954 congress passed the [[Communist Control Act of 1954]] which prevented members of the communist party in America from holding office in labor unions and other labor organizations.\n\n==== Wind Down ====\nIn 1954, after accusing the army, including war heroes, Senator Joseph McCarthy lost credibility in the eyes of the American public. He was formally censured by his colleagues in Congress and the hearings led by McCarthy came to a close.<ref name=\":1\" /> After the Senate formally censured McCarthy, he lost a lot of his standing and political power, and some of the tension and excitement from a possible communist takeover died down.\n\nFrom 1955 through 1959, the Supreme Court made several decisions which restricted the ways in which the government could enforce its anti-communist policies, some of which included limiting the federal loyalty program to only those who had access to sensitive information, allowing defendants to face their accusers, reducing the strength of congressional investigation committees, and weakening the Smith Act.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the 1957 case Yates v. United States and the 1961 case Scales v. United States, the Supreme Court limited Congress's ability to circumvent the First Amendment, and in 1967 during the Supreme Court case United States v. Robel, the Supreme Court ruled that a ban on communists in the defense industry was unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1063/red-scare |title=Red Scare |last=Cowley |first=Marcie K. |website=www.mtsu.edu |language=en |access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the American government revealed details of the [[Venona Project]], which when combined with the opening of the [[USSR]] [[ComIntern]] archives, provided substantial validation of intelligence gathering, outright spying, and policy influencing, by Americans on behalf of the Soviet Union, from 1940 through 1980.<ref name=\"NYUvenona\">{{Cite web |url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/venona.html |title=Venona and the Russian Files |year=2010 |website=The Hiss Case in Story |publisher=[[Harvard]], [[NYU]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514090916/http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/venona.html |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |access-date=2010-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/commissions/secrecy/pdf/12hist1.pdf |title=A Brief Account of the American Experience |last=Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy |website=Report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy.
