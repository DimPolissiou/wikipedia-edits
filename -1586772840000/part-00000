After [[PAN (record label)|PAN]] founder Bill Kouligas praised the unfinished record, Tumor finished ''Serpent Music'' for its PAN release.<ref name=\"dazed-interview\"/> \n\nDescribed as an [[Impressionism in music|impressionistic]] [[Sound collage|collage]],<ref name=\"allmusic-bio\"/> the album incorporates organic instruments, [[sampling (music)|samples]] and [[field recordings]].<ref name=\"ra-pan\"/> In addition to soul, the record features influences from [[ambient music|ambient]], [[club music|club]],<ref name=\"tiny-mix-review\"/> [[pop music|pop]], [[psychedelia]] and [[noise music]].<ref name=\"dazed-interview\"/> Eden Tizard of [[The Quietus]] regarded \"[[juxtaposition]]\" as a defining characteristic of ''Serpent Music'', noting that \"it merges ideas which would logically seem incompatible - grating noise one minute, blissed-out digital soul the next.\"<ref name=\"quietus-review\"/> [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'s Andy Beta compared the sonic traits of the record to those of [[James Ferraro]] and [[Dean Blunt]], noting that \"Tumor favors mysterious [[Loop (music)|loops]], soul music as rendered by the recently concussed and noise-as-loofah.\"<ref name=\"p4k-review\"/> The press release reported that the album was \"initially composed as a soul record.\"<ref name=\"fact-mykki\"/> On the soul description, Tumor has stated: \"I never thought of it as soul music, but that\u2019s just what I was doing.\"<ref name=\"ra-pan\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|MC        = 77/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n|rev1      = [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]\n|rev1Score = 7.3/10<ref name=\"p4k-review\"/>\n|rev2      = [[Resident Advisor]]\n|rev2Score = 3.7/5<ref name=\"ra-review\"/>\n|rev3      = [[Tiny Mix Tapes]]\n|rev3Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"tiny-mix-review\"/>\n}}\n\nAt [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, ''Serpent Music'' received an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 77, based on 6 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"MC\"/> Pitchfork critic Andy Beta wrote: \"While it doesn\u2019t always work, it\u2019s Yves Tumor\u2019s use of field recordings that gives ''Serpent Music'' an ambulatory quality.\" Beta further explained: \"At times, such a sense of wandering makes the tracks feel unresolved or interrupted, but at other times it gives the sensation of being lost in a strange urban landscape, alternating between endless gray blocks and brief glints of beauty.\"<ref name=\"p4k-review\"/> Angus Finlayson of [[Resident Advisor]] described the record as Tumor's \"most naked and tender music, made with lush guitars, frazzled drum loops and his own heavenly falsetto,\" while stating that \"at first it seems harmless; only later do you realise what you've gotten into.\"<ref name=\"ra-review\"/> [[Tiny Mix Tapes]]'s Rafael Lubner called the record \"a study in disruption, in aggregated polarities\" and remarked that \"''Serpent Music''{{'}}s pieces are never reducible to the singular [sonic form], either formally or emotionally.\"<ref name=\"tiny-mix-review\"/> Reviewing for The Quietus, Eden Tizard wrote: \"Toying with emotional themes of isolationism, loss and spirituality as opposed to fixed religious views, the album manages to somehow balance direct emotion with the indefinable and opaque.\"<ref name=\"quietus-review\"/>\n\nThe record was featured as number 13 on [[Vice (magazine)|Noisey]] magazine's list of \"The 33 Best Albums of 2016.\" On the album, ''Noisey'' critic Michelle Lhooq stated: \"Like the artist himself, ''Serpent'' Music is a slithering, complex work that unfurls over repeated encounters\u2014but the effect is infinitely moving, like painting a dreamy landscape with hot streaks of raw emotion.\"<ref name=\"vice-2016\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll tracks are written by Yves Tumor.<ref name=\"liner-notes\"/>\n# \"Devout\" \u2014 1:21\t\n# \"The Feeling When You Walk Away\" \u2014 3:00\t\n# \"Dajjal\" \u2014 2:57\t\n# \"Role in Creation\" \u2014 2:11\t\n# \"Serpent I\" \u2014 2:51\t\n# \"Serpent II\" \u2014 3:12\t\n# \"Broke In\" <small>(feat.
