An example of annexation of a territory from the British Raj was the [[Indian integration of Junagadh]].\n\n[[Akhand Bharat]], literally Undivided India or Whole India, is an irredentist call to reunite [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] (and for some Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal and Bhutan) with [[India]] to form an ''Undivided India'' as it existed before [[Partition of India|partition]] in 1947 during the [[British Raj]] (and before that, during other periods of political unity in [[South Asia]] when most of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] was under the rule of one power, such as during the [[Maurya Empire]], the [[Gupta Empire]], the [[Mughal Empire]] or the [[Maratha Empire]]). The call for ''Akhanda Bharata'' has often been raised by mainstream [[India]]n nationalistic cultural and political organizations such as the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP).<ref name=Ferguson>Yale H.

Multiple wars have been fought over the issue, the first one immediately upon independence and partition in 1947 itself. To stave off a Pakistani and tribal invasion, [[Maharaja]] [[Hari Singh]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] signed the [[Instrument of Accession]] with India. Kashmir has remained divided in three parts, administered by India, Pakistan and [[China]], since then. However, on the basis of the instrument of accession, India continues to claim the entire Kashmir region as its integral part. All modern Indian political parties support the return of the entirety of Kashmir to India, and all official maps of India show the entire Kashmir (including parts under Pakistani or Chinese administration after 1947) as an integral part of India.\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{Main|Greater Indonesia}}\n[[File:Westpapua.png|thumb|[[Western New Guinea]] was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969]]\nIndonesia claimed all territories of the former [[Dutch East Indies]], and previously viewed British plans to group the [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo|Borneo]] into a new independent federation of [[Malaysia]] as a threat to its objective to create a united state called [[Greater Indonesia]]. The Indonesian opposition of Malaysian formation has led to the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]] in the early 1960s. It also held [[History of East Timor|Portuguese Timor]] (modern [[East Timor]]) from 1975 to 2002 based on irredentist claims.\n\nThe idea of uniting former British and Dutch colonial possessions in Southeast Asia actually has its roots in the early 20th century, as the concept of Greater Malay (''Melayu Raya'') was coined in [[British Malaya]] espoused by students and graduates of [[Sultan Idris Education University|Sultan Idris Training College for Malay Teachers]] in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"McIntyre\">{{cite journal|last=McIntyre|first=Angus|authorlink=|year=1973|title=The 'Greater Indonesia' Idea of Nationalism in Malaysia and Indonesia.|url=|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=7|issue=1|pages=75\u201383|doi=10.1017/S0026749X0000439X|id=}}<!--|accessdate= 2008-02-16 --></ref> Some political figures in Indonesia including [[Mohammad Yamin]] and [[Sukarno]] revived the idea in the 1950s and named the political union concept as Greater Indonesia.\n\n===Israel and Palestine===\n{{Main|Zionism|Palestinian nationalism|Greater Israel|Greater Palestine}}\nThe nation state of Israel was established in 1948. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed U.N. Resolution 181, otherwise known as the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], with 72% of the valid votes. Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the \"Independence War\" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''\n\n[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]\nThe Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]\u2014one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)\u2014declares Jerusalem, \"complete and united\", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that \"[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine\". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].\n\nThe United States did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem until 2017. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests. From 1995 to 2017, every president delayed the move. However, President [[Donald Trump]] in December 2017 declared his intention to move the embassy to Jerusalem and in May 2018 the embassy officially did so.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Landler |date=6 December 2017 |title=Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html}}</ref>\n\nA number of Israelis and Jews regard the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank of the Jordan river]] (which is today the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]]) as the eastern parts of the [[Land of Israel]] (following the [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist]] idea) because, according to the Bible, the [[Tribes of Israel|Israelite tribes]] of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]] settled on the east bank of the Jordan, and allege that the area was designated a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] by the [[League of Nations]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] based upon the recognized historical connection of the Jewish people to the land.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cited as an explicit basis not to create, but to reconstitute the historical homeland of the Jewish people as a nation-state roughly analogous to the former Kingdom of Israel subject to change by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance or other lawful means, it forms a basis for claims of sovereign jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{main|Japanese nationalism}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\nJapan claims the two southernmost islands of the [[Russia]]n-administered [[Kuril Islands]], the island chain north of [[Hokkaido]], annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] following World War II.

The [[Kingdom of Spain]] formally ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown in 1713, under [[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]] of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Spain's territorial claim was formally reasserted by the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in the 1960s and has been continued by successive [[Government of Spain|Spanish governments]]. In 2002 an agreement in principle on joint sovereignty over [[Gibraltar]] between the governments of the United Kingdom and Spain was decisively rejected in a [[2002 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|referendum]].

This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. When the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was adopted in 1937 it provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and this is considered the time that the Republic of Ireland became a fully fledged independent nation. In the constitution [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that \"[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland\", while stipulating that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed.\n\nThe amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of \"every person born in the island of Ireland \u2026 to be part of the Irish Nation\" and to hold Irish citizenship, \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.\n\nUnder the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn F\u00e9in|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn F\u00e9in continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].\n\n==Historic, theoretical and fringe irredentistic claims==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n {{recentism|section|date=February 2018}}\n {{split section|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nIrredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).\n\n====East Africa====\n=====Somalia=====\n{{Main|Greater Somalia}}\n\n[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]\n\nGreater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977\u201378 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963\u20131967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a \"[[Greater Somalia]]\". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the \"[[French Somaliland]]\" during colonisation.

Both Korean states now accept the convention border as an administrative boundary. However, because the convention was made by the occupying [[Empire of Japan]], [[South Korea]] has disputed its legality and some Koreans claim that Korea extends into ''de facto'' PRC territory, viz.

Most prominent amongst them are the [[Naga (clan)|Naga]] fight for Greater [[Nagaland]], the [[Chin people|Chin]] struggle for a unified [[Chinland]], the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] struggle for a return of their state under [[Tamil Eelam]] and other self-determinist movements by the [[ethnic]] [[indigenous peoples]] of the erstwhile [[Assam]] both under the British and post-British Assam under India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Other such movements include [[Belgaum border dispute|Be\u1e3bag\u0101va border dispute]] on [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]] border with intentions to unite all [[Marathi people|Marathi]] speaking people under one state since the formation of the Karnataka state and dissolution of the bilingual [[Bombay state]].\n\n=====Bangladesh=====\n{{Main|Greater Bangladesh}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nGreater Bangladesh is an assumption of several Indian intellectuals that the neighbouring country of Bangladesh has an aspiration to unite all Bengali dominated regions under their flag. These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory. It is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nScholars have reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population.

The term ''Kleindeutschland'' \"Lesser Germany\" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre\u2013World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nA main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an \"all-German [[Reich]]\". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent, and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.\n\n====Greece====\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|Claims presented by Greece at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]].]]\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821\u20131832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe\" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.\n\nAnother concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878\u20131960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].\n\nThe Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.\n\n====Hungary====\n[[File:Territorial_gains_of_Hungary_1938-41_en.svg|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938\u20131941 including [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Hungarian irredentism}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe restoration of the borders of [[Hungary]] to their state prior to World War I, in order to unite all ethnic Hungarians within the same country once again.\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]\n\n{{Main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}\n\nItaly's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea), Libya, much of the north coast of Egypt, and what is now Somalia. And \u2013 on the European continent, and with significant German assistance, \u2013 Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.\n\n====North Macedonia====\n{{Main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}\n\nSome Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (\"Pirin Macedonia\") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.

Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the [[Kalmar Union]], the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark.\n\nIn 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].

Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of the Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated. The attachment to the \"myth of Kresy\", the vision of the region as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been criticized in Polish discourse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/51,97863,7751751.html?i=0Czas|title=odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Czas odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12, |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January, February and March 2012, the [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] conducted a survey, asking Poles about their ties to the Kresy.

Crimea was part of the [[Russian Empire]] from 1783 to 1917, after which it enjoyed a few years of autonomy until it was made part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (which was a part of the Soviet Union) from 1921 to 1954 and then [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] (which also was a part of the Soviet Union) in 1954. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Crimea still remained part of Ukraine until February 2014. Russia declared Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation in March 2014, and effective administration commenced. The Russian regional status is not currently recognised by the UN General Assembly and by many countries.\n\nRussian irredentism also includes southeastern and coastal Ukraine, known as ''[[Novorossiya]]'', a term from the Russian Empire.\n\n====Serbia====\n{{Main|Greater Serbia}}\n\n[[File:Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, 1981.png|thumb|The distribution of Serbs and Montenegrins in Yugoslavia (except Macedonia and Slovenia) in 1981.]]\n\nSerbian irredentism is manifested in \"[[Greater Serbia]]\".

Some intellectuals sought to unite all South Slavs (regardless of religion) into a Serbian state. [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] had gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by the Austrians in 1908, was viewed of as a part of the Serbian homeland. Serbia directed its territorial aspirations to the south, as the north and west was held by Austria. Macedonia was divided between Serbia and Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\nIn 1914, aspirations were directed towards Austria-Hungary. A government policy sought to incorporate all Serb-inhabited areas, and other South Slavic areas, thereby laying the foundation of [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Danver2010\">{{cite book|author=Steven L.

The Croatian [[Operation Storm]] ended large-scale combat and captured most of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], while the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the Bosnian War.

It acknowledges the [[division of Korea]] only indirectly by requiring the president to work for reunification. The [[Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces]], established in 1949, is the South Korean authority charged with the administration of Korean territory north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (i.e., North Korea), and consists of the governors of the five provinces, who are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of Korea|President]].

Kashmir has remained divided in three parts, administered by India, Pakistan and [[China]], since then. However, on the basis of the instrument of accession, India continues to claim the entire Kashmir region as its integral part.

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed U.N. Resolution 181, otherwise known as the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], with 72% of the valid votes. Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the \"Independence War\" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''\n\n[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]\nThe Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]\u2014one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)\u2014declares Jerusalem, \"complete and united\", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that \"[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine\". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].\n\nThe United States did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem until 2017. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests.

This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. When the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was adopted in 1937 it provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and this is considered the time that the Republic of Ireland became a fully fledged independent nation. In the constitution [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that \"[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland\", while stipulating that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed.\n\nThe amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of \"every person born in the island of Ireland \u2026 to be part of the Irish Nation\" and to hold Irish citizenship, \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.\n\nUnder the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn F\u00e9in|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn F\u00e9in continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].\n\n==Historic, theoretical and fringe irredentistic claims==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n {{recentism|section|date=February 2018}}\n {{split section|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nIrredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).\n\n====East Africa====\n=====Somalia=====\n{{Main|Greater Somalia}}\n\n[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]\n\nGreater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977\u201378 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963\u20131967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a \"[[Greater Somalia]]\". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the \"[[French Somaliland]]\" during colonisation. Here the apparent struggles for unification manifested itself in political strife that ended when in a referendum to join France as opposed to the Somali Republic succeeded among rumours of widespread [[vote rigging]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa Research Bulletin, Volume 3|author=Africa Research, Ltd|date=1966|publisher=Blackwell|page=597|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=42oEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> and the subsequent death of Somali nationalist [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council, who was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115</ref>\nSome sources say that Somalia has also laid a claim to the [[Socotra]] archipelago, which is currently governed by [[Yemen]].\n\n====North Africa====\nIn North Africa, the prime examples of irredentism are the concepts of [[Greater Morocco]] and [[Greater Mauritania]].<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/hasa03.pdf</ref> While Mauritania has since relinquished any claims to territories [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|outside its internationally recognized borders]], Morocco continues to claim [[Western Sahara]], which it refers to as its \"[[Southern Provinces]]\".\n\n=== Asia ===\n====East Asia====\n=====China=====\n{{Main|Chinese nationalism|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Transfer of sovereignty over Macau}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nWhen [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] were [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territories, respectively, China considered these two territories to be Chinese territories under British and Portuguese administration. Therefore, [[Hong Kong people]] and [[Macau people]] descended from Chinese immigrants were entitled to [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport]] or [[Macao Special Administrative Region passport]] after the two territories became the [[special administrative region]]s.\n\n=====Korea=====\nThe 1909 [[Gando Convention]] addressed a territory dispute between China and [[Joseon Korea]] in China's favour. Both Korean states now accept the convention border as an administrative boundary. However, because the convention was made by the occupying [[Empire of Japan]], [[South Korea]] has disputed its legality and some Koreans claim that Korea extends into ''de facto'' PRC territory, viz. [[Dandong]] and [[Liaoning]]. The most ambitious claims include all parts of [[Manchuria]] that the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom controlled.\n\n=====Mongolia=====\n{{Main|Pan-Mongolism}}\n\nThe irredentist idea that advocates cultural and political solidarity of [[Mongols]]. The proposed territory usually includes the independent state of [[Mongolia]], the Chinese regions of [[Inner Mongolia]] (Southern Mongolia) and [[Dzungaria]] (in [[Xinjiang]]), and the Russian subjects of [[Buryatia]]. Sometimes [[Tuva]] and the [[Altai Republic]] are included as well.\n\n====South Asia====\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\n[[South Asia]] too is another region in which armed irredentist movements have been active for almost a century. Most prominent amongst them are the [[Naga (clan)|Naga]] fight for Greater [[Nagaland]], the [[Chin people|Chin]] struggle for a unified [[Chinland]], the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] struggle for a return of their state under [[Tamil Eelam]] and other self-determinist movements by the [[ethnic]] [[indigenous peoples]] of the erstwhile [[Assam]] both under the British and post-British Assam under India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Other such movements include [[Belgaum border dispute|Be\u1e3bag\u0101va border dispute]] on [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]] border with intentions to unite all [[Marathi people|Marathi]] speaking people under one state since the formation of the Karnataka state and dissolution of the bilingual [[Bombay state]].\n\n=====Bangladesh=====\n{{Main|Greater Bangladesh}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nGreater Bangladesh is an assumption of several Indian intellectuals that the neighbouring country of Bangladesh has an aspiration to unite all Bengali dominated regions under their flag. These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory. It is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nScholars have reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population. In 1998, Lieutenant General S.K. Sinha, then the Governor of Assam, claimed that massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh was directly linked with \"the long-cherished design of Greater Bangladesh\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=====India=====\n{{Main|Indian nationalism|Greater India|Akhand Bharat}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe call for creation of ''Akhanda Bharata'' or ''Akhand Hindustan'' has on occasion been raised by some [[India]]n right wing [[Hindutva]]di cultural and political organisations, such as the [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha|Hindu Mahasabha]], [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP).<ref name=\"Ferguson\"/><ref name=\"Majumder\"/><ref name=\"Martensson\"/><ref name=\"Suda1953\">{{cite book|last=Suda|first=Jyoti Prasad|title=India, Her Civic Life and Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVsNAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2014|year=1953|publisher=Jai Prakash Nath & Co.|quote=Its members still swear by the ideal of Akhand Hindustan.}}</ref> The name of one organisation sharing this goal, the [[Akhand Hindustan Morcha]], bears the term in its name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hindu Political Parties|date=30 May 2010|publisher=General Books|isbn=9781157374923}}</ref> Other major Indian non-sectarian political parties, such as the [[Indian National Congress]], maintain a position against the [[partition of India]] .\n\n=====Iran=====\n{{Main|Pan-Iranism|Greater Iran}}\n\n[[Pan-Iranism]] is an [[ideology]] that advocates solidarity and reunification of [[Iranian people]]s living in the [[Iranian plateau]] and other regions that have significant Iranian cultural influence, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Ossetians]], [[Kurds]], [[Zazas]], [[Tajiks]] of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], the [[Pashtuns]] and the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] of [[Pakistan]].

The term ''Kleindeutschland'' \"Lesser Germany\" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre\u2013World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nA main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an \"all-German [[Reich]]\". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent, and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.\n\n====Greece====\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|Claims presented by Greece at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]].]]\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821\u20131832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe\" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.\n\nAnother concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878\u20131960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].\n\nThe Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.\n\n====Hungary====\n[[File:Territorial_gains_of_Hungary_1938-41_en.svg|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938\u20131941 including [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Hungarian irredentism}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe restoration of the borders of [[Hungary]] to their state prior to World War I, in order to unite all ethnic Hungarians within the same country once again.\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]\n\n{{Main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}\n\nItaly's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea), Libya, much of the north coast of Egypt, and what is now Somalia. And \u2013 on the European continent, and with significant German assistance, \u2013 Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.\n\n====North Macedonia====\n{{Main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}\n\nSome Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (\"Pirin Macedonia\") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.

Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the [[Kalmar Union]], the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark.\n\nIn 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. Norway formerly included the provinces [[J\u00e4mtland]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[Idre]]-[[S\u00e4rna]] (lost since the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]]), and [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] (lost since the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[Second Northern War]].\n\n====Poland====\n{{See also|Polish nationalism|Kresy}}\n\n[[Kresy]] (\"Borderlands\") are the eastern lands that formerly belonged to [[Poland]].

Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of the Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated. The attachment to the \"myth of Kresy\", the vision of the region as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been criticized in Polish discourse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/51,97863,7751751.html?i=0Czas|title=odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Czas odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12, |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January, February and March 2012, the [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] conducted a survey, asking Poles about their ties to the Kresy.

Poles living in ''Kresy'' are helped by [[Fundacja Pomoc Polakom na Wschodzie]], a Polish government-sponsored organization, as well as other organizations, such as The ''Association of Help of Poles in the East Kresy'' (see also [[Karta Polaka]]). Money is frequently collected to help those Poles who live in the ''Kresy'', and there are several annual events, such as a ''Christmas Package for a Polish Veteran in Kresy'', and ''Summer with Poland'', sponsored by the [[Association \"Polish Community\"]], in which Polish children from ''Kresy'' are invited to visit Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/wakacje/432777,dzieci-z-kresow-zwiedzaja-lodz-zdjecia,id,t.html|title=Dzieci z Kres\u00f3w zwiedzaj\u0105 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a [ZDJ\u0118CIA]|first=Micha\u0142|last=Meksa|publisher=}}</ref> Polish language handbooks and films, as well as medicines and clothes are collected and sent to ''Kresy''.

Crimea was part of the [[Russian Empire]] from 1783 to 1917, after which it enjoyed a few years of autonomy until it was made part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (which was a part of the Soviet Union) from 1921 to 1954 and then [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] (which also was a part of the Soviet Union) in 1954. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Crimea still remained part of Ukraine until February 2014. Russia declared Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation in March 2014, and effective administration commenced. The Russian regional status is not currently recognised by the UN General Assembly and by many countries.\n\nRussian irredentism also includes southeastern and coastal Ukraine, known as ''[[Novorossiya]]'', a term from the Russian Empire.\n\n====Serbia====\n{{Main|Greater Serbia}}\n\n[[File:Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, 1981.png|thumb|The distribution of Serbs and Montenegrins in Yugoslavia (except Macedonia and Slovenia) in 1981.]]\n\nSerbian irredentism is manifested in \"[[Greater Serbia]]\".

Some intellectuals sought to unite all South Slavs (regardless of religion) into a Serbian state. [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] had gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by the Austrians in 1908, was viewed of as a part of the Serbian homeland. Serbia directed its territorial aspirations to the south, as the north and west was held by Austria. Macedonia was divided between Serbia and Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\nIn 1914, aspirations were directed towards Austria-Hungary. A government policy sought to incorporate all Serb-inhabited areas, and other South Slavic areas, thereby laying the foundation of [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Danver2010\">{{cite book|author=Steven L.

The Croatian [[Operation Storm]] ended large-scale combat and captured most of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], while the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the Bosnian War. Bosnia and Herzegovina was established as a federal republic, made up by two separate entities, one being Serb-inhabited [[Republika Srpska]].

[[North Korea]]'s constitution stresses the importance of reunification, but, while it makes no similar formal provision for administering the South, it effectively claims its territory as it does not [[Diplomatic recognition|diplomatically recognise]] the Republic of Korea, deeming it an \"entity occupying the Korean territory\".\n\n[[South Korea]]'s constitution also claims jurisdiction over the entire Korean peninsula. It acknowledges the [[division of Korea]] only indirectly by requiring the president to work for reunification. The [[Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces]], established in 1949, is the South Korean authority charged with the administration of Korean territory north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (i.e., North Korea), and consists of the governors of the five provinces, who are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of Korea|President]]. However the body is purely symbolic and largely tasked with dealing with Northern defectors; if reunification were to occur the Committee would be dissolved and new administrators appointed by the [[Ministry of Unification]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/18/south-koreas-governors-in-theory-for-north-korea/|title=South Korea's Governors-in-Theory for North Korea|date=March 18, 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nPakistan has from its inception sought to have the territory of [[Kashmir]] incorporated into it.

It was developed for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Mac OS X]] platforms by Big Blue Box Studios, a satellite developer of [[Lionhead Studios]], and was published by [[Microsoft Studios]]. The game shipped for the Xbox in September 2004. An extended version of the game, ''[[#Fable: The Lost Chapters|Fable: The Lost Chapters]]'', was released for the Xbox and Windows in September 2005. A [[Porting#Porting of video games|port]] of the game for Mac OS X, created by Robosoft Technologies and published by [[Feral Interactive]], was released in March 2008 after a delay of more than two years due to licensing issues.\n\nOriginally developed under the name ''Project Ego'', ''Fable''{{'}}s development involved more than 150 people. The game's music was composed by [[Russell Shaw (composer)|Russell Shaw]], with the opening title theme written by [[Danny Elfman]]. The game's release was widely anticipated, due in part to Lionhead co-founder [[Peter Molyneux]]'s enthusiastic hype of the game. The game was originally in development for the [[Dreamcast]], but was moved to the Xbox due to the system's discontinuation.\n\n''Fable'' was well-received by critics for the quality of its gameplay and execution, though the failure to include many promised features was noted. ''Fable'' was the top-selling game of September 2004 and sold more than two million units by 2007. The game was followed by two sequels, ''[[Fable II]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Fable III]]'' in 2010. ''[[#Fable Anniversary|Fable Anniversary]]'', a [[High-definition video|high-definition]] [[Video game remake|remake]] of the game that includes ''The Lost Chapters'', was released for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in February 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|date=4 June 2013|url=http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/games-fable-anniversary-reveal|title=Relive the Magic with Fable Anniversary for Xbox 360|work=Xbox Wire|accessdate=4 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Fable battle.png|left|thumb|Screenshot of ''Fable'' for the PC, showing the Hero fighting a bandit. In the top left of the screen are health and will meters, and in the top right is a map. Available spells are displayed on the bottom edge of the screen.]]\n''Fable'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where players control their character from a third-person perspective. The main character, known as The Hero of Oakvale, can interact with people and objects as well as battle foes. The goal of ''Fable'' is to complete missions called quests that advance the game's plot, but ''Fable'' also features optional quests and allows players to pursue actions not directly tied to story completion.<ref name=\"prima-pg4\">{{cite book|author=Loe, Casey|year=2004|title=Fable: PRIMA Official Guide|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=United States of America|isbn=0-7615-4179-9|pages=4\u20136|series=\"Fundamentals \u2013 Training: Quests\"}}</ref>\n\nMost quests are acquired at a central location, known as the Heroes' Guild; required quests are marked with a gold symbol and advance the game's story, while optional quests are coloured silver and can be completed in any order. Some quests allow players to pick sides and aid either evil characters, such as bandits, or good characters, such as traders and guardsmen. Players can also boast after accepting a quest, wagering some of the quest's reward gold in exchange for a larger return if the player accomplishes their bet, such as sustaining no damage or undertaking the quest naked. Each quest's completion gives players gold, which can be used to buy weapons and items, and renown, which affects the way townspeople react to the Hero. Heroes also earn trophies of their victories, which can be displayed to large groups of townspeople to earn more renown.\n\nIn addition to fighting with melee weapons (such as swords and maces) and ranged weapons (longbows and crossbows), Heroes can learn and use spells to empower their abilities, ward off damage, or harm foes. As players complete quests or defeat enemies, they gain general experience as well as experience based on whether they used melee attacks, ranged weapons, or magic; these bestow Strength, Skill, and Will experience, respectively. Experience can be spent at a platform in the Heroes' Guild to level up attributes.<ref name=\"manual-pg18\">{{cite book|author=|year=2004|title=Fable (Xbox) manual|publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|pages=18\u201319|series=\"The Way of a Hero\"}}</ref> General experience can be used to modify all groups of attributes. Strength experience can only be used to modify three attributes: Physique, Health, and Toughness. The same applies to Skill which can only modify Speed, Accuracy, and Guile. Will can be used to upgrade player's total magic power or to learn and upgrade spells which are broken into three groups, Attack Spells, Surround Spells, and Physical Spells. The experience the main character gains can be multiplied during combat through the combat multiplier. As the character successfully hits an enemy, his combat multiplier increases. If the character is hit by the enemy, the combat multiplier drops down to the next multiple of five, or zero if below five.\n\n''Fable''{{'}}s game world is dotted with towns where recreational activities not related to combat can be undertaken. Enterprising Heroes can buy trade items such as [[beer keg]]s or grain sacks and sell them at other towns for profit. Towns are also prime locations to buy clothing, weapons, or other items. Many towns have houses for sale, which the Hero can buy, furnish, or lease to tenants for gold. Heroes may woo and marry men or women in each town.\n\n===Alignment===\n[[File:Fable alignment.png|upright|thumb|Positively and negatively-aligned Heroes.]]\nIn ''Fable'', a player's Hero has a measure of good or evil alignment based on the Hero's actions. Good deeds award good points, which produce a positive alignment, while committing evil acts adds evil points, producing a negative alignment. Killing monsters or saving villagers are acts of good, whereas killing innocents, breaking laws, or abusing a spouse will accumulate evil points. Consuming certain foodstuffs can also affect the Hero's alignment; for example, eating tofu will earn the hero positive points, while eating crunchy chicks (because crunchy chicks are assumed to be still alive) will earn evil points. The player may also pray at the temples of Avo and Skorm. Donations to the Temple of Avo will result in good points, while \"gifts\" to the Chapel of Skorm will result in evil points. The alignment affects not only the responses of [[non-player character]]s around the Hero, but also the appearance of the Hero himself. A Hero with a strongly positive alignment will feature a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] and a shaft of sparkling light above his head, butterflies fluttering around him and lighter features. An evil Hero emits a red haze from around his legs, draws flies, has glowing red eyes and grows horns.\n\nOther actions besides alignment affect the Hero. Eating too much causes the character to gain weight,\nwhile drinking excessive amounts of [[beer]] causes Heroes to become sick and vomit. Clothing, which provides defence in combat situations, also changes the Hero's attractiveness or scariness as well as alignment in some cases, and townspeople's reactions to the Hero accordingly. Bright clothing makes the character look more noble to the townspeople, and thus cause them to praise and respect him. Dark clothing causes the character to seem evil or threatening to townspeople and cause them to fear him. Heroes can be further customised via hairstyles, facial hair, and tattoos. The Hero's attributes also affect appearance; high levels of Strength increase brawn, high levels of skill increase height, and high-level spells create glowing arcane patterns on the Hero's body.<ref name=\"macworld-tlcrev\">{{cite web|author=Cohen, Peter|date=13 June 2008|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/133900/2008/06/fabletlc.html|title=Mac Software: ''Fable: The Lost Chapters''|work=[[Macworld]]|accessdate=8 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n''Fable'' takes place in Albion, a patchwork of [[city-states]] with lawless stretches of plains and forest between them. The entire land was once led by an ancient royal bloodline, bestowed with the title of Archon, referred to as the \"Old Kingdom\". The first Archon's rule was peaceful and prosperous, but the source of his power was an ancient and powerful sword (the Sword of Aeons) that gradually began to corrupt him and, eventually, his entire kingdom. By the time the events of the game take place, the world has slowly deteriorated from the days of the Old Kingdom. One of the most prominent institutions of Albion is the Heroes' Guild. The Guild is a centre of learning and training for Heroes, renowned mercenaries that are active in all parts of Albion. Heroes are hired as thieves, soldiers, guards, rescuers, and protectors; the Guild makes no moral judgement on the actions of its Heroes.<ref name=\"manual-pg18\"/>\n\n===Plot===\n<!-- needs to be condensed, and cleaned up, -->\nOn his sister's birthday, a young boy's village of Oakvale is raided by bandits; killing the boy's entire family. An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy, seeing great potential in him; Maze trains the boy to become a Hero at the Heroes' Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.\n\nLater on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/roommate back in the Guild\u2014Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.\n\nThe Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.\n\nDepending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.<ref name=\"prima-pg97\">{{cite book|author=Loe, Casey|year=2004|title=Fable: PRIMA Official Guide|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=United States of America|isbn=0-7615-4179-9|series=\"Chapter 4 \u2013 Stop Jack of Blades\"|page=97}}</ref>\n\nIn The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword \"Avo's Tear\", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned. He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon.

According to the Carters, they wanted to create a role-playing game like no other:\n<blockquote>The world would be a breathtakingly beautiful place filled with waterfalls, mountains, dense forests, populated with compelling and convincing characters with real personality, people who actually reacted to what you did. We wanted to give the player control of a hero who would adapt to the way they played, who would age, become scarred in battle, who could get tattoos, wear dreadlocks and a dress if the player was so inclined. We wanted each and every person who played our game to have a unique experience, to have their own stories to tell.

game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n'''''Fable''''' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]], the first in the [[Fable (video game series)|''Fable'' series]]. It was developed for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Mac OS X]] platforms by Big Blue Box Studios, a satellite developer of [[Lionhead Studios]], and was published by [[Microsoft Studios]]. The game shipped for the Xbox in September 2004. An extended version of the game, ''[[#Fable: The Lost Chapters|Fable: The Lost Chapters]]'', was released for the Xbox and Windows in September 2005. A [[Porting#Porting of video games|port]] of the game for Mac OS X, created by Robosoft Technologies and published by [[Feral Interactive]], was released in March 2008 after a delay of more than two years due to licensing issues.\n\nOriginally developed under the name ''Project Ego'', ''Fable''{{'}}s development involved more than 150 people. The game's music was composed by [[Russell Shaw (composer)|Russell Shaw]], with the opening title theme written by [[Danny Elfman]]. The game's release was widely anticipated, due in part to Lionhead co-founder [[Peter Molyneux]]'s enthusiastic hype of the game. The game was originally in development for the [[Dreamcast]], but was moved to the Xbox due to the system's discontinuation.\n\n''Fable'' was well-received by critics for the quality of its gameplay and execution, though the failure to include many promised features was noted. ''Fable'' was the top-selling game of September 2004 and sold more than two million units by 2007. The game was followed by two sequels, ''[[Fable II]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Fable III]]'' in 2010. ''[[#Fable Anniversary|Fable Anniversary]]'', a [[High-definition video|high-definition]] [[Video game remake|remake]] of the game that includes ''The Lost Chapters'', was released for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in February 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|date=4 June 2013|url=http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/games-fable-anniversary-reveal|title=Relive the Magic with Fable Anniversary for Xbox 360|work=Xbox Wire|accessdate=4 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Fable battle.png|left|thumb|Screenshot of ''Fable'' for the PC, showing the Hero fighting a bandit. In the top left of the screen are health and will meters, and in the top right is a map. Available spells are displayed on the bottom edge of the screen.]]\n''Fable'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where players control their character from a third-person perspective. The main character, known as The Hero of Oakvale, can interact with people and objects as well as battle foes. The goal of ''Fable'' is to complete missions called quests that advance the game's plot, but ''Fable'' also features optional quests and allows players to pursue actions not directly tied to story completion.<ref name=\"prima-pg4\">{{cite book|author=Loe, Casey|year=2004|title=Fable: PRIMA Official Guide|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=United States of America|isbn=0-7615-4179-9|pages=4\u20136|series=\"Fundamentals \u2013 Training: Quests\"}}</ref>\n\nMost quests are acquired at a central location, known as the Heroes' Guild; required quests are marked with a gold symbol and advance the game's story, while optional quests are coloured silver and can be completed in any order. Some quests allow players to pick sides and aid either evil characters, such as bandits, or good characters, such as traders and guardsmen. Players can also boast after accepting a quest, wagering some of the quest's reward gold in exchange for a larger return if the player accomplishes their bet, such as sustaining no damage or undertaking the quest naked. Each quest's completion gives players gold, which can be used to buy weapons and items, and renown, which affects the way townspeople react to the Hero. Heroes also earn trophies of their victories, which can be displayed to large groups of townspeople to earn more renown.\n\nIn addition to fighting with melee weapons (such as swords and maces) and ranged weapons (longbows and crossbows), Heroes can learn and use spells to empower their abilities, ward off damage, or harm foes. As players complete quests or defeat enemies, they gain general experience as well as experience based on whether they used melee attacks, ranged weapons, or magic; these bestow Strength, Skill, and Will experience, respectively. Experience can be spent at a platform in the Heroes' Guild to level up attributes.<ref name=\"manual-pg18\">{{cite book|author=|year=2004|title=Fable (Xbox) manual|publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|pages=18\u201319|series=\"The Way of a Hero\"}}</ref> General experience can be used to modify all groups of attributes. Strength experience can only be used to modify three attributes: Physique, Health, and Toughness. The same applies to Skill which can only modify Speed, Accuracy, and Guile. Will can be used to upgrade player's total magic power or to learn and upgrade spells which are broken into three groups, Attack Spells, Surround Spells, and Physical Spells. The experience the main character gains can be multiplied during combat through the combat multiplier. As the character successfully hits an enemy, his combat multiplier increases. If the character is hit by the enemy, the combat multiplier drops down to the next multiple of five, or zero if below five.\n\n''Fable''{{'}}s game world is dotted with towns where recreational activities not related to combat can be undertaken. Enterprising Heroes can buy trade items such as [[beer keg]]s or grain sacks and sell them at other towns for profit. Towns are also prime locations to buy clothing, weapons, or other items. Many towns have houses for sale, which the Hero can buy, furnish, or lease to tenants for gold. Heroes may woo and marry men or women in each town.\n\n===Alignment===\n[[File:Fable alignment.png|upright|thumb|Positively and negatively-aligned Heroes.]]\nIn ''Fable'', a player's Hero has a measure of good or evil alignment based on the Hero's actions. Good deeds award good points, which produce a positive alignment, while committing evil acts adds evil points, producing a negative alignment. Killing monsters or saving villagers are acts of good, whereas killing innocents, breaking laws, or abusing a spouse will accumulate evil points. Consuming certain foodstuffs can also affect the Hero's alignment; for example, eating tofu will earn the hero positive points, while eating crunchy chicks (because crunchy chicks are assumed to be still alive) will earn evil points. The player may also pray at the temples of Avo and Skorm. Donations to the Temple of Avo will result in good points, while \"gifts\" to the Chapel of Skorm will result in evil points. The alignment affects not only the responses of [[non-player character]]s around the Hero, but also the appearance of the Hero himself. A Hero with a strongly positive alignment will feature a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] and a shaft of sparkling light above his head, butterflies fluttering around him and lighter features. An evil Hero emits a red haze from around his legs, draws flies, has glowing red eyes and grows horns.\n\nOther actions besides alignment affect the Hero. Eating too much causes the character to gain weight,\nwhile drinking excessive amounts of [[beer]] causes Heroes to become sick and vomit. Clothing, which provides defence in combat situations, also changes the Hero's attractiveness or scariness as well as alignment in some cases, and townspeople's reactions to the Hero accordingly. Bright clothing makes the character look more noble to the townspeople, and thus cause them to praise and respect him. Dark clothing causes the character to seem evil or threatening to townspeople and cause them to fear him. Heroes can be further customised via hairstyles, facial hair, and tattoos. The Hero's attributes also affect appearance; high levels of Strength increase brawn, high levels of skill increase height, and high-level spells create glowing arcane patterns on the Hero's body.<ref name=\"macworld-tlcrev\">{{cite web|author=Cohen, Peter|date=13 June 2008|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/133900/2008/06/fabletlc.html|title=Mac Software: ''Fable: The Lost Chapters''|work=[[Macworld]]|accessdate=8 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\n''Fable'' takes place in Albion, a patchwork of [[city-states]] with lawless stretches of plains and forest between them. The entire land was once led by an ancient royal bloodline, bestowed with the title of Archon, referred to as the \"Old Kingdom\". The first Archon's rule was peaceful and prosperous, but the source of his power was an ancient and powerful sword (the Sword of Aeons) that gradually began to corrupt him and, eventually, his entire kingdom. By the time the events of the game take place, the world has slowly deteriorated from the days of the Old Kingdom. One of the most prominent institutions of Albion is the Heroes' Guild. The Guild is a centre of learning and training for Heroes, renowned mercenaries that are active in all parts of Albion. Heroes are hired as thieves, soldiers, guards, rescuers, and protectors; the Guild makes no moral judgement on the actions of its Heroes.<ref name=\"manual-pg18\"/>\n\n===Plot===\n<!-- needs to be condensed, and cleaned up, -->\nOn his sister's birthday, a young boy's village of Oakvale is raided by bandits; killing the boy's entire family. An old Hero, Maze, rescues the boy, seeing great potential in him; Maze trains the boy to become a Hero at the Heroes' Guild. Years pass; after honing his skills, Maze informs the Hero of a blind seeress living among a bandit camp near Oakvale, and advises the Hero to infiltrate the bandit camp. To the Hero's surprise, the blind seeress is actually his older sister Theresa who was taken in by Twinblade, a former Hero and the present Bandit King. After a showdown with Twinblade, the Hero is given the choice of killing or sparing the bandit.\n\nLater on in the Hero's life, after he has gained more recognition among the people of Albion, he is invited to fight in the Arena, where he meets the legendary Hero named Jack of Blades, who runs the arena battles. As a final challenge, Jack pits the Hero against his rival, which was also once his childhood friend/roommate back in the Guild\u2014Whisper; when the Hero defeats her he may kill or spare her.\n\nThe Hero learns that Jack of Blades himself destroyed Oakvale during the Hero's childhood; aided by Theresa, the Hero discovers his mother alive in Bargate Prison. The Hero is captured in the rescue attempt and spends a year or more in the prison before finally escaping. Maze is revealed to be a traitor and working with Jack. Maze kidnaps Theresa. After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons is said to be a very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword will be even more powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.\n\nDepending on the Hero's alignment and the player's choice of using or destroying the sword, there are a total of four different endings. Once the ending credits roll, players can resume their games.<ref name=\"prima-pg97\">{{cite book|author=Loe, Casey|year=2004|title=Fable: PRIMA Official Guide|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=United States of America|isbn=0-7615-4179-9|series=\"Chapter 4 \u2013 Stop Jack of Blades\"|page=97}}</ref>\n\nIn The Lost Chapters special edition, the story continues. After the defeat of Jack, the Hero must find passage to the Northern Wastes to aid a legendary hero named Scythe in stopping an unknown great evil from returning. Should the hero have discarded the Sword of Aeons he will have the opportunity to gain the sword \"Avo's Tear\", a sword of similar design and equal power but that holds a light alignment rather than dark. Avo is said to be a god that represents the light side alignment. After a series of quests revolving around this new evil, it is learned that Jack of Blades has returned. He must then defeat Jack of Blades a second time, Jack having returned from the dead in the form of a dragon. Upon the  death of Jack, the hero then uses Jack's mask to capture Jack's soul, with Scythe telling him that the battle is not over and that he must destroy the mask. The hero then has the final choice of putting on the mask\u2014being consumed by Jack in the process\u2014or destroying it, along with Jack, forever.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Peter-molyneux-at-university-of-southampton.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Molyneux]] enthusiastically promoted ''Fable''.]]\n''Fable'' was the first game developed by Big Blue Box, a satellite studio of [[Peter Molyneux]]'s [[Lionhead Studios|Lionhead]].

According to the Carters, they wanted to create a role-playing game like no other:\n<blockquote>The world would be a breathtakingly beautiful place filled with waterfalls, mountains, dense forests, populated with compelling and convincing characters with real personality, people who actually reacted to what you did. We wanted to give the player control of a hero who would adapt to the way they played, who would age, become scarred in battle, who could get tattoos, wear dreadlocks and a dress if the player was so inclined. We wanted each and every person who played our game to have a unique experience, to have their own stories to tell.

Other character-based augmentations include the voice of the antagonist, Jack of Blades, sounding deeper, harsher and more demonic, and the ability to uncover (and resolve) the murder mystery of Lady Grey's sister.\nThe updated edition of the game also applied fixes for certain glitches, such as the \"dig glitch\", in which the protagonist would move backward each time he used the shovel, pushing him through solid objects and sometimes trapping him.\n\n===''Fable Anniversary''===\n[[File:Fable Anniversary comparison.jpg|thumb|300px|In addition to the migration to [[Unreal Engine 3]], textures, lighting, and shadows were significantly improved along with longer draw distances over the original game.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20160308131044/http://www.lionhead.com/blog/2013/december/16/remastering-fable-anniversary/?label=Fable+Anniversary</ref>]]\nLionhead Studios announced ''Fable Anniversary'', a remastered version of ''Fable: The Lost Chapters'', for release on the Xbox 360 later in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lionhead.com/fable-anniversary-coming-soon/|title=Fable Anniversary Coming Soon!|publisher=[[Lionhead Studios]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608004451/http://lionhead.com/fable-anniversary-coming-soon|archivedate=8 June 2013|accessdate=}}</ref> It features overhauled graphics and audio, a new save system and incorporates [[Xbox Live#Gamerscore|Achievements]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pixelvolt.com/2014/02/02/dont-overlook-fable-anniversary/ |title=Don\u2019t Overlook Fable Anniversary |last=Iuglio |first=Anthony |date=2 February 2014 |work=[[Pixelvol]] |publisher=Pixelvolt |access-date=3 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202203820/http://pixelvolt.com/2014/02/02/dont-overlook-fable-anniversary/ |archive-date=2 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> On 13 September, Ted Timmins, lead designer of the game, announced that the game's release date would be pushed back to February 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=Katie<!-- no last name given -->|url=http://www.lionhead.com/blog/2013/september/13/a-letter-to-all-of-our-fable-fans/|title=A Letter to All of Our Fable Fans|publisher=[[Lionhead Studios]]|date=13 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014005853/http://www.lionhead.com/blog/2013/september/13/a-letter-to-all-of-our-fable-fans/|archive-date=14 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Luke|last=Karmali|date=13 September 2013|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/09/13/fable-anniversary-delayed|title=Fable Anniversary delayed|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> Later that year on 12 December 2013 the release date was announced as 4 February 2014 in North America, 6 February 2014 in Asia and 7 February 2014 in Europe.<ref name=\"anniversarydate\"/> On 2 June 2014 the game was also confirmed to be coming to PC.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Jackson|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/465684/fable-anniversary-headed-to-pc/|title=Fable Anniversary headed to PC|work=[[Computer and Video Games]]|publisher=[[Future plc|Future]]|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=}}</ref> ''Fable Anniversary'' was in full development for 15 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-01-21-definitely-not-on-rails|title=Definitely not on rails|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=21 January 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> The game featured graphical upgrades in many areas over the original most notably; native widescreen support, higher polygon count, larger textures, [[Specularity|specular maps]], [[normal maps]], improved lighting, improved shadows, and a larger draw/detail distance.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>\n\nIt was released on Steam on 12 September 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/288470/|title=Fable Anniversary on Steam|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]}}</ref> and includes [[mod (video games)|mod]] support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/09/11/fable-anniversary-will-support-modding-with-included-unreal-engine-3-editor/|title=Fable Anniversary will support modding with included Unreal Engine 3 editor|last=Chalk|first=Andy|date=11 September 2014|work=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref> Upon release it garnered mixed reviews.

Staff from [[1UP.com]] complimented the multiple approaches to combat which the publication stated made the game more a mini-game of its own. \"Combat becomes its own minigame, with the goal not solely to beat a foe, but to beat it with skill and get the most from every fight. Slaughter becomes irrelevant, and the fights never become tedious.\"<ref name=\"1up-review\"/>\n\nThough pointing out several flaws in the game such as bland character designs, Marc Saltzman of ''USAToday.com'' stated that the game \"should satisfy you with its incredible depth, open-ended game play, and a solid story that gets even better about half-way through the adventure.\" ''Fable''

The [[Prussia]]n [[Jean-Baptiste Cloots]] published that year the ''Wishes of a Gallophile'' ({{lang-fr|links=no|V\u0153ux d'un gallophile}}) and pronounced himself in favor of the annexation by France of the [[left bank of the Rhine]], \"natural boundary of the [[Gaul]]s\" ({{lang-fr|links=no|borne naturelle des Gaules}}).{{sfn|Smets|1998|p=676}}\nThis notion was influential among the French revolutionaries after 1790, notably among the [[Jacobins]].

On October 26, an assembly of Savoyard \u00e9lites met at [[Chamb\u00e9ry]]. The assembly ceased to recognise [[Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia]] as the sovereign. On October 29, they pronounced the annexation of Savoy to France. This unification was decreed by the Convention on November 17, 1792, and Savoy became the [[d\u00e9partement of Mont-Blanc]].\nOn January 31, 1793, the Convention annexed the [[County of Nice]] and the [[Principality of Monaco]] to form the d\u00e9partement of [[Alpes-Maritimes]].\n\n===In Rhineland===\n{{main|Left Bank of the Rhine}}\nDanton's rhetoric was spread throughout the occupied territories by the representatives of the Convention and the local supporters of the French,{{sfn|Smets|1998|pp=680\u2013681}} in order to prepare and justify the annexation of the territories. Even so, the French were beaten at the [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Battle of Neerwinden]] on March 18, 1793, and were forced to leave Belgium. The decisive French victory at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] in July 1794 and the founding of the [[Batavian Republic]] in January 1795 confirmed the French occupation of Belgium. Prussia started the negotiations that finished with the [[Peace of Basel|first treaty of Basel]], signed April 5, 1795, by which Prussia ceded to France its territories on the left bank of the Rhine.\nThe [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|victories of Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy]] forced Austria to sign the [[treaty of Campo Formio]] on October 27, 1797. Austria ceded to France all its territories to the west of the Rhine. The French government reorganised the newly enlarged left bank of the Rhine and created four new departments: [[Mont-Tonnerre]], [[Rhin-et-Moselle]], [[Roer (d\u00e9partement)|Roer]] and [[Sarre (d\u00e9partement)|Sarre]].\n\n===In Belgium===\nAfter the victory at Fleurus, long debates took place at the Convention to decide the fate of the [[Austrian Netherlands]].{{sfn|Smets|1998|pp=689\u2013691}} Pushed by [[Merlin de Douai]], the Convention feared that a separate Belgian republic, along the lines of the Batavian Republic, would be too weak to resist the English and the Austrians, and would become a buffer state against the French republic. The convention finally voted for annexation of Belgium on October 1, 1795, creating the nine Belgian d\u00e9partements: [[Dyle (d\u00e9partement)|Dyle]], [[Deux-N\u00e8thes]], [[Escaut (d\u00e9partement)|Escaut]], [[For\u00eats]], [[Jemmape (d\u00e9partement)|Jemmape]], [[Lys (d\u00e9partement)|Lys]], [[Ourte]], [[Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure]], and [[Sambre-et-Meuse]]. This annexation was confirmed by the Treaty of Campo Formio, by which the Austrian Empire ceded the Austrian Netherlands to France, followed by the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] in 1801.\n\n==The formation of the Hexagon==\nUnder the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and the [[First French Empire]], Napoleon expanded France to its theoretical natural borders through his conquests, mainly with the goal of controlling the coasts. In fact, the war against the [[United Kingdom]] rested partly on the [[Continental System|ban on all commerce with Great Britain]]. In 1812, France had [[130 departments of the First French Empire|130 departments]] (134 including the four departments in [[Catalonia]], which were only partially integrated). France's territory was stretched beyond the Rhine by the annexation of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1810), and the north coast of Germany to [[L\u00fcbeck]] (1811), beyond the Pyrenees by the annexation of part of Catalonia (1812), and beyond the Alps by the annexation of parts of Italy between 1801 and 1805.\nAfter the first abdication of Napoleon on April 6, 1814, France lost, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], all its territories conquered after 1792. France only kept a small part of Savoy. After [[battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|second Treaty of Paris in 1815]], France was taken back to its 1790 borders and therefore lost Savoy. Savoy and Nice were definitively annexed by France in 1860 by the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]].\n\nThe debate over France's borders continued throughout the nineteenth century. [[Jules Michelet]], in his ''History of France'', saw in it a deterministic cause of the history of France. The debate resurged in 1830 at the [[independence of Belgium]] and then between 1871 and 1918, when [[Alsace-Moselle]] was annexed and incorporated by the [[German Empire]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[French nationalism]]\n*[[Gallia Belgica]]\n*[[Irredentism]]\n*[[Territorial evolution of France]]\n*[[130 departments of the First French Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite journal|last1=Smets|first1=Josef|title=Le Rhin, fronti\u00e8re naturelle de la France|journal=Annales historiques de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise|volume=314|date=1998|issue=314|pages=675\u2013698|trans-title=The Rhine, natural border of France|ref=harv|doi=10.3406/ahrf.1998.2206}} {{in lang|fr}}\n* S\u00e9bastien Dubois, \"La conqu\u00eate de la Belgique et la th\u00e9orie des fronti\u00e8res naturelles de la France (XVIIe\u2009\u2011\u2009XIXe si\u00e8cle),\" in Laurence Van Ypersele (dir.), ''Imaginaires de guerre.

Often, this identifier corresponds to a Wikipedia page.]]\n\n\n==Introduction==\n\nIn entity linking, words of interest (names of persons, locations and companies) are mapped from an input text to corresponding unique entities in a target [[Knowledge Base|knowledge base]]. Words of interest are called '''named entities''' (NEs), mentions, or surface forms. The target knowledge base depends on the intended application, but for entity linking systems intended to work on open-domain text it is common to use knowledge-bases derived from [[Wikipedia]] (such as [[Wikidata]] or [[DBpedia]]).<ref name=\"khalid2008\"/><ref name=xianpei>{{cite journal |last1=Han |first1=Xianpei |last2=Sun |first2=Le |last3=Zhao |first3=Jun |title=Collective Entity Linking in Web Text: A Graph-based Method |journal=Proceedings of the 34th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval |date=2011 |pages=765\u2013774 |doi=10.1145/2009916.2010019 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2010019 |publisher=ACM}}</ref> In this case, each individual Wikipedia page is regarded as a separate entity.

These [[URL|uniform resource locators]] (URLs) can be used as unique [[URI|uniform resource identifiers]]\n(URIs) for the entities in the knowledge base. Using a different knowledge base will return different URIs, but for knowledge bases built starting from Wikipedia there exist one-to-one URI mappings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wikipedia Links |url=https://wiki.dbpedia.org/services-resources/documentation/datasets#WikipediaLinks}}</ref>\n\nIn most cases, knowledge bases are manually built<ref name= Wikidata>[[Wikidata]]</ref>, but in applications where large [[Text corpus|text corpora]] are available, the knowledge base can be inferred automatically from the [[Training set|available text]].<ref>Aaron M.

In all these fields, concepts relevant to the application are separated from text and other non-meaningful data.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Slawski |first1=Bill |title=How Google Uses Named Entity Disambiguation for Entities with the Same Names |url=http://www.seobythesea.com/2015/09/disambiguate-entities-in-queries-and-pages/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Zhou |first1=Ming |title=Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing |last2=Lv |first2=Weifeng |last3=Ren |first3=Pengjie |last4=Wei |first4=Furu |last5=Tan |first5=Chuanqi |chapter=Entity Linking for Queries by Searching Wikipedia Sentences |pages=68\u201377 |doi=10.18653/v1/D17-1007 |chapter-url=https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D17/D17-1007/ |language=en-us|arxiv=1704.02788 |year=2017 }}</ref>\n\nFor example, a common task performed by [[Web search engine|search engines]] is to find documents that are similar to one given as input, or to find additional information about the persons that are mentioned in it.\nConsider a sentence that contains the expression ''\"the capital of France\"'': without entity linking, the search engine that looks at the content of documents would not be able to directly retrieve documents containing the word ''\"Paris\"'', leading to so-called [[False Negative|false negative]]s (FN). Even worse, the search engine might produce\nspurious matches (or [[False Positive|false positive]]s (FP)), such as retrieving documents referring to ''\"France\"'' as a country.\n\nMany approaches orthogonal to entity linking exist to retrieve documents similar to an input document. For example, [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA) or comparing document embeddings obtained with\n[[Word2vec|doc2vec]]. However, these techniques do not allow the same fine-grained control that is offered by entity linking, as they will return other\ndocuments instead of creating high-level representations of the original one. For example, obtaining schematic information about ''\"Paris\"'', as presented by Wikipedia [[Infobox#Wikipedia|infobox]]es would be much less straightforward, or sometimes even unfeasible, depending on the query complexity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Le |first1=Quoc |last2=Mikolov |first2=Tomas |title=Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents |journal=Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning - Volume 32 |date=2014 |pages=II\u20131188\u2013II\u20131196 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3044805.3045025 |publisher=JMLR.org}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, entity linking has been used to improve the performance of [[information retrieval]] systems<ref name=\"khalid2008\">M.

Some of these issues are intrinsic to the task of entity linking,<ref name=rao>{{cite journal |last1=Rao |first1=Delip |last2=McNamee |first2=Paul |last3=Dredze |first3=Mark |title=Entity Linking: Finding Extracted Entities in a Knowledge Base |journal=Multi-source, Multilingual Information Extraction and Summarization |date=2013 |pages=93\u2013115 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28569-1_5 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |language=en|series=Theory and Applications of Natural Language Processing |isbn=978-3-642-28568-4 }}</ref> such as text ambiguity, while others, such as scalability and execution time, become relevant when considering real-life usage of such systems.\n\n* '''Name variations''': the same entity might appear with textual representations. Sources of these variations include abbreviations (''New York'', ''NY''), aliases (''New York'', ''Big Apple''), or spelling variations and errors (''New yokr'').\n\n* '''Ambiguity''': the same mention can often refer to many different entities, depending on the context, as many entity names tend to be [[Polysemy|polysemous]] (i.e. have multiple meanings). The word ''Paris'', among other things, could be referring to the [[Paris|French capital]] or to [[Paris Hilton]]. In some cases (as in ''the capital of France''), there is no textual similarity between the mention text and the actual target entity (''Paris'').\n\n* '''Absence''': sometimes, some named entities might not have a correct entity link in the target knowledge base. This might happen when dealing with very specific or unusual entities, or when processing documents about recent events, in which there might be mentions of persons or events that do not have yet a corresponding entity in the knowledge base. Another common situation in which there are missing entities is when using domain-specific knowledge bases (for example, a biology knowledge base or a movie database). In all these cases, the entity linking system should return a <code>NIL</code> entity link. Understanding when to return a <code>NIL</code> prediction is not straightforward, and many different approaches have been proposed; for example, by thresholding some kind of confidence score in the entity linking system, or by adding an additional <code>NIL</code> entity to the knowledge base, which is treated in the same way as the other entities. Moreover, in some cases providing a wrong, but related, entity link prediction might be better than no result at all from the perspective of an end user.<ref name=rao/>\n\n*  '''Scalability and Speed''': it is desirable for an industrial entity linking system to provide results in a reasonable time, and often in real-time. This requirement is critical for search engines, chat-bots and for entity linking systems offered by data-analytics platforms. Ensuring low execution time can be challenging when using large knowledge bases or when processing large documents.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parravicini |first1=Alberto |last2=Patra |first2=Rhicheek |last3=Bartolini |first3=Davide B. |last4=Santambrogio |first4=Marco D. |title=Fast and Accurate Entity Linking via Graph Embedding |journal=Proceedings of the 2Nd Joint International Workshop on Graph Data Management Experiences & Systems (GRADES) and Network Data Analytics (NDA) |date=2019 |pages=10:1\u201310:9 |doi=10.1145/3327964.3328499 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3327964.3328499 |publisher=ACM|isbn=9781450367899 |hdl=11311/1119019 }}</ref> For example, Wikipedia contains nearly [[Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia|9 million entities]] and more than 170 million relationships among them.\n\n* '''Evolving Information''': an entity linking system should also deal with evolving information, and easily integrate updates in the knowledge base. The problem of evolving information is sometimes connected to the problem of missing entities, for example when processing recent news articles in which there are mentions of events that do not have a corresponding entry in the knowledge base due to their novelty.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hoffart |first1=Johannes |last2=Altun |first2=Yasemin |last3=Weikum |first3=Gerhard |title=Discovering Emerging Entities with Ambiguous Names |journal=Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web |date=2014 |pages=385\u2013396 |doi=10.1145/2566486.2568003 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2568003 |publisher=ACM|isbn=9781450327442 }}</ref>\n\n* '''Multiple Languages''': an entity linking systems might support queries performed in multiple languages.

For example, the following sentence:\n\n{{quote|Paris is the capital of France.}}\n\n:would be processed by a NER system to obtain the following output: \n\n{{quote|['''Paris''']<sub>City</sub> is the capital of ['''France''']<sub>Country</sub>.}}\n\n:Named-entity recognition is usually a preprocessing step of an entity linking system, as it can be useful to know in advance which words should be linked to entities of the knowledge base.\n\n* [[Coreference#Coreference_resolution|Coreference resolution]] understands whether multiple words in a text refers to the same entity. It can be useful, for example, to understand the word a pronoun refers to. Consider the following example:\n\n{{quote|Paris is the capital of France. It is also the largest city in France.}} \n\n:In this example, a coreference resolution algorithm would identify that the pronoun ''It'' refers to ''Paris'', and not to ''France'' or to another entity. A notable distinction compared to entity linking is that Coreference Resolution does not assign any unique identity to the words it matches, but it simply says whether they refer to the same entity or not.\n\n==Approaches to entity linking==\n\nEntity linking has been a hot topic in industry and academia for the last decade. However, as of today most existing [[Entity Linking#Challenges of Entity Linking|challenges]] are still unsolved, and many entity linking systems, with widely different strengths and weaknesses, have been proposed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ji |first1=Heng |last2=Nothman |first2=Joel |last3=Hachey |first3=Ben |last4=Florian |first4=Radu |title=Overview of TAC-KBP2015 Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking |journal=TAC |date=2015}}</ref>\n\nBroadly speaking, modern entity linking systems can be divided into two categories:\n* '''Text-based approaches''', which make use of textual features extracted from large text corpora (e.g. [[Tf\u2013idf|Term frequency - Inverse document frequency]] (Tf-Idf), word co-occurrence probabilities, etc...).<ref name=cucerzan>{{cite journal |last1=Cucerzan |first1=Silviu |title=Large-Scale Named Entity Disambiguation Based on Wikipedia Data |volume=Proceedings of the 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL) |pages=708\u2013716 |url=https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D07/D07-1074/ |language=en-us}}</ref><ref name=rao/>\n* '''Graph-based approaches''', which exploit the structure of [[Knowledge Graph|knowledge graph]]s to represent the context and the relation of entities.<ref name=xianpei/><ref name=weikum>{{cite journal |last1=Weikum |first1=Gerhard |last2=Thater |first2=Stefan |last3=Taneva |first3=Bilyana |last4=Spaniol |first4=Marc |last5=Pinkal |first5=Manfred |last6=F\u00fcrstenau |first6=Hagen |last7=Bordino |first7=Ilaria |last8=Yosef |first8=Mohamed Amir |last9=Hoffart |first9=Johannes |title=Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text |journal=Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing |date=2011 |pages=782\u2013792 |url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D11/D11-1072/ |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nOften entity linking systems cannot be strictly categorized in either category, but they make use of knowledge graphs that have been enriched with additional textual features extracted, for example, from the text corpora that were used to build the knowledge graphs themselves.<ref name=\"zwick\">{{cite journal |last1=Zwicklbauer |first1=Stefan |last2=Seifert |first2=Christin |last3=Granitzer |first3=Michael |title=Robust and Collective Entity Disambiguation Through Semantic Embeddings |journal=Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval |date=2016 |pages=425\u2013434 |doi=10.1145/2911451.2911535 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2911451.2911535 |publisher=ACM|isbn=9781450340694 }}</ref><ref name=hachey/>\n\n[[File:Entity Linking - Example of pipeline.png|center|thumb|Representation of the main steps in an entity linking algorithm.

This last step is often done by creating a small set of candidate identifiers for each named entity, and by picking the most promising candidate with respect to a chosen metric.|upright=3.5]]\n\n===Text-based entity linking===\n\nThe seminal work by Cucerzan in 2007 proposed one of the first entity linking systems that appeared in the literature, and tackled the task of wikification, linking textual mentions to Wikipedia pages.<ref name=cucerzan/> This system partitions pages as entity, disambiguation, or list pages, used to assign categories to each entity. The set of entities present in each entity page is used to build the entity's context.

First, a set of candidate entities is chosen using string matching, acronyms, and known aliases. Then the best link among the candidates is chosen with a ranking [[Support Vector Machine|support vector machine]] (SVM) that uses linguistic features. \n\nRecent systems, such as the one proposed by Tsai et al.,<ref name=\"tsai\"/> employ word embeddings obtained with a [[N-gram#Skip-gram|skip-gram]] model as language features, and can be applied to any language as long as a large corpus to build word embeddings is provided. Similarly to most entity linking systems, the linking is done in two steps, with an initial candidate entities selection and a linear ranking SVM as second step. \n\nVarious approaches have been tried to tackle the problem of entity ambiguity. In the seminal approach of Milne and Witten, [[supervised learning]] is employed using the [[anchor text]]s of Wikipedia entities as training data.<ref>David Milne and Ian H. Witten (2008).

Han ''et al.'' propose the creation of a disambiguation graph (a subgraph of the knowledge base which contains candidate entities).<ref name=xianpei/> This graph is employed for a purely collective ranking procedure that finds the best candidate link for each textual mention.\n\nAnother famous entity linking approach is AIDA, which uses a series of complex graph algorithms, and a greedy algorithm that identifies coherent mentions on a dense subgraph by also considering context similarities and vertex importance features to perform collective disambiguation.<ref name=weikum/>\n\nGraph ranking (or vertex ranking) denotes algorithms such as [[PageRank]] (PR) and [[HITS algorithm|Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search]] (HITS), whose goal is to assign a score to each vertex that represents its relative importance in the overall graph.

In all these fields, concepts relevant to the application are separated from text and other non-meaningful data.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Slawski |first1=Bill |title=How Google Uses Named Entity Disambiguation for Entities with the Same Names |url=http://www.seobythesea.com/2015/09/disambiguate-entities-in-queries-and-pages/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Zhou |first1=Ming |title=Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing |last2=Lv |first2=Weifeng |last3=Ren |first3=Pengjie |last4=Wei |first4=Furu |last5=Tan |first5=Chuanqi |chapter=Entity Linking for Queries by Searching Wikipedia Sentences |pages=68\u201377 |doi=10.18653/v1/D17-1007 |chapter-url=https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D17/D17-1007/ |language=en-us|arxiv=1704.02788 |year=2017 }}</ref>\n\nFor example, a common task performed by [[Web search engine|search engines]] is to find documents that are similar to one given as input, or to find additional information about the persons that are mentioned in it.\nConsider a sentence that contains the expression ''\"the capital of France\"'': without entity linking, the search engine that looks at the content of documents would not be able to directly retrieve documents containing the word ''\"Paris\"'', leading to so-called [[False Negative|false negative]]s (FN). Even worse, the search engine might produce\nspurious matches (or [[False Positive|false positive]]s (FP)), such as retrieving documents referring to ''\"France\"'' as a country.\n\nMany approaches orthogonal to entity linking exist to retrieve documents similar to an input document. For example, [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA) or comparing document embeddings obtained with\n[[Word2vec|doc2vec]]. However, these techniques do not allow the same fine-grained control that is offered by entity linking, as they will return other\ndocuments instead of creating high-level representations of the original one. For example, obtaining schematic information about ''\"Paris\"'', as presented by Wikipedia [[Infobox#Wikipedia|infobox]]es would be much less straightforward, or sometimes even unfeasible, depending on the query complexity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Le |first1=Quoc |last2=Mikolov |first2=Tomas |title=Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents |journal=Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning - Volume 32 |date=2014 |pages=II\u20131188\u2013II\u20131196 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3044805.3045025 |publisher=JMLR.org}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, entity linking has been used to improve the performance of [[information retrieval]] systems<ref name=\"khalid2008\">M.

Some of these issues are intrinsic to the task of entity linking,<ref name=rao>{{cite journal |last1=Rao |first1=Delip |last2=McNamee |first2=Paul |last3=Dredze |first3=Mark |title=Entity Linking: Finding Extracted Entities in a Knowledge Base |journal=Multi-source, Multilingual Information Extraction and Summarization |date=2013 |pages=93\u2013115 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28569-1_5 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |language=en|series=Theory and Applications of Natural Language Processing |isbn=978-3-642-28568-4 }}</ref> such as text ambiguity, while others, such as scalability and execution time, become relevant when considering real-life usage of such systems.\n\n* '''Name variations''': the same entity might appear with textual representations. Sources of these variations include abbreviations (''New York'', ''NY''), aliases (''New York'', ''Big Apple''), or spelling variations and errors (''New yokr'').\n\n* '''Ambiguity''': the same mention can often refer to many different entities, depending on the context, as many entity names tend to be [[Polysemy|polysemous]] (i.e. have multiple meanings). The word ''Paris'', among other things, could be referring to the [[Paris|French capital]] or to [[Paris Hilton]]. In some cases (as in ''the capital of France''), there is no textual similarity between the mention text and the actual target entity (''Paris'').\n\n* '''Absence''': sometimes, some named entities might not have a correct entity link in the target knowledge base. This might happen when dealing with very specific or unusual entities, or when processing documents about recent events, in which there might be mentions of persons or events that do not have yet a corresponding entity in the knowledge base. Another common situation in which there are missing entities is when using domain-specific knowledge bases (for example, a biology knowledge base or a movie database). In all these cases, the entity linking system should return a <code>NIL</code> entity link. Understanding when to return a <code>NIL</code> prediction is not straightforward, and many different approaches have been proposed; for example, by thresholding some kind of confidence score in the entity linking system, or by adding an additional <code>NIL</code> entity to the knowledge base, which is treated in the same way as the other entities. Moreover, in some cases providing a wrong, but related, entity link prediction might be better than no result at all from the perspective of an end user.<ref name=rao/>\n\n*  '''Scalability and Speed''': it is desirable for an industrial entity linking system to provide results in a reasonable time, and often in real-time. This requirement is critical for search engines, chat-bots and for entity linking systems offered by data-analytics platforms. Ensuring low execution time can be challenging when using large knowledge bases or when processing large documents.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parravicini |first1=Alberto |last2=Patra |first2=Rhicheek |last3=Bartolini |first3=Davide B. |last4=Santambrogio |first4=Marco D. |title=Fast and Accurate Entity Linking via Graph Embedding |journal=Proceedings of the 2Nd Joint International Workshop on Graph Data Management Experiences & Systems (GRADES) and Network Data Analytics (NDA) |date=2019 |pages=10:1\u201310:9 |doi=10.1145/3327964.3328499 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3327964.3328499 |publisher=ACM|isbn=9781450367899 |hdl=11311/1119019 }}</ref> For example, Wikipedia contains nearly [[Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia|9 million entities]] and more than 170 million relationships among them.\n\n* '''Evolving Information''': an entity linking system should also deal with evolving information, and easily integrate updates in the knowledge base. The problem of evolving information is sometimes connected to the problem of missing entities, for example when processing recent news articles in which there are mentions of events that do not have a corresponding entry in the knowledge base due to their novelty.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hoffart |first1=Johannes |last2=Altun |first2=Yasemin |last3=Weikum |first3=Gerhard |title=Discovering Emerging Entities with Ambiguous Names |journal=Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web |date=2014 |pages=385\u2013396 |doi=10.1145/2566486.2568003 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2568003 |publisher=ACM|isbn=9781450327442 }}</ref>\n\n* '''Multiple Languages''': an entity linking systems might support queries performed in multiple languages. Ideally, the accuracy of the entity linking system should not be influenced by the input language, and entities in the knowledge base should be the same across different languages.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Doermann |first1=David S. |last2=Oard |first2=Douglas W. |last3=Lawrie |first3=Dawn J. |last4=Mayfield |first4=James |last5=McNamee |first5=Paul |title=Cross-Language Entity Linking |journal=Undefined |date=2011 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cross-Language-Entity-Linking-McNamee-Mayfield/593c635bb388630d23764aeea3ff7528154bc3a0 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Differences from other techniques===\n\nEntity linking is also known as named-entity disambiguation (NED), and is deeply connected to Wikification and [[record linkage]].<ref name=\"tsai\">{{cite journal |last1=Tsai |first1=Chen-Tse |last2=Roth |first2=Dan |title=Cross-lingual Wikification Using Multilingual Embeddings |date=2016 |volume=Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 2016 |pages=589\u2013598 |url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1072}}</ref>\nDefinitions are often blurry and vary slightly among different authors: Alhelbawy ''et al.''<ref name=alhelbawy>{{cite journal |last1=Alhelbawy |first1=Ayman |last2=Gaizauskas |first2=Robert |title=Collective Named Entity Disambiguation using Graph Ranking and Clique Partitioning Approaches |volume=Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers |issue=Dublin City University and Association for Computational Linguistics |pages=1544\u20131555 |url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C14-1147}}</ref> consider entity linking as a broader version of NED, as NED should assume that the entity that correctly match a certain textual named entity mention is in the knowledge base.

For example, the following sentence:\n\n{{quote|Paris is the capital of France.}}\n\n:would be processed by a NER system to obtain the following output: \n\n{{quote|['''Paris''']<sub>City</sub> is the capital of ['''France''']<sub>Country</sub>.}}\n\n:Named-entity recognition is usually a preprocessing step of an entity linking system, as it can be useful to know in advance which words should be linked to entities of the knowledge base.\n\n* [[Coreference#Coreference_resolution|Coreference resolution]] understands whether multiple words in a text refers to the same entity. It can be useful, for example, to understand the word a pronoun refers to. Consider the following example:\n\n{{quote|Paris is the capital of France. It is also the largest city in France.}} \n\n:In this example, a coreference resolution algorithm would identify that the pronoun ''It'' refers to ''Paris'', and not to ''France'' or to another entity. A notable distinction compared to entity linking is that Coreference Resolution does not assign any unique identity to the words it matches, but it simply says whether they refer to the same entity or not.\n\n==Approaches to entity linking==\n\nEntity linking has been a hot topic in industry and academia for the last decade. However, as of today most existing [[Entity Linking#Challenges of Entity Linking|challenges]] are still unsolved, and many entity linking systems, with widely different strengths and weaknesses, have been proposed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ji |first1=Heng |last2=Nothman |first2=Joel |last3=Hachey |first3=Ben |last4=Florian |first4=Radu |title=Overview of TAC-KBP2015 Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking |journal=TAC |date=2015}}</ref>\n\nBroadly speaking, modern entity linking systems can be divided into two categories:\n* '''Text-based approaches''', which make use of textual features extracted from large text corpora (e.g. [[Tf\u2013idf|Term frequency - Inverse document frequency]] (Tf-Idf), word co-occurrence probabilities, etc...).<ref name=cucerzan>{{cite journal |last1=Cucerzan |first1=Silviu |title=Large-Scale Named Entity Disambiguation Based on Wikipedia Data |volume=Proceedings of the 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL) |pages=708\u2013716 |url=https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D07/D07-1074/ |language=en-us}}</ref><ref name=rao/>\n* '''Graph-based approaches''', which exploit the structure of [[Knowledge Graph|knowledge graph]]s to represent the context and the relation of entities.<ref name=xianpei/><ref name=weikum>{{cite journal |last1=Weikum |first1=Gerhard |last2=Thater |first2=Stefan |last3=Taneva |first3=Bilyana |last4=Spaniol |first4=Marc |last5=Pinkal |first5=Manfred |last6=F\u00fcrstenau |first6=Hagen |last7=Bordino |first7=Ilaria |last8=Yosef |first8=Mohamed Amir |last9=Hoffart |first9=Johannes |title=Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text |journal=Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing |date=2011 |pages=782\u2013792 |url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D11/D11-1072/ |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nOften entity linking systems cannot be strictly categorized in either category, but they make use of knowledge graphs that have been enriched with additional textual features extracted, for example, from the text corpora that were used to build the knowledge graphs themselves.<ref name=\"zwick\">{{cite journal |last1=Zwicklbauer |first1=Stefan |last2=Seifert |first2=Christin |last3=Granitzer |first3=Michael |title=Robust and Collective Entity Disambiguation Through Semantic Embeddings |journal=Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval |date=2016 |pages=425\u2013434 |doi=10.1145/2911451.2911535 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2911451.2911535 |publisher=ACM|isbn=9781450340694 }}</ref><ref name=hachey/>\n\n[[File:Entity Linking - Example of pipeline.png|center|thumb|Representation of the main steps in an entity linking algorithm. Most entity linking algorithms are composed of a initial named-entity recognition step in which named entities are found in the original text (here, Paris and France), and of a subsequent step in which each named entity is linked to its corresponding unique identifier (here, a Wikipedia page). This last step is often done by creating a small set of candidate identifiers for each named entity, and by picking the most promising candidate with respect to a chosen metric.|upright=3.5]]\n\n===Text-based entity linking===\n\nThe seminal work by Cucerzan in 2007 proposed one of the first entity linking systems that appeared in the literature, and tackled the task of wikification, linking textual mentions to Wikipedia pages.<ref name=cucerzan/> This system partitions pages as entity, disambiguation, or list pages, used to assign categories to each entity. The set of entities present in each entity page is used to build the entity's context. The final entity linking step is a collective disambiguation performed by comparing binary vectors obtained from hand-crafted features, and from each entity's context.\nCucerzan's entity linking system is still used as baseline for many recent works.<ref name=kulkarni>{{Cite conference| doi = 10.1145/1557019.1557073| title = Collective annotation of Wikipedia entities in web text| conference = Proc. 15th ACM SIGKDD Int'l Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD)| pages = <!--457-->| year = 2009| last1 = Kulkarni | first1 = Sayali| last2 = Singh | first2 = Amit| last3 = Ramakrishnan | first3 = Ganesh| last4 = Chakrabarti | first4 = Soumen| isbn = 9781605584959}}</ref>\n\nThe work of Rao et al. is a well-known paper in the field of entity linking.<ref name=rao/> The authors propose a two-step algorithm to link named entities to entities in a target knowledge base. First, a set of candidate entities is chosen using string matching, acronyms, and known aliases. Then the best link among the candidates is chosen with a ranking [[Support Vector Machine|support vector machine]] (SVM) that uses linguistic features. \n\nRecent systems, such as the one proposed by Tsai et al.,<ref name=\"tsai\"/> employ word embeddings obtained with a [[N-gram#Skip-gram|skip-gram]] model as language features, and can be applied to any language as long as a large corpus to build word embeddings is provided. Similarly to most entity linking systems, the linking is done in two steps, with an initial candidate entities selection and a linear ranking SVM as second step. \n\nVarious approaches have been tried to tackle the problem of entity ambiguity. In the seminal approach of Milne and Witten, [[supervised learning]] is employed using the [[anchor text]]s of Wikipedia entities as training data.<ref>David Milne and Ian H. Witten (2008).

These systems extract complex features which take advantage of the knowledge graph topology, or leverage multi-step connections between entities, which would be hidden by simple text analysis. Moreover, creating multilingual entity linking systems based on [[Natural Language Processing|natural language processing]] (NLP) is inherently difficult, as it requires either large text corpora, often absent for many languages, or hand-crafted grammar rules, which are widely different among languages. Han ''et al.'' propose the creation of a disambiguation graph (a subgraph of the knowledge base which contains candidate entities).<ref name=xianpei/> This graph is employed for a purely collective ranking procedure that finds the best candidate link for each textual mention.\n\nAnother famous entity linking approach is AIDA, which uses a series of complex graph algorithms, and a greedy algorithm that identifies coherent mentions on a dense subgraph by also considering context similarities and vertex importance features to perform collective disambiguation.<ref name=weikum/>\n\nGraph ranking (or vertex ranking) denotes algorithms such as [[PageRank]] (PR) and [[HITS algorithm|Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search]] (HITS), whose goal is to assign a score to each vertex that represents its relative importance in the overall graph. The entity linking system presented in Alhelbawy et al. employs PageRank to perform collective entity linking on a disambiguation graph, and to understand which entities are more strongly related with each other and would represent a better linking.<ref name=alhelbawy/>\n==See also==\n* [[Controlled vocabulary]]\n* [[Explicit semantic analysis]]\n* [[Geoparsing]]\n* [[Information extraction]]\n* [[Linked data]]\n* [[Named entity]]\n* [[Named-entity recognition]]\n* [[Record linkage]]\n* [[Word sense disambiguation]]\n* [[Author Name Disambiguation]]\n* [[Coreference]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Natural language processing]]\n[[Category:Tasks of natural language processing]]\n", "name_user": "Paritalo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eApplications:grammar fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking"}

In recent years, they have opened 54 brick and mortar stores to combat the strategies of other low-cost competitors in Chinese markets.

In recent years, they have opened 54 brick and mortar stores to combat the strategies of other low-cost competitors in Chinese markets.

One day, I pointed out to their R&D boss, some inadequacies. After that, they merely acknowledged my input, but never acted upon what I had said.

The shop was later renamed Cavendish House and carried drapery, silks, haberdashery, millinery, hosiery, lace and family mourning goods.

Around 1843, another branch shop was launched in Harrogate.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/>\n\nExtended and refurbished premises opened in Cheltenham in October 1844. Pooley and Smith retired from the business in 1851 when Debenham took his son, William, and Clement Freebody into partnership, trading as Debenham, Son & Freebody. At this time all three shops in London, Cheltenham and Harrogate were trading in similar goods and issued a joint catalogue, called the Fashion Book, that was the basis of an extensive mail-order trade. In 1876 when Freebody retired, a new partnership, Debenham & Hewitt, was formed. George Hewitt appears to have worked at the Cheltenham store as a draper's assistant during the early 1860s but details of his subsequent career are not known. By 1883, George Hewitt was the sole owner of the Cheltenham business, Frank and William Debenham having withdrawn to manage the London store as a separate concern.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Crypt Chambers 1.jpg|thumb|[[Crypt Chambers]] in Chester houses part of the Browns of Chester store and is a Grade&nbsp;I [[listed building]].]]\nThe business was incorporated as ''Debenhams Limited'' in 1905.<ref>{{cite web|title=Business History of Department Stores: Interesting Dates |url=http://www.kipnotes.com/RetailDepartmentStores.htm |publisher=KIPnotes |date=1 October 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226213520/http://www.kipnotes.com/RetailDepartmentStores.htm |archivedate=26 December 2009  }}</ref> A new headquarters building, which was designed by William Wallace and [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/survey-of-london/tag/debenham-and-freebody/|title=South-East Marylebone Old and New|publisher=Survey of London|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> and built by [[Trollope & Colls]], was completed in Wigmore Street in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-btrl&cid=0#0 |title=Trollope & Colls|publisher= National Archives|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> The modern Debenhams group grew from the acquisition of department stores in towns and cities throughout the UK, under the leadership of its chairman, [[Ernest Debenham]].

The shop was later renamed Cavendish House and carried drapery, silks, haberdashery, millinery, hosiery, lace and family mourning goods. As the trade grew, the partners determined to expand the business by opening branches in Cheltenham and Harrogate.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.housefraserarchive.ac.uk/company/?id=c1536|title=Cavendish House Co Ltd|publisher=House of Fraser Archive|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy 1823, Clark & Debenham had opened a small drapery business at 3 Promenade Rooms, Cheltenham, selling a selection of silks, muslins, shawls, gloves, lace and fancy goods.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/> In 1837, Clark retired from the business and Debenham assumed two of his most trusted staff, William Pooley and John Smith, as partners, trading in both London and Cheltenham as Debenham, Pooley & Smith.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/> By 1840, the management of the Cheltenham branch appears to have been given to Clement Freebody, Debenham's brother-in-law. Around 1843, another branch shop was launched in Harrogate.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/>\n\nExtended and refurbished premises opened in Cheltenham in October 1844. Pooley and Smith retired from the business in 1851 when Debenham took his son, William, and Clement Freebody into partnership, trading as Debenham, Son & Freebody. At this time all three shops in London, Cheltenham and Harrogate were trading in similar goods and issued a joint catalogue, called the Fashion Book, that was the basis of an extensive mail-order trade. In 1876 when Freebody retired, a new partnership, Debenham & Hewitt, was formed. George Hewitt appears to have worked at the Cheltenham store as a draper's assistant during the early 1860s but details of his subsequent career are not known. By 1883, George Hewitt was the sole owner of the Cheltenham business, Frank and William Debenham having withdrawn to manage the London store as a separate concern.<ref name=\"housefraserarchive.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Crypt Chambers 1.jpg|thumb|[[Crypt Chambers]] in Chester houses part of the Browns of Chester store and is a Grade&nbsp;I [[listed building]].]]\nThe business was incorporated as ''Debenhams Limited'' in 1905.<ref>{{cite web|title=Business History of Department Stores: Interesting Dates |url=http://www.kipnotes.com/RetailDepartmentStores.htm |publisher=KIPnotes |date=1 October 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226213520/http://www.kipnotes.com/RetailDepartmentStores.htm |archivedate=26 December 2009  }}</ref> A new headquarters building, which was designed by William Wallace and [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/survey-of-london/tag/debenham-and-freebody/|title=South-East Marylebone Old and New|publisher=Survey of London|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> and built by [[Trollope & Colls]], was completed in Wigmore Street in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-btrl&cid=0#0 |title=Trollope & Colls|publisher= National Archives|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> The modern Debenhams group grew from the acquisition of department stores in towns and cities throughout the UK, under the leadership of its chairman, [[Ernest Debenham]].
