Wroth]], \u201cthe probability that one will some day be found has never ceased to excite the [[New England]] collector.\u201d{{sfn|150 Years in the Stacks}}\n\n==Modern-Day Discovery==\nThe break from English monarchy, combined with the document's status as the first document printed in America, conferred a special status on the \u201cOath.\u201d  Thus, the long-anticipated discovery of an original printing of the \u201cOath\u201d created a fervent reception when a rare-documents dealer named Mark Hofmann claimed to have found a broadside of the \u201cOath\u201d in a New York bookstore in 1985. In 1985, Hofmann's print of the \u201cOath\u201d was offered for sale to both the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[American Antiquarian Society]], at a reported asking price of $1.5 million. The Library of Congress declared that the discovery \u201cwould be one of the most important and exciting finds of the century\u201d and stated that its examination \u201cfound nothing inconsistent with a mid-17th century attribution.\u201d The American Antiquarian Society had possession of the document for two months and announced, \u201cas far as we know, there are no anomalies.\u201d  Both organizations wanted to undertake further testing of the \u201cOath\u201d to determine its authenticity and remained interested in acquiring the document despite some troubling events after its discovery. Steven Christensen, a prominent leader in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and one of Hofmann's customers, had been killed by a pipe bomb left at his office in downtown [[Salt Lake City]] in October 1985. A day later, Hofmann was badly injured by a pipe bomb placed in his automobile.{{sfn|McDowell|1985}} Hoffman later pled guilty to the bombings.\n\n==Hofmann's Forgery==\n===Why the \"Oath\" Was Forged===\n====Hofmann's Early Career====\nMark Hofmann's career as a historical-document collector and dealer began in 1980, when he was a student at [[Utah State University]]. Hofmann brought an old [[King James Bible]] with a document glued between two of its pages to Jeff Simmonds, the archivist at Utah State. The two separated the pages and found an aged piece of [[papyrus]] with columns of ancient characters written on it and the signature of [[Joseph Smith Jr]]. on the back.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=102\u2013103}}\n\nAccording to LDS Church legend, the Angel Moroni directed Joseph Smith Jr. to a set of golden plates buried in [[upstate New York]].{{sfn|Naifeh|105}} The golden plates contained writing in an ancient script and told the story of an extinct civilization.{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} Using a special pair of spectacles, Smith translated the writing on the plates, which he said were written in \u201cEgyptian shorthand.\u201d{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} The result of Smith's translation was the [[Book of Mormon]]. Only Smith was permitted to view the plates; however, he gave a small hand-copied transcript of the characters to his financier and scribe, [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]].{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=105}} Wishing to corroborate the authenticity of his investment, Harris took the transcript to [[Charles Anthon]], a professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] at [[Columbia College (New York)|Columbia College]].{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} Anthon wrote that the sample consisted of \u201cGreek and [[Hebrew]] letters, crosses and flourishes. Roman letters inverted or placed sideways.\u201d{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=106}} Harris interpreted Anthon's comments to mean that Anthon had declared the characters to be ancient shorthand Egyptian and had indicated that Smith's translation was genuine. Anthon repudiated Harris's claims, but his protests were ignored.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=106}} The golden plates and the \"[[Anthon Transcript]]\" subsequently disappeared.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=106}}\n\nFrom Anthon's description of the transcript and a comparison of the Joseph Smith signature to other known copies, Simmonds concluded that Hofmann had found the Anthon Transcript. After the LDS Church's history department verified the Smith signature, the Anthon Transcript was hailed as the earliest document in Mormon history. The LDS Church publicized the transcript as evidence that its faith was proven. The Church gave Hofmann $20,000 worth of collectibles in exchange for his gift of the Anthon Transcript to the Church.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=107-112}} \n \nHofmann appeared on several local television shows that covered the discovery of the Anthon Transcript. The publicity he received and the relationship he established with a grateful LDS Church enabled Hofmann to make his living as a professional documents dealer.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=127\u2013128}}\n\n====Questioning LDS Church History====\nHofmann's later LDS Church history discoveries contained embarrassing details that were consistent with parts of Joseph Smith's history that the Church preferred to overlook, such as Smith's involvement in money-digging and folk magic. Joseph Smith admitted to indulging in magic and hunts for buried gold during a trial in 1826 and was convicted of being a public nuisance.{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} In 1827, [[Willard Chase]], Smith's neighbor, gave an account of Smith's discovery of the gold plates.{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} According to Chase's statement, Smith had told Chase that when he first tried to unearth the plates, a toad guarding them had risen up and struck Smith in the head.{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} In 1984, Hofmann produced a letter written by Martin Harris in 1830 which related similar details to Chase's account.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=153}} According to this letter, the plates were guarded by a white salamander that struck Smith three times before he was allowed to take up the plates.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=153}} This letter contradicted the official Church history that told of the [[Angel Moroni]] guiding Smith to the location of the buried plates.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=40}} In place of the official history of divine inspiration, Harris's letter made the story of finding the plates an extension of Smith's previous acts of fraud and folk magic. The LDS Church did not want this letter to become public, and Steven Christensen purchased the \"[[salamander letter]]\u201d from Hofmann and donated it to the Church.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=40}}\n\n====Financial Troubles====\nAs Hofmann graduated to trading more expensive documents, he began taking in investors to finance his purchases.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=189}} Hofmann also collected rare children's books and purchased a home that cost more than $500,000.{{sfn|Worrall|2009}} As his need for money increased, he occasionally took money from multiple investors for the same document, leaving himself unable to pay off all of the debts owed when he sold these documents.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=236}} In 1985, his debts included a $185,000 loan from a bank that was arranged by Mormon Elder [[Hugh Pinnock]] and several hundred thousand dollars owed to other investors.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=192, 228}} The purpose of the bank loan was to acquire the McLellin collection, the private papers of one the original [[Quorum of the Twelve]] who later turned against the LDS Church.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=199}} The Church did not want these papers to become public, and Hofmann had represented that he had located the collection and needed the loan to acquire it.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=206}}\n\nWhen Hofmann failed to produce the McLellin collection, Steven Christensen and Hugh Pinnock pushed Hofmann to either produce the collection or pay back the loan. Hofmann did not tell the Church leaders that he had also borrowed money for the collection from another investor. Even if he had been able to acquire the McLellin collection, he had already sold it twice. The sale of the \u201cOath\u201d was Hofmann's only hope to satisfy his creditors.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=203, 248, 257}}\n\n===Bombings===\nThe delay in the authentication of the \u201cOath\u201d and the search for a buyer increased the pressure on Hofmann, and on October 15, 1985, he resorted to planting the bombs that killed Christensen and the wife of Christensen's business partner. Hofmann severely injured himself while attempting to remove a third bomb from his car.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=9, 298}}\n\nAt first, the police did not know if Hofmann was the perpetrator or a victim in the bombings. The clear connection between Hofmann and Christensen was the historical documents business. The investigation led police to track down Hofmann's business transactions, and they found a $2 check to DeBouzek Engraving among his files. Police visited the shop with a copy of the \u201cOath.\u201d A worker identified the document and turned over a negative for the plate that had been used to print the \u201cOath.\u201d Mark Hofmann's \u201cOath\u201d was a forgery, as were most of his high-profile discoveries, including the Anthon Transcript and the salamander letter.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=44, 463-464, 512}}\n\n===Forgery Skills===\nMark Hofmann demonstrated considerable skill in forgery. He acquired or stole paper that was manufactured appropriate to the time of the documents he forged.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=513}} He made his own ink and used chemical processes to age his documents in order to make them look authentic.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=513}} He learned to [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] himself in order to fluidly copy the signatures of historical figures.{{sfn|Worrall|2009}} His forgeries fooled experts in the field, such as [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], [[Kenneth W. Rendell]], and investigators at the [[NARA|National Archives]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{sfn|Lindsey|1987}} During his confession, Hofmann stated that he did most of his printing from plates that he made himself but \u201cgot lazy and had the \u2018Oath\u2019 plate made professionally.\"{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=513}} Ultimately, Hofmann's laziness and lack of paper money, which required him to write a $2 check, exposed him as a forger.\n\n===Imprisonment===\nOn January 23, 1987, Hofmann was sentenced to life imprisonment on two second degree murder charges.{{sfn|Lindsey|1987}} While in prison, Hofmann took an overdose of [[antidepressant]]s and, after lying comatose on his side for twelve hours, permanently damaged his right arm. His forgery arm no longer functions.{{sfn|Worrall|2009}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{wikisource}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite news |ref=harv |last1=McDowell |first1=Edwin |title=Gallery Said To Possess First American Imprint |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/02/arts/gallery-said-to-posses-first-americna-imprint.html |accessdate=10 May 2018 |agency=The New York Times |date=1985}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Worrall |first1=Simon |title=The Poet and the Murderer |date=2009 |edition=Kindle}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Naifeh |first1=Steven |last2=Smith |first2=Gregory White |title=The Mormon Murders: A True Story of Greed, Forgery, Deceit, and Death |date=2005 |publisher=St. Martin's Press}}\n*{{cite web |ref={{sfnref|150 Years}} |title=Year 79 \u2013 1939: The Oath of a Free-Man, with a Historical Study by Lawrence C.

Only Smith was permitted to view the plates; however, he gave a small hand-copied transcript of the characters to his financier and scribe, [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]].{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=105}} Wishing to corroborate the authenticity of his investment, Harris took the transcript to [[Charles Anthon]], a professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] at [[Columbia College (New York)|Columbia College]].{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} Anthon wrote that the sample consisted of \u201cGreek and [[Hebrew]] letters, crosses and flourishes. Roman letters inverted or placed sideways.\u201d{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=106}} Harris interpreted Anthon's comments to mean that Anthon had declared the characters to be ancient shorthand Egyptian and had indicated that Smith's translation was genuine. Anthon repudiated Harris's claims, but his protests were ignored.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=106}} The golden plates and the \"[[Anthon Transcript]]\" subsequently disappeared.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=106}}\n\nFrom Anthon's description of the transcript and a comparison of the Joseph Smith signature to other known copies, Simmonds concluded that Hofmann had found the Anthon Transcript. After the LDS Church's history department verified the Smith signature, the Anthon Transcript was hailed as the earliest document in Mormon history. The LDS Church publicized the transcript as evidence that its faith was proven. The Church gave Hofmann $20,000 worth of collectibles in exchange for his gift of the Anthon Transcript to the Church.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=107-112}} \n \nHofmann appeared on several local television shows that covered the discovery of the Anthon Transcript. The publicity he received and the relationship he established with a grateful LDS Church enabled Hofmann to make his living as a professional documents dealer.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=127\u2013128}}\n\n====Questioning LDS Church History====\nHofmann's later LDS Church history discoveries contained embarrassing details that were consistent with parts of Joseph Smith's history that the Church preferred to overlook, such as Smith's involvement in money-digging and folk magic. Joseph Smith admitted to indulging in magic and hunts for buried gold during a trial in 1826 and was convicted of being a public nuisance.{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} In 1827, [[Willard Chase]], Smith's neighbor, gave an account of Smith's discovery of the gold plates.{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} According to Chase's statement, Smith had told Chase that when he first tried to unearth the plates, a toad guarding them had risen up and struck Smith in the head.{{sfn|Brodie|2017}} In 1984, Hofmann produced a letter written by Martin Harris in 1830 which related similar details to Chase's account.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=153}} According to this letter, the plates were guarded by a white salamander that struck Smith three times before he was allowed to take up the plates.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=153}} This letter contradicted the official Church history that told of the [[Angel Moroni]] guiding Smith to the location of the buried plates.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=40}} In place of the official history of divine inspiration, Harris's letter made the story of finding the plates an extension of Smith's previous acts of fraud and folk magic. The LDS Church did not want this letter to become public, and Steven Christensen purchased the \"[[salamander letter]]\u201d from Hofmann and donated it to the Church.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=40}}\n\n====Financial Troubles====\nAs Hofmann graduated to trading more expensive documents, he began taking in investors to finance his purchases.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=189}} Hofmann also collected rare children's books and purchased a home that cost more than $500,000.{{sfn|Worrall|2009}} As his need for money increased, he occasionally took money from multiple investors for the same document, leaving himself unable to pay off all of the debts owed when he sold these documents.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=236}} In 1985, his debts included a $185,000 loan from a bank that was arranged by Mormon Elder [[Hugh Pinnock]] and several hundred thousand dollars owed to other investors.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=192, 228}} The purpose of the bank loan was to acquire the McLellin collection, the private papers of one the original [[Quorum of the Twelve]] who later turned against the LDS Church.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=199}} The Church did not want these papers to become public, and Hofmann had represented that he had located the collection and needed the loan to acquire it.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=206}}\n\nWhen Hofmann failed to produce the McLellin collection, Steven Christensen and Hugh Pinnock pushed Hofmann to either produce the collection or pay back the loan. Hofmann did not tell the Church leaders that he had also borrowed money for the collection from another investor. Even if he had been able to acquire the McLellin collection, he had already sold it twice. The sale of the \u201cOath\u201d was Hofmann's only hope to satisfy his creditors.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=203, 248, 257}}\n\n===Bombings===\nThe delay in the authentication of the \u201cOath\u201d and the search for a buyer increased the pressure on Hofmann, and on October 15, 1985, he resorted to planting the bombs that killed Christensen and the wife of Christensen's business partner. Hofmann severely injured himself while attempting to remove a third bomb from his car.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=9, 298}}\n\nAt first, the police did not know if Hofmann was the perpetrator or a victim in the bombings. The clear connection between Hofmann and Christensen was the historical documents business. The investigation led police to track down Hofmann's business transactions, and they found a $2 check to DeBouzek Engraving among his files. Police visited the shop with a copy of the \u201cOath.\u201d A worker identified the document and turned over a negative for the plate that had been used to print the \u201cOath.\u201d Mark Hofmann's \u201cOath\u201d was a forgery, as were most of his high-profile discoveries, including the Anthon Transcript and the salamander letter.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=44, 463-464, 512}}\n\n===Forgery Skills===\nMark Hofmann demonstrated considerable skill in forgery. He acquired or stole paper that was manufactured appropriate to the time of the documents he forged.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=513}} He made his own ink and used chemical processes to age his documents in order to make them look authentic.{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=513}} He learned to [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] himself in order to fluidly copy the signatures of historical figures.{{sfn|Worrall|2009}} His forgeries fooled experts in the field, such as [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], [[Kenneth W. Rendell]], and investigators at the [[NARA|National Archives]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{sfn|Lindsey|1987}} During his confession, Hofmann stated that he did most of his printing from plates that he made himself but \u201cgot lazy and had the \u2018Oath\u2019 plate made professionally.\"{{sfn|Naifeh|2005|p=513}} Ultimately, Hofmann's laziness and lack of paper money, which required him to write a $2 check, exposed him as a forger.\n\n===Imprisonment===\nOn January 23, 1987, Hofmann was sentenced to life imprisonment on two second degree murder charges.{{sfn|Lindsey|1987}} While in prison, Hofmann took an overdose of [[antidepressant]]s and, after lying comatose on his side for twelve hours, permanently damaged his right arm. His forgery arm no longer functions.{{sfn|Worrall|2009}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{wikisource}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite news |ref=harv |last1=McDowell |first1=Edwin |title=Gallery Said To Possess First American Imprint |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/02/arts/gallery-said-to-posses-first-americna-imprint.html |accessdate=10 May 2018 |agency=The New York Times |date=1985}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Worrall |first1=Simon |title=The Poet and the Murderer |date=2009 |edition=Kindle}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Naifeh |first1=Steven |last2=Smith |first2=Gregory White |title=The Mormon Murders: A True Story of Greed, Forgery, Deceit, and Death |date=2005 |publisher=St. Martin's Press}}\n*{{cite web |ref={{sfnref|150 Years}} |title=Year 79 \u2013 1939: The Oath of a Free-Man, with a Historical Study by Lawrence C.

Stations in Europe tended to follow British designs and were in some countries, like Italy, financed by British railway companies.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://members.aol.com/Zacarious1/his.italy.html| title=Italian Railroad Stations| work=History of Railroad Stations| accessdate=13 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nStations built more recently often have a similar feel to airports, with a simple, abstract style. Examples of modern stations include those on newer [[high-speed rail]] networks, such as the [[Shinkansen]] in Japan, [[THSR]] in the Republic of China, [[TGV]] lines in France and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] lines in Germany.\n\n== Station facilities ==\n[[File:Presto card at Oriole Station (20181011172332).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Presto card]] and single ticket machine at a suburban train station in Toronto]]\n\nStations usually have staffed ticket sales offices, automated [[ticket machine]]s, or both, although on some lines tickets are sold on board the trains. Many stations include a shop or convenience store. Larger stations usually have [[fast-food]] or [[restaurant]] facilities. In some countries, stations may also have a [[bar (establishment)|bar]] or [[pub]]. Other station facilities may include: [[toilet]]s, [[left-luggage]], [[Lost and found|lost-and-found]], [[public transport timetables|departures and arrivals boards]], luggage carts, [[waiting room]]s, [[taxi rank]]s, [[bus]] bays and even [[car park]]s. Larger or manned stations tend to have a greater range of facilities including also a station security office. These are usually open for travellers when there is sufficient traffic over a long enough period of time to warrant the cost. In large cities this may mean facilities available around the clock. A basic station might only have platforms, though it may still be distinguished from a '''halt''', a stopping or halting place that may not even have platforms.\n\nMany stations, either larger or smaller, offer interchange with local transportation; this can vary from a simple bus stop across the street to underground rapid-transit urban rail stations.\n\nIn many African, South American, and Asian countries, stations are also used as a place for public markets and other informal businesses. This is especially true on [[tourist]] routes or stations near [[tourist destination]]s.\n\nAs well as providing services for passengers and loading facilities for goods, stations can sometimes have locomotive and rolling stock depots (usually with facilities for storing and refuelling rolling stock and carrying out minor repair jobs).\n\n== Station configurations ==\nIn addition to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first is the [[Rail transport#Level|level of the tracks]]. Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a [[level crossing]], the road and railway will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in [[urban area]]s, except when the station is a terminus. Elevated stations are more common, not including metro stations. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time.\n\nOccasionally, a station serves two or more railway lines at differing levels. This may be due to the station's position at a point where two lines cross (example: [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]), or may be to provide separate station capacity for two types of service, such as intercity and suburban (examples: [[Paris-Gare de Lyon]] and [[30th Street Station|Philadelphia's 30th Street Station]]), or for two different destinations.\n\nStations may also be classified according to the layout of the platforms. Apart from single-track lines, the most basic arrangement is a pair of tracks for the two directions; there is then a basic choice of an [[island platform]] between, two separate platforms outside the tracks ([[Side Platform|side platforms]]), or a combination of the two. With more tracks, the possibilities expand.\n\nSome stations have unusual platform layouts due to space constraints of the station location, or the alignment of the tracks. Examples include staggered platforms, such as at [[Tutbury and Hatton railway station]] on the [[Crewe\u2013Derby line]], and curved platforms, such as [[Cheadle Hulme railway station]] on the Macclesfield to Manchester Line. [[Triangle (railway)|Triangular stations]] also exist where two lines form a three-way junction and platforms are built on all three sides, for example {{rws|Shipley}} and {{rws|Earlestown}} stations.\n\n=== Tracks ===\nIn a station, there are different types of tracks to serve different purposes. A station may also have a [[passing loop]] with a loop line that comes off the straight [[Main line (railway)|main line]] and merge back to the main line on the other end by [[railroad switch]]es to allow trains to pass.<ref name=cahsr>{{cite web|title=Technical Memorandum: Typical Cross Section for 15% Design (TM 1.1.21)|url=http://www.hsr.ca.gov/docs/programs/eir_memos/Proj_Guidelines_TM1_1_21R00.pdf|publisher=California High-Speed Rail Program|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA track with a spot at the station to board and disembark trains is called '''station track''' or '''house track'''<ref name=mw>{{cite web|title=Station Track|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/station%20track|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> regardless of whether it is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a [[Railway platform|platform]], the track may be called '''platform track'''. A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called '''passing track'''.<ref name=cahsr/> A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called '''through track'''.<ref name=mw/>\n\nThere may be other [[Siding (rail)|sidings]] at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes. A '''maintenance track''' or a maintenance siding, usually connected to a passing track, is used for parking maintenance equipment, trains not in service, [[autorack]]s or [[Sleeping car|sleepers]]. A '''[[refuge track]]''' is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train.<ref name=cahsr/>\n\n== Terminus ==\n<!-- some articles link here please leave an {{anchor|Terminus}} if changed.

Trains arriving there have to end their journeys (terminate) or reverse out of the station. Depending on the layout of the station, this usually permits travellers to reach all the [[railway platform|platforms]] without the need to cross any [[rail tracks|tracks]] \u2013 the public entrance to the station and the main reception facilities being at the far end of the platforms.\n\nSometimes, however, the track continues for a short distance beyond the station, and terminating trains continue forwards after depositing their passengers, before either proceeding to sidings or reversing to the station to pick up departing passengers. [[Bondi Junction railway station|Bondi Junction]] and [[Kristiansand Station|Kristiansand Station, Norway]], are like this.\n\nA terminus is frequently, but not always, the final destination of trains arriving at the station. Especially in continental Europe, a city may have a terminus as its main railway station, and all main lines converge on it. In such cases all trains arriving at the terminus must leave in the reverse direction from that of their arrival. There are several ways in which this can be accomplished:\n* arranging for the service to be provided by a [[multiple-unit]] or [[push-pull train]], both of which are capable of operating in either direction; the driver simply walks to the other end of the train and takes control from the other cab; this is increasingly the normal method in Europe; and is very common in North America;\n* by detaching the locomotive which brought the train into the station and then either\n** using another track to \"run it around\" to the other end of the train, to which it then re-attaches;\n** attaching a second locomotive to the outbound end of the train; or\n* by the use of a \"[[Wye (railroad)|wye]]\", a roughly triangular arrangement of track and [[Railroad switch|switches]] (points) where a train can reverse direction and back into the terminal;\n* historically, [[Railway turntable|turntables]] were used to reverse steam engines.\nThere may also be a bypass line, used by freight trains that do not need to stop at the terminus.\n\nSome termini have a newer set of through platforms underneath (or above, or alongside) the terminal platforms on the main level. They are used by a cross-city extension of the main line, often for [[Commuter rail|commuter trains]], while the terminal platforms may serve long-distance services. Examples of underground through lines include the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] platforms at {{stnlnk|Blackfriars}} in London, the [[Argyle Line|Argyle]] and [[North Clyde Line|North Clyde]] lines of [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport|Glasgow's suburban rail network]], in [[Antwerp]] in Belgium, the [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] at the [[Gare du Nord]] in Paris, the [[Milan]] [[Milan suburban railway service|suburban railway service]]'s [[Milan Passante railway|Passante railway]], and many of the numerous [[S-Bahn]] lines at terminal stations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, such as at [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof]].\n\nAn American example of a terminal with this feature is [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington, DC]], where there are bay platforms on the main concourse level to serve terminating trains and standard island platforms one level below to serve trains continuing southwards. The lower tracks run in a tunnel beneath the concourse and emerge a few blocks away to cross the Potomac River into Virginia.\n\nTerminus stations in large cities are by far the biggest stations, with the largest being the [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/new-york/new-york-city/review-56720.html|title=Grand Central Terminal|work=Fodor's: New York City }}</ref> \"[[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]]\" is the name of Rome's central train ststion. Other major cities, such as London, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Paris, [[Istanbul]], Tokyo, and [[Milan]]  have more than one terminus, rather than routes straight through the city. Train journeys through such cities often require alternative transport ([[rapid transit|metro]], [[bus]], [[taxicab|taxi]] or [[ferry]]) from one terminus to the other. For instance, in Istanbul transfers from the [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] (the European terminus) and the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]] (the Asian terminus) traditionally required crossing the [[Bosphorus]] via alternative means, before the [[Marmaray]] railway tunnel linking Europe and Asia was completed. Some cities, including New York, have both termini and through lines.\n\nTerminals that have competing rail lines using the station frequently set up a jointly owned [[terminal railroad]] to own and operate the station and its associated tracks and switching operations.\n\n== Stop ==\nDuring a journey, the term '''station stop''' may be used in announcements, to differentiate a halt during which passengers may alight for another reason, such as a [[locomotive change]].\n\nA '''railway stop''' is a spot along a [[railway line]], usually between stations or at a seldom-used station, where [[passenger]]s can board and exit the [[train]].\n\nWhile a junction or [[interlocking]] usually divides two or more lines or routes, and thus has remotely or locally operated [[railway signal|signals]], a station stop does not. A station stop usually does not have any tracks other than the main tracks, and may or may not have [[railroad switch|switches]] (points, crossovers).\n\n=== Halt ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Halt]] -->\n{{see also|Request stop}}\nA '''halt''', in railway parlance in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[Republic of Ireland]], is a small station, usually unstaffed or with very few staff, and with few or no facilities. In some cases, trains stop only on [[Request stop|request]], when passengers on the platform indicate that they wish to board, or passengers on the train inform the crew that they wish to alight.\n[[File:St Keyne 1533361.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Keyne Wishing Well Halt railway station|St Keyne Wishing Well Halt]]]]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most former halts on the national railway networks have had the word ''halt'' removed from their names. Historically, in many instances the spelling \"halte\" was used, before the spelling \"halt\" became commonplace. There are only two publicly advertised and publicly accessible National Rail stations with the word \"halt\" remaining: {{stnlnk|Coombe Junction Halt}} and {{stnlnk|St Keyne Wishing Well Halt}}.<ref>GB Rail Timetable Winter Edition 8 December 2013</ref><ref name=\"railchronology.free-online.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.railchronology.free-online.co.uk/Halts%20and%20Platforms.htm|title=Rail Chronology: Halts and Platforms|publisher=}}</ref> In addition there are many other such stops in the UK rail network such as {{stnlnk|Penmaenmawr}} in [[North Wales]], {{stnlnk|Yorton}} in [[Shropshire]], and {{stnlnk|The Lakes}} in [[Warwickshire]], where passengers are requested to inform a member of on-board train staff if they wish to alight, or, if catching a train from the station, to make themselves clearly visible to the driver and use a hand signal as the train approaches.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Rail Enquiries |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/pmw.aspx |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nA number of other halts are still open and operational on privately owned, heritage, and preserved railways throughout the British Isles. The word is often used informally to describe national rail network stations with limited service and low usage, such as the ''Oxfordshire Halts'' on the [[Cotswold Line]]. The title halt had also sometimes been applied colloquially to stations served by public services but not available for use by the general public, being accessible only by persons travelling to/from an associated factory (for example IBM near Greenock  and [[British Steel Redcar railway station|British Steel Redcar]]\u2013 although neither of these is any longer served by trains), or military base (such as [[Lympstone Commando railway station|Lympstone Commando]]) or railway yard.  The only two such remaining \"private\" stopping places on the national system where the \"halt\" designation is still officially used seem to be Staff Halt (at Durnsford Road, Wimbledon) and Battersea Pier Sidings Staff Halt \u2013 both are solely for railway staff and are '''not''' open to passengers.<ref name=\"railchronology.free-online.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Western Railway]] in Great Britain began opening ''haltes'' on 12 October 1903; from 1905, the French spelling was Anglicised to \"halt\". These GWR halts had the most basic facilities, with platforms long enough for just one or two carriages; some had no raised platform at all, necessitating the provision of steps on the carriages. Halts were normally unstaffed, tickets being sold on the train. On 1 September 1904, a larger version, known on the GWR as a \"platform\" instead of a \"halt\", was introduced; these had longer platforms, and were usually staffed by a senior grade porter, who sold tickets, and sometimes booked parcels or milk consignments.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacDermot |first=E.T. |title=History of the Great Western Railway |volume=Vol. II |publisher=[[Great Western Railway]] |location=Paddington |edition=1st |year=1931 |page=428 |chapter=Chapter XI: The Great Awakening |isbn=978-0-7110-0411-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Booker |first=Frank |title=The Great Western Railway: A New History |edition=2nd |origyear=1977 |year=1985 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=978-0-946537-16-7 |pages=112\u2013113 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1903 to 1947 the GWR built 379 halts and inherited a further 40 from other companies at the [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping]] of 1923. Peak building periods were before the [[First World War]] (145 built) and 1928\u201339 (198 built){{sfn|Coleford|2010|p=509}}). Ten more were opened by [[British Rail|BR]] on ex-GWR lines. The GWR also built 34 \"platforms\".{{sfn|Reade|1983|loc=Section: In praise of halts}}\n\nIn many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries the term \"halt\" is still used. In the United States such stations are traditionally referred to as [[flag stop#United States|flag stops]]. In Germany, the term is ''[[Haltepunkt]]'' (''Hp'').\n\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], a few small railway stations are designated as \"halts\" ({{Lang-ga|stadanna}}, sing. ''stad'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teanglann.ie/ga/eid/halt|title=English\u2013Irish Dictionary (de Bhaldraithe): halt|website=www.teanglann.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Victoria, Australia]], a '''rail motor stopping place''' ('''RMSP''') is a location on a railway line where a small passenger vehicle or [[railmotor]] can stop to allow passengers to alight.

It generally consists of at least one [[rail track|track]]-side [[railway platform|platform]] and a [[station building]] (depot) providing such ancillary services as [[train ticket|ticket]] sales, [[waiting room]]s and baggage/freight service. If a station is on a [[single track (rail)|single-track]] line, it often has a [[passing loop]] to facilitate traffic movements. The smallest stations are most often referred to as \"stops\" or, in some parts of the world, as \"halts\" ([[flag stop]]s).\n\nStations may be at ground level, underground or elevated. Connections may be available to intersecting [[railway line|rail lines]] or other transport modes such as [[bus]]es, [[tram]]s or other [[rapid transit]] systems.\n\n== Terminology ==\nIn [[British English]], traditional usage favours ''railway station'' or simply ''station'', even though ''train station'', which is often perceived as an Americanism, is now about as common as ''railway station'' in writing; ''railroad station'' is not used, ''railroad'' being obsolete there.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/collegeofjournalism/entries/1cbca265-2424-320c-b032-6e6f7974e221 |title=Steamed up about train stations |publisher=BBC |location=London |website=Academy |author=Ian Jolly |date=1 August 2014 |type=blog |accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bridgingtheunbridgeable.com/2014/11/12/railway-station-or-train-station/ |title=Railway station or train station? |author=Morana Luka\u010d |date=12 November 2014 |website=Bridging the Unbridgeable.

Various forms of architecture have been used in the construction of stations, from those boasting grand, intricate, [[Baroque Revival architecture|Baroque]]- or [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]]-style edifices, to plainer [[utilitarian]] or [[Modern architecture|modernist]] styles. Stations in Europe tended to follow British designs and were in some countries, like Italy, financed by British railway companies.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://members.aol.com/Zacarious1/his.italy.html| title=Italian Railroad Stations| work=History of Railroad Stations| accessdate=13 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nStations built more recently often have a similar feel to airports, with a simple, abstract style. Examples of modern stations include those on newer [[high-speed rail]] networks, such as the [[Shinkansen]] in Japan, [[THSR]] in the Republic of China, [[TGV]] lines in France and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] lines in Germany.\n\n== Station facilities ==\n[[File:Presto card at Oriole Station (20181011172332).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Presto card]] and single ticket machine at a suburban train station in Toronto]]\n\nStations usually have staffed ticket sales offices, automated [[ticket machine]]s, or both, although on some lines tickets are sold on board the trains. Many stations include a shop or convenience store. Larger stations usually have [[fast-food]] or [[restaurant]] facilities. In some countries, stations may also have a [[bar (establishment)|bar]] or [[pub]]. Other station facilities may include: [[toilet]]s, [[left-luggage]], [[Lost and found|lost-and-found]], [[public transport timetables|departures and arrivals boards]], luggage carts, [[waiting room]]s, [[taxi rank]]s, [[bus]] bays and even [[car park]]s. Larger or manned stations tend to have a greater range of facilities including also a station security office. These are usually open for travellers when there is sufficient traffic over a long enough period of time to warrant the cost. In large cities this may mean facilities available around the clock. A basic station might only have platforms, though it may still be distinguished from a '''halt''', a stopping or halting place that may not even have platforms.\n\nMany stations, either larger or smaller, offer interchange with local transportation; this can vary from a simple bus stop across the street to underground rapid-transit urban rail stations.\n\nIn many African, South American, and Asian countries, stations are also used as a place for public markets and other informal businesses. This is especially true on [[tourist]] routes or stations near [[tourist destination]]s.\n\nAs well as providing services for passengers and loading facilities for goods, stations can sometimes have locomotive and rolling stock depots (usually with facilities for storing and refuelling rolling stock and carrying out minor repair jobs).\n\n== Station configurations ==\nIn addition to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first is the [[Rail transport#Level|level of the tracks]]. Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a [[level crossing]], the road and railway will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in [[urban area]]s, except when the station is a terminus. Elevated stations are more common, not including metro stations. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time.\n\nOccasionally, a station serves two or more railway lines at differing levels. This may be due to the station's position at a point where two lines cross (example: [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]), or may be to provide separate station capacity for two types of service, such as intercity and suburban (examples: [[Paris-Gare de Lyon]] and [[30th Street Station|Philadelphia's 30th Street Station]]), or for two different destinations.\n\nStations may also be classified according to the layout of the platforms. Apart from single-track lines, the most basic arrangement is a pair of tracks for the two directions; there is then a basic choice of an [[island platform]] between, two separate platforms outside the tracks ([[Side Platform|side platforms]]), or a combination of the two. With more tracks, the possibilities expand.\n\nSome stations have unusual platform layouts due to space constraints of the station location, or the alignment of the tracks. Examples include staggered platforms, such as at [[Tutbury and Hatton railway station]] on the [[Crewe\u2013Derby line]], and curved platforms, such as [[Cheadle Hulme railway station]] on the Macclesfield to Manchester Line. [[Triangle (railway)|Triangular stations]] also exist where two lines form a three-way junction and platforms are built on all three sides, for example {{rws|Shipley}} and {{rws|Earlestown}} stations.\n\n=== Tracks ===\nIn a station, there are different types of tracks to serve different purposes. A station may also have a [[passing loop]] with a loop line that comes off the straight [[Main line (railway)|main line]] and merge back to the main line on the other end by [[railroad switch]]es to allow trains to pass.<ref name=cahsr>{{cite web|title=Technical Memorandum: Typical Cross Section for 15% Design (TM 1.1.21)|url=http://www.hsr.ca.gov/docs/programs/eir_memos/Proj_Guidelines_TM1_1_21R00.pdf|publisher=California High-Speed Rail Program|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA track with a spot at the station to board and disembark trains is called '''station track''' or '''house track'''<ref name=mw>{{cite web|title=Station Track|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/station%20track|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> regardless of whether it is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a [[Railway platform|platform]], the track may be called '''platform track'''. A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called '''passing track'''.<ref name=cahsr/> A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called '''through track'''.<ref name=mw/>\n\nThere may be other [[Siding (rail)|sidings]] at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes. A '''maintenance track''' or a maintenance siding, usually connected to a passing track, is used for parking maintenance equipment, trains not in service, [[autorack]]s or [[Sleeping car|sleepers]]. A '''[[refuge track]]''' is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train.<ref name=cahsr/>\n\n== Terminus ==\n<!-- some articles link here please leave an {{anchor|Terminus}} if changed.

Trains arriving there have to end their journeys (terminate) or reverse out of the station. Depending on the layout of the station, this usually permits travellers to reach all the [[railway platform|platforms]] without the need to cross any [[rail tracks|tracks]] \u2013 the public entrance to the station and the main reception facilities being at the far end of the platforms.\n\nSometimes, however, the track continues for a short distance beyond the station, and terminating trains continue forwards after depositing their passengers, before either proceeding to sidings or reversing to the station to pick up departing passengers. [[Bondi Junction railway station|Bondi Junction]] and [[Kristiansand Station|Kristiansand Station, Norway]], are like this.\n\nA terminus is frequently, but not always, the final destination of trains arriving at the station. Especially in continental Europe, a city may have a terminus as its main railway station, and all main lines converge on it. In such cases all trains arriving at the terminus must leave in the reverse direction from that of their arrival. There are several ways in which this can be accomplished:\n* arranging for the service to be provided by a [[multiple-unit]] or [[push-pull train]], both of which are capable of operating in either direction; the driver simply walks to the other end of the train and takes control from the other cab; this is increasingly the normal method in Europe; and is very common in North America;\n* by detaching the locomotive which brought the train into the station and then either\n** using another track to \"run it around\" to the other end of the train, to which it then re-attaches;\n** attaching a second locomotive to the outbound end of the train; or\n* by the use of a \"[[Wye (railroad)|wye]]\", a roughly triangular arrangement of track and [[Railroad switch|switches]] (points) where a train can reverse direction and back into the terminal;\n* historically, [[Railway turntable|turntables]] were used to reverse steam engines.\nThere may also be a bypass line, used by freight trains that do not need to stop at the terminus.\n\nSome termini have a newer set of through platforms underneath (or above, or alongside) the terminal platforms on the main level. They are used by a cross-city extension of the main line, often for [[Commuter rail|commuter trains]], while the terminal platforms may serve long-distance services. Examples of underground through lines include the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] platforms at {{stnlnk|Blackfriars}} in London, the [[Argyle Line|Argyle]] and [[North Clyde Line|North Clyde]] lines of [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport|Glasgow's suburban rail network]], in [[Antwerp]] in Belgium, the [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] at the [[Gare du Nord]] in Paris, the [[Milan]] [[Milan suburban railway service|suburban railway service]]'s [[Milan Passante railway|Passante railway]], and many of the numerous [[S-Bahn]] lines at terminal stations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, such as at [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof]].\n\nAn American example of a terminal with this feature is [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington, DC]], where there are bay platforms on the main concourse level to serve terminating trains and standard island platforms one level below to serve trains continuing southwards. The lower tracks run in a tunnel beneath the concourse and emerge a few blocks away to cross the Potomac River into Virginia.\n\nTerminus stations in large cities are by far the biggest stations, with the largest being the [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/new-york/new-york-city/review-56720.html|title=Grand Central Terminal|work=Fodor's: New York City }}</ref> \"[[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]]\" is the name of Rome's central train ststion. Other major cities, such as London, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Paris, [[Istanbul]], Tokyo, and [[Milan]]  have more than one terminus, rather than routes straight through the city. Train journeys through such cities often require alternative transport ([[rapid transit|metro]], [[bus]], [[taxicab|taxi]] or [[ferry]]) from one terminus to the other. For instance, in Istanbul transfers from the [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] (the European terminus) and the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]] (the Asian terminus) traditionally required crossing the [[Bosphorus]] via alternative means, before the [[Marmaray]] railway tunnel linking Europe and Asia was completed. Some cities, including New York, have both termini and through lines.\n\nTerminals that have competing rail lines using the station frequently set up a jointly owned [[terminal railroad]] to own and operate the station and its associated tracks and switching operations.\n\n== Stop ==\nDuring a journey, the term '''station stop''' may be used in announcements, to differentiate a halt during which passengers may alight for another reason, such as a [[locomotive change]].\n\nA '''railway stop''' is a spot along a [[railway line]], usually between stations or at a seldom-used station, where [[passenger]]s can board and exit the [[train]].\n\nWhile a junction or [[interlocking]] usually divides two or more lines or routes, and thus has remotely or locally operated [[railway signal|signals]], a station stop does not. A station stop usually does not have any tracks other than the main tracks, and may or may not have [[railroad switch|switches]] (points, crossovers).\n\n=== Halt ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Halt]] -->\n{{see also|Request stop}}\nA '''halt''', in railway parlance in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[Republic of Ireland]], is a small station, usually unstaffed or with very few staff, and with few or no facilities. In some cases, trains stop only on [[Request stop|request]], when passengers on the platform indicate that they wish to board, or passengers on the train inform the crew that they wish to alight.\n[[File:St Keyne 1533361.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Keyne Wishing Well Halt railway station|St Keyne Wishing Well Halt]]]]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most former halts on the national railway networks have had the word ''halt'' removed from their names. Historically, in many instances the spelling \"halte\" was used, before the spelling \"halt\" became commonplace. There are only two publicly advertised and publicly accessible National Rail stations with the word \"halt\" remaining: {{stnlnk|Coombe Junction Halt}} and {{stnlnk|St Keyne Wishing Well Halt}}.<ref>GB Rail Timetable Winter Edition 8 December 2013</ref><ref name=\"railchronology.free-online.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.railchronology.free-online.co.uk/Halts%20and%20Platforms.htm|title=Rail Chronology: Halts and Platforms|publisher=}}</ref> In addition there are many other such stops in the UK rail network such as {{stnlnk|Penmaenmawr}} in [[North Wales]], {{stnlnk|Yorton}} in [[Shropshire]], and {{stnlnk|The Lakes}} in [[Warwickshire]], where passengers are requested to inform a member of on-board train staff if they wish to alight, or, if catching a train from the station, to make themselves clearly visible to the driver and use a hand signal as the train approaches.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Rail Enquiries |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/pmw.aspx |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nA number of other halts are still open and operational on privately owned, heritage, and preserved railways throughout the British Isles. The word is often used informally to describe national rail network stations with limited service and low usage, such as the ''Oxfordshire Halts'' on the [[Cotswold Line]]. The title halt had also sometimes been applied colloquially to stations served by public services but not available for use by the general public, being accessible only by persons travelling to/from an associated factory (for example IBM near Greenock  and [[British Steel Redcar railway station|British Steel Redcar]]\u2013 although neither of these is any longer served by trains), or military base (such as [[Lympstone Commando railway station|Lympstone Commando]]) or railway yard.  The only two such remaining \"private\" stopping places on the national system where the \"halt\" designation is still officially used seem to be Staff Halt (at Durnsford Road, Wimbledon) and Battersea Pier Sidings Staff Halt \u2013 both are solely for railway staff and are '''not''' open to passengers.<ref name=\"railchronology.free-online.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Western Railway]] in Great Britain began opening ''haltes'' on 12 October 1903; from 1905, the French spelling was Anglicised to \"halt\". These GWR halts had the most basic facilities, with platforms long enough for just one or two carriages; some had no raised platform at all, necessitating the provision of steps on the carriages. Halts were normally unstaffed, tickets being sold on the train. On 1 September 1904, a larger version, known on the GWR as a \"platform\" instead of a \"halt\", was introduced; these had longer platforms, and were usually staffed by a senior grade porter, who sold tickets, and sometimes booked parcels or milk consignments.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacDermot |first=E.T. |title=History of the Great Western Railway |volume=Vol. II |publisher=[[Great Western Railway]] |location=Paddington |edition=1st |year=1931 |page=428 |chapter=Chapter XI: The Great Awakening |isbn=978-0-7110-0411-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Booker |first=Frank |title=The Great Western Railway: A New History |edition=2nd |origyear=1977 |year=1985 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=978-0-946537-16-7 |pages=112\u2013113 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1903 to 1947 the GWR built 379 halts and inherited a further 40 from other companies at the [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping]] of 1923. Peak building periods were before the [[First World War]] (145 built) and 1928\u201339 (198 built){{sfn|Coleford|2010|p=509}}). Ten more were opened by [[British Rail|BR]] on ex-GWR lines. The GWR also built 34 \"platforms\".{{sfn|Reade|1983|loc=Section: In praise of halts}}\n\nIn many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries the term \"halt\" is still used. In the United States such stations are traditionally referred to as [[flag stop#United States|flag stops]]. In Germany, the term is ''[[Haltepunkt]]'' (''Hp'').\n\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], a few small railway stations are designated as \"halts\" ({{Lang-ga|stadanna}}, sing. ''stad'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teanglann.ie/ga/eid/halt|title=English\u2013Irish Dictionary (de Bhaldraithe): halt|website=www.teanglann.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Victoria, Australia]], a '''rail motor stopping place''' ('''RMSP''') is a location on a railway line where a small passenger vehicle or [[railmotor]] can stop to allow passengers to alight. It is often designated by just a sign beside the railway<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/index.php/VPRS_12800_P1_H_4877|title=Public Records Office Victoria}}</ref> at a convenient access point near a road.

Considerations include: elevator or ramp access to all platforms, matching platform height to train floors, making wheelchair lifts available when platforms do not match vehicle floors, accessible toilets and pay phones, audible station announcements, and safety measures such as tactile marking of platform edges.\n\n== Goods stations ==\n[[File:09 Warehouses etc at the end of the Tunnel towards Wapping, from Bury's Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 1831 - artfinder 267568.jpg|thumb|right|Reached by a {{convert|1.24|mi|0|adj=on}} long tunnel, the 1830 [[Park Lane railway goods station|Park Lane Goods Terminus]] at Liverpool's docks was the world's first station built entirely for freight.]]\n{{Main|Goods station}}\n\nGoods or freight stations deal exclusively or predominantly with the loading and unloading of goods and may well have [[marshalling yards]] (classification yards) for the sorting of wagons.

Built in 1830, the terminal was reached by a {{convert|1.24|mi|0|adj=on}} tunnel.\n\nAs goods are increasingly moved by road, many former goods stations, as well as the goods sheds at passenger stations, have closed. In addition, many goods stations today are used purely for the cross-loading of freight and may be known as transshipment stations, where they primarily handle containers. They are also known as container stations or terminals.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Records==\n{{Stack|\n[[File:Grand Central Terminal Main Concourse May 2014 - 2.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York City is the largest station by number of platforms, with 44 on two levels.]]\n[[File:Clapham Junction Platforms.jpeg|thumb|{{stnlnk|Clapham Junction}} in London is the busiest station in terms of rail traffic with an average of one train every 20 seconds at peak times.]]\n}}\n\n=== Worldwide ===\n{{see also|List of highest railways in the world}}\n* The world's '''busiest passenger station''', in terms of daily passenger throughput, is [[Shinjuku Station]] in Tokyo.<ref name=\"Discovery Channel Busiest Railway\">{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/machines_and_engineering/building_the_biggest/busiest_railway/index.shtml| title=Machines & Engineering: Building the Biggest| publisher=Discovery Channel| year=2008| accessdate=13 March 2008}}</ref>\n* The world's '''station with most platforms''' is [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York City with 44 platforms.<ref name=\"AutoDR-6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-railway-station-(no-of-platforms)|title=Largest railway station (no. of platforms)|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref>\n* The world's '''highest station above ground level''' (not above sea level) is [[Smith\u2013Ninth Streets (IND Culver Line)|Smith\u2013Ninth Streets]] subway station in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mta.info/news/stories/?story=177 |work=MTA News |title=Rebuilding the Culver Viaduct }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=BROOKLYN!! |date=Summer 2013 |page=7 |type=Caption on photo from station reopening celebration |url=http://www.brooklyn-usa.org }}</ref>\n* [[Coney Island \u2013 Stillwell Avenue (New York City Subway)|Coney Island \u2013 Stillwell Avenue]] in New York City is the world's largest elevated terminal with 8 tracks and 4 island platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/nyregion/28subway.html|title=And Now for the Good News From the Subway System; New Terminal in Coney Island Rivals the Great Train Sheds of Europe|date=28 May 2005|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n* The [[Shanghai South Railway Station]], opened in June 2006, has the world's largest circular transparent roof.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://english.people.com.cn/200606/26/eng20060626_277464.html |title=The railway station with world's largest transparent roof |date=26 June 2006 |newspaper=People's Daily |location =Beijing |accessdate=13 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n{{see also|List of busiest railway stations in Europe}}\n\n'''Busiest'''\n* [[Gare du Nord]], in Paris, is '''by the number of travellers''', at around 214 millions per year, the busiest railway station in Europe, the 24th busiest in the world and the busiest outside Japan.<ref name=WA>{{cite news |website=WorldAtlas.com |location=Quebec, Canada |title=Europe's Record-Holding Railway Stations. |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/europe-s-record-holding-railway-stations.html |date=23 October 2017 |author=Oishimaya Sen Nag |accessdate=2018-09-15}}</ref>\n* {{stnlnk|Clapham Junction}}, in London, is Europe's busiest station '''by daily rail traffic''' with 100 to 180 trains per hour passing through.<ref name=WA/>{{unreliable source|reason=180 trains per hour though a platform is 3 trains every minute, a clear impossiblilty.

It is first officially noted in 1828, from French blouse (\"a workman's or peasant's smock\"), of obscure [[Occitan]] route.{{Clarify|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Description and history==\n[[File:Poet-shirt.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A man and woman wearing [[poet shirt]]s\u2014a unisex blouse, inspired by [[Romanticism]] and worn by fashionable people such as the English poet, [[Lord Byron]]]]\n[[File:Puffy Shirt 2006.jpg|thumb|175px|The ''[[Seinfeld]]'' [[The Puffy Shirt|\"puffy shirt\"]], worn by Jerry Seinfeld, is an example of a [[poet shirt]] blouse.]]\n[[File:Garibaldi and his wife, Anita, defending Rome in 1849.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] (center), the Italian patriot and his wife, Anita (right), popularized the red, Garibaldi shirt, a type of military blouse, which became popular, as early 1860s, civilian fashion, with men and women, both, in [[Europe]] and the [[North America]].]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 42023 Two women dressed for a game of tennis, 1890-1900.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Blouses from 1890-1900 Australia.]]\n\nBlouses are historically a cask style, mostly mail-like garment{{vague|date=October 2017}}, that were rarely part of the fashionable woman's wardrobe until the [[1890s in fashion|1890s]].  Before that time, they were occasionally popular for informal wear in styles that echoed [[peasant]] or traditional clothing, such as the [[Garibaldi shirt]] of the 1860s.\n\nBlouses usually consist of light fabrics such as silk or thin cotton fabrics, until the early 1990s are often made of softly falling [[synthetic fiber]]s (e.g. polyester). Sometimes they are decorated with frills, embroidery or loops. The classic of the ladies' blouses is the white [[shirt blouse]] (following the classic elegant white men's shirt). Here the combination possibilities are particularly diverse. The open spade, peter pan, reverse and [[revere collar]] is another common type of classic ladies' blouse.\n\n*'''1913 wrote The week about the ladies' blouse in the Reitsport:'''\n:''\"Even if more and more justification is given for the hot summer days of the casual blouse, the classic [[riding dress]] made of velvet or [[England|English]] linen still remains unmatched.\"''\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the [[sailor blouse]]s derived from [[sailor suit]]s were popular for girls to the blue [[pleated skirt]]. In the time of [[National Socialism]] this piece of clothing was rejected as a [[bourgeois]]-[[decadent]]. In the 1950s, the sailor's look then entered the leisure mode for adults.\n\nThe high collar in blouses was pushed out during this time by the [[halsferne variant]]. Specialist shops also offered \"ladies' cloaks\". [[KdW]] in Berlin applied in his illustrated main catalog: 1913 among other things a [[backfisch-confection]], with eight blouses between 2.75 and 9.50 Marks. The simplest model was a \"wash blouse, navy, white spotted\", the most expensive one \"blouse, white, wash, with tip and stick\". One of the novelties of the season was the pointed \"[[Charmeuse blouse]], very elegant form, pure silk, with very fluffy crepe and lace gown\"\n\nDuring the later Victorian period blouses became common for informal, practical wear. A simple blouse with a plain skirt was the standard dress for the newly expanded female (non-[[Domestic worker|domestic]]) workforce of the 1890s, especially for those employed in office work. In the [[1900s in fashion|1900s]] and [[1910s in fashion|1910s]], elaborate blouses, such as the \"lingerie blouse\" (so-called because they were heavily decorated with [[lace]] and [[embroidery]] in a style formerly restricted to underwear) and the \"[[Gibson Girl]] blouse\" with [[tuck (sewing)|tuck]]s and [[pleat]]ing, became immensely popular for daywear and even some informal evening wear. Since then, blouses have remained a wardrobe staple, so by now blouses have not ceased to be fixed in the \"popular cloakroom\" style.\n\nBlouses are often made of cotton or silk cloth and may or may not include a [[collar (clothing)|collar]] and [[sleeve]]s. They are generally more tailored than simple knit tops, and may contain [[feminine]] details such as [[ruffle]]s, a [[Necktie|tie]] or a soft [[Bow (knot)|bow]] at the [[neck]], or [[embroidery|embroidered decorations]].\n\nTailoring provides a closer fit to the wearer's shape. This is achieved with sewing of features such as [[princess seams]] or [[Dart (sewing)|darting]] in the waist and/or bust.\n\nBlouses (and many women's shirts with buttons) usually have [[button]]s reversed from that of men's shirts (except in the case of male [[battledress|military fatigues]]). That is, the buttons are normally on the wearer's left-hand and the buttonholes are on the right. The reasons for this are unclear, and several theories exist without have conclusive evidence. Some suggest this custom was introduced by launderers so they could distinguish between women's and men's shirts. One theory purports that the tradition arose in the [[Middle Ages]] when one manner of manifesting wealth was by the number of buttons one wore. Another that the original design was based on armour which was designed so that a right-handed opponent would not catch their weapon in the seam and tear through, and that a person could draw a weapon with their right-hand without catching it in a loose seam of their own clothes.\n\nFemale [[servant (domestic)|servant]]s were in charge of buttoning their mistress's gowns (since the buttons were usually in the back). They tired of attempting to deal with buttons that were, from their point of view, backwards and, as such they started reversing the placement when making or repairing them. Another possible reason is so that men can easily undo blouses as, from the front, buttons are on the same side as a man's shirt. One other theory is that women were normally dressed by their maids, while men dressed themselves. As such, women's blouses were designed so it could be easily buttoned by the maid but that of men were designed so it could be easily buttoned by the person wearing it.\n\nAlthough in all the cases proposed the reasons for the distinction no longer exist, it continues out of [[convention (norm)|custom]] or tradition.\n\nWhile most women prefer to have the top button open for better comfort, some blouses made for women have looser necklines so the top button can be fastened without compromising comfort, but giving the same stylish appearance.\n\nSome women attach various pins and ornaments to their blouses over a fastened top button for style. Some of these attach directly to the button itself, others to the collars.\n\nSome blouses do not have a top button at all, and collars are intentionally styled to be open. They also form part of some nations' traditional folk costume.\n\n===Styles since World War Two===\n[[File:Tanaka Sonoko and Sasada Kazuko.JPG|thumb|175px|A Japanese blouse (left), in 1951.]]\n\nVarious new and different forms of collar emerged in the 1920s. They diminished in sizes by the 1950s, but were huge in the 1930s. At the beginning of the 1970s, popular styles included the rounded collar, [[sausage dog collar]], then extra wide collar and [[double cuffs]] from shirts, that fell on them often from fashions relating to synthetic fabrics like usually [[polyester]]. At the beginning of the 1960s bubic bangs came back, then later wide collars. The fashion of [[standing collar]] and [[federal collar]], loops, [[rounded collar]]s, [[revere collar]] and the [[smallest collar]], sometimes with concealed [[button fly]] on a \"smoking blouse\", attached folds and stressed set-in-followed in the 1980s. Again, thin and often shining synthetic fibres were very popular. Towards the end of the 20th Century, they were of an extra-long blouses of pants style and worn over trousers or skirt worn, optionally combined with a rather wide belt around the waist in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Poland, the UK, Ireland, South Africa and the USA.\n\nThe sleeves had been shortened during the early 1950s to the {{frac|1|2}} and {{frac|1|4}} length in Europe. They were reduced again in the mid-1990s and are now regularly at the {{frac|7|8}}, {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|3}} and {{frac|1|4}} length around the world. As the eye will be drawn to the naked flesh below the sleeve, designers often use sleeve length to focus the minds eye on the slimmer parts of the arm, particularly short sleeve blouses below the elbow to give the illusion of a slimmer arm. Sleeveless tops were fashionable and a topical item in Western Europe and North America during the mid-2000s.\n\nMany fashionable styles of both the 1970s and 1980s were on the go again after the millennium in the blouse fashion: double cuffs, extra wide pointed collar, belt around the waist, synthetic fibre and the like. Often the blouses also embroidery or \"crystal stocking\", have especially on collar and string. The blouses with the so-called three-quarter arm were a striking phenomenon of the 1990s. Blouses can be combined well and easily with a [[blazer]], [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]], [[Bolero jacket|bolero]] or [[sweater]], with or without some colourful silks or bead chain necklaces.\n\n===Eco movement===\nAs part of the [[Eco movement]]'s folk blouses for women were cut from natural materials such as flax, linen and cotton. Men also wore these \"Frisian blouses\" on occasion.\n\n==Use in Aboyne dress==\n{{main|Aboyne dress}}\n[[Image:Aboyne 05SV 002.jpg|right|thumb|175px|A young Highland dancer wearing the Aboyne dress prescribed for female dancers for the National dances.]]\n\nIn one version, a tartan pattern skirt is worn with an over-the-shoulder plaid, a white blouse and petticoat, and a velvet bodice.

Before that time, they were occasionally popular for informal wear in styles that echoed [[peasant]] or traditional clothing, such as the [[Garibaldi shirt]] of the 1860s.\n\nBlouses usually consist of light fabrics such as silk or thin cotton fabrics, until the early 1990s are often made of softly falling [[synthetic fiber]]s (e.g. polyester). Sometimes they are decorated with frills, embroidery or loops. The classic of the ladies' blouses is the white [[shirt blouse]] (following the classic elegant white men's shirt). Here the combination possibilities are particularly diverse. The open spade, peter pan, reverse and [[revere collar]] is another common type of classic ladies' blouse.\n\n*'''1913 wrote The week about the ladies' blouse in the Reitsport:'''\n:''\"Even if more and more justification is given for the hot summer days of the casual blouse, the classic [[riding dress]] made of velvet or [[England|English]] linen still remains unmatched.\"''\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the [[sailor blouse]]s derived from [[sailor suit]]s were popular for girls to the blue [[pleated skirt]]. In the time of [[National Socialism]] this piece of clothing was rejected as a [[bourgeois]]-[[decadent]]. In the 1950s, the sailor's look then entered the leisure mode for adults.\n\nThe high collar in blouses was pushed out during this time by the [[halsferne variant]]. Specialist shops also offered \"ladies' cloaks\". [[KdW]] in Berlin applied in his illustrated main catalog: 1913 among other things a [[backfisch-confection]], with eight blouses between 2.75 and 9.50 Marks. The simplest model was a \"wash blouse, navy, white spotted\", the most expensive one \"blouse, white, wash, with tip and stick\". One of the novelties of the season was the pointed \"[[Charmeuse blouse]], very elegant form, pure silk, with very fluffy crepe and lace gown\"\n\nDuring the later Victorian period blouses became common for informal, practical wear. A simple blouse with a plain skirt was the standard dress for the newly expanded female (non-[[Domestic worker|domestic]]) workforce of the 1890s, especially for those employed in office work. In the [[1900s in fashion|1900s]] and [[1910s in fashion|1910s]], elaborate blouses, such as the \"lingerie blouse\" (so-called because they were heavily decorated with [[lace]] and [[embroidery]] in a style formerly restricted to underwear) and the \"[[Gibson Girl]] blouse\" with [[tuck (sewing)|tuck]]s and [[pleat]]ing, became immensely popular for daywear and even some informal evening wear. Since then, blouses have remained a wardrobe staple, so by now blouses have not ceased to be fixed in the \"popular cloakroom\" style.\n\nBlouses are often made of cotton or silk cloth and may or may not include a [[collar (clothing)|collar]] and [[sleeve]]s. They are generally more tailored than simple knit tops, and may contain [[feminine]] details such as [[ruffle]]s, a [[Necktie|tie]] or a soft [[Bow (knot)|bow]] at the [[neck]], or [[embroidery|embroidered decorations]].\n\nTailoring provides a closer fit to the wearer's shape. This is achieved with sewing of features such as [[princess seams]] or [[Dart (sewing)|darting]] in the waist and/or bust.\n\nBlouses (and many women's shirts with buttons) usually have [[button]]s reversed from that of men's shirts (except in the case of male [[battledress|military fatigues]]). That is, the buttons are normally on the wearer's left-hand and the buttonholes are on the right. The reasons for this are unclear, and several theories exist without have conclusive evidence. Some suggest this custom was introduced by launderers so they could distinguish between women's and men's shirts. One theory purports that the tradition arose in the [[Middle Ages]] when one manner of manifesting wealth was by the number of buttons one wore. Another that the original design was based on armour which was designed so that a right-handed opponent would not catch their weapon in the seam and tear through, and that a person could draw a weapon with their right-hand without catching it in a loose seam of their own clothes.\n\nFemale [[servant (domestic)|servant]]s were in charge of buttoning their mistress's gowns (since the buttons were usually in the back). They tired of attempting to deal with buttons that were, from their point of view, backwards and, as such they started reversing the placement when making or repairing them. Another possible reason is so that men can easily undo blouses as, from the front, buttons are on the same side as a man's shirt. One other theory is that women were normally dressed by their maids, while men dressed themselves. As such, women's blouses were designed so it could be easily buttoned by the maid but that of men were designed so it could be easily buttoned by the person wearing it.\n\nAlthough in all the cases proposed the reasons for the distinction no longer exist, it continues out of [[convention (norm)|custom]] or tradition.\n\nWhile most women prefer to have the top button open for better comfort, some blouses made for women have looser necklines so the top button can be fastened without compromising comfort, but giving the same stylish appearance.\n\nSome women attach various pins and ornaments to their blouses over a fastened top button for style. Some of these attach directly to the button itself, others to the collars.\n\nSome blouses do not have a top button at all, and collars are intentionally styled to be open. They also form part of some nations' traditional folk costume.\n\n===Styles since World War Two===\n[[File:Tanaka Sonoko and Sasada Kazuko.JPG|thumb|175px|A Japanese blouse (left), in 1951.]]\n\nVarious new and different forms of collar emerged in the 1920s.

Bernard has four daughters, Deidre, Monica, Julie, and Peggy de Gastyne. \n\n==Biography==\nSerge de Gastyne (1930\u20131992) was born in Paris, France. Early in his teens, de Gastyne fought in the French Underground. He emigrated to the United States in 1947 where his dazzling piano-playing soon won him scholarship grants at the University of Portland and the Eastman School of Music. Between studies he sold encyclopedias, and earned enough to finance a cross-country trip by bus.\n\nIn 1952 he enlisted in the Air Force, which decided that it wanted him at the keyboard of a piano, not at the controls of a plane. He was assigned to the Composing and Arranging staff of the [[Air Force Band]] in Washington DC.\n\nAt [[Sampson Air Force Base]] near Rochester, New York (Major General Richard Lindsay commanding), he set out to compose a huge musical \"panorama\" celebrating the 50th anniversary of powered flight.<ref>'''Air Force Wonder''',http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891687,00.html / '''Time Magazine''' article, Monday, January 30, 1956</ref>\n\nHis musical compositions include symphonies, operas, and many pieces for band, voice and organ. He won awards for his compositions from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP).\n\nIn 1968 he became a citizen of the United States. After studies at Eastman, he received a Masters and a Doctorate in music from the University of Maryland.\n\nHe taught music at [[Northern Virginia Community College]] while serving in the Air Force. After retirement, he moved to [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], where he lived for three years before his death on July 24, 1992.<ref>'''Coda''',https://books.google.com/books?id=hBMKAQAAMAAJ&q=Coda+air+force+gastyne+retired&dq=Coda+air+force+gastyne+retired&hl=en&ei=Wk7RTai6Lqrk0gGw-oigDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CF8Q6AEwAA / '''Coda''', the newsletter of the Retired Air Force Bandleaders and Superintendents Society, Sep\u2013Oct 1992</ref>\n\nSerge was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1953\u20131972, Serge was composer-in-residence with the U.S. Air Force Band and Orchestra in Washington, D.C. Concurrently he taught at Northern Virginia Community College, retiring in 1981. Serge was the Artistic Director and Resident Composer for the New Music Orchestra (Capitol Hill).\n\nHe wrote well over 100 original compositions, ranging from Chamber and Orchestral pieces (six commissioned Symphonies, a '''''Tone Poem''''' premiered by Leopold Stokowski, etc.), to many vocal works in different languages, compositions for band, ''chef d'oeuvre'' for organ and many mallet percussion pieces. He  also wrote for unusual instrumental combinations of the above, for example, including a significant part for organ in his '''''Symphony No. 4 for Band''''', reading of poetry in his '''''Symphony No. 6''''', etc.\n\nSerge's '''''Four Musical Moments ''''' and '''''Concerto for Trumpet''''' were premiered by Emerson Head and Roy Hamlin Johnson, both professors of music at the University of Maryland at College Park. Emerson Head also premiered his '''''Grand Duo Concertant''''' at the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nHis symphony, '''''L'Ile Lumiere''''' (Island of Light) was commissioned by Thor Johnson, Director of the [[Cincinnati Symphony]], and performed by the orchestra in its 1956 season.<ref name=\"EndureInStrength\">\nhttp://www.endureinstrength.org/pages.asp?pageid=111854</ref>\n\nSerge was instrumental in the creation of the Music Department at the Bailey's Cross Roads campus of Northern Virginia Community College. He wrote seven symphonies as well as his '''''Eclogae''''' for soprano and orchestra.\n\nBecause of his professional position with the Air Force Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. he is well known for his '''''American Weekend March''''', which was commissioned by the '''American Weekend''' magazine.  In addition, he also completed or collaborated on countless arrangements during his time in the Air Force.<ref name=\"International1956\">{{cite book|author=Rotary International|title=The Rotarian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59|accessdate=May 16, 2011|date=December 1956|publisher=Rotary International|pages=59\u2013|issn=0035-838X}}</ref><ref name=\"SmithStoutamire1979\">{{cite book|author1=Norman E.

Serge exuded a generosity of spirit and ruthlessness in equal measure. He was open to share basic aesthetic tenets. In particular, '''''Cantique de Joie''''' displays a spiritual connection. He seems to have a foot in the next world \u2013 a creative colossus at the peak of his powers with a particular [[Catholic]] spirituality translated into a religious idiom.\n\n'''''Cantique de Joie''''', Opus 70, was dedicated to Peter Basch and performed by him at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris, on the V/153 Cavaill\u00e9-Coll (modified) in 1973.

He took further studies at the [[Eastman School of Music]] and also at the [[University of Maryland]], where he was awarded Master of Music and [[Doctor of Music]] Arts degrees.<ref name=\"RehrigHoe1991\">{{cite book|author1=William H.

Early in his teens, de Gastyne fought in the French Underground. He emigrated to the United States in 1947 where his dazzling piano-playing soon won him scholarship grants at the University of Portland and the Eastman School of Music. Between studies he sold encyclopedias, and earned enough to finance a cross-country trip by bus.\n\nIn 1952 he enlisted in the Air Force, which decided that it wanted him at the keyboard of a piano, not at the controls of a plane. He was assigned to the Composing and Arranging staff of the [[Air Force Band]] in Washington DC.\n\nAt [[Sampson Air Force Base]] near Rochester, New York (Major General Richard Lindsay commanding), he set out to compose a huge musical \"panorama\" celebrating the 50th anniversary of powered flight.<ref>'''Air Force Wonder''',http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891687,00.html / '''Time Magazine''' article, Monday, January 30, 1956</ref>\n\nHis musical compositions include symphonies, operas, and many pieces for band, voice and organ. He won awards for his compositions from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP).\n\nIn 1968 he became a citizen of the United States. After studies at Eastman, he received a Masters and a Doctorate in music from the University of Maryland.\n\nHe taught music at [[Northern Virginia Community College]] while serving in the Air Force. After retirement, he moved to [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], where he lived for three years before his death on July 24, 1992.<ref>'''Coda''',https://books.google.com/books?id=hBMKAQAAMAAJ&q=Coda+air+force+gastyne+retired&dq=Coda+air+force+gastyne+retired&hl=en&ei=Wk7RTai6Lqrk0gGw-oigDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CF8Q6AEwAA / '''Coda''', the newsletter of the Retired Air Force Bandleaders and Superintendents Society, Sep\u2013Oct 1992</ref>\n\nSerge was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1953\u20131972, Serge was composer-in-residence with the U.S. Air Force Band and Orchestra in Washington, D.C. Concurrently he taught at Northern Virginia Community College, retiring in 1981. Serge was the Artistic Director and Resident Composer for the New Music Orchestra (Capitol Hill).\n\nHe wrote well over 100 original compositions, ranging from Chamber and Orchestral pieces (six commissioned Symphonies, a '''''Tone Poem''''' premiered by Leopold Stokowski, etc.), to many vocal works in different languages, compositions for band, ''chef d'oeuvre'' for organ and many mallet percussion pieces. He  also wrote for unusual instrumental combinations of the above, for example, including a significant part for organ in his '''''Symphony No. 4 for Band''''', reading of poetry in his '''''Symphony No. 6''''', etc.\n\nSerge's '''''Four Musical Moments ''''' and '''''Concerto for Trumpet''''' were premiered by Emerson Head and Roy Hamlin Johnson, both professors of music at the University of Maryland at College Park. Emerson Head also premiered his '''''Grand Duo Concertant''''' at the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nHis symphony, '''''L'Ile Lumiere''''' (Island of Light) was commissioned by Thor Johnson, Director of the [[Cincinnati Symphony]], and performed by the orchestra in its 1956 season.<ref name=\"EndureInStrength\">\nhttp://www.endureinstrength.org/pages.asp?pageid=111854</ref>\n\nSerge was instrumental in the creation of the Music Department at the Bailey's Cross Roads campus of Northern Virginia Community College. He wrote seven symphonies as well as his '''''Eclogae''''' for soprano and orchestra.\n\nBecause of his professional position with the Air Force Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. he is well known for his '''''American Weekend March''''', which was commissioned by the '''American Weekend''' magazine.  In addition, he also completed or collaborated on countless arrangements during his time in the Air Force.<ref name=\"International1956\">{{cite book|author=Rotary International|title=The Rotarian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59|accessdate=May 16, 2011|date=December 1956|publisher=Rotary International|pages=59\u2013|issn=0035-838X}}</ref><ref name=\"SmithStoutamire1979\">{{cite book|author1=Norman E.

Serge exuded a generosity of spirit and ruthlessness in equal measure. He was open to share basic aesthetic tenets. In particular, '''''Cantique de Joie''''' displays a spiritual connection. He seems to have a foot in the next world \u2013 a creative colossus at the peak of his powers with a particular [[Catholic]] spirituality translated into a religious idiom.\n\n'''''Cantique de Joie''''', Opus 70, was dedicated to Peter Basch and performed by him at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris, on the V/153 Cavaill\u00e9-Coll (modified) in 1973. He wrote of his experience playing there: \"The most exciting part for me was the entrance of the pedal triplets mid-way, like a pile driver pumping its way forward, a determined thrust and support to the upperwork that was crashing/exploding, aided by the dissonant chords cutting through the texture with a volcanic bombardment to the victorious final spread.
