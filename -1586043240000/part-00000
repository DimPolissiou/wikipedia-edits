More important objects such as [[Non-player character]]<nowiki/>s usually contain a higher amount of detail than less important objects, which are often small or in the background, like a blade of grass.

This ground color is overlaid dorsally with a series of 23-45 (mean, 36) dorsal body blotches that are dark gray-brown to brown in color.<ref>Ernst, CH; Ernst, EM. 2003. Snakes of the United States and Canada. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution.</ref> The first of these may be a pair of short stripes that extend backwards to eventually merge. Some of the first few blotches may be somewhat rectangular, but then become more hexagonal and eventually take on a distinctive diamond shape, hence the name \"diamondback rattlesnake\". The tail has two to eight (usually four to six) black bands separated by  ash white or pale gray interspaces; this led to the nickname of \"coon tail\", though other species (e.g., [[Mojave rattlesnake]]) have similarly banded tails. Its postocular stripe is smoky gray or dark gray-brown and extends diagonally from the lower edge of the eye across the side of the head. This stripe is usually bordered below by a white stripe running from the upper [[preocular scale]] down to the [[supralabial]] scales just below and behind the eye.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/> Its off-white belly is usually unmarked, its anal scale is undivided, and its dorsal scales are extremely [[keeled scales|keeled]], often in rows of 25 to 27 near the midbody.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n[[File:Crotalus atrox -Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA-29Aug2012.jpg|thumb|left|A skeleton at the [[Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma]]\nThe wide range of this species overlaps, or is close to, that of many others. It may be confused with them, but differences exist. The Mojave rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus scutulatus|C.&nbsp;scutulatus]]''), also has tail rings, but the black rings are narrow relative to the pale ones. The [[timber rattlesnake]] (''C.&nbsp;horridus''), has no tail rings. In the western rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus oreganus|C.&nbsp;oreganus]]''), the pale tail rings are the same color as the ground. The tail of the black-tailed rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus molossus|C.&nbsp;molossus]]''), is a uniform black, or has indistinct tail rings. The Mexican west coast rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus basiliscus|C.&nbsp;basiliscus]]''), also has a  mostly dark tail with obscure or absent rings. The tiger rattlesnake, (''[[Crotalus tigris|C.&nbsp;tigris]]''), has a relatively small head and large rattle along with a dorsal pattern consisting more of crossbands. The Middle American rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus simus|C.&nbsp;simus]]''), has a generally uniform gray tail without any rings, as well as a pair of distinctive paravertebral stripes running down the neck. Members of the genus ''[[Sistrurus]]'' lack tail rings and have enlarged head plates.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>\n\n==Distribution==\n===Geographic range===\nIt is found in the [[United States]] from central [[Arkansas]] to southeastern and Central [[California]], south into [[Mexico]] as far as northern [[Sinaloa]], [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] and northern [[Veracruz]]. Disjunct populations exist in southern Veracruz and southeastern [[Oaxaca]]. The [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] given is \"[[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]]\" (Indianola, [[Calhoun County, Texas]]).<ref name=\"McD99\"/>\n\nIn the United States, it occurs in central and western Arkansas, [[Oklahoma]] excluding the northeast, north-central region and the panhandle, [[Texas]] excluding the northern panhandle and the east, southern and central [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], extreme southern [[Nevada]], southwestern [[Utah]], and in southeastern California on either side of the [[Chocolate Mountains]]. Records from extreme southern [[Kansas]] ([[Cowley County, Kansas|Cowley]] and [[Sumner County, Kansas|Sumner]] Counties) may be based on a natural occurrence of the species, while multiple records from near Kanopolis Reservoir in [[Ellsworth County, Kansas|Ellsworth County]] seem to indicate a viable (although isolated) population.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>\n\nIn Mexico, it occurs in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Coahuila]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Sonora]], extreme northeastern [[Baja California]], northern [[Sinaloa]], northeastern [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]], most of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], northern Veracruz, Hidalgo, and [[Quer\u00e9taro]]. Specimens have been collected in the mountains northwest of [[Tehuantepec]], Oaxaca, on numerous occasions, but have not been reported there since the 1940s.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>\n\nThis species has also been reported on a number of islands in the [[Gulf of California]], including San Pedro M\u00e1rtir, Santa Mar\u00eda (Sinaloa), [[Tibur\u00f3n Island|T\u00edburon]] and the Turner Islands.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>The [[Tortuga Island diamond rattlesnake]] is also a subspecies.\n\n===Habitat===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nIts habitats  range from flat coastal plains to steep rocky canyons and hillsides; it is associated with many different vegetation types, including [[desert]], sandy [[Larrea tridentata|creosote]] areas, [[mesquite]] grassland, [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|desert scrub]], and pine-oak forests.   It is common to see the western diamondback on rural blacktop roads in early evening, because of the heat retention of these surfaces, as ambient temperatures drops.\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Patternless Crotalus atrox.jpg|thumb|''C. atrox'', patternless specimen]]\n\n''C. atrox'' is [[Solitary animal|solitary]] except during the mating season. Usually inactive between late October and early March, these [[ectotherm]]s occasionally may be seen basking in the sun on warm winter days. In the winter, they [[hibernation|hibernate]] or [[Brumation|brumate]] in caves or burrows, sometimes with many other species of snakes. Life expectancy is more than 20 years.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThey are poor climbers. Natural predators include [[Bird of prey|raptors]] such as hawks and eagles, [[Greater roadrunner|roadrunners]], wild hogs, and other snakes. When threatened, they usually coil and rattle to warn aggressors. They are one of the more aggressive rattlesnake species in the US in the way that they stand their ground when confronted by a foe. If rattling does not work, then the snake will strike in defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davesgarden.com/guides/articles/view/3273|title=Snakes in the Garden- the Good, the Bad and the Ugly|website=Dave's Garden}}</ref>\n\n==Prey==\nA comprehensive study by Beavers (1976) on the prey of ''C. atrox'' in Texas showed, by weight, 94.8% of their prey consisted of small mammals.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/> According to Pisani and Stephenson (1991), who conducted a study of the stomach contents of ''C. atrox'' in the fall and spring of [[Oklahoma]], mammalian prey included prairie dogs (''[[black-tailed prairie dog|Cynomys ludovicianus]]''), kangaroo rats (''[[Ord's kangaroo rat|Dipodomys ordii]]''), pocket gophers (''[[Plains pocket gopher|Geomys bursarius]]'' and ''[[Yellow-faced pocket gopher|Cratogeomys castanops]]''), voles (''[[Prairie vole|Microtus ochrogaster]]''), woodrats (''[[Eastern woodrat|Neotoma floridana]]''), pocket mice (''[[Perognathus hispidus]]'' and ''[[Perognathus flavescens|P. flavescens]]''), white-footed mice (''[[white-footed mouse|Peromyscus leucopus]]'' and ''[[Peromyscus maniculatus|P. maniculatus]]''), Old World rats and mice (''[[brown rat|Rattus norvegicus]]'' and ''[[Mus (genus)|Mus]]'' ssp.), harvest mice (''[[Western harvest mouse|Reithrodontomys megalotis]]''), [[fox squirrel]]s (''Sciurus niger''), cotton rats (''[[Hispid cotton rat|Sigmodon hispidus]]''), ground squirrels (''[[Spotted ground squirrel|Spermophilus spilosoma]]''), rabbits (''[[Eastern cottontail|Sylvilagus floridanus]]''), jackrabbits (''[[black-tailed jackrabbit|Lepus californicus]]''), and an unidentified mole species.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/> Klauber mentioned large specimens are capable of swallowing adult cottontail rabbits and even adult jackrabbits, although he figured the latter required confirmation.<ref name=\"Kla97\">Klauber LM.

One case reported by Vorhies (1948) involved a juvenile specimen that had attempted to eat a horned lizard (''[[Phrynosoma solare]]''), but died after the lizard's horns had punctured its [[esophagus]], leaving the lizard stuck there.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>\n\nHermann (1950) reported ''C. atrox'' also feeds on lubber grasshoppers (''[[Brachystola magna]]''). Klauber (1972) once found a single specimen in which the stomach contents included grasshoppers, beetles, and ants. However, mammal hairs and an [[iguanid]] lizard were also found in the same stomach, which made it more likely that the insects had first been eaten by the mammal or the lizard before they had been eaten by the snake.<ref name=\"Kla97\"/>\n\nThey hunt (or ambush prey) at night or in the early morning.\n\nThese snakes can go for up to two years without food in the wild. A 5\u00bd-month starvation study showed the snakes reduced energy expenditures by an average of 80% over the length of the study. The snakes also feed from within on energy-rich lipid stores. The most interesting finding was the snakes grew during the study, indicating while the snake's mass was shrinking, it was putting its resources into skeletal muscles and bone.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Marshall D. |last1=McCue |year=2006 |title=Characterizing the starvation syndrome in the western diamond-back rattlesnake, a species well-suited to tolerate long-term fasting |journal=The FASEB Journal |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=A827 |url=https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.20.5.a827 |lay-url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060406101718.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=April 6, 2006 |doi=10.1096/fasebj.20.5.A827 |doi-broken-date=2019-12-13 }}</ref>\n\nA key participant in the [[food chain]], it is an important predator of many small rodents, rabbits, and birds.

This ground color is overlaid dorsally with a series of 23-45 (mean, 36) dorsal body blotches that are dark gray-brown to brown in color.<ref>Ernst, CH; Ernst, EM. 2003. Snakes of the United States and Canada. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution.</ref> The first of these may be a pair of short stripes that extend backwards to eventually merge. Some of the first few blotches may be somewhat rectangular, but then become more hexagonal and eventually take on a distinctive diamond shape, hence the name \"diamondback rattlesnake\". The tail has two to eight (usually four to six) black bands separated by  ash white or pale gray interspaces; this led to the nickname of \"coon tail\", though other species (e.g., [[Mojave rattlesnake]]) have similarly banded tails. Its postocular stripe is smoky gray or dark gray-brown and extends diagonally from the lower edge of the eye across the side of the head. This stripe is usually bordered below by a white stripe running from the upper [[preocular scale]] down to the [[supralabial]] scales just below and behind the eye.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/> Its off-white belly is usually unmarked, its anal scale is undivided, and its dorsal scales are extremely [[keeled scales|keeled]], often in rows of 25 to 27 near the midbody.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n[[File:Crotalus atrox -Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA-29Aug2012.jpg|thumb|left|A skeleton at the [[Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma]]\nThe wide range of this species overlaps, or is close to, that of many others. It may be confused with them, but differences exist. The Mojave rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus scutulatus|C.&nbsp;scutulatus]]''), also has tail rings, but the black rings are narrow relative to the pale ones. The [[timber rattlesnake]] (''C.&nbsp;horridus''), has no tail rings. In the western rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus oreganus|C.&nbsp;oreganus]]''), the pale tail rings are the same color as the ground. The tail of the black-tailed rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus molossus|C.&nbsp;molossus]]''), is a uniform black, or has indistinct tail rings. The Mexican west coast rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus basiliscus|C.&nbsp;basiliscus]]''), also has a  mostly dark tail with obscure or absent rings. The tiger rattlesnake, (''[[Crotalus tigris|C.&nbsp;tigris]]''), has a relatively small head and large rattle along with a dorsal pattern consisting more of crossbands. The Middle American rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus simus|C.&nbsp;simus]]''), has a generally uniform gray tail without any rings, as well as a pair of distinctive paravertebral stripes running down the neck. Members of the genus ''[[Sistrurus]]'' lack tail rings and have enlarged head plates.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>\n\n==Distribution==\n===Geographic range===\nIt is found in the [[United States]] from central [[Arkansas]] to southeastern and Central [[California]], south into [[Mexico]] as far as northern [[Sinaloa]], [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] and northern [[Veracruz]]. Disjunct populations exist in southern Veracruz and southeastern [[Oaxaca]]. The [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] given is \"[[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]]\" (Indianola, [[Calhoun County, Texas]]).<ref name=\"McD99\"/>\n\nIn the United States, it occurs in central and western Arkansas, [[Oklahoma]] excluding the northeast, north-central region and the panhandle, [[Texas]] excluding the northern panhandle and the east, southern and central [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], extreme southern [[Nevada]], southwestern [[Utah]], and in southeastern California on either side of the [[Chocolate Mountains]]. Records from extreme southern [[Kansas]] ([[Cowley County, Kansas|Cowley]] and [[Sumner County, Kansas|Sumner]] Counties) may be based on a natural occurrence of the species, while multiple records from near Kanopolis Reservoir in [[Ellsworth County, Kansas|Ellsworth County]] seem to indicate a viable (although isolated) population.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>\n\nIn Mexico, it occurs in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Coahuila]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Sonora]], extreme northeastern [[Baja California]], northern [[Sinaloa]], northeastern [[Durango]], [[Zacatecas]], most of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], northern Veracruz, Hidalgo, and [[Quer\u00e9taro]]. Specimens have been collected in the mountains northwest of [[Tehuantepec]], Oaxaca, on numerous occasions, but have not been reported there since the 1940s.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>\n\nThis species has also been reported on a number of islands in the [[Gulf of California]], including San Pedro M\u00e1rtir, Santa Mar\u00eda (Sinaloa), [[Tibur\u00f3n Island|T\u00edburon]] and the Turner Islands.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>The [[Tortuga Island diamond rattlesnake]] is also a subspecies.\n\n===Habitat===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nIts habitats  range from flat coastal plains to steep rocky canyons and hillsides; it is associated with many different vegetation types, including [[desert]], sandy [[Larrea tridentata|creosote]] areas, [[mesquite]] grassland, [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|desert scrub]], and pine-oak forests.   It is common to see the western diamondback on rural blacktop roads in early evening, because of the heat retention of these surfaces, as ambient temperatures drops.\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Patternless Crotalus atrox.jpg|thumb|''C. atrox'', patternless specimen]]\n\n''C. atrox'' is [[Solitary animal|solitary]] except during the mating season. Usually inactive between late October and early March, these [[ectotherm]]s occasionally may be seen basking in the sun on warm winter days. In the winter, they [[hibernation|hibernate]] or [[Brumation|brumate]] in caves or burrows, sometimes with many other species of snakes. Life expectancy is more than 20 years.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThey are poor climbers. Natural predators include [[Bird of prey|raptors]] such as hawks and eagles, [[Greater roadrunner|roadrunners]], wild hogs, and other snakes. When threatened, they usually coil and rattle to warn aggressors. They are one of the more aggressive rattlesnake species in the US in the way that they stand their ground when confronted by a foe. If rattling does not work, then the snake will strike in defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davesgarden.com/guides/articles/view/3273|title=Snakes in the Garden- the Good, the Bad and the Ugly|website=Dave's Garden}}</ref>\n\n==Prey==\nA comprehensive study by Beavers (1976) on the prey of ''C. atrox'' in Texas showed, by weight, 94.8% of their prey consisted of small mammals.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/> According to Pisani and Stephenson (1991), who conducted a study of the stomach contents of ''C. atrox'' in the fall and spring of [[Oklahoma]], mammalian prey included prairie dogs (''[[black-tailed prairie dog|Cynomys ludovicianus]]''), kangaroo rats (''[[Ord's kangaroo rat|Dipodomys ordii]]''), pocket gophers (''[[Plains pocket gopher|Geomys bursarius]]'' and ''[[Yellow-faced pocket gopher|Cratogeomys castanops]]''), voles (''[[Prairie vole|Microtus ochrogaster]]''), woodrats (''[[Eastern woodrat|Neotoma floridana]]''), pocket mice (''[[Perognathus hispidus]]'' and ''[[Perognathus flavescens|P. flavescens]]''), white-footed mice (''[[white-footed mouse|Peromyscus leucopus]]'' and ''[[Peromyscus maniculatus|P. maniculatus]]''), Old World rats and mice (''[[brown rat|Rattus norvegicus]]'' and ''[[Mus (genus)|Mus]]'' ssp.), harvest mice (''[[Western harvest mouse|Reithrodontomys megalotis]]''), [[fox squirrel]]s (''Sciurus niger''), cotton rats (''[[Hispid cotton rat|Sigmodon hispidus]]''), ground squirrels (''[[Spotted ground squirrel|Spermophilus spilosoma]]''), rabbits (''[[Eastern cottontail|Sylvilagus floridanus]]''), jackrabbits (''[[black-tailed jackrabbit|Lepus californicus]]''), and an unidentified mole species.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/> Klauber mentioned large specimens are capable of swallowing adult cottontail rabbits and even adult jackrabbits, although he figured the latter required confirmation.<ref name=\"Kla97\">Klauber LM.

Avian prey include mockingbirds (''[[Mimidae]]''), [[quail]], a nearly full-grown [[Gambel's quail]], a [[burrowing owl]] (''Athene cunicularia''),<ref name=\"Kla97\"/> a fledgling [[horned lark]] (''Eremophila alpestris'') a [[black-throated sparrow]] (''Amphispiza bilineata''), and an [[eastern meadowlark]] (''Sturnella magna'').<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/> Lizard prey include a whiptail lizard (''[[Cnemidophorus]]''), spiny lizards (''[[Sceloporus]]''), a [[Texas banded gecko]] (''Coleonyx brevis''),<ref name=\"Kla97\"/> and a side-blotched lizard (''[[Uta palmeri]]''). One case reported by Vorhies (1948) involved a juvenile specimen that had attempted to eat a horned lizard (''[[Phrynosoma solare]]''), but died after the lizard's horns had punctured its [[esophagus]], leaving the lizard stuck there.<ref name=\"Nor-C&L04\"/>\n\nHermann (1950) reported ''C. atrox'' also feeds on lubber grasshoppers (''[[Brachystola magna]]''). Klauber (1972) once found a single specimen in which the stomach contents included grasshoppers, beetles, and ants. However, mammal hairs and an [[iguanid]] lizard were also found in the same stomach, which made it more likely that the insects had first been eaten by the mammal or the lizard before they had been eaten by the snake.<ref name=\"Kla97\"/>\n\nThey hunt (or ambush prey) at night or in the early morning.\n\nThese snakes can go for up to two years without food in the wild. A 5\u00bd-month starvation study showed the snakes reduced energy expenditures by an average of 80% over the length of the study. The snakes also feed from within on energy-rich lipid stores. The most interesting finding was the snakes grew during the study, indicating while the snake's mass was shrinking, it was putting its resources into skeletal muscles and bone.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Marshall D. |last1=McCue |year=2006 |title=Characterizing the starvation syndrome in the western diamond-back rattlesnake, a species well-suited to tolerate long-term fasting |journal=The FASEB Journal |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=A827 |url=https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.20.5.a827 |lay-url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060406101718.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=April 6, 2006 |doi=10.1096/fasebj.20.5.A827 |doi-broken-date=2019-12-13 }}</ref>\n\nA key participant in the [[food chain]], it is an important predator of many small rodents, rabbits, and birds.

Moses batted and threw [[Handedness#Types|left-handed]], stood {{convert|5|ft|10|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|160|lb}}. He was born in [[Uvalda, Georgia]].\n\n== Baseball career ==\n\nMoses started his professional career with Galveston of the [[Texas League]], where he batted .316 in 1934.<ref name=minors>{{cite news|title=A Moses Emerges To Aid A's|publisher=The Sporting News|page=1|date= January 3, 1935}}</ref>  He debuted with the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1935 season. He batted over .300 each of his seven years with them, with a career-best .345 in his sophomore year.\n\nMoses had by far his most productive season in 1937, when he hit career-highs in [[home run]]s (25), [[run batted in|RBI]] (86), [[run (baseball)|runs]] (113), [[hit (baseball)|hits]] (208) and [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (48), batting .320 with 13 [[triple (baseball)|triples]]. In [[1939 World Series|1939]], he missed a [[World Series]] opportunity when his trade to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for [[Benny McCoy]] was nullified by [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis|K.M. Landis]]. The verdict made several Tigers [[free agent]]s.\n\nThrough years of last place finishes with Philadelphia, Moses had little chance to display his speed on the basepaths. But in 1943, with the Chicago White Sox, he posted a career-high 56 [[stolen bases]] and co-led the [[American League]] in triples (12). A strong-armed right fielder, he led the AL in [[putout]]s (329) in 1945.\n\nIn the [[1946 World Series]] with the [[Boston Red Sox]], Moses hit .417 (5-for-12) and tied a WS record with four hits in a game. He finished his career with the Athletics in 1951.\n\nHis first 7 years with the A's (1935-1941) were the most productive in his career. Moses surpassed .300 in every season. He posted 61 home runs, 354 rbi, and hit .317 (1135-for-3580). After being traded away after the 1941 season, he never hit .300 again and his productivity declined, posting 28 home runs, 325 rbi, and batting .266 (1003-for-3776) over the next 10 seasons with the White Sox and Red Sox and the A's again. The closest he came to the .300 plateau is when he hit .295 with the White Sox in 1945. His second tenure with the A's (1949-1951) was not even close to the numbers he put up with them at the beginning of his career.\n\nIn a 17-season career, Moses hit .291 with 89 home runs and 679 RBI in 2012 [[games played]]. He added 1,124 runs, 2,138 hits, 435 doubles, 110&nbsp;triples and 174 stolen bases. His career [[fielding percentage]] was .973. A patient hitter with a good eye, Moses collected a 1.80 [[walk-to-strikeout ratio]] (821-to-457). He also made the [[MLB All-Star Game|American League All-Star]] team in 1937 and 1945.\n\n== Post career ==\nFollowing his playing career, Moses was a [[coach (baseball)|coach]] for the Athletics (1952\u201354, the A's final three seasons in [[Philadelphia]]), [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (1955\u201358), [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1959\u201360), [[New York Yankees]] (1961\u201362; 1966) and [[Detroit Tigers]] (1967\u201370), serving as both a first base coach and hitting instructor. He also was a minor league batting coach and scout for the Yankees.\n\nMoses died in [[Vidalia, Georgia]] two days after his 80th birthday.\n\nMoses was the last 20th century Athletics player with a 200-hit season.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\".\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. But the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]].

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\".\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. But the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7910-6173-6}}, p. 70.</ref> What follows is a study of terror but, more specifically, the memory of terror, as the narrator is relating events from the past.<ref>Quinn, Arthur Hobson.

Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8018-5730-9}}. p. 394</ref> The first word of the story, \"True!\", is an admission of their guilt, as well as an assurance of reliability.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\"/> This introduction also serves to gain the reader's attention.<ref>Meyers, Jeffrey.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E. Arthur. \"Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\" in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales'', edited by William L. Howarth. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc., 1971, p. 94.</ref> Their denial of insanity is based on their systematic actions and their precision, as they provide a rational explanation for irrational behavior.<ref name=\"Cleman-p70\"/> This rationality, however, is undermined by their lack of motive (\"Object there was none. Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/>\n\nThe story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\", which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J. Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-521-79727-6}}, p. 87.</ref> Poe's contemporaries may well have been reminded of the controversy over the [[insanity defense]] in the 1840s.<ref name=\"Cleman-p66\">Cleman, ''Bloom's BioCritiques'', p. 66.</ref>\n\nThe narrator claims to have a disease that causes [[Sensitivity (human)|hypersensitivity]]. A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is a removal of conscience.<ref name=\"Hoffman-p223\">Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''.

They have the ability to shoot at various frame rates including [[24p|24fps]] and a resolution of up to [[8K resolution|8K]]. The camera can be used with a Miranda DVC 802 converter. This allows the camera to output SDI, DV, and multiple HD outputs.\n\n== History and use in motion pictures ==\nIn June 1999, [[George Lucas]] announced that [[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Episode II]] of the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' Prequel Trilogy]] would be the first major motion picture to be shot 100% digitally. [[Sony]] and [[Panavision]] had teamed up to develop the High Definition 24p camera that Lucas would use to accomplish this and thus the first CineAlta camera was born: the Sony HDW-F900 (also called the [[Panavision HD-900F]] after being \"panavised\"). However, the [[science-fiction]] film ''[[Vidocq (2001 film)|Vidocq]]'' was actually the first released feature that was shot entirely with [[digital cinematography]]. Lucas held a private screening of ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' for the Atsugi Technology Center staff, and inserted a credit to specifically thank the Sony engineers at [[Atsugi, Kanagawa|Atsugi]] for the use of the HDW-F900.<ref name=F23-03 />\n\nFor ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' the more advanced Sony HDC-F950 was used, with higher resolution and better color reproduction than its predecessor. The film was cropped to a 2.40:1 aspect ratio from its native 16:9 frame. As a result, only 818 of the 1080 vertical pixels were actually used; but there is an [[anamorphic]] adaptor lens from [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], which allows shooting in 2.39:1 without losing any pixels. Manuel Huerga's ''[[Salvador (2006 film)|Salvador]]'' is the first movie shot with this adaptor.\n\n2002's ''[[Russian Ark]]'' was recorded in uncompressed high definition video using a Sony HDW-F900. The information was recorded uncompressed onto a hard disk which could hold 100 minutes, thus allowing the entire film to be shot in a single 86 minute take. This was very complicated, as in 2002 there wasn't widely available technology for high capacity hard disk-recording; even less for doing this portably, on battery power, with the camera moving inside and outside, from {{convert|-23|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|23|\u00b0C}}. Four attempts were made to complete the shot which had to be completed in one day due to the [[Hermitage Museum]] being closed for the shooting; the first three had to be interrupted due to technical faults, but the fourth attempt was completed successfully.

Now Sony's products branded as CineAlta include camera, camcorder, recorder, cinema server, and projector. \"CineAlta\" is a [[portmanteau]] of Cine, from [[cinematography]], and Alta, an Italian word for \"high\".<ref name=F23-03 />\n\n===Logo===\nThe first CineAlta logo was designed by Hiroki Oka, Chief Art Director of [[Sony CreativeWorks Corporation]], based at the [[Atsugi Technology Center]]. The twinned ribbons represent the marriage of film and videotape, arranged in a way to deliberately evoke the [[infinity symbol]], to symbolize the infinite possibilities.<ref name=F23-03>{{cite web |url=https://www.sony.net/Fun/design/activity/product/f23_03.html |title=Feature Design: \"CineAlta\" Digital Cinema Camera F23 |date=13 June 2007 |publisher=Sony |accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref> The CineAlta logo was updated by Tetsuro Sano and applied for the first time to the F65.<ref name=F65-03>{{cite web |url=https://www.sony.net/Fun/design/activity/product/f65/03.html |title=Feature Design: \"CineAlta\" Digital Cinema Camera F65 |date=11 June 2012 |publisher=Sony |accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nCineAlta cameras record onto [[Betacam#HDCAM/HDCAM SR|HDCAM]] tapes, [[XDCAM]] [[Professional Disc]]s, [[SRMemory]], or [[SxS]] flash memory cards. They have the ability to shoot at various frame rates including [[24p|24fps]] and a resolution of up to [[8K resolution|8K]]. The camera can be used with a Miranda DVC 802 converter. This allows the camera to output SDI, DV, and multiple HD outputs.\n\n== History and use in motion pictures ==\nIn June 1999, [[George Lucas]] announced that [[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Episode II]] of the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' Prequel Trilogy]] would be the first major motion picture to be shot 100% digitally. [[Sony]] and [[Panavision]] had teamed up to develop the High Definition 24p camera that Lucas would use to accomplish this and thus the first CineAlta camera was born: the Sony HDW-F900 (also called the [[Panavision HD-900F]] after being \"panavised\"). However, the [[science-fiction]] film ''[[Vidocq (2001 film)|Vidocq]]'' was actually the first released feature that was shot entirely with [[digital cinematography]]. Lucas held a private screening of ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' for the Atsugi Technology Center staff, and inserted a credit to specifically thank the Sony engineers at [[Atsugi, Kanagawa|Atsugi]] for the use of the HDW-F900.<ref name=F23-03 />\n\nFor ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' the more advanced Sony HDC-F950 was used, with higher resolution and better color reproduction than its predecessor. The film was cropped to a 2.40:1 aspect ratio from its native 16:9 frame. As a result, only 818 of the 1080 vertical pixels were actually used; but there is an [[anamorphic]] adaptor lens from [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], which allows shooting in 2.39:1 without losing any pixels. Manuel Huerga's ''[[Salvador (2006 film)|Salvador]]'' is the first movie shot with this adaptor.\n\n2002's ''[[Russian Ark]]'' was recorded in uncompressed high definition video using a Sony HDW-F900. The information was recorded uncompressed onto a hard disk which could hold 100 minutes, thus allowing the entire film to be shot in a single 86 minute take. This was very complicated, as in 2002 there wasn't widely available technology for high capacity hard disk-recording; even less for doing this portably, on battery power, with the camera moving inside and outside, from {{convert|-23|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|23|\u00b0C}}. Four attempts were made to complete the shot which had to be completed in one day due to the [[Hermitage Museum]] being closed for the shooting; the first three had to be interrupted due to technical faults, but the fourth attempt was completed successfully. Extra material on the DVD release includes a documentary on the technology used.\n\nOther notable movies that were shot with CineAlta cameras include:\n{{div col |colwidth=25em |gap=2em}}\n* ''[[All About Lily Chou-Chou]]'' (2001, shot August 2000)\n* ''[[Session 9]]'' (released 2001, shot September \u2013 October 2000)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0261983/business?ref_=tt_dt_bus| title=Session 9 Budget / Box Office / Filming Dates, IMDB| accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0261983/technical| title=Session 9 Technical Specifications, IMDB| accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/session-9-1200469568/| title=Review: 'Session 9', Variety| accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref>\n* ''[[Burning Annie]]'' (released 2007, shot February 2002)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/series/how_they_did_it/burning-annie-found-self-distribution-after-a-decade-of-catastrophes| title=MovieMaker: How They Did It 'Burning Annie'}}</ref>\n* ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' (released 2003, shot May 2001)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285823/technical| title=Once Upon a Time in Mexico Technical Specifications, IMDB| accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>\n* ''[[Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Dogville]]'' (2003)\n* [[Scacco pazzo]] (2003)\n* ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[The World (film)|The World]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Zebraman]]'' (2004)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388556/technical |title=Zebraman Technical Specifications, IMDB| accessdate=2011-08-24}}</ref>\n* ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]] (2005)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/financial/ar/2006/qfhh7c00000aksu2-att/qfhh7c00000aksvf.pdf| title=HD World: The World of High Definition, Created by Sony| format=[[Portable Document File|PDF]]| accessdate=2007-05-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070131042038/http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/financial/ar/2006/qfhh7c00000aksu2-att/qfhh7c00000aksvf.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-31}}</ref>\n* ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[U2 3D]] (2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iSvX2Mh9HIlJOpHjDRwrDbQ%3D%3D|title=Mysterious ways: U2 in 3-D concert film|first=Gregg|last=Goldstein|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2006-10-31|accessdate=2007-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829215903/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iSvX2Mh9HIlJOpHjDRwrDbQ%3D%3D|archive-date=2008-08-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* ''[[Cloverfield]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Rachel Getting Married]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Yesterday Was a Lie]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Tetro]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Public Enemies (2009 film)|Public Enemies]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Real Steel]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Just Go with It]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Shark Night 3D]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Darkest Hour (film)|The Darkest Hour]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Sanctum (film)|Sanctum]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Sunset Limited (film)|The Sunset Limited]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Mirror Mirror (film)|Mirror Mirror]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[After Earth]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[White House Down]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[The Smurfs 2]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Winter Sleep (2014 film)|Winter Sleep]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Lucy (2014 film)|Lucy]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' (2015)\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Future ===\nSony has announced on several occasions that CineAlta 4K, a 4K production suite including a 4K digital cinema camera, recorder, and production tools, is being developed.

While at UC Berkeley, Greider co-discovered [[telomerase]], a key enzyme in cancer and anemia research, along with Bret Weinstein.\n\nGreider joined Blackburn's laboratory in April 1984 looking for the enzyme that was hypothesized to add extra [[DNA bases]] to the ends of chromosomes. Without the extra bases, which are added as repeats of a six base pair motif, chromosomes are shortened during [[DNA replication]], eventually resulting in chromosome deterioration and [[senescence]] or cancer-causing chromosome fusion. Blackburn and Greider looked for the enzyme in the model organism ''[[Tetrahymena|Tetrahymena thermophila]]'', a fresh-water protozoan with a large number of telomeres.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503019102| pmid = 15928079| year = 2005| last1 = Nuzzo | first1 = R.| title = Biography of Carol W.

While at UC Berkeley, Greider co-discovered [[telomerase]], a key enzyme in cancer and anemia research, along with Blackburn.\n\nGreider joined Blackburn's laboratory in April 1984 looking for the enzyme that was hypothesized to add extra [[DNA bases]] to the ends of chromosomes. Without the extra bases, which are added as repeats of a six base pair motif, chromosomes are shortened during [[DNA replication]], eventually resulting in chromosome deterioration and [[senescence]] or cancer-causing chromosome fusion. Blackburn and Greider looked for the enzyme in the model organism ''[[Tetrahymena|Tetrahymena thermophila]]'', a fresh-water protozoan with a large number of telomeres.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503019102| pmid = 15928079| year = 2005| last1 = Nuzzo | first1 = R.| title = Biography of Carol W.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on. However, what it did do was to make me want to read the book \u2013 if only to find out what happened!\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sibley |first=Brian |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=6}}</ref> Jackson bought a tie-in paperback edition.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books. To allow the story to be clearer for viewers, Jackson takes a more [[chronology|chronological]] approach to the story than did Tolkien. During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters.<ref name=\"FOTR SEE\" />\n\nEarlier versions of the script included additional characters like Fatty Bolger, Glorfindel, Elladan, Elrohir, Erkenbrand, Imrahil and Forlong.<ref name=\"quest\">{{Cite book |author=Brian Sibley |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2006 |isbn=0-00-717558-2 |location=London |pages=329\u201387 |chapter=Quest for the Ring|author-link=Brian Sibley}}</ref> At one point, Jackson even considered reintroducing Tom Bombadil in a cameo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugEFwc5bMB8&list=PLCZgoww3m_249koI9ngypkNy5kKy3J3SX&index=70 |title=Philippa Boyens interview in Comic-Con, 2014 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> Gimli was going to swear throughout the films, and Arwen would join the Fellowship in Rohan and share a nude scene with Aragorn in the pools of the Glittering Caves.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Anything You Can Imagine |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=200\u2013203}}</ref>\n\nJackson hired long-time collaborator [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] to lead [[Weta Workshop]] on five major design elements: armour, weapons, [[prosthetic makeup]], creatures, and miniatures.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books.

Jackson has since founded his own film production company, [[Wingnut Films]], as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as ''The Lord of the Rings'' series.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.
