It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020. Commencing work on the album in early 2018, Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]], [[Stuart Price]], [[The Monsters and the Strangerz]] and others, in order to create a \"nostalgic\" [[Pop music|pop]] and [[disco]] album with influences from [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic music]], inspired by artists such as [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Moloko]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Outkast]].\n\nThe album was preceded by three singles and one promotional single. \"[[Don't Start Now (Dua Lipa song)|Don't Start Now]]\" was released on 1 November 2019, as the album's [[lead single]], attaining both critical and commercial success. The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single on 13 December 2019. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively. To promote the album, Lipa announced the [[Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production.\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter the release of ''[[Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition]]'' in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of her debut album, Lipa announced a new single titled \"[[Swan Song (song)|Swan Song]]\". On 24 January 2019, the song was released for the film ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' (2019), and was met with moderate commercial success.

It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020. Commencing work on the album in early 2018, Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]], [[Stuart Price]], [[The Monsters and the Strangerz]] and others, in order to create a \"nostalgic\" [[Pop music|pop]] and [[disco]] album with influences from [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic music]], inspired by artists such as [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Moloko]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Outkast]].\n\nThe album was preceded by three singles and one promotional single. \"[[Don't Start Now (Dua Lipa song)|Don't Start Now]]\" was released on 1 November 2019, as the album's [[lead single]], attaining both critical and commercial success. The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single on 13 December 2019. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively. To promote the album, Lipa announced the [[Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production.\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter the release of ''[[Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition]]'' in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of her debut album, Lipa announced a new single titled \"[[Swan Song (song)|Swan Song]]\".

It was released on October 25, 2019, through [[GOOD Music]] and distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album follows a [[Christianity|Christian]] theme, with West describing it as \"an expression of [[the gospel]].\" West had formed his [[Gospel music|gospel]] group the [[Sunday Service Choir]] in January 2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from West's discography. The song \"[[Water (Kanye West song)|Water]]\" was performed live prior to release by the group.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' features guest appearances from [[Clipse]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], [[Kenny G]], [[Fred Hammond]], [[Ant Clemons]], and the Sunday Service Choir. Production is included from West, [[Benny Blanco]], BoogzDaBeast, [[Francis Starlite]], [[Pi'erre Bourne]], and [[Timbaland]], among others. West quit taking medication for his [[bipolar disorder]] and began recording the album in August 2018, originally announcing it as ''Yandhi''. The album missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018 under the original title, before being delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn August 2019, West's wife [[Kim Kardashian]] reannounced ''Yandhi'' as ''Jesus Is King'', but it missed two planned release dates for late September 2019 under the new title. The final release was simultaneous with that of a [[concert film]] [[Jesus Is King (film)|of the same name]], which included a number of the tracks as part of the soundtrack. \"[[Follow God]]\" was released as the lead single in November 2019, followed by \"[[Closed on Sunday]]\" later that same month. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised it in comparison to West's previous solo album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'' and complemented the composition, while other critics expressed negative feelings towards the lyrical content and the inconsistency of ideas.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' stood as West's record-equaling ninth consecutive album to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. With the release, West became the first artist to occupy all top ten spots on the US [[Christian Songs]] and [[Billboard charts|Gospel Songs]] charts, respectively. West broke another record at the same time by being the first artist to simultaneously top five separate US charts: the ''Billboard'' 200, [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], [[Top Rap Albums]], [[List of number-one Billboard Christian Albums|Top Christian Albums]] and [[Top Gospel Albums]]. The album was a chart topper in eight other countries, including Australia and Canada, while attaining top five positions in the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. A companion album, ''[[Jesus Is Born]]'', was released in December 2019 by the Sunday Service Choir, and West's collaborative sequel album ''[[Jesus Is King Part II]]'' with [[Dr. Dre]] is slated for a future release.\n\n==Background and recording==\n===August \u2013 November 2018: ''Yandhi'', Chicago and Uganda===\nThroughout May and June 2018, five seven-track albums produced by West at his ranch in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]] were successively released as the Wyoming Sessions. [[Pusha T]]'s third studio album ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'' was released first, followed by West's eighth studio album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'', West's collaborative studio album ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'', with [[Kid Cudi]] as [[Kids See Ghosts]], [[Nas]]' twelfth studio album ''[[Nasir (album)|Nasir]]'', and [[Teyana Taylor]]'s second studio album ''[[K.T.S.E.]]''; all of the albums were released in 2018. On ''Ye'', West acknowledged his [[bipolar disorder]] diagnosis. He stopped taking his medication for the disorder in June 2018 during the rollout of the Wyoming Sessions albums.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|title=Kanye: \"6 months off meds I can feel me again\"|date=December 15, 2018|accessdate=March 11, 2019|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215215103/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|title=Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Tekashi 6ix9ine: Which Rapper Had The Worst Album Rollout Of 2018?|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=December 13, 2018|first=Bryan|last=Rolli|accessdate=September 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214123613/https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|archive-date=December 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, Chicago music artist [[Chance the Rapper]] announced that West was coming to Chicago to produce for his seven-track debut studio album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|title=Chance the Rapper Says Kanye West Is Heading to Chicago to Produce His New Album|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 12, 2018|first=Carl|last=Lamarre|accessdate=March 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714091209/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|archive-date=July 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Chance the Rapper's debut studio album ''[[The Big Day (album)|The Big Day]]'' was later released in July 2019 with no contributions from West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|title=Chance The Rapper drops ''The Big Day'', featuring everyone but Kanye West|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727021530/https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|archive-date=July 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} West was seen in the city at the end of August 2018, and simultaneously confirmed to [[Fox News]] that the two of them were recording music together.<ref name=\"August\">{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|title=Kanye West in Chicago working with Chance the Rapper|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=March 13, 2019|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|first=Alice|last=Bazerghi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829193755/https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|title=Kanye in Chicago to work on Chance the Rapper's new album|date=August 30, 2018|accessdate=September 19, 2019|magazine=Consequence of Sound|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830084551/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|archive-date=August 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> West later stated that his recording sessions with Chance the Rapper had helped the former reconnect with his roots and faith in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/december-15-2018|title=Kanye West's Road From 'Yandhi' to 'Jesus Is King'|date=August 30, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|first=Jessica|last=McKinney|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831145326/https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/|archive-date=August 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The following month, West released the collaborative single \"[[I Love It (Kanye West and Lil Pump song)|I Love It]]\" with fellow rapper [[Lil Pump]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hot97.com/news/news/kanye-west-releases-brand-new-nsfw-single-i-love-it-ft-lil-pump-video|title=Kanye West Releases Brand New NSFW Single 'I Love It' ft.

It was released on October 25, 2019, through [[GOOD Music]] and distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album follows a [[Christianity|Christian]] theme, with West describing it as \"an expression of [[the gospel]].\" West had formed his [[Gospel music|gospel]] group the [[Sunday Service Choir]] in January 2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from West's discography. The song \"[[Water (Kanye West song)|Water]]\" was performed live prior to release by the group.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' features guest appearances from [[Clipse]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], [[Kenny G]], [[Fred Hammond]], [[Ant Clemons]], and the Sunday Service Choir. Production is included from West, [[Benny Blanco]], BoogzDaBeast, [[Francis Starlite]], [[Pi'erre Bourne]], and [[Timbaland]], among others. West quit taking medication for his [[bipolar disorder]] and began recording the album in August 2018, originally announcing it as ''Yandhi''. The album missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018 under the original title, before being delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn August 2019, West's wife [[Kim Kardashian]] reannounced ''Yandhi'' as ''Jesus Is King'', but it missed two planned release dates for late September 2019 under the new title. The final release was simultaneous with that of a [[concert film]] [[Jesus Is King (film)|of the same name]], which included a number of the tracks as part of the soundtrack. \"[[Follow God]]\" was released as the lead single in November 2019, followed by \"[[Closed on Sunday]]\" later that same month. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised it in comparison to West's previous solo album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'' and complemented the composition, while other critics expressed negative feelings towards the lyrical content and the inconsistency of ideas.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' stood as West's record-equaling ninth consecutive album to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. With the release, West became the first artist to occupy all top ten spots on the US [[Christian Songs]] and [[Billboard charts|Gospel Songs]] charts, respectively. West broke another record at the same time by being the first artist to simultaneously top five separate US charts: the ''Billboard'' 200, [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], [[Top Rap Albums]], [[List of number-one Billboard Christian Albums|Top Christian Albums]] and [[Top Gospel Albums]]. The album was a chart topper in eight other countries, including Australia and Canada, while attaining top five positions in the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. A companion album, ''[[Jesus Is Born]]'', was released in December 2019 by the Sunday Service Choir, and West's collaborative sequel album ''[[Jesus Is King Part II]]'' with [[Dr. Dre]] is slated for a future release.\n\n==Background and recording==\n===August \u2013 November 2018: ''Yandhi'', Chicago and Uganda===\nThroughout May and June 2018, five seven-track albums produced by West at his ranch in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]] were successively released as the Wyoming Sessions. [[Pusha T]]'s third studio album ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'' was released first, followed by West's eighth studio album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'', West's collaborative studio album ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'', with [[Kid Cudi]] as [[Kids See Ghosts]], [[Nas]]' twelfth studio album ''[[Nasir (album)|Nasir]]'', and [[Teyana Taylor]]'s second studio album ''[[K.T.S.E.]]''; all of the albums were released in 2018. On ''Ye'', West acknowledged his [[bipolar disorder]] diagnosis. He stopped taking his medication for the disorder in June 2018 during the rollout of the Wyoming Sessions albums.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|title=Kanye: \"6 months off meds I can feel me again\"|date=December 15, 2018|accessdate=March 11, 2019|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215215103/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|title=Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Tekashi 6ix9ine: Which Rapper Had The Worst Album Rollout Of 2018?|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=December 13, 2018|first=Bryan|last=Rolli|accessdate=September 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214123613/https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|archive-date=December 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, Chicago music artist [[Chance the Rapper]] announced that West was coming to Chicago to produce for his seven-track debut studio album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|title=Chance the Rapper Says Kanye West Is Heading to Chicago to Produce His New Album|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 12, 2018|first=Carl|last=Lamarre|accessdate=March 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714091209/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|archive-date=July 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Chance the Rapper's debut studio album ''[[The Big Day (album)|The Big Day]]'' was later released in July 2019 with no contributions from West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|title=Chance The Rapper drops ''The Big Day'', featuring everyone but Kanye West|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727021530/https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|archive-date=July 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} West was seen in the city at the end of August 2018, and simultaneously confirmed to [[Fox News]] that the two of them were recording music together.<ref name=\"August\">{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|title=Kanye West in Chicago working with Chance the Rapper|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=March 13, 2019|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|first=Alice|last=Bazerghi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829193755/https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|title=Kanye in Chicago to work on Chance the Rapper's new album|date=August 30, 2018|accessdate=September 19, 2019|magazine=Consequence of Sound|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830084551/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|archive-date=August 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> West later stated that his recording sessions with Chance the Rapper had helped the former reconnect with his roots and faith in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/december-15-2018|title=Kanye West's Road From 'Yandhi' to 'Jesus Is King'|date=August 30, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|first=Jessica|last=McKinney|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831145326/https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/|archive-date=August 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The following month, West released the collaborative single \"[[I Love It (Kanye West and Lil Pump song)|I Love It]]\" with fellow rapper [[Lil Pump]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hot97.com/news/news/kanye-west-releases-brand-new-nsfw-single-i-love-it-ft-lil-pump-video|title=Kanye West Releases Brand New NSFW Single 'I Love It' ft.

The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]]. The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing the [[Russian America|colony of Alaska]] that spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted [[Alaska Purchase|its sale to the U.S.]] in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km<sup>2</sup>). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912.

It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.\n\nOn March 30, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for the sum of $7.2&nbsp;million. It was another six months before the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged. The formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. The original ceremony included 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers, who marched to the governor's house at \"Castle Hill\". Here the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as [[Alaska Day]], a legal holiday on October 18.\n\n[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the President of the United States. A federal [[United States territorial court|district court]] was headquartered in Sitka.\n\n[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the [[Chilkoot Trail]] during the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]\n\nFor most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers. They organized a \"provisional city government\", which was Alaska's first municipal government, but not in a legal sense.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Keith|chapter=Learning to cope with 'Seward's Icebox'|title=The Alaskans|url=https://archive.org/details/alaskans00time|url-access=registration|year=1977|publisher=[[Time\u2013Life Books]]|location=[[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]|isbn=978-0-8094-1506-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/alaskans00time/page/57 57\u201364]}}</ref> Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and [[Home rule#Home rule in the United States|home rule]] for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959.\n\n===Alaska as an incorporated U.S. territory===\n\n{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Territory of Alaska}}\n\nStarting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska. Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.\n[[File:US troops at the Battle of Attu.jpg|thumb|U.S. troops navigate snow and ice during the [[Battle of Attu]] in May 1943]]\n\nDuring World War II, the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] focused on [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska Island|Kiska]], all which were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref>these three Aleutian outer islands are about {{convert|460|mi|km}} away from mainland USSR, {{convert|920|mi|km}} from mainland Alaska, {{convert|950|mi|km}} from Japan.</ref> During the Japanese occupation, a white American civilian and two [[United States Navy]] personnel were killed at Attu and Kiska respectively, and nearly a total of 50 Aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in Japan.

The United States [[Lend-Lease]] program involved flying American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{See also|Alaska Statehood Act|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nStatehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska\u2014Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:1964 Alaska Quake Kodiak Before and After.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kodiak, before and after the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[Good Friday]] earthquake in 1964, destroying much of the townsite]]\n\n===Good Friday earthquake===\n\n{{Main|1964 Alaska earthquake}}\n\nOn March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides. It was the [[Largest earthquakes by magnitude|second-most-powerful earthquake]] in recorded history, with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 9.2 (more than a thousand times as powerful as the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 San Francisco earthquake]]). The time of day (5:36&nbsp;pm), time of year (spring) and location of the [[epicenter]] were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.\n\n===Discovery of oil===\n\nThe 1968 discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay]] and the 1977 completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.\n\nIn 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spilling]] more than {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline.

Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.\n\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\n\nEmployment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.\n\n===Energy===\n\n{{See also|Natural gas in Alaska|Energy law#Alaska law}}\n[[File:Alaska Pipeline Closeup Underneath.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] transports oil, Alaska's most financially important export, from the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].

It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.\n\nThe [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50&nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/|title=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|website=apfc.org|access-date=May 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520095308/http://www.apfc.org/|archive-date=May 20, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.\n\nStarting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 \"Resource Rebate\"). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |title=State of Alaska Permanent Fund Division |publisher=Pfd.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420014117/http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.\n\nThe Permanent Fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a \"[[Basic income]]\" policy in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title = Alaska's Citizens' Dividend Set To Be Near Highest Ever|url = http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/08/alaska-usa-dividend-amount-estimated-to-be-near-highest-ever/|website = BIEN|accessdate = November 3, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151103055141/http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/08/alaska-usa-dividend-amount-estimated-to-be-near-highest-ever/|archive-date = November 3, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n===Cost of living===\n\nThe cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. Federal government employees, particularly [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nRural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Agriculture and fishing===\n\n[[File:Pacific Halibut Fileting.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Halibut]], both as a sport fish and commercially, is important to the state's economy.]]\n\nDue to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.\n\nThe [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].\n\nAlaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth\u2014USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117072838/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011%2F08%2F0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630050159/http://alaskapeonies.org/ |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Heavy-lift_melon.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Monster vegetable display at the Tanana Valley State Fair 2010.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Oversized vegetables on display at the [[Alaska State Fair]] (left) and the [[Tanana Valley State Fair]] (right)\n}}\nAlaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs. However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the [[Alaska State Fair]] in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. \"Alaska Grown\" is used as an agricultural slogan.\n\nAlaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |title=Alaska Department of Fish and Game |publisher=Adfg.alaska.gov |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624202032/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |archivedate=June 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHunting for subsistence, primarily [[caribou]], [[moose]], and [[Dall sheep]] is still common in the state, particularly in remote [[The Bush (Alaska)|Bush]] communities. An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.\n\nAlaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]], where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119004453/http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |archive-date=November 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|\"Outside\"]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50\u00a2 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Fuel Gauge Report|url=http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp|publisher=Automobile Association of America|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620090230/http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http%3A%2F%2Ffuelgaugereport.opisnet.com%2Findex.asp|archive-date=June 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Retail Fuel Pricing and News|url=http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|publisher=Oil Price Information Service|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602043909/http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n\n{{Main|Transportation in Alaska}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Sterling Highway.jpg|thumb|The [[Sterling Highway]], near its intersection with the [[Seward Highway]]]]\n\n===Roads===\n\n{{See also|List of Alaska Routes}}\n[[File:Susitnabridge.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Susitna River]] bridge on the [[Denali Highway]] is {{convert|1036|ft}} long.]]\n[[File:Interstate Routes in Alaska.svg|thumb|[[List of Interstate Highways in Alaska|Alaska Interstate Highways]]]]\n\nAlaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry; this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.\n[[File:AlaskaSign.jpg|right|thumb|Alaska welcome sign on the [[Klondike Highway]]]]\n\nThe [[Interstate Highways in Alaska]] consists of a total of 1082 miles. One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], an active [[Alaska Railroad]] tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] on [[Prince William Sound]] to the [[Seward Highway]] about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Anchorage at [[Portage, Alaska|Portage]].

It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as \"The Railbelt\". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.\n\nThe railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.\n\nThe Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.\n\nIn northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''\n\nThe Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. (The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the [[Canadian National Railway]] at [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], several hundred miles to the southeast.)

The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.\n\nMany communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs.

The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.\n\nOf Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} CDPs have not been established for these areas by the [[United States Census Bureau]], except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North [[Tongass Highway]], [[Pennock Island]] and [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the [[Unorganized Borough]], in largely remote areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations.

The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the [[Anchorage Symphony Orchestra]], though the [[Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Juneau Symphony]] are also notable. The [[Anchorage Opera]] is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.\n\nThe official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of Alaska is \"[[Alaska's Flag]]\", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the [[flag of Alaska]].\n\n===Alaska in film and on television===\n\n{{see also|List of films set in Alaska}}\n[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s to stand in for wild wolves.]]\n\nAlaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was ''[[The Chechahcos]]'', produced by Alaskan businessman [[Austin E. Lathrop]] and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.\n\nOne of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as \"The Biggest Picture Ever Made\". Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up \"Camp Hollywood\" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in Hollywood to prepare meals.\n\nWhen ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history. ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.\n\nThe 1983 Disney movie ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'' was at least partially shot in Alaska.

The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into The Wild]]'', was partially filmed and set in Alaska.

The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing the [[Russian America|colony of Alaska]] that spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted [[Alaska Purchase|its sale to the U.S.]] in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km<sup>2</sup>). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912.

After his crew returned to Russia with [[sea otter]] pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.\n[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|left|The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak town]]), [[Kodiak Island]], 1814]]\n\nBetween 1774 and 1800, [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.\n\n[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]]. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.\n\nOn March 30, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for the sum of $7.2&nbsp;million. It was another six months before the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged. The formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. The original ceremony included 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers, who marched to the governor's house at \"Castle Hill\". Here the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as [[Alaska Day]], a legal holiday on October 18.\n\n[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the President of the United States. A federal [[United States territorial court|district court]] was headquartered in Sitka.\n\n[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the [[Chilkoot Trail]] during the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]\n\nFor most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers.

Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.\n[[File:US troops at the Battle of Attu.jpg|thumb|U.S. troops navigate snow and ice during the [[Battle of Attu]] in May 1943]]\n\nDuring World War II, the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] focused on [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska Island|Kiska]], all which were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref>these three Aleutian outer islands are about {{convert|460|mi|km}} away from mainland USSR, {{convert|920|mi|km}} from mainland Alaska, {{convert|950|mi|km}} from Japan.</ref> During the Japanese occupation, a white American civilian and two [[United States Navy]] personnel were killed at Attu and Kiska respectively, and nearly a total of 50 Aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in Japan.

The United States [[Lend-Lease]] program involved flying American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{See also|Alaska Statehood Act|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nStatehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska\u2014Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:1964 Alaska Quake Kodiak Before and After.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kodiak, before and after the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[Good Friday]] earthquake in 1964, destroying much of the townsite]]\n\n===Good Friday earthquake===\n\n{{Main|1964 Alaska earthquake}}\n\nOn March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides.

The time of day (5:36&nbsp;pm), time of year (spring) and location of the [[epicenter]] were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.\n\n===Discovery of oil===\n\nThe 1968 discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay]] and the 1977 completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.\n\nIn 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spilling]] more than {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline.

Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.\n\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\n\nEmployment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector.

The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900&nbsp;million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.\n\nThe [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50&nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/|title=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|website=apfc.org|access-date=May 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520095308/http://www.apfc.org/|archive-date=May 20, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.\n\nStarting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 \"Resource Rebate\").

Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.\n\nThe [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].\n\nAlaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth\u2014USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117072838/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011%2F08%2F0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630050159/http://alaskapeonies.org/ |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Heavy-lift_melon.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Monster vegetable display at the Tanana Valley State Fair 2010.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Oversized vegetables on display at the [[Alaska State Fair]] (left) and the [[Tanana Valley State Fair]] (right)\n}}\nAlaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs.

The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. \"Alaska Grown\" is used as an agricultural slogan.\n\nAlaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport.

An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.\n\nAlaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]], where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119004453/http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |archive-date=November 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|\"Outside\"]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50\u00a2 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Fuel Gauge Report|url=http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp|publisher=Automobile Association of America|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620090230/http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http%3A%2F%2Ffuelgaugereport.opisnet.com%2Findex.asp|archive-date=June 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Retail Fuel Pricing and News|url=http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|publisher=Oil Price Information Service|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602043909/http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n\n{{Main|Transportation in Alaska}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Sterling Highway.jpg|thumb|The [[Sterling Highway]], near its intersection with the [[Seward Highway]]]]\n\n===Roads===\n\n{{See also|List of Alaska Routes}}\n[[File:Susitnabridge.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Susitna River]] bridge on the [[Denali Highway]] is {{convert|1036|ft}} long.]]\n[[File:Interstate Routes in Alaska.svg|thumb|[[List of Interstate Highways in Alaska|Alaska Interstate Highways]]]]\n\nAlaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada.

It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as \"The Railbelt\". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.\n\nThe railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.\n\nThe Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.\n\nIn northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''\n\nThe Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. (The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the [[Canadian National Railway]] at [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], several hundred miles to the southeast.)

However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]].\n\nThe Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[census area]]s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the [[public record]] in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State [[recorder of deeds|Recorder]]. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nWhereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization\u2014state/county/township\u2014most of Alaska uses only two tiers\u2014state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the [[Unorganized Borough]]. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dixon|first=Mim|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=35SwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT44&lpg=PT44&dq=Fairbanks+has+a+separate+borough+(the+Fairbanks+North+Star+Borough)+and+municipality+(the+City+of+Fairbanks)&source=bl&ots=BCgI8dcgDn&sig=ACfU3U0hPQLgZ3797_mEAj69IywLKbkzkw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO5OG1o4boAhWEZxUIHRZABzMQ6AEwDnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=Fairbanks%20has%20a%20separate%20borough%20(the%20Fairbanks%20North%20Star%20Borough)%20and%20municipality%20(the%20City%20of%20Fairbanks)&f=false|title=What Happened To Fairbanks?: The Effects of the Trans-alaska Oil Pipeline on the Community Of Fairbanks, Alaska|date=September 18, 2019|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-000-01076-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAnchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian.

The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as \"[[The Bush (Alaska)|The Bush]]\" and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.\n\nOf Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} CDPs have not been established for these areas by the [[United States Census Bureau]], except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North [[Tongass Highway]], [[Pennock Island]] and [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the [[Unorganized Borough]], in largely remote areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.\n\nOne of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as \"The Biggest Picture Ever Made\". Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up \"Camp Hollywood\" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in Hollywood to prepare meals.\n\nWhen ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history. ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.\n\nThe 1983 Disney movie ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'' was at least partially shot in Alaska.

Founded as the ancient city of [[Londinium]] in the first century CE by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as capital of the Roman province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], London has been an inhabited settlement almost continuously since. After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal from Britain]] in the 5th century, the layout of the Roman settlement became the approximate blueprint of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Medieval London|medieval city]]. This ancient core of London is known as the [[City of London]] with [[Westminster]], the ancient centre of political power in London, lying to the west. Relatively few structures survive from London's medieval past due to the city's near-total destruction in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]], but notable survivors include the [[Tower of London]], [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Westminster Hall]], [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], [[St James's Palace]], [[Lambeth Palace]] and a handful of scattered [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] survivals. After the Great Fire, London was transformed as it was rebuilt and greatly modernised under the direction of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] architect [[Sir Christopher Wren]], with the new Baroque [[St Paul's Cathedral]] as its centrepiece. After a period of dramatic expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries, London reached its zenith as the world's largest and populous city from 1831 to 1925, as well as being the capital of the [[British Empire]] at its greatest extent and power. In this period London sprawled vastly beyond its historical boundaries, absorbing many formerly rural settlements and creating vast suburbs. The city was also transformed by groundbreaking new infrastructure projects like the [[West India Docks]] which affirmed London's status as a major port, a system of canals which included the [[Regent's Canal]], [[London sewerage system|a modern sewage system]], some of the world's first intercity railway termini such as [[London Paddington station|Paddington Station]], and [[London Underground|the world's first underground railway system]]. These innovations set London apart as the pre-eminent city of the [[Industrial Age|industrial age]]. After suffering significant destruction during by [[The Blitz]] of [[World War II]] and a period of economic decline in the [[History of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)|post-war]] period, London is once again a global capital of culture and commerce, with much new development adding to its eclectic cityscape.\n\nLondon contains a very wide variety of architectural styles from a variety of historical periods. London's great architectural eclecticism stems from its long history, constant redevelopment, destruction caused by [[The Blitz]] and historical government recognition of private property rights which often prevented large scale state planning. This sets London apart from other great European capitals like [[Paris]], [[Vienna]] and [[Rome]] which are more architecturally homogenous and were more rationally planned. London's eclectic architectural heritage ranges from Roman archaeological remains, the great medieval fortress the [[Tower of London]], the 13th-century gothic of [[Westminster Abbey]], the opulent [[English Baroque|baroque]] of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the elegant neoclassicism of [[Somerset House]], the urban set piece of [[Regent Street]], the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian High Gothic]] of [[St Pancras railway station]], the [[Art Deco|art deco]] [[Hoover Building]], the austere [[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]] of the [[Barbican Estate]] and the [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] skyscraper [[30 St Mary Axe]].\n\nBeing the capital of the [[United Kingdom]], London contains many of the most important buildings of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British State]], [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|The Monarchy]] and [[Church of England|The Church of England]]. These include the [[Palace of Westminster]]; the centre of British democracy, [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham Palace;]] the official residence of the British Monarchy and [[Westminster Abbey]]; the site of all coronations of English and British monarchs since 1066. London also contains numerous [[monument]]s such as the ancient heart of London at [[London Stone]], the 17th-century [[The Monument|Monument]] to the Great Fire of London, [[Marble Arch]], [[Wellington Arch]], the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is an internationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], often regarded as the centre of London.\n[[File:Westminster Abbey London 8.jpg|thumb|339x339px|[[Westminster Abbey]], a predominantly 13th-14th century [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] abbey, one of London's most significant surviving buildings from the middle ages.]]\nThroughout most of London's history, the height of buildings has been restricted. These restrictions gradually eroded in the post-war period (except those protecting certain views of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]) and high rise buildings have become ever more numerous since, particularly in the 21st century. Skyscrapers are now numerous in the [[City of London]] financial district and [[Canary Wharf]]: a new financial district created in the 1980s and 90s in the former London [[London Docklands|docklands]] area of the [[Isle of Dogs]].

In the medieval period, the city lay predominantly within the boundaries of the city walls originally built by the Romans \u2013 the area now known as [[City of London|The City of London]] \u2013 with [[Westminster]] being a separate much smaller settlement to the west. Some aristocratic houses were constructed along the [[Strand, London|Strand]] which connected the two settlements. There was also some development on the south bank of the [[River Thames|Thames]] at [[Southwark]] with the famous [[London Bridge]] connecting the district to the rest of London as well as being the gateway to the South East of England. The earliest record of [[London Bridge|London bridge]] dates from the 10th century, a structure probably built of wood, but the most famous incarnation of this bridge was constructed between 1176 and 1209. This was a stone bridge 900&nbsp;ft wide and consisting of 19 arches, complete with its own street of shops, houses, a chapel and a drawbridge in the centre to allow large boat traffic pass through.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=124}}</ref> The River Thames was an important means of transportation within the city, as well as providing access to overseas trade by sea, with many wharfs and quays built along the north bank of the river.\n\n====== Norman and Gothic Architecture ======\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| total_width = 620\n| image1 = Tower_of_London_viewed_from_the_River_Thames.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The White Tower (1080) the romanesque central keep of the tower of London complex.\n| image2 = Tower of London from the Shard (8515883950).jpg\n| caption2 = An aerial view of The Tower of London complex, which reached it's current form c.14th century\n| header = The Tower of London\n}}\nMany of medieval London's most significant structures were initially constructed by the [[Normans]], who recognised the importance of architecture as a means of demonstrating their power and of subordinating the native Saxon population after [[Norman conquest of England|their conquest of England]]. The [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] was a major turning point in the history of [[Architecture of England|English architecture]] as they brought with them a new European [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style \nand a greater architectural ambition than their [[Saxons|Saxon]] predecessors. Almost immediately after their conquest of England the Normans built several fortresses along the River Thames in the centre of the London to consolidate their power, the most notable of which being [[Baynard's Castle]] which was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]] and the [[Tower of London]] which still survives today.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=108}}</ref> The [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]], the central keep of the Tower of London complex, was completed in the 1080s and built in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]].

Completed in 1097 in the reign of [[William II of England|William II]] as a royal residence, the hall become the foundation of the [[Palace of Westminster]], a complex which gradually expanded throughout the Middle Ages. The hall was largely rebuilt in the reign of Richard II and became the largest such hall in medieval Europe. It is notable for its exceptionally wide span [[hammerbeam roof]] added in the 14th century, widely considered to be a marvel of medieval engineering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE81VeStEFg&t=311s|title=Dan Cruickshank explores the Palace of Westminster|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Miraculously [[Westminster Hall]] still survives today having escaped the fire of 1834 which destroyed the majority of the medieval Palace of Westminster; it was then incorporated into [[Charles Barry|Barry]] and [[Augustus Pugin|Pugin]]'s [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] [[Palace of Westminster]] who admired it's authentic gothic style. Other surviving examples of medieval halls in London can be found in the form of [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] (1440) which once served as London's city hall (it was greatly altered after [[Great Fire of London|the great fire]]) and the Old Hall of [[Lincoln's Inn]] (1492).\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| image1 = Towers of Westminster Abbey.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = (left) Twin Towers of the west front, c.18th century.\n| image2 = Westminster abbey.jpg\n| caption2 = (centre) North portal c.14th century.\n| image 3 = \n| image3 = London - Westminster abbey - chapter house 03.jpg\n| img_gap = 200\n| caption3 = (right) Chapter house c.14th century\n| caption_align = \n| header = Westminster Abbey\n}}\n\n[[Normans|The Normans]] also began the construction of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] on [[Ludgate Hill]], replacing a primitive [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] timber framed building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=136}}</ref> By the time of its completion in the 14th century the cathedral included elements of [[English Gothic architecture|Gothic architecture]] alongside the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] nave constructed by the Normans.

The sophisticated [[gothic architecture]] of the abbey is reminiscent of French Cathedrals like that of [[Reims Cathedral|Reims]] rather than the [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] of the period, leading to much speculation as to whether the master mason was French.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Webb|first=Geoffrey|title=Architecture of Britain in the Middle Ages|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=109}}</ref>  The most significant later addition to the abbey was the [[Henry VII Chapel]] built in the late 15th to early 16th century, an exceptional example of late [[English Gothic architecture]] notable for its highly ornate [[fan vault]]ed ceiling. The twin-towered west front of the abbey was added in the 18th century to the designs of [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] in a faithful [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] style intended to be in keeping with the rest of the medieval building. Other significant [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] churches surviving from the Middle Ages include [[Southwark Cathedral]], a former priory that was the first gothic church in London built between 1220 and 1420, as well as a handful of city churches that miraculously survived the great fire like [[St Andrew Undershaft]], [[St Helen's Church, Bishopsgate|St Helen's Bishopsgate]], [[St Olave's Church, Hart Street|St Olave's Hart Street]] and [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate]].\n\n====== Tudor Architecture ======\n[[File:Great Gate, Hampton Court Palace.jpg|thumb|290x290px|[[Hampton Court Palace]] (1515\u20131540) residence of [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] then [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]],]]A significant proportion of London's surviving architecture from the Middle Ages dates from the [[Tudor period]]. The Tudor period was a period of rapid expansion for London, both economically as a result of growing overseas trade and in terms of population which grew dramatically from roughly 50,000 in 1500 to 250,000 in 1600. As a result of this population boom the city sprawled considerably and by the end of the 16th century the majority of London's population lived outside the city walls for the first time.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Edward|title=A Guide to the Architecture of London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Henry VII and Henry VIII also commissioned a substantial number of royal works including the extension and construction of several palaces, these included the massive [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall Palace]] that stretched all the way from Westminster Hall to what is now [[Trafalgar Square]], the extravagant [[Nonsuch Palace]] in Greenwich and [[St James's Palace]] which survives today. By far the most substantial surviving Tudor palace in Greater London is [[Hampton Court Palace]], originally built for [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] and then later becoming a residence of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Greatly extended by Christopher Wren in the late 17th century, the palace still retains most of its original Tudor architecture with its original 16th-century great hall, chapel, astronomical clock and gatehouses; it is often regarded as the finest example of [[Tudor architecture|Tudor Architecture]] in England.<ref name=\":1\" /> Henry VIII also greatly influenced the current form of central London by establishing the hunting grounds of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[Green Park]] and [[St James's Park]] giving London its exceptionally green city centre which survives to this day.

[[Tudor architecture]] however is most closely associated with its distinctive vernacular houses which were typically timber framed and filled with [[wattle and daub]] giving the houses a black and white 'checkerboard' appearance. Most commercial and domestic buildings in London before [[Great Fire of London|the great fire]] resembled this from. Only a tiny handful of such buildings survive to this day including [[Staple Inn]]; an [[Inns of Chancery|Inn of Chancery]] dating back to the [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] period, 41 [[Cloth Fair]]; central London's oldest house started in 1597 and [[Prince Henry's Room]]; a timber-framed [[jettying|jettied]] townhouse built in 1610. Although the vast majority of such structures were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] many timber-framed houses did, in fact, survive until as late as the late 19th and early 20th centuries but were demolished to make way for new development.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Daview|first=Phillip|title=Lost London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> A famous example of this is the demolition of [[Wych Street]] in the Edwardian period to make way for [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]], a new road built between the [[Strand, London|Strand]] and [[High Holborn]].<gallery>\nFile:White Tower, City of London.jpg|[[White Tower (Tower of London)|The White Tower]] (1080) the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] central keep of the [[Tower of London]].\nFile:Tower of London from the Shard (8515883950).jpg|[[Tower of London|The Tower of London]] fortress complex.

The pre-eminent architect in this architectural miletstone was [[Inigo Jones]], who was appointed Surveyor of the King's Works in 1615. Having travelled around Italy and owning a copy of ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' by [[Andrea Palladio]], Jones was one of the first English architects to be firmly influenced by [[classical architecture]], both of [[Classical architecture|classical antiquity]] and the [[Neoclassical architecture|revival of the style]] epitomised by the work of Italian architect [[Andrea Palladio]] his strongest influence. His first completed major work in inner London was [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]] (1622), an extension to the mostly medieval [[Palace of Whitehall]], with a Palladian portland stone facade and a fine painted ceiling by the famous Flemish painter [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. As the first truly classical building in London \u2013 a then primitive predominantly timber-framed medieval city \u2013 it is an extremely significant building in the history of London's Architecture, described by Eric de Mare as.\n\n\"an architectural innovation that must have startled Londoners with its sophisticated Palladian Masonry, for its main fa\u00e7ades containing rhythmical rows of tall windows, carved decorations and classical pilasters, all in mathematically, carefully proportioned precision, must have seemed to them like a stage set than a building.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wren's London|last=Eric|first=De Mare|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden, London.jpg|thumb|292x292px|[[St Paul's, Covent Garden]] (1633) Indigo Jones, London's first classical church and the centre piece of Jones's Covent Garden piazza.]]\n\nAnother royal commission [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] was completed in 1633 and again shows Jones's purist [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style that did not mirror the exuberant [[Baroque]] which was then fashionable in mainland Europe. But perhaps Jones' most significant architectural commission was the redevelopment of [[Covent Garden]] in West London. In 1630 Jones was commissioned by the Earl of Bedford to redevelop the area in the west of the city with fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Between 1630 and 1633 Jones designed and constructed London's first modern square; a classical style piazza lined with colonnaded terraced houses and the [[St Paul Covent Garden|Church of St Paul]] on the Western side; the first church in London built in a classical style notable for it's monumental tuscan portico. The piazza became a blueprint for the fashionable squares built across the [[West End of London]] in the [[Georgian era]] and the [[St Paul Covent Garden|Church of St Paul]] was an architectural blueprint for the baroque [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|city churches]] built by Wren after the [[Great Fire of London]]. The outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642 greatly interrupted building activity in England and after the parliamentarian victory Jones was heavily fined due to his close connections to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He later died in poverty in 1652.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Outline of English Architecture|last=Gardner|first=A.

[[Lindsey House, Lincoln's Inn Fields|Lindsey House]] (1640) on [[Lincoln's Inn Fields|Lincolns Inn Fields]], a very early Palladian townhouse, is also possibly by Jones. Despite his short architectural career and few surviving works, Jones's introduction of classical architecture to England is one of the great milestones of English architectural history. <gallery>\nFile:Banqueting House Interior.jpg|The interior of [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] (1622).\nFile:Banqueting House 03.jpg|The painted ceiling of [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] (1622) by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Peter Rubens]].\nFile:Queens House.jpg|[[Queen's House]] (1635) by Indigo Jones.\nFile:TulipStair QueensHouse Greenwich.jpg|The Tulip Staris, [[Queen's House]] (1635) by Indigo Jones.\nFile:Queen's Chapel St James's Palace Inigo Jones.jpg|[[Queen's Chapel]] (1625) by Indigo Jones.\n</gallery>\n\n== Baroque London: The Great Fire and Christopher Wren's Reconstruction (1666\u20131714) ==\n{{See also|Baroque Architecture|Christopher Wren|List of Christopher Wren churches in London}}\n[[File:Sir Christopher Wren's plan of London as reproduced by Gwynn. Wellcome M0003248.jpg|thumb|288x288px|[[Christopher Wren]]'s rejected classical style plan for the reconstruction of London with an entirely new street plan, piazzas and wide boulevards. Despite this plan's rejection, London was still greatly modernised in its reconstruction.|alt=]]\n\nThe [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666 destroyed almost 90% of the largely medieval city, including a total of 13,500 houses, 87 parish churches, 44 [[Livery Company|Company]] Halls, the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], the [[Bridewell Palace]] and other City prisons, the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Letter Office]], and the three western city gates; [[Ludgate]], [[Newgate]], and [[Aldersgate]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Fire of London|last=Porter|first=Stephen|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Although the Great Fire is considered to be a cataclysmic event in the history of London, the enormous destruction it caused also presented a historic opportunity to completely replan and modernise the somewhat primitive, predominantly medieval city in its subsequent reconstruction. Radical classical style reconstruction plans were quickly drawn up by architects such as Christopher Wren which proposed to completely discard the city's chaotic medieval street plan in favour of a rationalised grid system with wide boulevards, piazzas and a uniform classical style for all new buildings. However, due to a shortage of labour necessary to complete such grandiose plans, complications with redistributing and compensating property that had been lost in the fire, as well as the intense urgency of rebuilding the city as quickly as possible, it was thus decided to rebuild the city around the original medieval street plan.<ref name=\":2\" /> Despite the rejection of a classical style replanning of the city, London nonetheless witnessed a radical architectural transformation in its subsequent reconstruction. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the new city compared to its predecessor was its architectural uniformity. In 1667 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] specified that all new houses were to be built to a uniform height and plot size, as well all being built of brick rather than wood to reduce fire hazard. As a result, the chaotic streets of overhanging timber-framed houses of medieval and Stuart London were replaced with neat rows of uniformly proportioned brick terraces. A good surviving example of the kind of simple brick terraces built immediately after the fire can be found at [[King's Bench Walk, London|King's Bench Walk]] in the [[Inner Temple]], becoming a blue print for the Georgian terraced house.\n\n====== St Paul's Cathedral and The City Churches ======\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = 600\n| image1 = St_Paul's_Cathedral_Dome_from_One_New_Change_-_Square_Crop.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The \t365ft (111 m) high dome of St Paul's Cathedral completed in 1710.

Much like his masterplan for the reconstruction of the city, Wren's original design for the new [[St Paul's Cathedral]] was also rejected and a compromise design had to be reached as a result. Inspired by [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basillica]] in Rome, Wren originally wanted to build a domed baroque style cathedral built in a [[Greek Cross|Greek cross]] layout, but this design was rejected by the church as a result of the excessive [[papist]] connotations of this very Southern European design.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Dlu-zVHq0&t=2307s|title=Baroque: From St Peter's to St Paul's - Part Three (Art History Documentary)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an act of compromise, the design that was eventually built is a hybrid design which utilises baroque ornamentation and a great dome but built on the Latin cross layout of the [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|former gothic cathedral]]. Largely as a result of the awkward incorporation of a Latin cross layout in a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] design, the overall composition of the cathedral is considered to be inferior to most comparable baroque cathedrals of the same period, however, the 111-metre-high dome completed in 1710 is widely considered to be one of the greatest ever built, and has since become one of London's most enduring landmarks; it was also London's tallest building from 1710 until 1962.<ref name=\":3\" /> The main west facade with its double [[corinthian order]] and fine baroque towers is another successful feature of the exterior, with a great imposing scale when viewed up [[Ludgate Hill]]. \n[[File:St Mary-le-Bow (15667683845).jpg|thumb|The tower of [[St Mary-le-Bow]] (1683) Christopher Wren, one of the finest of the City Churches.]]\nThe [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|51 city churches]] (25 of which survive today) designed by Wren and his team are also of great architectural significance. Stylistically they are very eclectic and inventive designs, that were often built on very small and limiting sites. The towers of the churches are the most architecturally notable and inventive feature of the church exteriors. Perhaps the most notable examples are the unusual tiered spire of [[St Bride's Church|St Bride's Fleet Street]] the tallest of the city churches and the famous tower of [[St Mary-le-Bow|St-Mary-le-bow]], an inventive mixture of classicism and gothic. Stylistically most of the churches are not purely baroque in their style, the most notable exception being [[St Stephen Walbrook|St Stephen's Walbrook]] with its fine domed interior.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pevsner|first=Nikolaus|title=An Outline of European Architecture|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Many of the churches such as [[St Peter upon Cornhill|St Peter Upon Cornhill]] showcase a strong influence from Dutch classicism and [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]], whereas others like [[St Mary Aldermary]] are purely [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] recreations of the former medieval churches, complete with a fan vaulted ceiling harking back to the [[English Gothic architecture|perpendicular gothic]] of the late Middle Ages. Despite the architectural merit of these individual buildings, perhaps the most significant achievement of Wren's reconstruction of St Paul's and the city churches was their overall interaction as an ensemble. Observing Canaletto's views of the [[City of London]] painted in 1750, one can see how [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] and the [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]] soar prominently above the rest of the city as a result of the tightly restricted height of all new domestic and commercial buildings in the city. The result is a highly picturesque skyline whose beauty astounded visitors to the newly reconstructed city.<ref name=\":2\" /> And so paradoxically, the great catastrophe that was the [[Great Fire of London]] can be considered in hindsight to have given a great new lease of life to London, as it gave a much-needed opportunity drastically improve and modernise the city. In the words of the architectural historian [[Simon Thurley|Dr Simon Thurley]]:\n\n\"This apparent catastrophe [...] was in reality one of the best things that ever happened to London. [...] The Great Fire of London enabled a new start - a new type of mass housing, handsome paved streets populated with modern churches and public buildings. There was a new [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], a new [[St Paul's Cathedral|Cathedral]], a rebuilt [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]]. London now was cleaner, more modern and more uniform that any other city in Europe [...] and it remained so until the mid 19th century.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|title=The Five Catastrophes That Made London - Professor Dr Simon Thurley|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZrzY0R_yz8|language=en|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref>\n\n====== Later Architectural Commissions: Royal Hospital Chelsea, Old Royal Naval College and The Commissioners Churches ======\n[[File:Christ Church exterior, Spitalfields, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|left|thumb|335x335px|[[Christ Church, Spitalfields]] (1729) showcasing the unusual style of [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]]]\n\nBut the reconstruction of London was not the only significant architectural commission of this period. [[Christopher Wren]], very much the preeminent architect of this period, was tasked with the design of two new military hospitals; the first being the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] for army veterans completed in 1692, and the latter of which being the [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]] (latterly known as the [[Old Royal Naval College]]) completed in 1712. [[Royal Hospital Chelsea|Royal Chelsea Hospital]] is one of Wren's more restrained works, with its red brick facades resembling long residential terraces. It nonetheless has a fine chapel and great hall with decorative interiors. In contrast [[Old Royal Naval College]] with its ornate Painted Hall, St Paul's Chapel and symmetrical east and west wings that frame [[Queen's House|Queens House]] by [[Inigo Jones]] is widely considered to be the crowning glory of the [[English Baroque]] movement. Now a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], the site is described as \"the finest and most dramatically sited architectural ensemble and landscape ensemble in the British Isles.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/795/|title=Maritime Greenwich, UNESCO|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOther fine examples of English Baroque in London can be found in the form of the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches|Commissioner's Churches]], 12 highly original churches that were built in response to a [[New Churches in London and Westminster Act 1710|1710 act of Parliament]] requesting the building of 50 new churches in London (the further 38 were not completed). The majority of these churches were designed by Wren's former assistant [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] who made significant contributions to the design of the [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]] and [[Old Royal Naval College]]. [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] is well known for his highly eccentric and idiosyncratic style that draws upon influences in Greek, Roman, Egyptian and even medieval architecture. Perhaps the most lauded and best known of these churches is [[Christ Church, Spitalfields]] (1729) which showcases [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor's]] trademark blend of baroque and gothic, as well his tendency to create buildings with an imposing sense of monumentality. Other Commissioner's Churches such as [[St Mary le Strand|St Mary-le-Strand]] by James Gibbs and [[St John's, Smith Square|St John's Smith Square]] by [[Thomas Archer]] are also superlative examples of late English [[Baroque architecture|Baroque Architecture]] showing a much stronger European influence than the designs of [[Christopher Wren|Wren]] or [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] whilst still maintaining a distinctly English sensibility.[[File:Old Royal Naval College 2017-08-06.jpg|thumb|1213x1213px|[[Old Royal Naval College|The Old Royal Naval College]] by [[Christopher Wren]] (1712) and [[Queen's House|Queens House]] (1635) by [[Inigo Jones]] viewed from the River Thames.]]<gallery>\nFile:PaternosterSquare-TempleBar.jpg|[[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] (1672) [[Christopher Wren]], originally on [[Fleet Street]] then moved to [[Paternoster Square]].

This great rise in prestige and wealth is reflected in London's significant growth in size and population in the 18th century. The city sprawled significantly, with substantial new development in areas in the west of the city such as [[Bloomsbury]], [[Marylebone]], [[Mayfair]] and [[Kensington]], as well as in London's Satellite villages like [[Hampstead]], [[Islington]], [[Hackney, London|Hackney]] and [[Dulwich]]<ref name=\":1\" />[[St James's|.]] This development was centred around the construction of terraces and fashionable new squares like [[Grosvenor Square]], [[Portman Square]] and [[Bedford Square]], which became the new home of the burgeoning middle classes that emerged from Britain's new mercantile economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McxRTW1vCoE|title=London's Great Estates|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As well as this, with the construction of new bridges across the Thames at [[Westminster Bridge|Westminster]] (1750) and [[Blackfriars Bridge|Blackfriars]] (1769), the first new bridges since the early Middle Ages, the city began to spread significantly south of river. The style colloquially known as 'Georgian' refers to the British interpretation of 18th-century [[neoclassical architecture]], with stylistic routes that lay firmly in [[Palladian architecture]], particularly in the writings of Scottish architect [[Colen Campbell|Colen Campell.]] Often described as the 'father of the Georgian style', [[Colen Campbell|Campell's]] highly influential book [[Colen Campbell|Vitruvius Britannicus]] set the stylistic tone for [[Architecture of England|English architecture]] for the rest of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Summerson|first=John|title=Georgian London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=74}}</ref> This more restrained style was a reaction against the exuberant [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] of the late 17th century, with a strict emphasis on plain unadorned brickwork, geometrical harmony and restrained classically inspired ornament. Despite this reactionary motive, Georgian architects nonetheless took great influence from [[Christopher Wren]] and other English Baroque architects. A precursor to the more unobtrusive Georgian style can be seen in the simple plain terraces built after the [[Great Fire of London]] at 4 [[King's Bench Walk, London|King's Bench Walk]] in [[Temple, London|Temple]] or the plain brick facades of [[Royal Hospital Chelsea|Royal Chelsea Hospital]], both by Wren. Key architects of the Georgian period who built substantial works in London include [[James Gibbs]], [[Robert Adams (architect)|Robert Adam,]] [[William Kent]] and [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]].\n\n====== The Georgian Terraced House ======\n[[File:10 Downing Street. MOD 45155532.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The front door of [[10 Downing Street]] (1734), a classic example of a Georgian porch.]]\nResidential houses of this era in London are distinctive for their sunken basement built on brick arch foundations, [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] base storey, taller [[piano nobile]] reception floor and attic storey. They are generally built from buff (pale yellow) London Stock Brick to [[golden section]] proportions, often generously spanning triple bay frontages with 'implied' columns or [[pilasters]] and carefully proportioned and very large off-white [[sash windows]], slate [[mansard]] roofs above an [[Attic style|Attic]] [[pediment]]. They were grouped in formal [[garden square]]s, [[Crescent (architecture)|crescents]] and [[Terraced house|terraces]] with wide pavements supported on brick [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s on wide, straight public streets, often with private access to [[Romanticism|romantic]]ally landscaped gardens. Later encroachment of commercial properties has significantly reduced the apparent width of historic streets in many parts of London, where the original plans were comparable to in size or in excess of those found in Continental urban planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fet.uwe.ac.uk/conweb/house_ages/flypast/print.htm |title=Domestic Architecture 1700 to 1960 |publisher=Fet.uwe.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-12-16}}</ref> The area of [[Spitalfields]] in East London has many extant early Georgian properties with some unusual continental features;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/culture/step-back-into-the-spitalfields-of-huguenots/8646533.article|title=Step back into the Spitalfields of Huguenots|first1=15|last1=April|first2=2013By James|last2=Pallister|website=Architects Journal}}</ref> [[Soho]] \u2013 particularly [[Meard Street]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols33-4/pp238-246|title=The Pitt Estate in Dean Street: Meard Street &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> and [[Westminster]] also preserve a large number of properties at an early stage of development of the style.[[File:Spencer House.jpg|thumb|298x298px|[[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]] (1756) [[John Vardy]], the grandest surviving aristocratic [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] from the Georgian period.]]\n\nA typical house was designed to accommodate a single family, with front and back rooms on each floor and a partial-width rear 'closet' wing projection. The ground floor was reserved for business, the tall ''piano nobile'' for formal entertaining, and upper storeys with family bedrooms all accessed from a stair positioned on the side party{{clarify|date=January 2020}}. Servants were accommodated in the below-ground kitchen and in attic rooms in the roof. Each of the distinctions in function was subtly indicated in the decorative scheme of the fa\u00e7ade by the sequential height of openings, projecting cornices and restrained decorative mouldings such as round-headed arches and rustication at the base and diminishing columns, sculptural capitals, [[balustrades]] and friezes expressing the top.[[File:St Martin-in-the-Fields, July 2011.jpg|thumb|366x366px|[[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (1726) by [[James Gibbs]]]]Features include:\n* A tall panelled front door with an arched [[fanlight]] often flanked by columns and covered by a pedimented canopy is reached up a short walkway which extends from the street, arching over the basement cavity and protected from burglary by a run of wrought iron security railings. \n* [[Sash windows]] which allow the window to be held open on corded lead weights to ventilate the room. Developed in [[Holland]] and first seen in the Royal Palaces, they became common in Georgian times; previously [[casement window]]s had been the norm. The sash box joinery and [[ovolo]] or [[astragal]] moulded window frames were designed to be as slim and unobtrusive as achievable, using the largest available sheets of glass in either a \"6 over 6\" or \"6 over 9\" pattern. Since the 1980s, these are often now painted in brilliant white; however this modern colour did not exist in the period: originally they were painted ivory off-white, pale yellow or other darker colours of the period.\n* Window openings in the proportion of 1:2 or the [[golden section]]; the windows were headed by the Dutch style [[flat arch]] often made from [[gauged brickwork]] in the finest properties.\n* The roof is often hidden by a [[parapet]] above an [[attic]] frieze. This was initially to reduce the spread of fire; however, in much of London, parapets were added to Georgian houses for aesthetic reasons alone. From the street, the building appears to have a flat roof, but from the rear one can see that there is a double pitched 'butterfly' roof. \n*Elevational classical adornments such as [[rustication (architecture)|rustication]], [[pilaster]]s, [[columns]], [[medallions]], [[friezes]], [[cornices]] and false [[pediments]] often formed in timber, [[stucco]] or natural stone are obvious indicators of wealth and status; however, much care and restraint was exercised to avoid the excessive flamboyance of continental architecture, with a marked preference for severe simplicity, honesty of means and sparseness of ornament in line with [[Protestant]] and neo-Palladian thinking, best exemplified by the work of [[Scottish Enlightenment]] architect [[Robert Adams (architect)|Robert Adams]] \u2013 a philosophy extended to interior furnishing by the [[Thomas Chippendale]] furniture.\n* Suburban buildings are usually constructed from [[London stock brick]], in a yellowish buff colour (which often appears grey \u2013 see [[10 Downing Street]]). More prestigious houses are rendered with [[stucco]] or built from imported natural stone.\n*Chimney breasts were located in shared party walls, with gable parapets projecting above the roof line. The great number of chimney pots on London properties indicates the relative wealth of the inhabitants, serving fireplaces in every room.[[File:Somerset House New Wing entrance.jpg|thumb|444x444px|The Western facade of [[Somerset House]] (1776) [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]]]\n\n====== The Georgian Townhouse ======\nBut Georgian houses in London did not just come in the form of simple terraces. Many much more sumptuous homes known as [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]] were built as city residences for the nobility and gentry as opposed to their [[English country house|country house]] or stately home. The grandest of the London townhouses were [[Single-family detached home|stand-alone buildings]] like [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]] but some were [[Terraced house|terraced buildings]] such as [[Chandos House]]. In the Georgian period many of these grand houses once lined [[Piccadilly]] and [[Park Lane]] but the majority of these were demolished as they went out of fashion in the late 19th and early 20th century, including the famous [[Devonshire House]] on Piccadilly. The few that do survive to this day include [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]], [[Burlington House]], [[Apsley House]], [[Chandos House]], [[Cambridge House]], Melbourne House, [[Marlborough House]] and [[Lancaster House]]. As well as this in the Greater London area a number of fine stately homes from the Georgian period can be found. These include the Palladian villa [[Chiswick House]] with its famous landscape gardens by William Kent and [[Syon House]] with its lavish interiors by [[Robert Adam]].\n\n====== Georgian Church and Civic Architecture ======\n\nAn array of notable civic, commercial and religious structures were also built in the Georgian period. Churches of the Georgian period were still very heavily influenced by the work of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]] who had pioneered the use of [[classical architecture]] in church design in England with his [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]]. But with the declining popularity of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], Georgian church design took a more restrained [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] approach than [[Christopher Wren|Wren]]. Arguably the most famous church of the period is [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (1722) by [[James Gibbs]]. Often described as the archetypal church of the Georgian period, [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] is a simple neoclassical 'temple church' with restrained Palladian ornament on its exterior and a tall spire that evokes memories of Wren's City Churches. Its format was much copied across England and abroad. [[St Peter, Vere Street]] (1722) also by [[James Gibbs]] is a further indicator of the increasing simplicity of church design in the 18th century.\n\n[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]] also dominated civic architecture in the Georgian period in London. This is exemplified by [[William Kent]]'s [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] on Whitehall (1750), an essay in the austere [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style of mid-18th century. Arguably the most significant secular architectural commission of Georgian London was [[Somerset House]], a collection of government offices on [[Strand, London|the Strand]] that was to replace a 16th-century house of the same name on the site. The resulting building was designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chamber]]<nowiki/>s and completed in 1776. The building is built in a quadrangle with a grand courtyard in the centre. On the south side of the exterior there is a grand terrace overlooking the River Thames and at ground level a watergate that would have once faced directly onto the River Thames before the construction of the [[Victoria Embankment]].\n\nNew bridges across the River Thames were also built in the Georgian period; the first bridges built in London since the early Middle Ages. These bridges included [[Westminster Bridge]] in 1750, [[Blackfriars Bridge]] in 1769 and [[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]] in 1777; all were built in a neoclassical style. With the exception of Richmond Bridge, all of these bridges have now been replaced. These bridges were highly significant as [[London Bridge]] had been the only bridge across the river for over 500 years.

This is aesthetically distinct from early Georgian architecture, though it falls within the scope of Georgian architecture and continues the stylistic trend of Neoclassicism. Technically the [[Regency era]] only lasted between 1811 and 1820, when the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] ruled as proxy for his incapacitated father George III, but the distinctive trends in art and architecture in fashion during the Regency extended roughly into the first 40 years of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book| title=Georgian London| author=Sir John Summerson| year=1945| p=135}}</ref> Regency is above all a very stringent form of Classicism, directly referencing Graeco-Roman architecture and structures.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/style/georgian.shtml| title=Architectural Style: Georgian Architecture (1740\u20131830)| publisher=buildinghistory.org| access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> Regency employed enhanced ornamentation like [[frieze]]s with high and low [[relief]] figural or vegetative motifs, statuary, urns, and porticos, all the while keeping the clean lines and symmetry of early Georgian architecture.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-regency-classicism/| title=Style Guide: Regency Classicism| publisher=vam.ac.uk| year=2016| access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> Typically Georgian features like [[sash windows]] were retained, along with first-floor balconies, which became especially popular in the Regency period, with either delicate cast iron scrollwork or traditional [[baluster]]s.<ref name=\"Matthew Weinreb 1999\">{{cite book| title=London: Portrait of a City| author=Matthew Weinreb| publisher=Phaidon| year=1999| p=218}}</ref>[[File:Athenaeum Club, London -

The most enduring legacy of this relationship is [[Buckingham Palace]], which was transformed from the modest Buckingham House of George III's reign into a grand Neoclassical palace to Nash's designs. Beginning in 1825, Nash extended the existing house westwards and added two flanking wings, which created an open forecourt, or ''[[Cour d'honneur]]'', facing [[St. James's Park]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Buckingham Palace| author=Jonathan Marsden| publisher=Royal Collection Publications| year=2011| p=18\u201320}}</ref> The style is remarkably similar to Nash's terraces on the edges of Regents Park, except that the Palace was built in golden-hued [[Bath stone]] instead of stucco-faced brick.<ref name=\"NHLE 1000795\">{{NHLE| num=1000795| desc=Buckingham Palace | accessdate=2018-07-13}}</ref> The front fa\u00e7ade of the main block features a two-storey porch of Doric columns on the bottom, tall fluted Corinthian columns above, with a pediment topped by statuary and adorned in high-relief sculpture.<ref name=\"NHLE 1000795\"/> All the hallmarks of Regency Neoclassicism also appear, including an encompassing frieze with vegetative scrollwork made of [[Coade stone]], balconies accessible from the first floor, and an attic with figural sculptures using the Elgin Marbles as their model. The west front overlooking the main garden features a bay window at its centre, with a long terrace with balustrades and large Classical urns made of Coade stone.<ref name=\"NHLE 1000795\"/> Preceding{{clarify|date=January 2020}} the forecourt was a monumental Roman arch, modelled on the ''[[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]]'' in Paris, which currently stands as the [[Marble Arch]] at the north-eastern corner of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Buckingham Palace| author=Jonathan Marsden| publisher=Royal Collection Publications| year=2011| p=27}}</ref> The addition of the East Wing early in the reign of Queen Victoria enclosed the forecourt and created the frontage of Buckingham Palace known ever since, but the bulk of the Palace exterior remains from Nash's Regency additions, particularly the long garden front on the west side.\n\nContemporaneous to Nash's building work in Regent's Park and St. James', the development of [[Belgravia]] further west offers the most uniform and extensive example of Regency architecture in London in the form of [[Belgrave Square]], [[Eaton Square]], [[Wilton Crescent]] and [[Chester Square]]. An ultra-exclusive housing development built on a formerly rural swathe of land on the [[Grosvenor Estate]], building was entrusted to [[Thomas Cubitt]] and began in 1825 with Belgrave Square; the three main squares were completed and occupied by the 1840s.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Great Houses of London| author=James Stourton| publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd.| year=2012| p=169}}</ref> Like Nash, Cubitt designed elegant Classical terraces,.

A '''Commissioners' church''', also known as a '''Waterloo church''' and '''Million Act church''', is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church built with money voted by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as a result of the [[Church Building Act]]s of 1818 and 1824. The 1818 Act supplied a grant of money and established the Church Building Commission to direct its use, and in 1824 made a further grant of money. The First Parliamentary Grant for churches amounted to \u00a31 million (equivalent to \u00a373,550,000 in 2019), which is why the 1818 Act that provided for it is sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the '''Million Pound Act'''. The Second Parliamentary Grant of 1824 amounted to an additional \u00a3500,000 (\u00a344,320,000 in 2019), so the term \"million\" cannot apply to all the churches aided by the Commission. The Commission was founded on a wave of national triumph following the defeat of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815; hence the suggestion of the word \"Waterloo\" in the title. Commissioner's churches in London include [[All Souls Church, Langham Place|All Souls, Langham Place]] by John Nash; the church's unusual circular tower was deliberately placed on a bend on Nash's Regents Street to create a picturesque view from [[Oxford Circus]], the fine neoclassical [[St Mary, Bryanston Square|St Mary's, Bryanston Square]] by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] and [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea|St Luke's, Chelsea]] one of London's first Gothic-revival churches; an indication of the shift of a style away from neoclassicism that was to occur later in the 19th century.

Critics compared London to cities like [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]], where state intervention and large scale demolition had created a more regular arrangement, with broad boulevards, panoramas and architectural uniformity.

Many buildings clustered around Georgian squares in central London were demolished and replaced, ironically enough, with Neo-Georgian edifices in near-identical styles but larger.

The development's main tower [[One Canada Square]] became the tallest building in the United Kingdom.\n\nWith the encouragement of [[Ken Livingstone]] who was [[Mayor of London]] from 2000 to 2008, a renewed trend for building tall was established in the 2000s. Following another over 10-year gap, [[8 Canada Square]] and [[25 Canada Square]], both standing at 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft), were completed at Canary Wharf in 2002. Several others of a smaller height followed at Canary Wharf including: [[Heron Quays]], [[40 Bank Street]] in 2003 at 153 metres (502&nbsp;ft), [[10 Upper Bank Street]] in 2003 at 151 metres (495&nbsp;ft), and [[25 Bank Street]] in 2004 at 153 metres (502&nbsp;ft). In the City of London, [[30 St Mary Axe]], nicknamed \"the Gherkin\" was completed in 2003 at 180 metres (590&nbsp;ft), [[Heron Tower]] in 2007 at 230 metres (750&nbsp;ft), and the [[Broadgate Tower]] in 2008 at 165 metres (541&nbsp;ft). Notably, some of the awards given to 30 St Mary Axe include the [[Emporis Skyscraper Award]] in 2003 and the [[Stirling Prize|RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture]] in 2004.\n[[File:Ayuntamiento y Shard, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 076.JPG|thumb|396x396px|(left) [[City Hall, London|City Hall]] (2002) [[Foster and Partners|Fosters and Partners]] and (right) The Shard (2012) Renzo Piano, two notable works of [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] and [[Neo-futurism|neo-futurist]] architecture.]]\n[[Boris Johnson]] who was Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016 approved the construction of more skyscrapers in London. [[The Shard]] topped out in 2012 at [[London Bridge]] and at 309.6 metres (1,016&nbsp;ft) remains London's tallest building. In 2014, the 225 metres (738&nbsp;ft) tall [[122 Leadenhall Street]], nicknamed \"the Cheesegrater\", was completed in the City of London. In September, 2016 a refit was completed of the 111m King's Reach Tower, originally built in the 1970s, which included an 11-storey height increase to bring it up to 150 metres (490&nbsp;ft) tall and it was renamed the [[South Bank Tower]]. [[One Blackfriars]], also located on the [[South Bank]], topped out in 2017 at 163 metres (535&nbsp;ft). [[The Scalpel]], at 190 metres (620&nbsp;ft) was completed in the City of London in 2018 and it was designed to protect views of St Paul's Catherdral. [[Newfoundland Quay]], at 220 metres (720&nbsp;ft) and [[Landmark Pinnacle]] at 233 metres (764&nbsp;ft) topped out in Canary Wharf in 2018 and 2019 respectively. [[One Park Drive]] at 205 metres (673&nbsp;ft) and [[South Quay Plaza]] at 215 metres (705&nbsp;ft) both also topped out at Canary Wharf in 2019. [[22 Bishopsgate]], at 278 metres (912&nbsp;ft) topped out in the City of London in 2019, after being approved by the current Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]], in 2016.\n\n[[1 Undershaft]], at 290 metres (950&nbsp;ft), also approved by Sadiq Khan in 2016, is planned to form the centrepiece of the City of London's skyscraper cluster. It is the tallest skyscraper currently proposed for London and will only be exceeded in height by The Shard. It will be built on the site of the aforementioned 1969 St Helen's building which will be demolished. [[100 Leadenhall]], at 249 metres (817&nbsp;ft), and already nicknamed the \"Cheesegrater 2\", is also planned for the City of London. [[Spire London]], at 235 metres (771&nbsp;ft) is planned for Canary Wharf. However, construction was halted after concerns that the building only had one escape stairwell for residents on the upper floors. The tallest of the two [[Riverside South (Canary Wharf)|Riverside South]] towers that have been planned for construction at Canary Wharf since 2008 would have exceeded that cluster's tallest building, One Canada Square, by 1 metre in height, but construction has been stalled since 2011. Construction has started on the 216 metres (709&nbsp;ft) tall [[Alpha Square|Consort Place]] (previously called Alpha Square) also at Canary Wharf.\n\nThere is another major skyscraper cluster emerging in the [[Vauxhall]] and [[Nine Elms]] districts of London. The first skyscraper to appear here was [[St George Wharf Tower]] at 181 metres (594&nbsp;ft) and which was completed in 2014. The tallest tower planned for this cluster is the 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft) [[One Nine Elms|One Nine Elms City Tower]]. In 2019, Sadiq Khan blocked the construction of the 290 metre tall [[Tulip (tower)|Tulip]] that would have been built in the City of London. However, in January, 2020, the developers of the tower launched an appeal against Khan's decision which is to be considered at a public inquiry in the middle of the year.<gallery>\nFile:Tower 42 looking north from Bishopsgate 2011-05-04.jpg|[[Tower 42|Natwest Tower]] \"Tower 42\" (1980)\nFile:Lloyd's insurance exterior at night.jpg|[[Lloyd's building]] (1986)\nFile:Charingcross-eye s.jpg|[[Charing Cross railway station|Charring Cross Station]] (1990) [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] \nFile:London MMB S6 Canary Wharf.jpg|[[One Canada Square]] (1991)\nFile:SIS building (26327425611).jpg|[[SIS Building]] (1996) [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]], a notable work of postmodern architecture.\nFile:British library london.jpg|[[British Library]] (1997)\nFile:No 1 Poultry (1398376326).jpg|[[No 1 Poultry|No.1 Poultry]] (1997) [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]]\nFile:O2 Arena.jpg|[[Millennium Dome|The Millennium Dome]] (1999) [[Richard Rogers]]\nFile:British Museum Great Court, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|[[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court, British Museum]] (2000) [[Foster and Partners|Fosters and Partners]]\nFile:London City Hall.jpg|[[City Hall, London]] (2002) [[Foster and Partners|Fosters and Partners]]\nFile:HSBC Building London.jpg|[[8 Canada Square]] (2002)\nFile:Citigroup EMEA Centre.jpg|[[Citigroup Centre, London|25 Canada Square]] (2003)\nFile:30 St Mary Axe from Leadenhall Street.jpg|[[30 St Mary Axe]] (2003) [[Foster and Partners]]\nFile:Wembley-STadion 2013.JPG|[[Wembley Stadium]] (2007) [[Foster and Partners]]\nFile:Heron Tower, Bishopsgate, London.JPG|[[Heron Tower]] (2007) [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]]\nFile:Willis Building (London).jpg|[[Willis Building (London)|Willis Building]] (2008) [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]\nFile:Broadgate Tower.jpg|[[Broadgate Tower]] (2008)\nFile:Orbit Tower - Aquatics Centre.jpg|[[London Aquatics Centre]] (2012)\nFile:King's Cross Western Concourse - central position - 2012-05-02.75.jpg|Concourse, [[London King's Cross railway station|Kings Cross Railway Station]] (2012)\nFile:The Shard from the Sky Garden 2015.jpg|[[The Shard]] (2012)\nFile:Cheesegrater and Gherkin.jpg|[[122 Leadenhall Street]] (2014)\nFile:St Georges Wharf Tower 2013-09-26.jpg|[[St George Wharf Tower|St George's Wharf Tower]] (2014)\nFile:Walkie-Talkie - Sept 2015.jpg|[[20 Fenchurch Street]] (2015)\nFile:Tate Modern Switch House (27633103611).jpg|[[Tate Modern|Switch House, Tate Modern]] (2016)\nFile:The Scalpel, August 2018.jpg|[[The Scalpel]] (2018)\nFile:One Blackfriars, The Shard and South Bank Tower - from Waterloo Bridge - 2019-01-04 - Afternoon.jpg|[[One Blackfriars]] (left) (2018)\nFile:22BishopsgateDec19.png|[[22 Bishopsgate]] (2019) \n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|London}}\n* [[List of tallest buildings and structures in London]]\n* [[List of demolished buildings and structures in London]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n===Sources===\n* Marianne Butler, ''London Architecture'', metropublications, 2006\n* Billings, Henrietta, ''Brutalist London Map'', [[Blue crow media|Blue Crow Media]], 2015\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Architecture of London}}\n* [http://archiseek.com/category/buildings/england/london-uk-buildings/ Architecture of London] From Archiseek.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161002021609/http://www.desarch.co.uk/projects/ Architecture of London Projects] from Design Architecture Limited\n* [https://bluecrowmedia.com/products/brutalist-london-map/ Brutalist Architecture in London] from [[Blue crow media]]\n* [https://bluecrowmedia.com/collections/architecture-maps/products/art-deco-london-map/ Art Deco Architecture in London] from [[Blue crow media]]\n\n{{Architecture of England}}\n{{London landmarks}}\n\n[[Category:London architecture| ]]\n[[Category:Architecture in the United Kingdom by city|London]]\n[[Category:History of the built environment of London]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Parliament at Sunset.JPG|thumb|right|338x338px|[[Palace of Westminster]] (1840\u201370) by [[Charles Barry]] and [[Augustus Pugin]], one of London's most iconic works of architecture and a masterpiece of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] movement.]]\n[[File:London Greenwich.JPG|thumb|339x339px|[[Queen's House|Queens House]] (1633) [[Inigo Jones|Indigo Jones]] (centre) and [[Old Royal Naval College]] (1712) Christopher Wren, a masterpiece of the [[English Baroque|English Baroque Movement]]]]\n[[London]] is the largest and capital city of [[England]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Founded as the ancient city of [[Londinium]] in the first century CE by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as capital of the Roman province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], London has been an inhabited settlement almost continuously since. After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal from Britain]] in the 5th century, the layout of the Roman settlement became the approximate blueprint of the [[Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Medieval London|medieval city]]. This ancient core of London is known as the [[City of London]] with [[Westminster]], the ancient centre of political power in London, lying to the west. Relatively few structures survive from London's medieval past due to the city's near-total destruction in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]], but notable survivors include the [[Tower of London]], [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Westminster Hall]], [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], [[St James's Palace]], [[Lambeth Palace]] and a handful of scattered [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] survivals. After the Great Fire, London was transformed as it was rebuilt and greatly modernised under the direction of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] architect [[Sir Christopher Wren]], with the new Baroque [[St Paul's Cathedral]] as its centrepiece. After a period of dramatic expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries, London reached its zenith as the world's largest and populous city from 1831 to 1925, as well as being the capital of the [[British Empire]] at its greatest extent and power. In this period London sprawled vastly beyond its historical boundaries, absorbing many formerly rural settlements and creating vast suburbs. The city was also transformed by groundbreaking new infrastructure projects like the [[West India Docks]] which affirmed London's status as a major port, a system of canals which included the [[Regent's Canal]], [[London sewerage system|a modern sewage system]], some of the world's first intercity railway termini such as [[London Paddington station|Paddington Station]], and [[London Underground|the world's first underground railway system]]. These innovations set London apart as the pre-eminent city of the [[Industrial Age|industrial age]]. After suffering significant destruction during by [[The Blitz]] of [[World War II]] and a period of economic decline in the [[History of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)|post-war]] period, London is once again a global capital of culture and commerce, with much new development adding to its eclectic cityscape.\n\n\n\nLondon contains a very wide variety of architectural styles from a variety of historical periods. London's great architectural eclecticism stems from its long history, constant redevelopment, destruction caused by [[The Blitz]] and historical government recognition of private property rights which often prevented large scale state planning. This sets London apart from other great European capitals like [[Paris]], [[Vienna]] and [[Rome]] which are more architecturally homogenous and were more rationally planned. London's eclectic architectural heritage ranges from Roman archaeological remains, the great medieval fortress the [[Tower of London]], the 13th-century gothic of [[Westminster Abbey]], the opulent [[English Baroque|baroque]] of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the elegant neoclassicism of [[Somerset House]], the urban set piece of [[Regent Street]], the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian High Gothic]] of [[St Pancras railway station]], the [[Art Deco|art deco]] [[Hoover Building]], the austere [[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]] of the [[Barbican Estate]] and the [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] skyscraper [[30 St Mary Axe]].\n\nBeing the capital of the [[United Kingdom]], London contains many of the most important buildings of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British State]], [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|The Monarchy]] and [[Church of England|The Church of England]]. These include the [[Palace of Westminster]]; the centre of British democracy, [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham Palace;]] the official residence of the British Monarchy and [[Westminster Abbey]]; the site of all coronations of English and British monarchs since 1066. London also contains numerous [[monument]]s such as the ancient heart of London at [[London Stone]], the 17th-century [[The Monument|Monument]] to the Great Fire of London, [[Marble Arch]], [[Wellington Arch]], the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is an internationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], often regarded as the centre of London.\n[[File:Westminster Abbey London 8.jpg|thumb|339x339px|[[Westminster Abbey]], a predominantly 13th-14th century [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] abbey, one of London's most significant surviving buildings from the middle ages.]]\nThroughout most of London's history, the height of buildings has been restricted. These restrictions gradually eroded in the post-war period (except those protecting certain views of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]) and high rise buildings have become ever more numerous since, particularly in the 21st century. Skyscrapers are now numerous in the [[City of London]] financial district and [[Canary Wharf]]: a new financial district created in the 1980s and 90s in the former London [[London Docklands|docklands]] area of the [[Isle of Dogs]]. Notable recent tall buildings include the 1980s skyscraper [[Tower 42]], the radical [[Lloyd's building]] by [[Richard Rogers]], [[One Canada Square]]; the centre piece of the Canary Wharf district and [[30 St Mary Axe]] (nicknamed the \"Gherkin\") which has set a precedent for other recent high-rise developments built in a similar [[High-tech architecture|high-tech style]].

But after the [[Boudica]]n Revolt of 61, when both cities were razed to the ground, the capital was removed to London, which rapidly grew to pre-eminence with the establishment of a [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]] and a provincial [[Praetorium]]. The city was originally laid out to a [[planned city|classical plan]] like many other cities in [[Britannia]] and throughout Europe, in a roughly rectangular form with the south side formed by the River Thames, and divided into blocks of [[insulae]].<ref>London Archaeology; Vol 15 Spring 2018</ref> Two east\u2013west streets (now [[Cheapside]] and [[Lower Thames Street]]) led from [[Newgate]] and [[Ludgate]] to form the [[cardo]], presumably leading to a lost gate (or gates) at the present location of the [[Tower of London]] with the road to [[Canterbury]] and [[Dover]]. An extension of Watling Street formed the [[decumanus maximus]], crossing the river from [[Billingsgate]] over the ancient [[London Bridge]] to [[Southwark]] and the south coast road beyond.

In the medieval period, the city lay predominantly within the boundaries of the city walls originally built by the Romans \u2013 the area now known as [[City of London|The City of London]] \u2013 with [[Westminster]] being a separate much smaller settlement to the west. Some aristocratic houses were constructed along the [[Strand, London|Strand]] which connected the two settlements. There was also some development on the south bank of the [[River Thames|Thames]] at [[Southwark]] with the famous [[London Bridge]] connecting the district to the rest of London as well as being the gateway to the South East of England. The earliest record of [[London Bridge|London bridge]] dates from the 10th century, a structure probably built of wood, but the most famous incarnation of this bridge was constructed between 1176 and 1209. This was a stone bridge 900&nbsp;ft wide and consisting of 19 arches, complete with its own street of shops, houses, a chapel and a drawbridge in the centre to allow large boat traffic pass through.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=124}}</ref> The River Thames was an important means of transportation within the city, as well as providing access to overseas trade by sea, with many wharfs and quays built along the north bank of the river.\n\n====== Norman and Gothic Architecture ======\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| total_width = 620\n| image1 = Tower_of_London_viewed_from_the_River_Thames.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The White Tower (1080) the romanesque central keep of the tower of London complex.\n| image2 = Tower of London from the Shard (8515883950).jpg\n| caption2 = An aerial view of The Tower of London complex, which reached it's current form c.14th century\n| header = The Tower of London\n}}\nMany of medieval London's most significant structures were initially constructed by the [[Normans]], who recognised the importance of architecture as a means of demonstrating their power and of subordinating the native Saxon population after [[Norman conquest of England|their conquest of England]]. The [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] was a major turning point in the history of [[Architecture of England|English architecture]] as they brought with them a new European [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style \nand a greater architectural ambition than their [[Saxons|Saxon]] predecessors. Almost immediately after their conquest of England the Normans built several fortresses along the River Thames in the centre of the London to consolidate their power, the most notable of which being [[Baynard's Castle]] which was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]] and the [[Tower of London]] which still survives today.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=C.H|title=The City of London - A Record of Destruction and Survival|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=108}}</ref> The [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]], the central keep of the Tower of London complex, was completed in the 1080s and built in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]].

Completed in 1097 in the reign of [[William II of England|William II]] as a royal residence, the hall become the foundation of the [[Palace of Westminster]], a complex which gradually expanded throughout the Middle Ages. The hall was largely rebuilt in the reign of Richard II and became the largest such hall in medieval Europe.

The Tudor period was a period of rapid expansion for London, both economically as a result of growing overseas trade and in terms of population which grew dramatically from roughly 50,000 in 1500 to 250,000 in 1600. As a result of this population boom the city sprawled considerably and by the end of the 16th century the majority of London's population lived outside the city walls for the first time.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Edward|title=A Guide to the Architecture of London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Henry VII and Henry VIII also commissioned a substantial number of royal works including the extension and construction of several palaces, these included the massive [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall Palace]] that stretched all the way from Westminster Hall to what is now [[Trafalgar Square]], the extravagant [[Nonsuch Palace]] in Greenwich and [[St James's Palace]] which survives today. By far the most substantial surviving Tudor palace in Greater London is [[Hampton Court Palace]], originally built for [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] and then later becoming a residence of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Greatly extended by Christopher Wren in the late 17th century, the palace still retains most of its original Tudor architecture with its original 16th-century great hall, chapel, astronomical clock and gatehouses; it is often regarded as the finest example of [[Tudor architecture|Tudor Architecture]] in England.<ref name=\":1\" /> Henry VIII also greatly influenced the current form of central London by establishing the hunting grounds of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], [[Green Park]] and [[St James's Park]] giving London its exceptionally green city centre which survives to this day.

[[Tudor architecture]] however is most closely associated with its distinctive vernacular houses which were typically timber framed and filled with [[wattle and daub]] giving the houses a black and white 'checkerboard' appearance. Most commercial and domestic buildings in London before [[Great Fire of London|the great fire]] resembled this from. Only a tiny handful of such buildings survive to this day including [[Staple Inn]]; an [[Inns of Chancery|Inn of Chancery]] dating back to the [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] period, 41 [[Cloth Fair]]; central London's oldest house started in 1597 and [[Prince Henry's Room]]; a timber-framed [[jettying|jettied]] townhouse built in 1610.

The pre-eminent architect in this architectural miletstone was [[Inigo Jones]], who was appointed Surveyor of the King's Works in 1615. Having travelled around Italy and owning a copy of ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' by [[Andrea Palladio]], Jones was one of the first English architects to be firmly influenced by [[classical architecture]], both of [[Classical architecture|classical antiquity]] and the [[Neoclassical architecture|revival of the style]] epitomised by the work of Italian architect [[Andrea Palladio]] his strongest influence. His first completed major work in inner London was [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]] (1622), an extension to the mostly medieval [[Palace of Whitehall]], with a Palladian portland stone facade and a fine painted ceiling by the famous Flemish painter [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. As the first truly classical building in London \u2013 a then primitive predominantly timber-framed medieval city \u2013 it is an extremely significant building in the history of London's Architecture, described by Eric de Mare as.\n\n\"an architectural innovation that must have startled Londoners with its sophisticated Palladian Masonry, for its main fa\u00e7ades containing rhythmical rows of tall windows, carved decorations and classical pilasters, all in mathematically, carefully proportioned precision, must have seemed to them like a stage set than a building.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wren's London|last=Eric|first=De Mare|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden, London.jpg|thumb|292x292px|[[St Paul's, Covent Garden]] (1633) Indigo Jones, London's first classical church and the centre piece of Jones's Covent Garden piazza.]]\n\nAnother royal commission [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] was completed in 1633 and again shows Jones's purist [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style that did not mirror the exuberant [[Baroque]] which was then fashionable in mainland Europe. But perhaps Jones' most significant architectural commission was the redevelopment of [[Covent Garden]] in West London. In 1630 Jones was commissioned by the Earl of Bedford to redevelop the area in the west of the city with fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Between 1630 and 1633 Jones designed and constructed London's first modern square; a classical style piazza lined with colonnaded terraced houses and the [[St Paul Covent Garden|Church of St Paul]] on the Western side; the first church in London built in a classical style notable for it's monumental tuscan portico. The piazza became a blueprint for the fashionable squares built across the [[West End of London]] in the [[Georgian era]] and the [[St Paul Covent Garden|Church of St Paul]] was an architectural blueprint for the baroque [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|city churches]] built by Wren after the [[Great Fire of London]]. The outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642 greatly interrupted building activity in England and after the parliamentarian victory Jones was heavily fined due to his close connections to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He later died in poverty in 1652.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Outline of English Architecture|last=Gardner|first=A.

Despite this plan's rejection, London was still greatly modernised in its reconstruction.|alt=]]\n\nThe [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666 destroyed almost 90% of the largely medieval city, including a total of 13,500 houses, 87 parish churches, 44 [[Livery Company|Company]] Halls, the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], the [[Bridewell Palace]] and other City prisons, the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Letter Office]], and the three western city gates; [[Ludgate]], [[Newgate]], and [[Aldersgate]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Fire of London|last=Porter|first=Stephen|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Although the Great Fire is considered to be a cataclysmic event in the history of London, the enormous destruction it caused also presented a historic opportunity to completely replan and modernise the somewhat primitive, predominantly medieval city in its subsequent reconstruction. Radical classical style reconstruction plans were quickly drawn up by architects such as Christopher Wren which proposed to completely discard the city's chaotic medieval street plan in favour of a rationalised grid system with wide boulevards, piazzas and a uniform classical style for all new buildings. However, due to a shortage of labour necessary to complete such grandiose plans, complications with redistributing and compensating property that had been lost in the fire, as well as the intense urgency of rebuilding the city as quickly as possible, it was thus decided to rebuild the city around the original medieval street plan.<ref name=\":2\" /> Despite the rejection of a classical style replanning of the city, London nonetheless witnessed a radical architectural transformation in its subsequent reconstruction. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the new city compared to its predecessor was its architectural uniformity. In 1667 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] specified that all new houses were to be built to a uniform height and plot size, as well all being built of brick rather than wood to reduce fire hazard. As a result, the chaotic streets of overhanging timber-framed houses of medieval and Stuart London were replaced with neat rows of uniformly proportioned brick terraces. A good surviving example of the kind of simple brick terraces built immediately after the fire can be found at [[King's Bench Walk, London|King's Bench Walk]] in the [[Inner Temple]], becoming a blue print for the Georgian terraced house.\n\n====== St Paul's Cathedral and The City Churches ======\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = 600\n| image1 = St_Paul's_Cathedral_Dome_from_One_New_Change_-_Square_Crop.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The \t365ft (111 m) high dome of St Paul's Cathedral completed in 1710.

Much like his masterplan for the reconstruction of the city, Wren's original design for the new [[St Paul's Cathedral]] was also rejected and a compromise design had to be reached as a result. Inspired by [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basillica]] in Rome, Wren originally wanted to build a domed baroque style cathedral built in a [[Greek Cross|Greek cross]] layout, but this design was rejected by the church as a result of the excessive [[papist]] connotations of this very Southern European design.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Dlu-zVHq0&t=2307s|title=Baroque: From St Peter's to St Paul's - Part Three (Art History Documentary)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an act of compromise, the design that was eventually built is a hybrid design which utilises baroque ornamentation and a great dome but built on the Latin cross layout of the [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|former gothic cathedral]]. Largely as a result of the awkward incorporation of a Latin cross layout in a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] design, the overall composition of the cathedral is considered to be inferior to most comparable baroque cathedrals of the same period, however, the 111-metre-high dome completed in 1710 is widely considered to be one of the greatest ever built, and has since become one of London's most enduring landmarks; it was also London's tallest building from 1710 until 1962.<ref name=\":3\" /> The main west facade with its double [[corinthian order]] and fine baroque towers is another successful feature of the exterior, with a great imposing scale when viewed up [[Ludgate Hill]]. \n[[File:St Mary-le-Bow (15667683845).jpg|thumb|The tower of [[St Mary-le-Bow]] (1683) Christopher Wren, one of the finest of the City Churches.]]\nThe [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|51 city churches]] (25 of which survive today) designed by Wren and his team are also of great architectural significance. Stylistically they are very eclectic and inventive designs, that were often built on very small and limiting sites. The towers of the churches are the most architecturally notable and inventive feature of the church exteriors. Perhaps the most notable examples are the unusual tiered spire of [[St Bride's Church|St Bride's Fleet Street]] the tallest of the city churches and the famous tower of [[St Mary-le-Bow|St-Mary-le-bow]], an inventive mixture of classicism and gothic. Stylistically most of the churches are not purely baroque in their style, the most notable exception being [[St Stephen Walbrook|St Stephen's Walbrook]] with its fine domed interior.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pevsner|first=Nikolaus|title=An Outline of European Architecture|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Many of the churches such as [[St Peter upon Cornhill|St Peter Upon Cornhill]] showcase a strong influence from Dutch classicism and [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]], whereas others like [[St Mary Aldermary]] are purely [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] recreations of the former medieval churches, complete with a fan vaulted ceiling harking back to the [[English Gothic architecture|perpendicular gothic]] of the late Middle Ages. Despite the architectural merit of these individual buildings, perhaps the most significant achievement of Wren's reconstruction of St Paul's and the city churches was their overall interaction as an ensemble. Observing Canaletto's views of the [[City of London]] painted in 1750, one can see how [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] and the [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]] soar prominently above the rest of the city as a result of the tightly restricted height of all new domestic and commercial buildings in the city. The result is a highly picturesque skyline whose beauty astounded visitors to the newly reconstructed city.<ref name=\":2\" /> And so paradoxically, the great catastrophe that was the [[Great Fire of London]] can be considered in hindsight to have given a great new lease of life to London, as it gave a much-needed opportunity drastically improve and modernise the city. In the words of the architectural historian [[Simon Thurley|Dr Simon Thurley]]:\n\n\"This apparent catastrophe [...] was in reality one of the best things that ever happened to London. [...] The Great Fire of London enabled a new start - a new type of mass housing, handsome paved streets populated with modern churches and public buildings. There was a new [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], a new [[St Paul's Cathedral|Cathedral]], a rebuilt [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]].

[[Christopher Wren]], very much the preeminent architect of this period, was tasked with the design of two new military hospitals; the first being the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] for army veterans completed in 1692, and the latter of which being the [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]] (latterly known as the [[Old Royal Naval College]]) completed in 1712. [[Royal Hospital Chelsea|Royal Chelsea Hospital]] is one of Wren's more restrained works, with its red brick facades resembling long residential terraces. It nonetheless has a fine chapel and great hall with decorative interiors. In contrast [[Old Royal Naval College]] with its ornate Painted Hall, St Paul's Chapel and symmetrical east and west wings that frame [[Queen's House|Queens House]] by [[Inigo Jones]] is widely considered to be the crowning glory of the [[English Baroque]] movement. Now a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], the site is described as \"the finest and most dramatically sited architectural ensemble and landscape ensemble in the British Isles.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/795/|title=Maritime Greenwich, UNESCO|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOther fine examples of English Baroque in London can be found in the form of the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches|Commissioner's Churches]], 12 highly original churches that were built in response to a [[New Churches in London and Westminster Act 1710|1710 act of Parliament]] requesting the building of 50 new churches in London (the further 38 were not completed). The majority of these churches were designed by Wren's former assistant [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] who made significant contributions to the design of the [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]] and [[Old Royal Naval College]]. [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] is well known for his highly eccentric and idiosyncratic style that draws upon influences in Greek, Roman, Egyptian and even medieval architecture. Perhaps the most lauded and best known of these churches is [[Christ Church, Spitalfields]] (1729) which showcases [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor's]] trademark blend of baroque and gothic, as well his tendency to create buildings with an imposing sense of monumentality. Other Commissioner's Churches such as [[St Mary le Strand|St Mary-le-Strand]] by James Gibbs and [[St John's, Smith Square|St John's Smith Square]] by [[Thomas Archer]] are also superlative examples of late English [[Baroque architecture|Baroque Architecture]] showing a much stronger European influence than the designs of [[Christopher Wren|Wren]] or [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]] whilst still maintaining a distinctly English sensibility.[[File:Old Royal Naval College 2017-08-06.jpg|thumb|1213x1213px|[[Old Royal Naval College|The Old Royal Naval College]] by [[Christopher Wren]] (1712) and [[Queen's House|Queens House]] (1635) by [[Inigo Jones]] viewed from the River Thames.]]<gallery>\nFile:PaternosterSquare-TempleBar.jpg|[[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] (1672) [[Christopher Wren]], originally on [[Fleet Street]] then moved to [[Paternoster Square]].

This great rise in prestige and wealth is reflected in London's significant growth in size and population in the 18th century. The city sprawled significantly, with substantial new development in areas in the west of the city such as [[Bloomsbury]], [[Marylebone]], [[Mayfair]] and [[Kensington]], as well as in London's Satellite villages like [[Hampstead]], [[Islington]], [[Hackney, London|Hackney]] and [[Dulwich]]<ref name=\":1\" />[[St James's|.]] This development was centred around the construction of terraces and fashionable new squares like [[Grosvenor Square]], [[Portman Square]] and [[Bedford Square]], which became the new home of the burgeoning middle classes that emerged from Britain's new mercantile economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McxRTW1vCoE|title=London's Great Estates|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As well as this, with the construction of new bridges across the Thames at [[Westminster Bridge|Westminster]] (1750) and [[Blackfriars Bridge|Blackfriars]] (1769), the first new bridges since the early Middle Ages, the city began to spread significantly south of river. The style colloquially known as 'Georgian' refers to the British interpretation of 18th-century [[neoclassical architecture]], with stylistic routes that lay firmly in [[Palladian architecture]], particularly in the writings of Scottish architect [[Colen Campbell|Colen Campell.]] Often described as the 'father of the Georgian style', [[Colen Campbell|Campell's]] highly influential book [[Colen Campbell|Vitruvius Britannicus]] set the stylistic tone for [[Architecture of England|English architecture]] for the rest of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Summerson|first=John|title=Georgian London|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=74}}</ref> This more restrained style was a reaction against the exuberant [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] of the late 17th century, with a strict emphasis on plain unadorned brickwork, geometrical harmony and restrained classically inspired ornament. Despite this reactionary motive, Georgian architects nonetheless took great influence from [[Christopher Wren]] and other English Baroque architects. A precursor to the more unobtrusive Georgian style can be seen in the simple plain terraces built after the [[Great Fire of London]] at 4 [[King's Bench Walk, London|King's Bench Walk]] in [[Temple, London|Temple]] or the plain brick facades of [[Royal Hospital Chelsea|Royal Chelsea Hospital]], both by Wren. Key architects of the Georgian period who built substantial works in London include [[James Gibbs]], [[Robert Adams (architect)|Robert Adam,]] [[William Kent]] and [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]].\n\n====== The Georgian Terraced House ======\n[[File:10 Downing Street.

They are generally built from buff (pale yellow) London Stock Brick to [[golden section]] proportions, often generously spanning triple bay frontages with 'implied' columns or [[pilasters]] and carefully proportioned and very large off-white [[sash windows]], slate [[mansard]] roofs above an [[Attic style|Attic]] [[pediment]]. They were grouped in formal [[garden square]]s, [[Crescent (architecture)|crescents]] and [[Terraced house|terraces]] with wide pavements supported on brick [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s on wide, straight public streets, often with private access to [[Romanticism|romantic]]ally landscaped gardens. Later encroachment of commercial properties has significantly reduced the apparent width of historic streets in many parts of London, where the original plans were comparable to in size or in excess of those found in Continental urban planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fet.uwe.ac.uk/conweb/house_ages/flypast/print.htm |title=Domestic Architecture 1700 to 1960 |publisher=Fet.uwe.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-12-16}}</ref> The area of [[Spitalfields]] in East London has many extant early Georgian properties with some unusual continental features;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/culture/step-back-into-the-spitalfields-of-huguenots/8646533.article|title=Step back into the Spitalfields of Huguenots|first1=15|last1=April|first2=2013By James|last2=Pallister|website=Architects Journal}}</ref> [[Soho]] \u2013 particularly [[Meard Street]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols33-4/pp238-246|title=The Pitt Estate in Dean Street: Meard Street &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> and [[Westminster]] also preserve a large number of properties at an early stage of development of the style.[[File:Spencer House.jpg|thumb|298x298px|[[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]] (1756) [[John Vardy]], the grandest surviving aristocratic [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] from the Georgian period.]]\n\nA typical house was designed to accommodate a single family, with front and back rooms on each floor and a partial-width rear 'closet' wing projection. The ground floor was reserved for business, the tall ''piano nobile'' for formal entertaining, and upper storeys with family bedrooms all accessed from a stair positioned on the side party{{clarify|date=January 2020}}. Servants were accommodated in the below-ground kitchen and in attic rooms in the roof. Each of the distinctions in function was subtly indicated in the decorative scheme of the fa\u00e7ade by the sequential height of openings, projecting cornices and restrained decorative mouldings such as round-headed arches and rustication at the base and diminishing columns, sculptural capitals, [[balustrades]] and friezes expressing the top.[[File:St Martin-in-the-Fields, July 2011.jpg|thumb|366x366px|[[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (1726) by [[James Gibbs]]]]Features include:\n* A tall panelled front door with an arched [[fanlight]] often flanked by columns and covered by a pedimented canopy is reached up a short walkway which extends from the street, arching over the basement cavity and protected from burglary by a run of wrought iron security railings. \n* [[Sash windows]] which allow the window to be held open on corded lead weights to ventilate the room. Developed in [[Holland]] and first seen in the Royal Palaces, they became common in Georgian times; previously [[casement window]]s had been the norm. The sash box joinery and [[ovolo]] or [[astragal]] moulded window frames were designed to be as slim and unobtrusive as achievable, using the largest available sheets of glass in either a \"6 over 6\" or \"6 over 9\" pattern. Since the 1980s, these are often now painted in brilliant white; however this modern colour did not exist in the period: originally they were painted ivory off-white, pale yellow or other darker colours of the period.\n* Window openings in the proportion of 1:2 or the [[golden section]]; the windows were headed by the Dutch style [[flat arch]] often made from [[gauged brickwork]] in the finest properties.\n* The roof is often hidden by a [[parapet]] above an [[attic]] frieze. This was initially to reduce the spread of fire; however, in much of London, parapets were added to Georgian houses for aesthetic reasons alone. From the street, the building appears to have a flat roof, but from the rear one can see that there is a double pitched 'butterfly' roof. \n*Elevational classical adornments such as [[rustication (architecture)|rustication]], [[pilaster]]s, [[columns]], [[medallions]], [[friezes]], [[cornices]] and false [[pediments]] often formed in timber, [[stucco]] or natural stone are obvious indicators of wealth and status; however, much care and restraint was exercised to avoid the excessive flamboyance of continental architecture, with a marked preference for severe simplicity, honesty of means and sparseness of ornament in line with [[Protestant]] and neo-Palladian thinking, best exemplified by the work of [[Scottish Enlightenment]] architect [[Robert Adams (architect)|Robert Adams]] \u2013 a philosophy extended to interior furnishing by the [[Thomas Chippendale]] furniture.\n* Suburban buildings are usually constructed from [[London stock brick]], in a yellowish buff colour (which often appears grey \u2013 see [[10 Downing Street]]). More prestigious houses are rendered with [[stucco]] or built from imported natural stone.\n*Chimney breasts were located in shared party walls, with gable parapets projecting above the roof line. The great number of chimney pots on London properties indicates the relative wealth of the inhabitants, serving fireplaces in every room.[[File:Somerset House New Wing entrance.jpg|thumb|444x444px|The Western facade of [[Somerset House]] (1776) [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]]]\n\n====== The Georgian Townhouse ======\nBut Georgian houses in London did not just come in the form of simple terraces. Many much more sumptuous homes known as [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]] were built as city residences for the nobility and gentry as opposed to their [[English country house|country house]] or stately home. The grandest of the London townhouses were [[Single-family detached home|stand-alone buildings]] like [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]] but some were [[Terraced house|terraced buildings]] such as [[Chandos House]]. In the Georgian period many of these grand houses once lined [[Piccadilly]] and [[Park Lane]] but the majority of these were demolished as they went out of fashion in the late 19th and early 20th century, including the famous [[Devonshire House]] on Piccadilly. The few that do survive to this day include [[Spencer House, London|Spencer House]], [[Burlington House]], [[Apsley House]], [[Chandos House]], [[Cambridge House]], Melbourne House, [[Marlborough House]] and [[Lancaster House]]. As well as this in the Greater London area a number of fine stately homes from the Georgian period can be found. These include the Palladian villa [[Chiswick House]] with its famous landscape gardens by William Kent and [[Syon House]] with its lavish interiors by [[Robert Adam]].\n\n====== Georgian Church and Civic Architecture ======\n\nAn array of notable civic, commercial and religious structures were also built in the Georgian period. Churches of the Georgian period were still very heavily influenced by the work of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]] who had pioneered the use of [[classical architecture]] in church design in England with his [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|City Churches]]. But with the declining popularity of the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]], Georgian church design took a more restrained [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] approach than [[Christopher Wren|Wren]]. Arguably the most famous church of the period is [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (1722) by [[James Gibbs]]. Often described as the archetypal church of the Georgian period, [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] is a simple neoclassical 'temple church' with restrained Palladian ornament on its exterior and a tall spire that evokes memories of Wren's City Churches. Its format was much copied across England and abroad. [[St Peter, Vere Street]] (1722) also by [[James Gibbs]] is a further indicator of the increasing simplicity of church design in the 18th century.\n\n[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]] also dominated civic architecture in the Georgian period in London. This is exemplified by [[William Kent]]'s [[Horse Guards (building)|Horse Guards]] on Whitehall (1750), an essay in the austere [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style of mid-18th century. Arguably the most significant secular architectural commission of Georgian London was [[Somerset House]], a collection of government offices on [[Strand, London|the Strand]] that was to replace a 16th-century house of the same name on the site. The resulting building was designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chamber]]<nowiki/>s and completed in 1776. The building is built in a quadrangle with a grand courtyard in the centre. On the south side of the exterior there is a grand terrace overlooking the River Thames and at ground level a watergate that would have once faced directly onto the River Thames before the construction of the [[Victoria Embankment]].\n\nNew bridges across the River Thames were also built in the Georgian period; the first bridges built in London since the early Middle Ages. These bridges included [[Westminster Bridge]] in 1750, [[Blackfriars Bridge]] in 1769 and [[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]] in 1777; all were built in a neoclassical style. With the exception of Richmond Bridge, all of these bridges have now been replaced. These bridges were highly significant as [[London Bridge]] had been the only bridge across the river for over 500 years. Their construction greatly encouraged development south of the river.<gallery>\nFile:Queen Anne's Gate 01.JPG|[[Queen Anne's Gate]], Westminster (1701).

This is aesthetically distinct from early Georgian architecture, though it falls within the scope of Georgian architecture and continues the stylistic trend of Neoclassicism.

The west front overlooking the main garden features a bay window at its centre, with a long terrace with balustrades and large Classical urns made of Coade stone.<ref name=\"NHLE 1000795\"/> Preceding{{clarify|date=January 2020}} the forecourt was a monumental Roman arch, modelled on the ''[[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]]'' in Paris, which currently stands as the [[Marble Arch]] at the north-eastern corner of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Buckingham Palace| author=Jonathan Marsden| publisher=Royal Collection Publications| year=2011| p=27}}</ref> The addition of the East Wing early in the reign of Queen Victoria enclosed the forecourt and created the frontage of Buckingham Palace known ever since, but the bulk of the Palace exterior remains from Nash's Regency additions, particularly the long garden front on the west side.\n\nContemporaneous to Nash's building work in Regent's Park and St. James', the development of [[Belgravia]] further west offers the most uniform and extensive example of Regency architecture in London in the form of [[Belgrave Square]], [[Eaton Square]], [[Wilton Crescent]] and [[Chester Square]]. An ultra-exclusive housing development built on a formerly rural swathe of land on the [[Grosvenor Estate]], building was entrusted to [[Thomas Cubitt]] and began in 1825 with Belgrave Square; the three main squares were completed and occupied by the 1840s.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Great Houses of London| author=James Stourton| publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd.| year=2012| p=169}}</ref> Like Nash, Cubitt designed elegant Classical terraces,.

A '''Commissioners' church''', also known as a '''Waterloo church''' and '''Million Act church''', is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church built with money voted by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as a result of the [[Church Building Act]]s of 1818 and 1824. The 1818 Act supplied a grant of money and established the Church Building Commission to direct its use, and in 1824 made a further grant of money. The First Parliamentary Grant for churches amounted to \u00a31 million (equivalent to \u00a373,550,000 in 2019), which is why the 1818 Act that provided for it is sometimes referred to in scholarly literature as the '''Million Pound Act'''. The Second Parliamentary Grant of 1824 amounted to an additional \u00a3500,000 (\u00a344,320,000 in 2019), so the term \"million\" cannot apply to all the churches aided by the Commission. The Commission was founded on a wave of national triumph following the defeat of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815; hence the suggestion of the word \"Waterloo\" in the title. Commissioner's churches in London include [[All Souls Church, Langham Place|All Souls, Langham Place]] by John Nash; the church's unusual circular tower was deliberately placed on a bend on Nash's Regents Street to create a picturesque view from [[Oxford Circus]], the fine neoclassical [[St Mary, Bryanston Square|St Mary's, Bryanston Square]] by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] and [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea|St Luke's, Chelsea]] one of London's first Gothic-revival churches; an indication of the shift of a style away from neoclassicism that was to occur later in the 19th century.

There was little coherent urban planning in London during the Victorian era, apart from major infrastructure projects like the [[Thames Embankment]] and [[Tower Bridge]]. Critics compared London to cities like [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]], where state intervention and large scale demolition had created a more regular arrangement, with broad boulevards, panoramas and architectural uniformity.

Important European architects of the era include [[Berthold Lubetkin]] and [[Ern\u0151 Goldfinger]], who employed and trained architects on modernist social housing such as the [[Dorset Estate]] of 1957, [[Alexander Fleming House]] (1962\u201364), [[Balfron Tower]] of 1963 and [[Trellick Tower]] of 1966, as well as [[Keeling House]] by [[Denys Lasdun]] in 1957.\nInternational [[History of urban planning#Modern urban planning|movements in architecture and urban planning]] were reflected in the new developments with separation of motor transportation and industrial and commercial uses from living areas, according to the prevailing orthodoxies of the [[Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]].<ref>Modern Architecture: A Critical History (1980; revised 1985, 1992 and 2007) Kenneth Frampton</ref> High-rise residential developments of [[council housing]] in London were above all else influenced by [[Le Corbusier]]'s [[Unit\u00e9 d'habitation]] (or ''Cit\u00e9 Radieuse'' (\"Radiant City\") of 1947\u201352.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2014/09/15/le-corbusier-unite-d-habitation-cite-radieuse-marseille-brutalist-architecture/|title=Brutalist buildings: Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation by Le Corbusier|date=September 15, 2014|website=Dezeen}}</ref> The architecture of [[Modern architecture#Postwar modernism in Europe (1945-1975)|post war modernism]] was informed by ideals of technological progress and social progress through egalitarianism; this was expressed by humanistic repetition of forms and use of the modernist material ''par excellence'' \u2013 [[B\u00e9ton brut]]<ref>Raw Concrete: The Beauty of Brutalism, Barnabas Calder</ref> or [https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1095022/raw-concrete/ 'raw concrete'].\nSignificant council housing works in London include the [[Brunswick Centre]] (1967\u201372) by [[Patrick Hodgkinson]] and the [[Alexandra Road Estate]] (1972\u201378) by [[Neave Brown]] of the [[Camden London Borough Council|Camden Council]] architects department.\n\nThe British exponents of the internationalist movement were headed by [[Alison and Peter Smithson]], originally as part of [[Team 10]]; they went on to design [[Robin Hood Gardens]] (1972) in [[Bow, London|Bow]] and ''[[The Economist]]'' Building<ref>{{cite web |url=http://postwarbuildings.com/buildings/the-economist-buildings |title=The Economist Buildings |access-date=2018-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061959/http://postwarbuildings.com/buildings/the-economist-buildings |archive-date=2016-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (1962\u20134) in [[Mayfair]], regarded by architects as some of the very finest works of British [[New Brutalism]].\n\nMany schools, residential housing and public buildings were built over the period; however the failure of some the modernist ideals, coupled with poor quality of construction and poor maintenance by building owners, has resulted in a somewhat negative popular perception of the architecture of the era; this is, however, being transformed and expressed in the enduring value and prestige of refurbished developments such as the Barbican, Trellick Tower and [[Balfron Tower]], regarded by many as architectural \"icons\" of a distant era of confidently heroic progressive social constructivism{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}} and highly sought-after places of residence.\n\n==Postmodernism, High-Tech and High-Rise Architecture (1980-Present)==\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in London|Postmodern architecture|High-tech architecture}}\n\n==== Postmodern and High Tech Architecture ====\n[[File:SIS building (26327425611).jpg|thumb|338x338px|The [[SIS Building|SIS or MI6 Building]] by [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] (1996) is a distinctive example of postmodern architecture.]]\nThe late 1970s is considered to be a stylistic turning point in the history of architecture. Formed in reaction against the austere [[Modern architecture|modernism]] which had dominated architectural design since the end of world war II, [[Postmodern architecture|the postmodern school]] - which first expressed itself in the controversial book [[Learning from Las Vegas]] (1973) by\u00a0[[Robert Venturi]]  - was a movement that rejected minimalism by embracing irony, playfulness, pop culture and quoting historical styles in their buildings.<ref>{{Citation|title=Architecture at the Crossroads - 1.

London contains some notable examples of postmodern architecture, mostly from the 1990s. [[Robert Venturi|Robert Venturi's]] [[National Gallery|Sailsbury Wing]] of the [[National Gallery]] (1991) is an excellent example of postmodern [[Historicism (art)|historical pastiche]], being built of [[portland stone]] and ironically imitating the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] of the original National Gallery in order to blend in with the older building. Two of the postmodern movement's most influential architects [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] were both British and many of their most significant works can be found in London. Perhaps London's best-known postmodernist building, [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell's]] [[SIS Building|SIS Building or MI6 Building]] (1996) in [[Vauxhall]], is a highly distinctive pyramidal design that was heavily influenced by [[Maya architecture|Maya]] and [[Aztec architecture|Aztec Architecture]]; it is the headquarters of [[Secret Intelligence Service|Britain's military intelligence agency]]. [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling's]] [[No 1 Poultry|No.1 Poultry]] (1997) has been highly commended as a masterpiece of the [[Postmodern architecture|postmodernist style]] becoming grade II* listed in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thespaces.com/postmodern-no-1-poultry-listed/|title=Postmodern London landmark No 1 Poultry gets listed status|date=2016-11-29|website=The Spaces|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Occupying the east corner of [[Bank junction|Bank Junction]], its unusual design incorporates a pink terracotta fa\u00e7ade containing equestrian sculptures and an unusual clock tower resembling a submarine conning tower.

These two styles embrace much of the eccentricity of the [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern style]] in their utilisation of unusual forms and shapes, whilst also taking cues from the modernist movement in their embrace of functionality and utopianism. In terms of construction there is an emphasis on the usage of glass, steel and high-tech production processes. A revolutionary example of the high-tech movement can be seen in the form of [[Lloyd's building|The Lloyd's Building]] (1986) by [[Richard Rogers]]; an unusual \u2018inside-out\u2019 design in which all the building's utilities; lifts, ducts and vents are placed on the outside rather than on the inside of the building, acting as if they are the external fa\u00e7ade.

Its height was controversial, being contrary to the previous height restrictions, it was the tallest building in the United Kingdom at the time and also the tallest [[cantilever]] building in the world. Following an over ten-year gap, [[One Canada Square]] was completed in 1991 at 235 metres (771&nbsp;ft) and formed the centrepiece of the [[Canary Wharf]] development, which itself is part of the [[Isle of Dogs]] and can be considered the east-side of Central London. The development's main tower [[One Canada Square]] became the tallest building in the United Kingdom.\n\nWith the encouragement of [[Ken Livingstone]] who was [[Mayor of London]] from 2000 to 2008, a renewed trend for building tall was established in the 2000s. Following another over 10-year gap, [[8 Canada Square]] and [[25 Canada Square]], both standing at 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft), were completed at Canary Wharf in 2002. Several others of a smaller height followed at Canary Wharf including: [[Heron Quays]], [[40 Bank Street]] in 2003 at 153 metres (502&nbsp;ft), [[10 Upper Bank Street]] in 2003 at 151 metres (495&nbsp;ft), and [[25 Bank Street]] in 2004 at 153 metres (502&nbsp;ft). In the City of London, [[30 St Mary Axe]], nicknamed \"the Gherkin\" was completed in 2003 at 180 metres (590&nbsp;ft), [[Heron Tower]] in 2007 at 230 metres (750&nbsp;ft), and the [[Broadgate Tower]] in 2008 at 165 metres (541&nbsp;ft). Notably, some of the awards given to 30 St Mary Axe include the [[Emporis Skyscraper Award]] in 2003 and the [[Stirling Prize|RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture]] in 2004.\n[[File:Ayuntamiento y Shard, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 076.JPG|thumb|396x396px|(left) [[City Hall, London|City Hall]] (2002) [[Foster and Partners|Fosters and Partners]] and (right) The Shard (2012) Renzo Piano, two notable works of [[High-tech architecture|high-tech]] and [[Neo-futurism|neo-futurist]] architecture.]]\n[[Boris Johnson]] who was Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016 approved the construction of more skyscrapers in London. [[The Shard]] topped out in 2012 at [[London Bridge]] and at 309.6 metres (1,016&nbsp;ft) remains London's tallest building. In 2014, the 225 metres (738&nbsp;ft) tall [[122 Leadenhall Street]], nicknamed \"the Cheesegrater\", was completed in the City of London. In September, 2016 a refit was completed of the 111m King's Reach Tower, originally built in the 1970s, which included an 11-storey height increase to bring it up to 150 metres (490&nbsp;ft) tall and it was renamed the [[South Bank Tower]]. [[One Blackfriars]], also located on the [[South Bank]], topped out in 2017 at 163 metres (535&nbsp;ft). [[The Scalpel]], at 190 metres (620&nbsp;ft) was completed in the City of London in 2018 and it was designed to protect views of St Paul's Catherdral. [[Newfoundland Quay]], at 220 metres (720&nbsp;ft) and [[Landmark Pinnacle]] at 233 metres (764&nbsp;ft) topped out in Canary Wharf in 2018 and 2019 respectively. [[One Park Drive]] at 205 metres (673&nbsp;ft) and [[South Quay Plaza]] at 215 metres (705&nbsp;ft) both also topped out at Canary Wharf in 2019. [[22 Bishopsgate]], at 278 metres (912&nbsp;ft) topped out in the City of London in 2019, after being approved by the current Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]], in 2016.\n\n[[1 Undershaft]], at 290 metres (950&nbsp;ft), also approved by Sadiq Khan in 2016, is planned to form the centrepiece of the City of London's skyscraper cluster. It is the tallest skyscraper currently proposed for London and will only be exceeded in height by The Shard. It will be built on the site of the aforementioned 1969 St Helen's building which will be demolished. [[100 Leadenhall]], at 249 metres (817&nbsp;ft), and already nicknamed the \"Cheesegrater 2\", is also planned for the City of London. [[Spire London]], at 235 metres (771&nbsp;ft) is planned for Canary Wharf. However, construction was halted after concerns that the building only had one escape stairwell for residents on the upper floors. The tallest of the two [[Riverside South (Canary Wharf)|Riverside South]] towers that have been planned for construction at Canary Wharf since 2008 would have exceeded that cluster's tallest building, One Canada Square, by 1 metre in height, but construction has been stalled since 2011. Construction has started on the 216 metres (709&nbsp;ft) tall [[Alpha Square|Consort Place]] (previously called Alpha Square) also at Canary Wharf.\n\nThere is another major skyscraper cluster emerging in the [[Vauxhall]] and [[Nine Elms]] districts of London. The first skyscraper to appear here was [[St George Wharf Tower]] at 181 metres (594&nbsp;ft) and which was completed in 2014. The tallest tower planned for this cluster is the 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft) [[One Nine Elms|One Nine Elms City Tower]].

He is unable to perform, and vents his anger by slapping the helpless Subbu. Singaperumal is the grand don of crime in Madras. His lieutenant, Pasupathi, brings a proposal. A large stash of cocaine, worth about {{Indian Rupee}} 2 crore, has entered the city. The guy bringing the stash wants to sell it for {{Indian Rupee}} 50 lakh. Pasupathi sees the immediate easy profit, as well as the long term benefit (to control the cocaine market with such a large supply) and the recognition that they are able to pull off such a deal. The drawback is that the stash really belongs to their arch-rival Gajendran. Singaperumal knows that Gajendran is a vicious and unpredictable adversary, and the venture is risky and likely to become messy. He decides to pass. Pasupathi dourly suggests Singaperumal is getting old and rusty. He asks Singaperumal to loan him the {{Indian Rupee}} 50 lakh so he can do the job himself. Pasupathi is prepared to face the risks, and in return for the loan, he offers Singaperumal a cut of the profits. Singaperumal agrees to the loan, but, instead asks Pasupathi to first get the stash and then think of the profit distribution. The money for the loan is brought to Singaperumal.\n\nThe film introduces Kalaya, a now destitute farmer, and his young, street-smart son Kodukapuli. They live in the slums and earn a meagre living staging cock-fights; as a coincidence, Singaperumal loves to watch these cock-fights. One evening, a man arrives to bunk with Kalaya for the night. This man is the cocaine courier. He routinely transports various stashes of drugs in and out of the city, and collects a relatively small fee ({{Indian Rupee}} 10,000) for each trip. That evening, after a long bout of drinking, he reveals that he has learnt the true value of the stash, and he now intends to sell it himself instead of delivering it to its true owner. He passes out.\n\nSeeing Subbu in tears, Singaperumal asks one of his men, Sappai, to take her out and comfort her \"so she is prepared to perform for him at night\". Sappai takes her to the beach and tries to console her.\n\nPasupathi and the men meet with the tipster and drive off to retrieve the stash. En route in the car, one of the men receives a call from Singaperumal, who orders him to bump-off Pasupathi as soon as the stash is acquired. Pasupathi overhears this as the call is on speaker mode and gets into a [[Mexican standoff|Mexican stand-off]] with others. In a desperate ploy he deliberately provokes a cop at a checkpoint, getting arrested and then later making an escape. The other men kidnap his wife, Kasturi, and use her as bait to lure Pasupathi. Singaperumal orders them to bring Kasturi to him.\n\nSubbu hates being a plaything for Singaperumal. She yearns to be free and live life on her own terms. She tries to persuade Sappai to think for himself and realise that Singaperumal is merely using them. Sappai, however, is too fearful and weak to oppose Singaperumal. Subbu and Sappai become unlikely lovers, and Subbu continues to hope for a way out. We learn that Subbu is somewhat educated, and learns whatever she can about the world outside Singaperumal.\n\nKalaya stages his cock-fight the following day. But this time, his prize cocks get killed. Kalaya is in serious financial trouble. Kodukapuli senses this and immediately goes to see if their visitor, still unconscious, has any money. They find out that the man had overdone his drink and died. Kalaya and Kodukapuli find the cocaine stash and the telephone number of a prospective buyer (Singaperumal and Pasupathi). Kalaya declares that his financial woes are at an end.\n\nSingaperumal is worried. His stash has not arrived, nor has he got word that Pasupathi is dead. He gets an angry call from Gajapati (Gajendran's brother and right-hand man): if Pasupathi seizes Gajapati's stuff, Gajendran will unleash a terrible gang war. The cunning Singaperumal tells Gajapati that Pasupathi has gone rogue, and that Gajapati is free to take out Pasupathi. Singaperumal figures this will benefit him both ways: he will get the stash, and his avaricious general will be killed by Gajendran. Gajendran sends his thugs after Pasupathi. Pasupathi is on the run. Now that Singaperumal has become his enemy, Pasupathi figures that Gajendran could possibly become an ally.\n\nKalaya calls Singaperumal to meet and make a deal for the stash. While waiting for him, Singaperumal's thugs arrive and kidnap Kalaya at the rendezvous point. After continuous torture, Kalaya is unable to reveal anything as his son Kodukapuli has the stash. Kodukapuli ends up calling Pasupathi's number accidentally, and offers to trade the stash for his father. Pasupathi joins Kodukapuli and offers the same trade to Singaperumal: the stash in return for Kalaya and Kasturi. Pasupathi places a call to Gajendran and offers to reveal the location of the stash.\n\nGajendran and his gang arrive at the location to make the exchange with Pasupathi. Singaperumal's thugs also arrive at about the same time. Pasupathi pretends to offer the stash to Gajapati, but instead slices his throat right in front of Gajendran. An enraged Gajendran and his gang chase Pasupathi. Pasupathi leads them around the block where Singaperumal's gang lay waiting. Both gangs mistaking Pasupathi's loyalties charge at each other and ensue in a gang-fight. Pasupathi gets out of the fray, and watches as Gajendran and the key generals of Singaperumal's hack each other to bits. Pasupathi's plan to decimate the two strong factions has succeeded. He returns to finish Singaperumal.\n\nBack in his rooms, Singaperumal discovers that the bag with the loan money is missing. He rushes to the conclusion that Sappai took it. When Sappai returns (having been sent by Subbu to fetch fruits), Singaperumal beats him up severely. Sappai's faith is shattered. In his first moment of independence, he grabs a pistol and shoots Singaperumal dead! Subbu emerges from the shadows. She is proud of Sappai, but in a stunning twist, she shoots and kills Sappai! When Pasupathi arrives, he finds Sappai and Singaperumal dead and Subbu in tears. Having always been sympathetic to Subbu's suffering with Singaperumal, he says she is free to go. Subbu leaves. Pasupathi summons the remaining thugs of Singaperumal's gang and assumes command. Kasturi is unharmed. Pasupathi gets the stash and pays Kodukapuli a fair commission.\n\nIt is finally revealed that Subbu had planned the whole thing. She sent Sappai with the bag containing the loan money to provoke Singaperumal's temper. She retrieves the bag with the loan money and quietly leaves the city to begin her new life. She remarks that the men basically mistrusted, misused and slaughtered each other. In her view, Sappai, too, was not really an innocent victim. She says Sappai is also a man, but all men are sappai (The word 'sappai' has varied meanings, but in this case, it means insignificant to the point of being [[contemptuous]]). The film ends with her line: The best thing about being a woman is that it's a man's world.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Singaperumal/Ayya\n* [[Ravi Krishna]] as Sappai\n* [[Sampath Raj]] as Pasupathy\n* Master Vasanth as Kodukkapuli\n* [[Guru Somasundaram]] as Kaalayan\n* [[Yasmin Ponnappa]] as Subbu\n* [[Ajay Raj]] as Chittu\n* Boxer Aarumugam as Gajendran\n* Sai Dheena as Gajapathy\n* Sugunthan as Mullu\n* [[Jayashree (actress)|Jayashree]] as Kasthuri\n* [[Five Star Krishna]] as astrologer\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn August 2007, following the success of his film ''[[Chennai 600028]]'' (2007), speculation over [[S.

It ran into difficulties as the regional [[Central Board of Film Certification|censor board]] in Chennai raised objection against the film, giving it an adult rating besides demanding 52 cuts.<ref name=\"thehindu1\"/> After screening at and becoming approved by the Tribunal in Delhi, the film was released worldwide on 10 June 2011,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/67543.html | work=IndiaGlitz | title=Friday Fiesta 100611 | date=27 December 2011}}</ref> to high critical acclaim but [[Box office bomb|underperformed]] at box-office.

He is unable to perform, and vents his anger by slapping the helpless Subbu. Singaperumal is the grand don of crime in Madras. His lieutenant, Pasupathi, brings a proposal. A large stash of cocaine, worth about {{Indian Rupee}} 2 crore, has entered the city. The guy bringing the stash wants to sell it for {{Indian Rupee}} 50 lakh. Pasupathi sees the immediate easy profit, as well as the long term benefit (to control the cocaine market with such a large supply) and the recognition that they are able to pull off such a deal. The drawback is that the stash really belongs to their arch-rival Gajendran. Singaperumal knows that Gajendran is a vicious and unpredictable adversary, and the venture is risky and likely to become messy. He decides to pass. Pasupathi dourly suggests Singaperumal is getting old and rusty. He asks Singaperumal to loan him the {{Indian Rupee}} 50 lakh so he can do the job himself. Pasupathi is prepared to face the risks, and in return for the loan, he offers Singaperumal a cut of the profits. Singaperumal agrees to the loan, but, instead asks Pasupathi to first get the stash and then think of the profit distribution. The money for the loan is brought to Singaperumal.\n\nThe film introduces Kalaya, a now destitute farmer, and his young, street-smart son Kodukapuli. They live in the slums and earn a meagre living staging cock-fights; as a coincidence, Singaperumal loves to watch these cock-fights. One evening, a man arrives to bunk with Kalaya for the night. This man is the cocaine courier. He routinely transports various stashes of drugs in and out of the city, and collects a relatively small fee ({{Indian Rupee}} 10,000) for each trip. That evening, after a long bout of drinking, he reveals that he has learnt the true value of the stash, and he now intends to sell it himself instead of delivering it to its true owner. He passes out.\n\nSeeing Subbu in tears, Singaperumal asks one of his men, Sappai, to take her out and comfort her \"so she is prepared to perform for him at night\". Sappai takes her to the beach and tries to console her.\n\nPasupathi and the men meet with the tipster and drive off to retrieve the stash. En route in the car, one of the men receives a call from Singaperumal, who orders him to bump-off Pasupathi as soon as the stash is acquired. Pasupathi overhears this as the call is on speaker mode and gets into a [[Mexican standoff|Mexican stand-off]] with others. In a desperate ploy he deliberately provokes a cop at a checkpoint, getting arrested and then later making an escape. The other men kidnap his wife, Kasturi, and use her as bait to lure Pasupathi. Singaperumal orders them to bring Kasturi to him.\n\nSubbu hates being a plaything for Singaperumal. She yearns to be free and live life on her own terms. She tries to persuade Sappai to think for himself and realise that Singaperumal is merely using them. Sappai, however, is too fearful and weak to oppose Singaperumal. Subbu and Sappai become unlikely lovers, and Subbu continues to hope for a way out. We learn that Subbu is somewhat educated, and learns whatever she can about the world outside Singaperumal.\n\nKalaya stages his cock-fight the following day. But this time, his prize cocks get killed. Kalaya is in serious financial trouble. Kodukapuli senses this and immediately goes to see if their visitor, still unconscious, has any money. They find out that the man had overdone his drink and died. Kalaya and Kodukapuli find the cocaine stash and the telephone number of a prospective buyer (Singaperumal and Pasupathi). Kalaya declares that his financial woes are at an end.\n\nSingaperumal is worried. His stash has not arrived, nor has he got word that Pasupathi is dead. He gets an angry call from Gajapati (Gajendran's brother and right-hand man): if Pasupathi seizes Gajapati's stuff, Gajendran will unleash a terrible gang war. The cunning Singaperumal tells Gajapati that Pasupathi has gone rogue, and that Gajapati is free to take out Pasupathi. Singaperumal figures this will benefit him both ways: he will get the stash, and his avaricious general will be killed by Gajendran. Gajendran sends his thugs after Pasupathi. Pasupathi is on the run. Now that Singaperumal has become his enemy, Pasupathi figures that Gajendran could possibly become an ally.\n\nKalaya calls Singaperumal to meet and make a deal for the stash. While waiting for him, Singaperumal's thugs arrive and kidnap Kalaya at the rendezvous point. After continuous torture, Kalaya is unable to reveal anything as his son Kodukapuli has the stash. Kodukapuli ends up calling Pasupathi's number accidentally, and offers to trade the stash for his father. Pasupathi joins Kodukapuli and offers the same trade to Singaperumal: the stash in return for Kalaya and Kasturi. Pasupathi places a call to Gajendran and offers to reveal the location of the stash.\n\nGajendran and his gang arrive at the location to make the exchange with Pasupathi. Singaperumal's thugs also arrive at about the same time. Pasupathi pretends to offer the stash to Gajapati, but instead slices his throat right in front of Gajendran. An enraged Gajendran and his gang chase Pasupathi. Pasupathi leads them around the block where Singaperumal's gang lay waiting. Both gangs mistaking Pasupathi's loyalties charge at each other and ensue in a gang-fight. Pasupathi gets out of the fray, and watches as Gajendran and the key generals of Singaperumal's hack each other to bits. Pasupathi's plan to decimate the two strong factions has succeeded. He returns to finish Singaperumal.\n\nBack in his rooms, Singaperumal discovers that the bag with the loan money is missing. He rushes to the conclusion that Sappai took it. When Sappai returns (having been sent by Subbu to fetch fruits), Singaperumal beats him up severely. Sappai's faith is shattered. In his first moment of independence, he grabs a pistol and shoots Singaperumal dead! Subbu emerges from the shadows. She is proud of Sappai, but in a stunning twist, she shoots and kills Sappai! When Pasupathi arrives, he finds Sappai and Singaperumal dead and Subbu in tears. Having always been sympathetic to Subbu's suffering with Singaperumal, he says she is free to go. Subbu leaves. Pasupathi summons the remaining thugs of Singaperumal's gang and assumes command. Kasturi is unharmed. Pasupathi gets the stash and pays Kodukapuli a fair commission.\n\nIt is finally revealed that Subbu had planned the whole thing. She sent Sappai with the bag containing the loan money to provoke Singaperumal's temper. She retrieves the bag with the loan money and quietly leaves the city to begin her new life. She remarks that the men basically mistrusted, misused and slaughtered each other. In her view, Sappai, too, was not really an innocent victim. She says Sappai is also a man, but all men are sappai (The word 'sappai' has varied meanings, but in this case, it means insignificant to the point of being [[contemptuous]]). The film ends with her line: The best thing about being a woman is that it's a man's world.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Singaperumal/Ayya\n* [[Ravi Krishna]] as Sappai\n* [[Sampath Raj]] as Pasupathy\n* Master Vasanth as Kodukkapuli\n* [[Guru Somasundaram]] as Kaalayan\n* [[Yasmin Ponnappa]] as Subbu\n* [[Ajay Raj]] as Chittu\n* Boxer Aarumugam as Gajendran\n* Sai Dheena as Gajapathy\n* Sugunthan as Mullu\n* [[Jayashree (actress)|Jayashree]] as Kasthuri\n* [[Five Star Krishna]] as astrologer\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn August 2007, following the success of his film ''[[Chennai 600028]]'' (2007), speculation over [[S.

It was one of the first devices capable of generating the [[Continuous wave|continuous radio waves]] needed for transmission of [[amplitude modulation]] (sound) by radio.  It was used from about 1910 in a few \"superpower\" [[longwave]] [[radiotelegraphy]] stations to transmit transoceanic message traffic by [[Morse code]] to similar stations all over the world.\n\nAlthough obsolete by the early 1920s due to the development of [[vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] transmitters, the Alexanderson alternator continued to be used until [[World War II]].  It is on the [[list of IEEE Milestones]] as a key achievement in [[electrical engineering]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Alexanderson_Radio_Alternator,_1904 |title=Milestones:Alexanderson Radio Alternator, 1904 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Prior developments ===\n\nAfter [[radio wave]]s were discovered in 1887, the first generation of [[radio transmitter]]s, the [[spark gap transmitter]]s, produced strings of ''[[damped wave]]s'', pulses of radio waves which died out to zero quickly. By the 1890s it was realized that damped waves had disadvantages; their energy was spread over a broad [[frequency]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] so transmitters on different frequencies interfered with each other,  and they could not be [[modulation|modulated]] with an audio signal to transmit sound.  Efforts were made to invent transmitters that would produce ''[[continuous wave]]s'', a sinusoidal alternating current at a single frequency.\n\nIn an 1891 lecture, [[Frederick Thomas Trouton]] pointed out that, if an electrical [[alternator]] were run at a great enough cycle speed (that is, if it turned fast enough and was built with a large enough number of magnetic poles on its armature) it would generate continuous waves at radio frequency.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxh6n6;view=1up;seq=316 \"Radiation of Electric Energy\"] by Frederick Trouton, ''The Electrician'' (London), January 22, 1892, page 302.</ref>   Starting with [[Elihu Thomson]] in 1889,<ref name=\"Thomson1891\">{{cite journal\n  | title = Prof. Thomson's new alternating generator\n  | journal = The Electrical Engineer\n  | volume = 11\n  | issue = 154\n  | pages = 437\n  | publisher =  Electrical Engineer Co.\n  | location = \n  | date = April 15, 1891\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kOZQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA437#v=onepage&q&f=false\n  | issn = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate = April 18, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomson1890\">{{cite journal\n  | last1  = Thomson\n  | first1 = Elihu\n  | title = letter\n  | journal = The Electrician\n  | volume = 25\n  | issue = \n  | pages = 529\u2013530\n  | publisher =  \n  | location = London\n  | date = September 12, 1890\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u4JNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA529&dq=%22elihu+Thomson%22+alternating+machine%22#v=onepage&q=%22elihu%20Thomson%22%20alternating%20machine%22&f=false\n  | issn = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate = April 18, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Aitken\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Aitken\n | first1 = Hugh G.J.\n | title  = The Continuous Wave: Technology and American Radio, 1900-1932\n | publisher = Princeton Univ.

The alternator was designed by [[Ernst Alexanderson]]. The Alexanderson alternator was extensively used for long-wave [[radio communication]]s by shore stations, but was too large and heavy to be installed on most ships. In 1906 the first 50-kilowatt alternators were delivered. One was to Reginald Fessenden at [[Brant Rock, Massachusetts]], another to [[John Hays Hammond, Jr.]] in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] and another to the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America| American Marconi Company]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]].\n\nAlexanderson would receive a patent in 1911 for his device. The Alexanderson alternator followed Fessenden's rotary spark-gap transmitter as the second radio transmitter to be [[amplitude modulation|modulated]] to carry the human voice. Until the invention of [[vacuum-tube]] (valve) [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s in 1913 such as the [[Armstrong oscillator]], the Alexanderson alternator was an important high-power [[radio]] [[transmitter]], and allowed [[amplitude modulation]] radio transmission of the human voice. The last remaining operable Alexanderson alternator is at the [[VLF transmitter Grimeton]] in Sweden and was in regular service until 1996. It continues to be operated for a few minutes on [[Alexanderson Day]], which is either the last Sunday in June or first Sunday in July every year.\n\n=== World War I and the formation of RCA ===\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] forced European nations to temporarily abandon development of international radio communications networks, while the United States increased efforts to develop transoceanic radio. By the end of the war the Alexanderson alternator was operating to reliably provide transoceanic radio service. [[Marconi Company|British Marconi]] offered [[General Electric]] $5,000 in business in exchange for exclusive rights to use the alternator, but just as the deal was about to go through, the American president [[Woodrow Wilson]] requested that GE decline the offer, which would have given the British (who were the leader in [[submarine cables]]) dominance over worldwide radio communications. GE complied with the request and joined with [[American Telephone and Telegraph]] (AT&T), the [[United Fruit Company]], the [[Western Electric Company]] and the [[Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company]] to form the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), giving American companies control of American radio for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harboard |first1=J.G. |title=The Commercial Uses of Radio |journal=The Annals of the American Academy |date=1929 |doi=10.1177/0002716229142001S09}}</ref>\n\n=== Stations ===\nThorn L.

A new facility was constructed at Haiku in Hawaii, where two 200 KW Alexanderson alternators transferred from the mainland were installed. The Navy also operated an existing transmitter at Bolinas, California, again for Pacific ocean communication.<ref>Mayes (1989), pages 176-177.</ref> Both Haiku alternators were sold for salvage in 1969, possibly to Kreger Company of California. \n\nIn the late 1940s the Air Force assumed control of the Haiku and Marion, Massachusetts facilities. The Air Force found that longwave transmissions were more reliable than shortwave when sending weather information to Arctic researchers as well as bases in Greenland, Labrador, and Iceland. The two Marion transmitters were used until 1957. One was scrapped in 1961 and the other was reportedly handed over to the U.S. Bureau of Standards<ref>Mayes (1989), page 176.</ref> and stored in a Smithsonian Institution warehouse.<ref>Mayes (1989), quoting July 15, 1976 correspondence from \"the Commanding Officer of the USCG Station Hawaii\", page 180.</ref>\n\n== Design ==\n[[Image:Rotor of Alexanderson alternator.jpg|thumb|Rotor of 200 kW alternator]]\n[[Image:Alexanderson rotor closeup.jpg|thumb|Closeup of above rotor. It has 300 narrow slots cut through the rotor. The \"teeth\" between the slots are the magnetic poles of the machine.]]\n\nThe Alexanderson alternator works similarly to an AC electric generator, but generates higher-frequency current, in the very low frequency (VLF) radio frequency range.  The rotor has no conductive windings or electrical connections; it consists of a solid disc of high tensile strength magnetic steel, with narrow slots cut in its circumference to create a series of narrow \"teeth\" that function as magnetic poles. The space between the teeth is filled with nonmagnetic material, to give the rotor a smooth surface to decrease aerodynamic drag.  The rotor is turned at a high speed by an electric motor.\n\nThe machine operates by variable [[reluctance]] (similar to an electric [[guitar pickup]]), changing the [[magnetic field|magnetic flux]] linking two coils.  The periphery of the rotor is embraced by a circular iron stator with a C-shaped cross-section, divided into narrow poles, the same number as the rotor has, carrying two sets of coils.  One set of coils is energized with [[direct current]] and produces a magnetic field in the air gap in the stator, which passes axially (sideways) through the rotor.\n\nAs the rotor turns, alternately either an iron section of the disk is in the gap between each pair of stator poles, allowing a high magnetic flux to cross the gap, or else a non-magnetic slot is in the stator gap, allowing less magnetic flux to pass. Thus the magnetic flux through the stator varies sinusoidally at a rapid rate. These changes in flux induce a [[radio-frequency]] voltage in a second set of coils on the stator.\n\nThe RF collector coils are all interconnected by an output [[transformer]], whose secondary winding is connected to the antenna circuit. [[Modulation]] or [[Telegraphy|telegraph keying]] of the radio frequency energy was done by a [[magnetic amplifier]], which was also used for [[amplitude modulation]] and voice transmissions.\n\nThe [[frequency]] of the current generated by an Alexanderson alternator in [[hertz (unit)|hertz]] is the product of the number of rotor poles and the revolutions per second.  Higher radio frequencies thus require more poles, a higher rotational speed, or both.  Alexanderson alternators were used to produce radio waves in the [[very low frequency]] (VLF) range, for transcontinental wireless communication. A typical alternator with an output frequency of 100&nbsp;kHz had 300 poles and rotated at 20,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) (330 revolutions per second).  To produce high power, the clearance between the rotor and stator had to be kept to only 1&nbsp;mm.  The manufacture of precision machines rotating at such high speeds presented many new problems, and Alexanderson transmitters were bulky and very expensive.\n\n=== Frequency control ===\n\nThe output frequency of the transmitter is proportional to the speed of the rotor.  To keep the frequency constant, the speed of the electric motor turning it was controlled with a feedback loop.  In one method, a sample of the output signal is applied to a high-Q [[tuned circuit]], whose [[resonant frequency]] is slightly above the output frequency.  The generator's frequency falls on the \"skirt\" of the LC circuit's impedance curve, where the impedance increases rapidly with frequency.  The output of the LC circuit is rectified, and the resulting voltage is compared with a constant reference voltage to produce a feedback signal to control the motor speed.  If the output frequency gets too high, the impedance presented by the LC circuit increases, and the amplitude of the RF signal getting through the LC circuit drops.  The feedback signal to the motor drops, and the motor slows down. Thus the alternator output frequency is \"locked\" to the tuned circuit resonant frequency.\n\nThe sets were built to operate at wavelengths of 10,500 to 24,000 meters (28.57 to 12.5 KHz). This was accomplished by three design variables. The alternators were built with\n1220 or 976 or 772 poles. Three gear boxes were available with ratios of 2.675- 2.973 and 3.324 and the 900 RPM driving motor was operated at slips of 4% to 20%, giving speeds of 864 to 720 RPM . Transmitters installed in Europe, operating on 50-cycle power, had a wavelength range of 12, 500 to 28, 800 meters because of the lower speed of the driving motor.\n\n== Performance advantages ==\n\nA large Alexanderson alternator might produce 500&nbsp;kW of output radio-frequency energy and would be water- or oil-cooled.  One such machine had 600 pole pairs in the stator winding, and the rotor was driven at 2170 RPM, for an output frequency near 21.7&nbsp;kHz. To obtain higher frequencies, higher rotor speeds were required, up to 20,000 RPM.\n\nAlong with the [[arc converter]] invented in 1903, the Alexanderson alternator was one of the first radio transmitters that generated [[continuous wave]]s.  In contrast, the earlier [[spark-gap transmitter]]s generated a string of [[damped wave]]s.  These were electrically \"noisy\"; the energy of the transmitter was spread over a wide frequency range, so they interfered with other transmissions and operated inefficiently.  With a continuous-wave transmitter, all of the energy was concentrated within a narrow [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|frequency band]], so for a given output power they could communicate over longer distances.  In addition, continuous waves could be [[modulation|modulated]] with an [[audio signal]] to carry sound.  The Alexanderson alternator was one of the first transmitters to be used for [[amplitude modulation|AM]] transmission.\n\nThe Alexanderson alternator produced \"purer\" continuous waves than the arc converter, whose nonsinusoidal output generated significant [[harmonics]], so the alternator was preferred for long-distance telegraphy.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nBecause of the extremely high rotational speed compared to a conventional alternator, the Alexanderson alternator required continuous maintenance by skilled personnel. Efficient lubrication and oil or water cooling was essential for reliability which was difficult to achieve with the lubricants available at the time. In fact, early editions of the [[Royal Navy]]'s \"Admiralty Handbook of Wireless Telegraphy\" cover this in considerable detail, mostly as an explanation as to why the navy did not use that particular technology. However, the US Navy did.\n\nOther major problems were that changing the operating frequency was a lengthy and complicated process, and unlike a spark transmitter, the carrier signal could not be switched on and off at will. The latter problem greatly complicated  \"listening through\" (that is, stopping the transmission to listen for any answer). There was also the risk that it would allow enemy vessels to detect the presence of the ship.\n\nBecause of the limits of the number of poles and rotational speed of a machine, the Alexanderson alternator is capable of generating transmission frequencies up to around 600kHz in the lower [[Medium wave]] band, with [[Shortwave radio|Shortwave]] and higher frequencies being physically impossible.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Alexanderson Day]]\n* [[Tonewheel]]\n* [[Resolver (electrical)]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050311003838/http://www.antiquewireless.org/otb/blw535202.htm Antique Wireless Association - column edited by Frank Lotito ]\n* David E.

It was used from about 1910 in a few \"superpower\" [[longwave]] [[radiotelegraphy]] stations to transmit transoceanic message traffic by [[Morse code]] to similar stations all over the world.\n\nAlthough obsolete by the early 1920s due to the development of [[vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] transmitters, the Alexanderson alternator continued to be used until [[World War II]].

By the 1890s it was realized that damped waves had disadvantages; their energy was spread over a broad [[frequency]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] so transmitters on different frequencies interfered with each other,  and they could not be [[modulation|modulated]] with an audio signal to transmit sound.  Efforts were made to invent transmitters that would produce ''[[continuous wave]]s'', a sinusoidal alternating current at a single frequency.\n\nIn an 1891 lecture, [[Frederick Thomas Trouton]] pointed out that, if an electrical [[alternator]] were run at a great enough cycle speed (that is, if it turned fast enough and was built with a large enough number of magnetic poles on its armature) it would generate continuous waves at radio frequency.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxh6n6;view=1up;seq=316 \"Radiation of Electric Energy\"] by Frederick Trouton, ''The Electrician'' (London), January 22, 1892, page 302.</ref>   Starting with [[Elihu Thomson]] in 1889,<ref name=\"Thomson1891\">{{cite journal\n  | title = Prof. Thomson's new alternating generator\n  | journal = The Electrical Engineer\n  | volume = 11\n  | issue = 154\n  | pages = 437\n  | publisher =  Electrical Engineer Co.\n  | location = \n  | date = April 15, 1891\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kOZQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA437#v=onepage&q&f=false\n  | issn = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate = April 18, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomson1890\">{{cite journal\n  | last1  = Thomson\n  | first1 = Elihu\n  | title = letter\n  | journal = The Electrician\n  | volume = 25\n  | issue = \n  | pages = 529\u2013530\n  | publisher =  \n  | location = London\n  | date = September 12, 1890\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u4JNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA529&dq=%22elihu+Thomson%22+alternating+machine%22#v=onepage&q=%22elihu%20Thomson%22%20alternating%20machine%22&f=false\n  | issn = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate = April 18, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Aitken\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Aitken\n | first1 = Hugh G.J.\n | title  = The Continuous Wave: Technology and American Radio, 1900-1932\n | publisher = Princeton Univ.

The alternator was designed by [[Ernst Alexanderson]]. The Alexanderson alternator was extensively used for long-wave [[radio communication]]s by shore stations, but was too large and heavy to be installed on most ships. In 1906 the first 50-kilowatt alternators were delivered. One was to Reginald Fessenden at [[Brant Rock, Massachusetts]], another to [[John Hays Hammond, Jr.]] in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] and another to the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America| American Marconi Company]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]].\n\nAlexanderson would receive a patent in 1911 for his device. The Alexanderson alternator followed Fessenden's rotary spark-gap transmitter as the second radio transmitter to be [[amplitude modulation|modulated]] to carry the human voice. Until the invention of [[vacuum-tube]] (valve) [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s in 1913 such as the [[Armstrong oscillator]], the Alexanderson alternator was an important high-power [[radio]] [[transmitter]], and allowed [[amplitude modulation]] radio transmission of the human voice. The last remaining operable Alexanderson alternator is at the [[VLF transmitter Grimeton]] in Sweden and was in regular service until 1996. It continues to be operated for a few minutes on [[Alexanderson Day]], which is either the last Sunday in June or first Sunday in July every year.\n\n=== World War I and the formation of RCA ===\n\nThe outbreak of [[World War I]] forced European nations to temporarily abandon development of international radio communications networks, while the United States increased efforts to develop transoceanic radio. By the end of the war the Alexanderson alternator was operating to reliably provide transoceanic radio service. [[Marconi Company|British Marconi]] offered [[General Electric]] $5,000 in business in exchange for exclusive rights to use the alternator, but just as the deal was about to go through, the American president [[Woodrow Wilson]] requested that GE decline the offer, which would have given the British (who were the leader in [[submarine cables]]) dominance over worldwide radio communications. GE complied with the request and joined with [[American Telephone and Telegraph]] (AT&T), the [[United Fruit Company]], the [[Western Electric Company]] and the [[Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company]] to form the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), giving American companies control of American radio for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harboard |first1=J.G. |title=The Commercial Uses of Radio |journal=The Annals of the American Academy |date=1929 |doi=10.1177/0002716229142001S09}}</ref>\n\n=== Stations ===\nThorn L.

A new facilty was constructed at Haiku in Hawaii, where two 200 KW Alexanderson alternators transferred from the mainland were installed. The Navy also operated an existing transmitter at Bolinas, California, again for Pacific ocean communication.<ref>Mayes (1989), pages 176-177.</ref> Both Haiku alternators were sold for salvage in 1969, possibly to Kreger Company of California. \n\nIn the late 1940s the Air Force assumed control of the Haiku and Marion, Massachusetts facilities. The Air Force found that longwave transmissions were more reliable than shortwave when sending weather information to Arctic researchers as well as bases in Greenland, Labrador, and Iceland. The two Marion transmitters were used until 1957. One was scrapped in 1961 and the other was reportedly handed over to the U.S. Bureau of Standards<ref>Mayes (1989), page 176.</ref> and stored in a Smithsonian Institution warehouse.<ref>Mayes (1989), quoting July 15, 1976 correspondence from \"the Commanding Officer of the USCG Station Hawaii\", page 180.</ref>\n\n== Design ==\n[[Image:Rotor of Alexanderson alternator.jpg|thumb|Rotor of 200 kW alternator]]\n[[Image:Alexanderson rotor closeup.jpg|thumb|Closeup of above rotor. It has 300 narrow slots cut through the rotor. The \"teeth\" between the slots are the magnetic poles of the machine.]]\n\nThe Alexanderson alternator works similarly to an AC electric generator, but generates higher-frequency current, in the very low frequency (VLF) radio frequency range.  The rotor has no conductive windings or electrical connections; it consists of a solid disc of high tensile strength magnetic steel, with narrow slots cut in its circumference to create a series of narrow \"teeth\" that function as magnetic poles. The space between the teeth is filled with nonmagnetic material, to give the rotor a smooth surface to decrease aerodynamic drag.  The rotor is turned at a high speed by an electric motor.\n\nThe machine operates by variable [[reluctance]] (similar to an electric [[guitar pickup]]), changing the [[magnetic field|magnetic flux]] linking two coils.  The periphery of the rotor is embraced by a circular iron stator with a C-shaped cross-section, divided into narrow poles, the same number as the rotor has, carrying two sets of coils.  One set of coils is energized with [[direct current]] and produces a magnetic field in the air gap in the stator, which passes axially (sideways) through the rotor.\n\nAs the rotor turns, alternately either an iron section of the disk is in the gap between each pair of stator poles, allowing a high magnetic flux to cross the gap, or else a non-magnetic slot is in the stator gap, allowing less magnetic flux to pass. Thus the magnetic flux through the stator varies sinusoidally at a rapid rate. These changes in flux induce a [[radio-frequency]] voltage in a second set of coils on the stator.\n\nThe RF collector coils are all interconnected by an output [[transformer]], whose secondary winding is connected to the antenna circuit. [[Modulation]] or [[Telegraphy|telegraph keying]] of the radio frequency energy was done by a [[magnetic amplifier]], which was also used for [[amplitude modulation]] and voice transmissions.\n\nThe [[frequency]] of the current generated by an Alexanderson alternator in [[hertz (unit)|hertz]] is the product of the number of rotor poles and the revolutions per second.  Higher radio frequencies thus require more poles, a higher rotational speed, or both.  Alexanderson alternators were used to produce radio waves in the [[very low frequency]] (VLF) range, for transcontinental wireless communication. A typical alternator with an output frequency of 100&nbsp;kHz had 300 poles and rotated at 20,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) (330 revolutions per second).  To produce high power, the clearance between the rotor and stator had to be kept to only 1&nbsp;mm.  The manufacture of precision machines rotating at such high speeds presented many new problems, and Alexanderson transmitters were bulky and very expensive.\n\n=== Frequency control ===\n\nThe output frequency of the transmitter is proportional to the speed of the rotor.  To keep the frequency constant, the speed of the electric motor turning it was controlled with a feedback loop.  In one method, a sample of the output signal is applied to a high-Q [[tuned circuit]], whose [[resonant frequency]] is slightly above the output frequency.  The generator's frequency falls on the \"skirt\" of the LC circuit's impedance curve, where the impedance increases rapidly with frequency.  The output of the LC circuit is rectified, and the resulting voltage is compared with a constant reference voltage to produce a feedback signal to control the motor speed.  If the output frequency gets too high, the impedance presented by the LC circuit increases, and the amplitude of the RF signal getting through the LC circuit drops.  The feedback signal to the motor drops, and the motor slows down. Thus the alternator output frequency is \"locked\" to the tuned circuit resonant frequency.\n\nThe sets were built to operate at wavelengths of 10,500 to 24,000 meters (28.57 to 12.5 KHz) . This was accomplished by three design variables. The alternators were built with\n1220 or 976 or 772 poles . Three gear boxes were available with ratios of 2.675- 2.973 and 3.324 and the 900 RPM driving motor was operated at slips of 4% to 20%, giving speeds of 864 to 720 RPM . Transmitters installed in Europe, operating on 50-cycle power, had a wavelength range of 12, 500 to 28, 800 meters because of the lower speed of the driving motor.\n\n== Performance advantages ==\n\nA large Alexanderson alternator might produce 500&nbsp;kW of output radio-frequency energy and would be water- or oil-cooled.  One such machine had 600 pole pairs in the stator winding, and the rotor was driven at 2170 RPM, for an output frequency near 21.7&nbsp;kHz. To obtain higher frequencies, higher rotor speeds were required, up to 20,000 RPM.\n\nAlong with the [[arc converter]] invented in 1903, the Alexanderson alternator was one of the first radio transmitters that generated [[continuous wave]]s.  In contrast, the earlier [[spark-gap transmitter]]s generated a string of [[damped wave]]s.  These were electrically \"noisy\"; the energy of the transmitter was spread over a wide frequency range, so they interfered with other transmissions and operated inefficiently.  With a continuous-wave transmitter, all of the energy was concentrated within a narrow [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|frequency band]], so for a given output power they could communicate over longer distances.  In addition, continuous waves could be [[modulation|modulated]] with an [[audio signal]] to carry sound.  The Alexanderson alternator was one of the first transmitters to be used for [[amplitude modulation|AM]] transmission.\n\nThe Alexanderson alternator produced \"purer\" continuous waves than the arc converter, whose nonsinusoidal output generated significant [[harmonics]], so the alternator was preferred for long-distance telegraphy.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nBecause of the extremely high rotational speed compared to a conventional alternator, the Alexanderson alternator required continuous maintenance by skilled personnel. Efficient lubrication and oil or water cooling was essential for reliability which was difficult to achieve with the lubricants available at the time. In fact, early editions of the [[Royal Navy]]'s \"Admiralty Handbook of Wireless Telegraphy\" cover this in considerable detail, mostly as an explanation as to why the navy did not use that particular technology. However, the US Navy did.\n\nOther major problems were that changing the operating frequency was a lengthy and complicated process, and unlike a spark transmitter, the carrier signal could not be switched on and off at will. The latter problem greatly complicated  \"listening through\" (that is, stopping the transmission to listen for any answer). There was also the risk that it would allow enemy vessels to detect the presence of the ship.\n\nBecause of the limits of the number of poles and rotational speed of a machine, the Alexanderson alternator is capable of generating transmission frequencies up to around 600kHz in the lower [[Medium wave]] band, with [[Shortwave radio|Shortwave]] and higher frequencies being physically impossible.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Alexanderson Day]]\n* [[Tonewheel]]\n* [[Resolver (electrical)]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050311003838/http://www.antiquewireless.org/otb/blw535202.htm Antique Wireless Association - column edited by Frank Lotito ]\n* David E.
