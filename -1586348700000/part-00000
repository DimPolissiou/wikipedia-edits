It was originally named '''Westinghouse Electric Company''', and was renamed Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1945. The company acquired the [[CBS]] television network in 1995, and was renamed CBS Corporation before being acquired by [[Viacom (1952&ndash;2006)|Viacom]] in 1999.\n\n{{As of|2019|8}}, the Westinghouse brand is managed by the [[Westinghouse Licensing Corporation]], a subsidiary of [[ViacomCBS]] that became the legal successor to Viacom. The nuclear power business, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1999.\n\n==History==\n[[File:George Westinghouse.jpg|150px|thumb|right|George Westinghouse]]\nWestinghouse Electric was founded by [[George Westinghouse]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] in 1886. The firm became active in developing [[electric]] infrastructure throughout the United States. The company's largest factories were located in [[East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|East Pittsburgh Pennsylvania]], and [https://richesmi.cah.ucf.edu/omeka2/items/show/6184 Lester, Pennsylvania]<ref name=\"Tinicum Township\">{{cite book|title=History of Tinicum Township (PA) 1643\u20131993|publisher=Tinicum Township Historical Society|year=1993|isbn=|url=http://tthsdelco.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/History%20of%20Tinicum%20Twp.pdf}}</ref> and in Hamilton, Ontario, where they made [[turbine]]s, generators, motors, and switch gear for generation, transmission, and use of electricity.<ref name=\"WDL1\" /> In addition to George Westinghouse, early engineers working for the company included [[Frank Conrad]], [[Benjamin Garver Lamme]], [[Bertha Lamme Feicht|Bertha Lamme]] (America\u2019s first woman mechanical engineer), [[Oliver B. Shallenberger]], [[William Stanley (physicist)|William Stanley]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Stephen Timoshenko]] and [[Vladimir Zworykin]].\n\nEarly on, Westinghouse was a rival to [[Thomas Edison]]'s electric company. In 1892, Edison was merged with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], making an even bigger competitor, [[General Electric]]. Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company changed its name to '''Westinghouse Electric Corporation''' in 1945.\n\nWestinghouse purchased [[CBS Inc.]] in 1995. Westinghouse Electric Corporation changed its name to and became [[CBS Corporation]] in 1997. In 1998, the Power Generation Business Unit, headquartered in [[Orlando, Florida]], was sold to [[Siemens AG]], of Germany. A year later, CBS sold all of its commercial nuclear power businesses to [[BNFL|British Nuclear Fuels Limited]] (BNFL). \nIn connection with that sale, certain rights to use the Westinghouse trademarks were granted to the newly formed BNFL subsidiary, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]]. That company was sold to [[Toshiba]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=TOSHIBA ACQUIRES WESTINGHOUSE FROM BNFL |url=https://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2006_02/pr0601.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Financial catastrophe and corporate reinvention===\nIn 1990, Westinghouse experienced a financial catastrophe when the Corporation lost over one billion dollars due to bad high-risk, high-fee, high-interest loans made by its [[Westinghouse Credit Corporation]] lending arm.<ref name=\"Westinghouse Electric Corporation\" />\n\nIn an attempt to revitalize the corporation, the Board of Directors appointed outside management in the form of CEO Michael Jordan, who brought in numerous consultants to help re-engineer the company in order to realize the potential that they saw in the broadcasting industry. Westinghouse reduced the workforce in many of its traditional industrial operations and made further acquisitions in broadcasting to add to its already substantial [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] network, purchasing CBS in 1995. Shortly after, Westinghouse purchased [[Infinity Broadcasting]], [[The Nashville Network|TNN]], [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]], [[American Radio Systems]], and rights to [[National Football League|NFL]] broadcasting. These investments cost the company over fifteen billion dollars. To recoup its costs, Westinghouse sold many other operations. Siemens purchased non-nuclear power generation, while other firms bought the defense electronics, office furniture company [[Knoll (company)|Knoll]], [[Thermo King]], and residential security. With little remaining of the company aside from its broadcasting, Westinghouse renamed itself CBS Corporation in 1997.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Patents==\nDuring the 20th century, Westinghouse engineers and scientists were granted more than 28,000 U.S. government patents, the third most of any company.<ref name=2009profile>2009 Westinghouse corporate profile</ref>\n\n==Products and sponsorships==\nThe company pioneered the power generation industry<ref>{{cite web|url=https://richesmi.cah.ucf.edu/omeka2/items/show/6187|title=Westinghouse Power Generation|date=1993|publisher=RICHES of Central Florida|access-date=}}</ref> and in the fields of long-distance power transmission and high-voltage [[alternating current|alternating-current]] transmission, unveiling the technology for lighting in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe first commercial Westinghouse steam turbine driven generator, a 1,500&nbsp;kW unit, began operation at [[Hartford Electric Light Company|Hartford Electric Light Co]]. in 1901. The machine, nicknamed [[Mary-Ann (turbine generator)|Mary-Ann]], was the first steam turbine generator to be installed by an electric utility to generate electricity in the US. George Westinghouse had based his original steam turbine design on designs licensed from the English inventor Charles Parsons. Today a large proportion of steam turbine generators operating around the world, ranging to units as large as 1,500 MW (or 1,000 times the original 1901 unit) were supplied by [http://findingaids.hagley.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/1969_170.xml Westinghouse from its factories in Lester, Pennsylvania]; Charlotte, North Carolina; or Hamilton, Ont. or were built overseas under Westinghouse license. Major Westinghouse licensees or joint venture partners included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and Harbin Turbine Co. and Shanghai Electric Co. of China.\n\nWestinghouse boasted 50,000 employees by 1900, and established a formal research and development department in 1906. While the company was expanding, it would experience internal financial difficulties. During the Panic of 1907, the Board of Directors forced George Westinghouse to take a six-month leave of absence. Westinghouse officially retired in 1909 and died several years later in 1914.\n\nUnder new leadership, Westinghouse Electric diversified its business activities in electrical technology. It acquired the Copeman Electric Stove Company in 1914 and Pittsburgh High Voltage Insulator Company in 1921. Westinghouse also moved into radio broadcasting by establishing Pittsburgh's [http://ethw.org/Milestones:Westinghouse_Radio_Station_KDKA,_1920 KDKA, the first commercial radio station], and WBZ in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1921. Westinghouse expanded into the elevator business, establishing the Westinghouse Elevator Company in 1928. Throughout the decade, diversification engendered considerable growth; sales went from $43 million in 1914 to $216 million in 1929.<ref name=\"Westinghouse Electric Corporation\">{{cite web|url=http://ethw.org/Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation|title=Westinghouse Electric Corporation|publisher=Engineering and Technology History Wiki|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWestinghouse produced the first operational American [[turbojet]] for the US Navy program in 1943.  After many successes, the ill-fated [[Westinghouse J40|J40]] project, started soon after WWII, was abandoned in 1955 and led to Westinghouse exiting the aircraft engine business with closure of the [[Westinghouse Aviation Gas Turbine Division]] (Kansas City) in 1960.\n\nDuring the late 1940s Westinghouse applied its aviation gas turbine technology and experience to develop its first industrial gas turbine. A 2,000&ndash;horsepower model W21 was installed in 1948 at the Mississippi River Fuel Corp gas compression station in Wilmar, Arkansas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://richesmi.cah.ucf.edu/omeka2/files/original/cddb252b6f856e57afa2326ecfcfb9bd.jpg|title=Westinghouse W21, Mississippi River Fuel Corp|date=1948|publisher=RICHES of Central Florida|access-date=}}</ref> This was the beginning of a 50-year history of Westinghouse industrial and utility gas turbine development,<ref>{{cite book|last=Scalzo.

Evolving from the Small Steam and Gas Turbine Division formed in the early 1950s, the [[Westinghouse Combustion Turbine Systems Division]] was located in Concordville, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia and the old Lester, Pennsylvania plant, until it was relocated to Power Generation headquarters in Orlando, Florida in 1987.\n\nAs a result of its participation in the US government's military program for nuclear energy applications (e.g. The Nuclear Navy) Westinghouse was instrumental in the development and commercialization of nuclear energy systems for electric power generation.  This business currently operates as the [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], and is owned by Toshiba of Japan. [[\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France|Electricite de France (EDF)]] a major global player in the nuclear power business, was a long-time licensee of the Westinghouse nuclear technology.\n\nAdditional major industrial products in the widespread Westinghouse portfolio included electric motors of all sizes, elevators and escalators, controls and lighting. The Large Motor Division, once headquartered in Buffalo, NY, entered a joint venture with Taiwan Electric Co. (TECO) in the 1970s and today operates as TECO-Westinghouse.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tecowestinghouse.com/ | title=TECO-Westinghouse Motor Company, a world leader in manufacturing electric motors and generators, supplying motor controls, and providing engineering services, genuine Westinghouse renewal parts and large motor repairs}}</ref>  Much of Westinghouse's higher voltage power equipment was sold to ABB in 1989 and renamed the ABB Power T&D Company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://new.abb.com/us/about/abb-in-brief/history |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103072938/http://new.abb.com/us/about/abb-in-brief/history |archive-date=2017-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Westinghouse Transportation Division (est. 1894) supplied equipment and controls for many North American [[interurban]] and [[streetcar]] lines, the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART), Washington DC METRO ([[WMATA]]), New York City Subway (NYCT) equipment from the 1890s elevated era to the R68A in 1988, among many other heavy rail and rail transit systems and [[List of Westinghouse locomotives|built locomotives]], often in partnership with [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]], [[Lima Locomotive Works|Lima-Hamilton]] as well as supplying electrical and traction equipment for [[Fairbanks-Morse]] [[List of Fairbanks-Morse locomotives|diesel locomotives]].  The division designed and built Automated People Movers (APMs) at several major U.S. airports, including Tampa, Dallas-Ft. Worth and Orlando.  The Transportation Division was sold to [[AEG]] of Germany (1988), which merged into a joint venture of [[ABB]] and [[Daimler AG|Daimler Benz]] named [[AdTranz]] in 1996. Ultimately, the unit was acquired by Bombardier of Canada in 2001 and is still headquartered in Pittsburgh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.bombardier.com/us/library/documents/Pittsburgh_en.pdf|title=Bombardier, Pittsburgh Fact Sheet}}</ref>\n\nWestinghouse was also a leader in the design and manufacturing of household electrical products including radios, televisions, and other audio/video equipment, and both small and large electric appliances of all kinds, from hair dryers and electric irons to clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators and air conditioning units.  For many years Westinghouse was a familiar household name and favored brand.  After more than 50 years, and after playing a strong No. 2 to rival General Electric for most of that time, Westinghouse decided to exit the appliance business in the mid- 1970s. [[White-Westinghouse]] was formed when White Consolidated acquired the Westinghouse appliance unit in 1975.\n\nThe company is also known for its [[Westinghouse Time Capsules|time capsule contributions]] during the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and [[1964 New York World's Fair]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} They also participated in the [[St. Louis World's Fair]] in 1904.

One phase of the cleanup effort describes Westinghouse Electric Corporation's facility, designated \"Disposal Area F\" and the \"Former Runoff Basin Area,\" which are contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) and arsenic, will be cleaned up using a combination of soil excavation and [[soil vapor extraction]]. At Disposal Area F, the area of contamination is about 0.3 acres. At the Former Runoff Basin Area, the contaminated soils cover approximately 0.7 acres. Disposal of the excavated soils occurred at appropriate off-site facilities. The removal of the PAHs and arsenic contamination will protect site workers and employees at the Westinghouse facility and the cleanup of the VOCs will help restore the quality of the Newtown Creek Aquifer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cleanup of Horseheads Superfund Site|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d10ed0d99d826b068525735900400c2a/967db9438cd0be4785257266006b771b|publisher=EPA}}</ref>{{verify source|date=February 2018}} In 1986, Westinghouse entered a joint venture at this plant with Toshiba to produce CRTs.

January 8, 1886, by [[George Westinghouse]]. It was originally named '''Westinghouse Electric Company''', and was renamed Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1945. The company acquired the [[CBS]] television network in 1995, and was renamed CBS Corporation before being acquired by [[Viacom (1952&ndash;2006)|Viacom]] in 1999.\n\n{{As of|2019|8}}, the Westinghouse brand is managed by the [[Westinghouse Licensing Corporation]], a subsidiary of [[ViacomCBS]] that became the legal successor to Viacom. The nuclear power business, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1999.\n\n==History==\n[[File:George Westinghouse.jpg|150px|thumb|right|George Westinghouse]]\nWestinghouse Electric was founded by [[George Westinghouse]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] in 1886. The firm became active in developing [[electric]] infrastructure throughout the United States.

Shallenberger]], [[William Stanley (physicist)|William Stanley]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Stephen Timoshenko]] and [[Vladimir Zworykin]].\n\nEarly on, Westinghouse was a rival to [[Thomas Edison]]'s electric company. In 1892, Edison was merged with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], making an even bigger competitor, [[General Electric]]. Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company changed its name to '''Westinghouse Electric Corporation''' in 1945.\n\nWestinghouse purchased [[CBS Inc.]] in 1995. Westinghouse Electric Corporation changed its name to and became [[CBS Corporation]] in 1997. In 1998, the Power Generation Business Unit, headquartered in [[Orlando, Florida]], was sold to [[Siemens AG]], of Germany. A year later, CBS sold all of its commercial nuclear power businesses to [[BNFL|British Nuclear Fuels Limited]] (BNFL). \nIn connection with that sale, certain rights to use the Westinghouse trademarks were granted to the newly formed BNFL subsidiary, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]]. That company was sold to [[Toshiba]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=TOSHIBA ACQUIRES WESTINGHOUSE FROM BNFL |url=https://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2006_02/pr0601.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Financial catastrophe and corporate reinvention===\nIn 1990, Westinghouse experienced a financial catastrophe when the Corporation lost over one billion dollars due to bad high-risk, high-fee, high-interest loans made by its [[Westinghouse Credit Corporation]] lending arm.<ref name=\"Westinghouse Electric Corporation\" />\n\nIn an attempt to revitalize the corporation, the Board of Directors appointed outside management in the form of CEO Michael Jordan, who brought in numerous consultants to help re-engineer the company in order to realize the potential that they saw in the broadcasting industry. Westinghouse reduced the workforce in many of its traditional industrial operations and made further acquisitions in broadcasting to add to its already substantial [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] network, purchasing CBS in 1995. Shortly after, Westinghouse purchased [[Infinity Broadcasting]], [[The Nashville Network|TNN]], [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]], [[American Radio Systems]], and rights to [[National Football League|NFL]] broadcasting. These investments cost the company over fifteen billion dollars. To recoup its costs, Westinghouse sold many other operations. Siemens purchased non-nuclear power generation, while other firms bought the defense electronics, office furniture company [[Knoll (company)|Knoll]], [[Thermo King]], and residential security. With little remaining of the company aside from its broadcasting, Westinghouse renamed itself CBS Corporation in 1997.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Patents==\nDuring the 20th century, Westinghouse engineers and scientists were granted more than 28,000 U.S. government patents, the third most of any company.<ref name=2009profile>2009 Westinghouse corporate profile</ref>\n\n==Products and sponsorships==\nThe company pioneered the power generation industry<ref>{{cite web|url=https://richesmi.cah.ucf.edu/omeka2/items/show/6187|title=Westinghouse Power Generation|date=1993|publisher=RICHES of Central Florida|access-date=}}</ref> and in the fields of long-distance power transmission and high-voltage [[alternating current|alternating-current]] transmission, unveiling the technology for lighting in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe first commercial Westinghouse steam turbine driven generator, a 1,500&nbsp;kW unit, began operation at [[Hartford Electric Light Company|Hartford Electric Light Co]]. in 1901. The machine, nicknamed [[Mary-Ann (turbine generator)|Mary-Ann]], was the first steam turbine generator to be installed by an electric utility to generate electricity in the US. George Westinghouse had based his original steam turbine design on designs licensed from the English inventor Charles Parsons. Today a large proportion of steam turbine generators operating around the world, ranging to units as large as 1,500 MW (or 1,000 times the original 1901 unit) were supplied by [http://findingaids.hagley.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/1969_170.xml Westinghouse from its factories in Lester, Pennsylvania]; Charlotte, North Carolina; or Hamilton, Ont. or were built overseas under Westinghouse license. Major Westinghouse licensees or joint venture partners included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and Harbin Turbine Co. and Shanghai Electric Co. of China.\n\nWestinghouse boasted 50,000 employees by 1900, and established a formal research and development department in 1906. While the company was expanding, it would experience internal financial difficulties. During the Panic of 1907, the Board of Directors forced George Westinghouse to take a six-month leave of absence. Westinghouse officially retired in 1909 and died several years later in 1914.\n\nUnder new leadership, Westinghouse Electric diversified its business activities in electrical technology. It acquired the Copeman Electric Stove Company in 1914 and Pittsburgh High Voltage Insulator Company in 1921. Westinghouse also moved into radio broadcasting by establishing Pittsburgh's [http://ethw.org/Milestones:Westinghouse_Radio_Station_KDKA,_1920 KDKA, the first commercial radio station], and WBZ in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1921. Westinghouse expanded into the elevator business, establishing the Westinghouse Elevator Company in 1928. Throughout the decade, diversification engendered considerable growth; sales went from $43 million in 1914 to $216 million in 1929.<ref name=\"Westinghouse Electric Corporation\">{{cite web|url=http://ethw.org/Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation|title=Westinghouse Electric Corporation|publisher=Engineering and Technology History Wiki|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWestinghouse produced the first operational American [[turbojet]] for the US Navy program in 1943.  After many successes, the ill-fated [[Westinghouse J40|J40]] project, started soon after WWII, was abandoned in 1955 and led to Westinghouse exiting the aircraft engine business with closure of the [[Westinghouse Aviation Gas Turbine Division]] (Kansas City) in 1960.\n\nDuring the late 1940s Westinghouse applied its aviation gas turbine technology and experience to develop its first industrial gas turbine. A 2,000&ndash;horsepower model W21 was installed in 1948 at the Mississippi River Fuel Corp gas compression station in Wilmar, Arkansas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://richesmi.cah.ucf.edu/omeka2/files/original/cddb252b6f856e57afa2326ecfcfb9bd.jpg|title=Westinghouse W21, Mississippi River Fuel Corp|date=1948|publisher=RICHES of Central Florida|access-date=}}</ref> This was the beginning of a 50-year history of Westinghouse industrial and utility gas turbine development,<ref>{{cite book|last=Scalzo.

Evolving from the Small Steam and Gas Turbine Division formed in the early 1950s, the [[Westinghouse Combustion Turbine Systems Division]] was located in Concordville, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia and the old Lester, Pennsylvania plant, until it was relocated to Power Generation headquarters in Orlando, Florida in 1987.\n\nAs a result of its participation in the US government's military program for nuclear energy applications (e.g. The Nuclear Navy) Westinghouse was instrumental in the development and commercialization of nuclear energy systems for electric power generation.  This business currently operates as the [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], and is owned by Toshiba of Japan. [[\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France|Electricite de France (EDF)]] a major global player in the nuclear power business, was a long-time licensee of the Westinghouse nuclear technology.\n\nAdditional major industrial products in the widespread Westinghouse portfolio included electric motors of all sizes, elevators and escalators, controls and lighting. The Large Motor Division, once headquartered in Buffalo, NY, entered a joint venture with Taiwan Electric Co. (TECO) in the 1970s and today operates as TECO-Westinghouse.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tecowestinghouse.com/ | title=TECO-Westinghouse Motor Company, a world leader in manufacturing electric motors and generators, supplying motor controls, and providing engineering services, genuine Westinghouse renewal parts and large motor repairs}}</ref>  Much of Westinghouse's higher voltage power equipment was sold to ABB in 1989 and renamed the ABB Power T&D Company.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://new.abb.com/us/about/abb-in-brief/history |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103072938/http://new.abb.com/us/about/abb-in-brief/history |archive-date=2017-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Westinghouse Transportation Division (est. 1894) supplied equipment and controls for many North American [[interurban]] and [[streetcar]] lines, the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART), Washington DC METRO ([[WMATA]]), New York City Subway (NYCT) equipment from the 1890s elevated era to the R68A in 1988, among many other heavy rail and rail transit systems and [[List of Westinghouse locomotives|built locomotives]], often in partnership with [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]], [[Lima Locomotive Works|Lima-Hamilton]] as well as supplying electrical and traction equipment for [[Fairbanks-Morse]] [[List of Fairbanks-Morse locomotives|diesel locomotives]].  The division designed and built Automated People Movers (APMs) at several major U.S. airports, including Tampa, Dallas-Ft. Worth and Orlando.  The Transportation Division was sold to [[AEG]] of Germany (1988), which merged into a joint venture of [[ABB]] and [[Daimler AG|Daimler Benz]] named [[AdTranz]] in 1996. Ultimately, the unit was acquired by Bombardier of Canada in 2001 and is still headquartered in Pittsburgh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.bombardier.com/us/library/documents/Pittsburgh_en.pdf|title=Bombardier, Pittsburgh Fact Sheet}}</ref>\n\nWestinghouse was also a leader in the design and manufacturing of household electrical products including radios, televisions, and other audio/video equipment, and both small and large electric appliances of all kinds, from hair dryers and electric irons to clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators and air conditioning units.  For many years Westinghouse was a familiar household name and favored brand.  After more than 50 years, and after playing a strong No. 2 to rival General Electric for most of that time, Westinghouse decided to exit the appliance business in the mid- 1970s. [[White-Westinghouse]] was formed when White Consolidated acquired the Westinghouse appliance unit in 1975.\n\nThe company is also known for its [[Westinghouse Time Capsules|time capsule contributions]] during the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and [[1964 New York World's Fair]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} They also participated in the [[St. Louis World's Fair]] in 1904.

They were deemed responsible for pollution at the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Superfund site in [[Horseheads, New York]].  Westinghouse polluted nearby soil, affecting the safety of a nearby aquifer and wells used by residents.  One phase of the cleanup effort describes Westinghouse Electric Corporation's facility, designated \"Disposal Area F\" and the \"Former Runoff Basin Area,\" which are contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) and arsenic, will be cleaned up using a combination of soil excavation and [[soil vapor extraction]]. At Disposal Area F, the area of contamination is about 0.3 acres. At the Former Runoff Basin Area, the contaminated soils cover approximately 0.7 acres. Disposal of the excavated soils occurred at appropriate off-site facilities. The removal of the PAHs and arsenic contamination will protect site workers and employees at the Westinghouse facility and the cleanup of the VOCs will help restore the quality of the Newtown Creek Aquifer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cleanup of Horseheads Superfund Site|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d10ed0d99d826b068525735900400c2a/967db9438cd0be4785257266006b771b|publisher=EPA}}</ref>{{verify source|date=February 2018}} In 1986, Westinghouse entered a joint venture at this plant with Toshiba to produce CRTs.

It is named after the essayist and social critic [[John Ruskin]] (1819\u20131900) and specialises in providing [[Adult education|educational opportunities for adults]] with few or no qualifications. The college is an affiliate of the University of Oxford; this relationship allows students special privileges such as attending lectures and the use of most facilities.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Mission and purpose ==\n\nThe mission of the college has always been to provide educational opportunities to adults who are excluded and disadvantaged, and to transform the individuals concerned along with the communities, groups and societies from which they come, the only change having been to personalise the language (away from 'the excluded', who do not sound like people) in line with growing equalities awareness. The mission statement is twofold:\n\n* The first aim, that of giving individuals a second chance in education, continues to be achieved by admitting those with few or no formal qualifications to courses of study that can result in, or lead on to, university-level qualifications.\n* The second aim, the transformational element of the mission, is evidenced by the fact that the most frequent thing former students say about Ruskin is that it changed their lives. Students, whether or not they themselves are resident, benefit from studying in a setting with a strong sense of academic community and from the intensive tutorial teaching that Ruskin offers. The college is also transformational because it sees education as a vehicle for progressive social change.\n\nRuskin tends towards a curriculum that has high social relevance, students who want to make a difference in the world, and forms of academic scholarship and research that are engaged and applied.\n\nRuskin's mission is also pursued by means of strong historical links, nationally and internationally, with the labour and [[Trade Unions|trade union movement]], other social movements and activism around social issues (e.g., anti-[[ageism]]), as well as with local communities, for example through the Social Work and Youth and [[Community work]] programmes.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ruskin-Hall-students.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Part of the 1901 class of students at Ruskin Hall, Oxford (Ruskin College).]]\n\nRuskin College \u2013 originally known as Ruskin Hall, Oxford<ref name=Edwards>\"Ruskin Hall, Oxford: The People's University,\" in Joseph Edwards (ed.), ''The Reformer's Year Book: 1902.'' Glasgow: Joseph Edwards, 1902; p. 71.</ref> \u2013 was established in 1899 specifically to provide educational opportunities for working-class men, who were denied access to university. It was deliberately placed in [[Oxford]], the city in which its young American founders, [[Charles A. Beard]], James Alfred Dale ''MA (Oxon)'' (1875-1951) Lecturer at Merton College Oxford and later Professor of McGill and Toronto universities in Canada, and Walter Vrooman, had studied, because the city symbolised the educational privilege and standards to which ordinary people could never previously have aspired. It was Walter Vrooman's then wife, Amne (later Amne Grafflin), who financially supported the foundation of the college.\n\nThe school was envisioned as a mechanism by which \"working-class reformers\" could \"educate themselves efficiently at nominal cost.\"<ref name=Edwards /> Tuition, lodging, and board was priced at 12-1/2 [[shillings]] per week (20 shillings = \u00a31), with a parallel [[distance education|correspondence course]] alternatively offered for 1 shilling per week plus a 1 shilling entrance fee.<ref name=Edwards /> Courses were offered in [[political economy]], sociology, the history of the labour movement, principles of politics, English literature, [[psychology]], and other related aspects of the social sciences.<ref name=Edwards />\n\nThe school was administered by a General Council, which included elected representatives from the Parliamentary Committee of the [[Trade Union Congress]] and the Central Board of the [[Co-operatives UK|Cooperative Union]].<ref name=Edwards /> An auxiliary organisation of supporters of the school was launched in 1901, the Ruskin Hall Educational League, which arranged conferences and public lectures in conjunction with the activities of the school.<ref name=Edwards />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], some of the two hundred Belgian refugees who came to Oxford were lodged in the college.<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of the University of Oxford: Volume VIII: The Twentieth Century \u2013 Oxford Scholarship|url = http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001/acprof-9780198229742|doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001|last = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nRuskin College became, in turn, a symbol of [[labour movement|workers']] education. It served as a model for labour colleges around the world, and [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] made a point of visiting during a brief stay in Oxford in 1931 because he had been so inspired by the writings of [[John Ruskin]] on workers' education, just as the college founders had been.\n\nRuskin College was a [[Secularism|secular]] sister-school to and model for [[Plater College]] until Plater's closing in 2005.<ref>Philpot, Terry , [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=200278&sectioncode=26 \"No second chance for giver of fresh starts\"], ''Times Higher Education'', 9 December 2005.</ref>\n\n=== Strike of 1909 ===\n\nIn 1908, a group of Ruskin students, dissatisfied with its education policy which they viewed as too pro-establishment and imbued with elements of \"social control\", formed the [[Plebs' League]].

It is named after the essayist and social critic [[John Ruskin]] (1819\u20131900) and specialises in providing [[Adult education|educational opportunities for adults]] with few or no qualifications. The college is an affiliate of the University of Oxford; this relationship allows students special privileges such as attending lectures and the use of most facilities.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Mission and purpose ==\n\nThe mission of the college has always been to provide educational opportunities to adults who are excluded and disadvantaged, and to transform the individuals concerned along with the communities, groups and societies from which they come, the only change having been to personalise the language (away from 'the excluded', who do not sound like people) in line with growing equalities awareness. The mission statement is twofold:\n\n* The first aim, that of giving individuals a second chance in education, continues to be achieved by admitting those with few or no formal qualifications to courses of study that can result in, or lead on to, university-level qualifications.\n* The second aim, the transformational element of the mission, is evidenced by the fact that the most frequent thing former students say about Ruskin is that it changed their lives. Students, whether or not they themselves are resident, benefit from studying in a setting with a strong sense of academic community and from the intensive tutorial teaching that Ruskin offers. The college is also transformational because it sees education as a vehicle for progressive social change.\n\nRuskin tends towards a curriculum that has high social relevance, students who want to make a difference in the world, and forms of academic scholarship and research that are engaged and applied.\n\nRuskin\u2019s mission is also pursued by means of strong historical links, nationally and internationally, with the labour and [[Trade Unions|trade union movement]], other social movements and activism around social issues (e.g., anti-[[ageism]]), as well as with local communities, for example through the Social Work and Youth and [[Community work]] programmes.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ruskin-Hall-students.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Part of the 1901 class of students at Ruskin Hall, Oxford (Ruskin College).]]\n\nRuskin College \u2013 originally known as Ruskin Hall, Oxford<ref name=Edwards>\"Ruskin Hall, Oxford: The People's University,\" in Joseph Edwards (ed.), ''The Reformer's Year Book: 1902.''

It was deliberately placed in [[Oxford]], the city in which its young American founders, [[Charles A. Beard]], James Alfred Dale ''MA (Oxon)'' (1875-1951) Lecturer at Merton College Oxford and later Professor of McGill and Toronto universities in Canada, and Walter Vrooman, had studied, because the city symbolised the educational privilege and standards to which ordinary people could never previously have aspired. It was Walter Vrooman's then wife, Amne (later Amne Grafflin), who financially supported the foundation of the college.\n\nThe school was envisioned as a mechanism by which \"working-class reformers\" could \"educate themselves efficiently at nominal cost.\"<ref name=Edwards /> Tuition, lodging, and board was priced at 12-1/2 [[shillings]] per week (20 shillings = \u00a31), with a parallel [[distance education|correspondence course]] alternatively offered for 1 shilling per week plus a 1 shilling entrance fee.<ref name=Edwards /> Courses were offered in [[political economy]], sociology, the history of the labour movement, principles of politics, English literature, [[psychology]], and other related aspects of the social sciences.<ref name=Edwards />\n\nThe school was administered by a General Council, which included elected representatives from the Parliamentary Committee of the [[Trade Union Congress]] and the Central Board of the [[Co-operatives UK|Cooperative Union]].<ref name=Edwards /> An auxiliary organisation of supporters of the school was launched in 1901, the Ruskin Hall Educational League, which arranged conferences and public lectures in conjunction with the activities of the school.<ref name=Edwards />\n\nDuring [[World War I]], some of the two hundred Belgian refugees who came to Oxford were lodged in the college.<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of the University of Oxford: Volume VIII: The Twentieth Century \u2013 Oxford Scholarship|url = http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001/acprof-9780198229742|doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001|last = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nRuskin College became, in turn, a symbol of [[labour movement|workers']] education. It served as a model for labour colleges around the world, and [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] made a point of visiting during a brief stay in Oxford in 1931 because he had been so inspired by the writings of [[John Ruskin]] on workers' education, just as the college founders had been.\n\nRuskin College was a [[Secularism|secular]] sister-school to and model for [[Plater College]] until Plater's closing in 2005.<ref>Philpot, Terry , [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=200278&sectioncode=26 \"No second chance for giver of fresh starts\"], ''Times Higher Education'', 9 December 2005.</ref>\n\n=== Strike of 1909 ===\n\nIn 1908, a group of Ruskin students, dissatisfied with its education policy which they viewed as too pro-establishment and imbued with elements of \"social control\", formed the [[Plebs' League]].

There is also a post graduate programme and an international section involving: International Labour and Trade Union Studies; Webb and [[Chevening Scholar]]s.\n\nThe Ruskin Fellowship was founded in the academic year 1911/1912 and held its first \"Annual Meet\" on 27 May 1912.  This tradition continues with an Annual Reunion held in September of each year. The Reunion is held over a weekend and incorporates speakers on relevant topics, a social activity including a bar, music and a buffet and, on the Sunday morning of the Reunion weekend, the Fellowship's Annual General Meeting (AGM). The AGM elects an Executive Committee to run the Fellowship for the following 12 months. A history of the Fellowship was produced in 2012 to mark the centenary of the Fellowship's first \"Annual Meet\".\n\nA pamphlet on ''The History of the College and the Fellowship During World War One'' has been published as part of the commemoration of the War.\n\nThe Ruskin Fellowship has a web page that can be accessed through the home page of the College's website.\n\n== Students Union ==\nThe Ruskin Students Union is known for its political and social endeavours.

They primarily compete in [[NCAA Division I]] as members of the [[Patriot League]]. In ice hockey, a sport not sponsored by the Patriot League for either sex, the Crusaders are members of two other leagues, with men competing in the [[Atlantic Hockey|Atlantic Hockey Association]] and women in [[Hockey East]]. The men's rowing team is part of the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges. Of its 25 varsity teams, Holy Cross supports 12 men's and 13 women's sports,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goholycross.com|title=Holy Cross Crusaders - College of the Holy Cross Official Athletic Site|website=www.goholycross.com|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> giving Holy Cross the largest ratio of teams-per-enrollment in the country.  Holy Cross's athletic teams for both men and women are known as the [[Crusades|Crusaders]].\n\nHoly Cross is a founding member of the [[Patriot League]], and boasts that one-quarter of its student body participates in its varsity athletic programs. Principal facilities include [[Fitton Field]] for football (capacity: 23,500) and baseball (3,000), the [[Hart Center]] at the Luth Athletic Complex for basketball (3,600) and ice hockey (1,400), the [[Linda Johnson Smith Soccer Stadium]] (1,320), and the Smith Wellness Center, located inside the Luth Athletic Complex.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goholycross.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=210235766&DB_OEM_ID=33100&DB_OEM_ID=33100 |title=Facilities |accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe College is one of nine schools to have won an NCAA championship in both baseball ([[1952 College World Series|1952]]) and basketball ([[1947 NCAA Tournament|1947]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theonlycolors.com/2013/6/25/4465326/national-championships-by-the-numbers|title=National Championships by the Numbers|website=SB Nation}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Holy Cross Crusaders|Men's sports|Women's sports}}\n|-\n| [[Holy Cross Crusaders baseball|Baseball]] || [[Holy Cross Crusaders women's basketball|Basketball]]\n|-\n| [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Basketball]] || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country || Field hockey\n|-\n| [[Holy Cross Crusaders football|Football]] || Golf\n|-\n| Golf || Ice hockey\n|-\n| [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's ice hockey|Ice hockey]] || Lacrosse\n|-\n|[[Holy Cross Crusaders men's lacrosse|Lacrosse]]|| Rowing\n|- \n| Rowing || Soccer\n|-\n| Soccer || Softball\n|-\n| Swimming & diving || Swimming & diving\n|-\n| Tennis || Tennis\n|- \n| Track & field<sup>\u2020</sup> || Track & field<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA secondary color cell|Holy Cross Crusaders}}\" | {{small|\u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor.}}\n|}\n\n===Baseball===\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders baseball}}\nThe Holy Cross baseball team won the NCAA National Championship in [[1952 Holy Cross Crusaders baseball team|1952]] and remains the only team from the northeastern part of the United States to have won the [[College World Series]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/ncaa/cws/history.html|title=ESPN.com: NCAA - College World Series history |website=static.espn.go.com|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> The Crusaders also reached the College World Series in 1958, 1962, and 1963. In the last two of these seasons, the team featured pitcher [[Dick Joyce (baseball)|Dick Joyce]], who briefly made the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]], and third baseman [[John Peterman]], who after a short minor-league career went on to become [[The J. Peterman Company|a successful entrepreneur]] who was [[Jacopo Peterman|parodied on ''Seinfeld'']]. The Crusaders won their first Patriot League Baseball Tournament title in 2017 and returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1978 where it defeated No. 25 Nebraska.\n\n===Basketball===\n\n==== Men's basketball====\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball}}\nThe Holy Cross men's basketball team has won two national tournament championships having won the NCAA Tournament in [[1946-47 Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball team|1947]] and the National Invitation Tournament in 1954 at a time when the NIT was considered to be equal to if not more prestigious than the NCAA Tournament. The team also has reached the Final Four in 1948 and the Elite Eight in 1950 and 1953. In 2016, the team captured its first win in an NCAA Tournament game since the 1953 season. Notable former players include [[Boston Celtics]] legends and [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] inductees [[Bob Cousy]] and [[Tom Heinsohn]].\n\n====Women's basketball====\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders women's basketball}}\nThe Holy Cross women's basketball team has also made several appearances in the postseason including 12 trips to the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] as well as one appearance in both the [[Women's National Invitation Tournament]] and the [[Women's Basketball Invitational]]. They are 1\u201312 in the NCAA Tournament with the lone win coming in 1991 as an upset over 6th seeded Maryland. This is the only victory in the NCAA Tournament for any team from the Patriot League. Six-time Patriot League Coach of the Year Bill Gibbons recorded his 500th win early in the 2011\u20132012 campaign.\n\n===Football===\n[[File:FittonField2.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Visitor side of football stadium (2008)]]\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders football}}\nThe Holy Cross football team played in the [[1946 Orange Bowl]]. The team has since made the FCS postseason in 1983 and 2009. In 1987, the team went undefeated and finished first in the national polls despite the Patriot League not allowing its teams to participate in the NCAA Tournament. Notable former players include [[Bill Osmanski]] who went on to win four NFL Championships with the [[Chicago Bears]] and two-time [[Heisman Trophy]] finalist [[Gordie Lockbaum]].\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders men's ice hockey}}\nOn March 24, 2006, the Holy Cross men's hockey team made history by defeating the Golden Gophers of the [[University of Minnesota]] in the first round of the [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]] by the score of 4&ndash;3, in overtime. Coined as one of the biggest upsets in NCAA ice hockey history, never since the NCAA tourney expanded to sixteen teams had a sixteen seed beat a number one seed until again in 2015 when the 16th seeded [[RIT Tigers men's ice hockey|RIT Tigers]] defeated the first seeded [[Minnesota State Mavericks]] by a score of 2\u20131.<ref>[http://www.collegehockeynews.com/news/2006/03/24_holycow.php Crusaders Pull Off Stunner, Win One for the Little Guy.

In 1917, Andrew Kelly set the world record in the 300 yard dash. [[Joe Tierney]] won the [[IC4A]] 440 yard title in 1925, and [[James Quinn (athlete)|James Quinn]] won the [[IC4A]] 100 yard in 1928 before going on to win an Olympic gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay. In the early 1960s, Charlie Buchta and Kevin Kilgallen were prominent Crusaders on the national scene.\n\nThe Holy Cross golf team has also produced some exceptional golfers including [[Willie Turnesa]] who won two US Amateur titles and a British Amateur, and [[Paul Harney]] who, after earning a medal at the 1952 NCAA championship, won six PGA Tour events and was inducted into the PGA of America Hall of Fame.\n\nIn recent years, the soccer programs made their first NCAA Tournament appearances with the women appearing in [[2000 NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Tournament|2000]] and the men appearing in [[2002 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|2002]].\nIn [[2006 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship|2006]] and [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship|2007]], the women's [[lacrosse]] team made its first NCAA Tournament appearances, defeating LeMoyne in the NCAA play-in game before falling to Duke in 2006, and losing to Northwestern in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patriotleague.cstv.com/sports/w-lacros/spec-rel/051106aaa.html|title=Women's Lacrosse NCAA Preview: Difficulty Increases as Holy Cross Draws Duke.

Key highlights include the women's team winning several New England championships and the 2002 ECAC National Invitational, and the men's varsity eight finishing ranked within the national top 20 in 2005, 2006, 2013, and 2015. In 2016, the men's varsity four finished fourth at the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]] National Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goholycross.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=210998188&DB_OEM_ID=33100|title=Crusaders Finish Fourth In The Nation|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> The women's team competes in the Patriot League and also holds membership in the Eastern College Athletic Conference. As the NCAA and Patriot League do not sponsor men's rowing, the men's team was granted an acceptance into the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC), which is composed of the traditional Ivy League schools plus other select universities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://goholycross.cstv.com/sports/m-rowing/spec-rel/012307aaa.html|title=Refreshing to... |website=goholycross.cstv.com |accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\nHoly Cross student-athletes are among the most academically successful in the nation. In 2016, the Crusaders\u2019 overall Graduation Success Rate of 97 percent for all student-athletes tied for the 17th best mark in the country out of 351 Division I schools. That marked the 10th straight year in which Holy Cross posted a Graduation Success Rate of at least 97 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goholycross.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=33100&ATCLID=211298193|title=Holy Cross Among National Leaders In Graduation Success Rate|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2016, 14 Holy Cross varsity athletic teams received Division I Academic Progress Rate (APR) public recognition awards from the NCAA. These teams posted multi-year APR scores in the top 10 percent of all squads in their respective sports. The 14 total teams earning public recognition awards put Holy Cross in the top 10 among all Division I athletic programs. The Crusaders finished tied for eighth in the nation out of 356 schools, placing them in the top three percent of all of Division I.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goholycross.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=33100&ATCLID=210886497|title=14 Holy Cross Teams Receive NCAA Public Recognition Awards |accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Championships==\n===NCAA Team Championships===\nHoly Cross has won two NCAA team national championships:\n\n*'''Men's (2)'''\n**[[College World Series#Mens team titles|Baseball]] (1): [[1952 College World Series|1952]]\n**[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Team titles|Basketball]] (1): [[1947 NCAA Basketball Tournament|1947]]\n\n===Other national team championships===\nHoly Cross also claims two national championships not recognized by the NCAA:\n\n*'''Men's (2)'''\n**[[National Invitational Tournament#Basketball|Basketball]] (1): [[1954 National Invitation Tournament|1954]]*\n**[[Football Championship Subdivision|Football]] (1): [[1987 NCAA Division I-AA football rankings|1987]]**\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> - The NIT was widely considered equally prestigious to the NCAA Tournament at the time, particularly because it was played at the high-profile Madison Square Garden.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> \u2013 The Patriot League did not allow its members to participate in the 1-AA football playoffs during its early years, but the undefeated Crusaders finished first in the national polls and [[the Sporting News]] declared them National Champions.\n\n===Conference Championships===\nHoly Cross has won more than 50 regular season and/or postseason conference championships throughout its history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goholycross.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=33100&ATCLID=211423790|title=Holy Cross' Conference Championship Teams |accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> The majority of these have come in the Patriot League, where it currently competes for most sports.\n\n*'''Patriot League Champions'''\n** Baseball - 2013, [[2017 Patriot League Baseball Tournament|2017]]\n** [[Patriot League Men's Basketball Tournament|Men's Basketball]] \u2013 1993, 1994, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, [[2016 Patriot League Men's Basketball Tournament|2016]]\n** [[Patriot League Women's Basketball Tournament|Women's Basketball]] \u2013 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007\n** Field Hockey \u2013 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001\n** Football \u2013 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991, 2009\n** Women's Lacrosse \u2013 2006, 2007\n** [[Patriot League Men's Soccer Tournament|Men's Soccer]] \u2013 1995, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2007\n** Women's Soccer \u2013 2000\n** Softball \u2013 1998\n*'''Atlantic Hockey Champions'''\n** Men's Ice Hockey \u2013 [[2004 Atlantic Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2004]], [[2006 Atlantic Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2006]]\n*'''Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Champions'''\n** Baseball \u2013 1986\n** Men's Basketball \u2013 1990 \n** Women's Basketball \u2013 1984, 1985, 1989\n** Women's Cross Country \u2013 1983, 1984, 1985\n** Men's Ice Hockey \u2013 [[1999 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1999]] \n** Women's Tennis \u2013 1986, 1988\n*'''Eastern College Athletic Conference Champions'''\n** Men's Basketball \u2013  1977, 1980\n** Women's Ice Hockey \u2013 2009, 2010, 2011\n*'''New England Hockey Conference Open Tournament Champions'''\n** Women's Ice hockey \u2013  2015, 2016\n\n==Nickname==\nIt is reported that the name \"Crusader\" was first associated with Holy Cross in 1884 at an alumni banquet in Boston, where an engraved Crusader mounted on an armored horse appeared at the head of the menu.<ref name=\"color\">[http://www.holycross.edu/abouthc/why/history/color/ Holy Cross: Color, Mascot, & Songs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421025858/http://www.holycross.edu/abouthc/why/history/color/ |date=2009-04-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe name was rediscovered by Stanley Woodward, a sports reporter for the ''Boston Herald'', when he used the term \"Crusader\" to describe the Holy Cross baseball team in a story written in 1925. The name appealed to the Holy Cross student body, which held a vote later in that year to decide whether this cognomen or one of the other two currently in use \u2013 \"Chiefs\" and \"Sagamores\"- would be adopted. On October 6, 1925, ''The Tomahawk'', an earlier name of the student newspaper, reported that the results of the ballot were: Crusaders 143, Chiefs 17, Sagamores 7.<ref name=\"color\"/>\n\nOwing to the [[Post-9/11]] controversy over the \u201cCrusaders\u201d nickname,<ref>Glenn Arthur Pierce, \"5 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Team Nicknames and Mascots\" (2015/2016), https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/7301999-5-things-you-didn-t-know-about-team-nicknames-and-mascots, 2015/2016.</ref> only Holy Cross and [[Valparaiso Crusaders|Valparaiso University]] maintain Crusaders at the NCAA Division I level.\n\n==School colors==\n[[File:HCGTMB1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Holy Cross \"Goodtime\" Marching Band in the familiar HC formation]]\n\nThe school color is [[royal purple]].<ref>http://www.nmnathletics.com/fls/33100/sports/football/2015/2015-hc-fb-fb.pdf</ref> There are two theories of how Holy Cross chose purple as its official color. One suggests it was derived from the royal purple used by Emperor Constantine the Great (born about 275 A.D., died in 337 AD) as displayed on his labarum (military standard) and on those of later Christian emperors of Rome.<ref name=\"color\"/>\n\nThe other version is attributed to Walter J. Connors, an 1887 graduate, and was printed in the October 1940 issue of the Alumnus. According to the account, there was a disagreement during the 1870s between Holy Cross students from Massachusetts and Connecticut concerning the schools' baseball uniform colors. Those from Massachusetts purportedly favored the crimson of Harvard, while those from Connecticut favored the deep blue of Yale. Legend has it that a fellow student with a sense of diplomacy resolved the dispute in the chemistry lab, where he mixed copper sulphate (blue) with iron oxide (red) to produce the color of deep purple.<ref name=\"color\"/>\n\n==Boston College rivalry==\nHistorically, Holy Cross' major rival has been the [[Boston College Eagles|Eagles of Boston College]], especially in football. Boston College does not share this view as far as Holy Cross being a \"rival\". In 1896, Holy Cross and Boston College played the first football game between the two schools.\n\nTo accommodate larger crowds, the Holy Cross game was routinely held at larger venues off campus, with the 1916 matchup taking place at the newly constructed [[Fenway Park]]. A record 54,000 attended the 1922 game at [[Braves Field]], home of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] baseball team. On November 28, 1942, Holy Cross beat BC in a huge upset by a score of 55\u201312, a result that proved fortunate for the losing Eagles. The BC team had booked their victory party for a popular Boston nightclub, but canceled after the upset loss. As a result, the Eagles were not among the nearly 500 who died or the hundreds more who were injured when the nightclub [[Cocoanut Grove fire|caught fire that night]].\n\nBy the late 1970s the Holy Cross game had become more of a tradition than a rivalry, as Holy Cross football began to cease to be a major power. By 1980, the game was no longer part of the student ticket package, and was mostly attended by alumni. In 1986 Holy Cross changed the direction of its football program, joining the Division 1-AA [[Patriot League]], and terminated the series. BC had won 17 of the last 20 games.\n\nThe last basketball game between the two schools was played on January 17, 2006, a 63\u201353 win for Boston College at Worcester's [[DCU Center]].

They primarily compete in [[NCAA Division I]] as members of the [[Patriot League]]. In ice hockey, a sport not sponsored by the Patriot League for either sex, the Crusaders are members of two other leagues, with men competing in the [[Atlantic Hockey|Atlantic Hockey Association]] and women in [[Hockey East]]. The men's rowing team is part of the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges. Of its 25 varsity teams, Holy Cross supports 12 men's and 13 women's sports,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goholycross.com|title=Holy Cross Crusaders - College of the Holy Cross Official Athletic Site|website=www.goholycross.com|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> giving Holy Cross the largest ratio of teams-per-enrollment in the country.  Holy Cross's athletic teams for both men and women are known as the [[Crusades|Crusaders]].\n\nHoly Cross is a founding member of the [[Patriot League]], and boasts that one-quarter of its student body participates in its varsity athletic programs. Principal facilities include [[Fitton Field]] for football (capacity: 23,500) and baseball (3,000), the [[Hart Center]] at the Luth Athletic Complex for basketball (3,600) and ice hockey (1,400), the [[Linda Johnson Smith Soccer Stadium]] (1,320), and the Smith Wellness Center, located inside the Luth Athletic Complex.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goholycross.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=210235766&DB_OEM_ID=33100&DB_OEM_ID=33100 |title=Facilities |accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe College is one of nine schools to have won an NCAA championship in both baseball ([[1952 College World Series|1952]]) and basketball ([[1947 NCAA Tournament|1947]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theonlycolors.com/2013/6/25/4465326/national-championships-by-the-numbers|title=National Championships by the Numbers|website=SB Nation}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Holy Cross Crusaders|Men's sports|Women's sports}}\n|-\n| [[Holy Cross Crusaders baseball|Baseball]] || [[Holy Cross Crusaders women's basketball|Basketball]]\n|-\n| [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Basketball]] || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country || Field hockey\n|-\n| [[Holy Cross Crusaders football|Football]] || Golf\n|-\n| Golf || Ice hockey\n|-\n| [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's ice hockey|Ice hockey]] || Lacrosse\n|-\n|[[Holy Cross Crusaders men's lacrosse|Lacrosse]]|| Rowing\n|- \n| Rowing || Soccer\n|-\n| Soccer || Softball\n|-\n| Swimming & diving || Swimming & diving\n|-\n| Tennis || Tennis\n|- \n| Track & field<sup>\u2020</sup> || Track & field<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA secondary color cell|Holy Cross Crusaders}}\" | {{small|\u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor.}}\n|}\n\n===Baseball===\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders baseball}}\nThe Holy Cross baseball team won the NCAA National Championship in [[1952 Holy Cross Crusaders baseball team|1952]] and remains the only team from the northeastern part of the United States to have won the [[College World Series]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/ncaa/cws/history.html|title=ESPN.com: NCAA - College World Series history |website=static.espn.go.com|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> The Crusaders also reached the College World Series in 1958, 1962, and 1963.

The Crusaders won their first Patriot League Baseball Tournament title in 2017 and returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1978 where it defeated No. 25 Nebraska.\n\n===Basketball===\n\n==== Men's basketball====\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball}}\nThe Holy Cross men's basketball team has won two national tournament championships having won the NCAA Tournament in [[1946-47 Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball team|1947]] and the National Invitation Tournament in 1954 at a time when the NIT was considered to be equal to if not more prestigious than the NCAA Tournament. The team also has reached the Final Four in 1948 and the Elite Eight in 1950 and 1953. In 2016, the team captured its first win in an NCAA Tournament game since the 1953 season. Notable former players include [[Boston Celtics]] legends and [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] inductees [[Bob Cousy]] and [[Tom Heinsohn]].\n\n====Women's basketball====\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders women's basketball}}\nThe Holy Cross women's basketball team has also made several appearances in the postseason including 12 trips to the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] as well as one appearance in both the [[Women's National Invitation Tournament]] and the [[Women's Basketball Invitational]]. They are 1-12 in the NCAA Tournament with the lone win coming in 1991 as an upset over 6th seeded Maryland. This is the only victory in the NCAA Tournament for any team from the Patriot League. Six-time Patriot League Coach of the Year Bill Gibbons recorded his 500th win early in the 2011\u20132012 campaign.\n\n===Football===\n[[File:FittonField2.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Visitor side of football stadium (2008)]]\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders football}}\nThe Holy Cross football team played in the [[1946 Orange Bowl]]. The team has since made the FCS postseason in 1983 and 2009. In 1987, the team went undefeated and finished first in the national polls despite the Patriot League not allowing its teams to participate in the NCAA Tournament. Notable former players include [[Bill Osmanski]] who went on to win four NFL Championships with the [[Chicago Bears]] and two-time [[Heisman Trophy]] finalist [[Gordie Lockbaum]].\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{main|Holy Cross Crusaders men's ice hockey}}\nOn March 24, 2006, the Holy Cross men's hockey team made history by defeating the Golden Gophers of the [[University of Minnesota]] in the first round of the [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]] by the score of 4&ndash;3, in overtime. Coined as one of the biggest upsets in NCAA ice hockey history, never since the NCAA tourney expanded to sixteen teams had a sixteen seed beat a number one seed until again in 2015 when the 16th seeded [[RIT Tigers men's ice hockey|RIT Tigers]] defeated the first seeded [[Minnesota State Mavericks]] by a score of 2\u20131.<ref>[http://www.collegehockeynews.com/news/2006/03/24_holycow.php Crusaders Pull Off Stunner, Win One for the Little Guy.

In 1917, Andrew Kelly set the world record in the 300 yard dash. [[Joe Tierney]] won the [[IC4A]] 440 yard title in 1925, and [[James Quinn (athlete)|James Quinn]] won the [[IC4A]] 100 yard in 1928 before going on to win an Olympic gold medal in the 4x100m relay. In the early 1960s, Charlie Buchta and Kevin Kilgallen were prominent Crusaders on the national scene.\n\nThe Holy Cross golf team has also produced some exceptional golfers including [[Willie Turnesa]] who won two US Amateur titles and a British Amateur, and [[Paul Harney]] who, after earning a medal at the 1952 NCAA championship, won six PGA Tour events and was inducted into the PGA of America Hall of Fame.\n\nIn recent years, the soccer programs made their first NCAA Tournament appearances with the women appearing in [[2000 NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Tournament|2000]] and the men appearing in [[2002 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|2002]].\nIn [[2006 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship|2006]] and [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship|2007]], the women's [[lacrosse]] team made its first NCAA Tournament appearances, defeating LeMoyne in the NCAA play-in game before falling to Duke in 2006, and losing to Northwestern in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patriotleague.cstv.com/sports/w-lacros/spec-rel/051106aaa.html|title=Women's Lacrosse NCAA Preview: Difficulty Increases as Holy Cross Draws Duke.

Key highlights include the women's team winning several New England championships and the 2002 ECAC National Invitational, and the men's varsity eight finishing ranked within the national top 20 in 2005, 2006, 2013, and 2015.

The name appealed to the Holy Cross student body, which held a vote later in that year to decide whether this cognomen or one of the other two currently in use \u2013 \"Chiefs\" and \"Sagamores\"- would be adopted. On October 6, 1925, ''The Tomahawk'', an earlier name of the student newspaper, reported that the results of the ballot were: Crusaders 143, Chiefs 17, Sagamores 7.<ref name=\"color\"/>\n\nOwing to the [[Post-9/11]] controversy over the \u201cCrusaders\u201d nickname,<ref>Glenn Arthur Pierce, \"5 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Team Nicknames and Mascots\" (2015/2016), https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/7301999-5-things-you-didn-t-know-about-team-nicknames-and-mascots, 2015/2016.</ref> only Holy Cross and [[Valparaiso Crusaders|Valparaiso University]] maintain Crusaders at the NCAA Division I level.\n\n==School colors==\n[[File:HCGTMB1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Holy Cross \"Goodtime\" Marching Band in the familiar HC formation]]\n\nThe school color is [[royal purple]].<ref>http://www.nmnathletics.com/fls/33100/sports/football/2015/2015-hc-fb-fb.pdf</ref> There are two theories of how Holy Cross chose purple as its official color. One suggests it was derived from the royal purple used by Emperor Constantine the Great (born about 275 A.D., died in 337 AD) as displayed on his labarum (military standard) and on those of later Christian emperors of Rome.<ref name=\"color\"/>\n\nThe other version is attributed to Walter J. Connors, an 1887 graduate, and was printed in the October 1940 issue of the Alumnus. According to the account, there was a disagreement during the 1870s between Holy Cross students from Massachusetts and Connecticut concerning the schools' baseball uniform colors. Those from Massachusetts purportedly favored the crimson of Harvard, while those from Connecticut favored the deep blue of Yale. Legend has it that a fellow student with a sense of diplomacy resolved the dispute in the chemistry lab, where he mixed copper sulphate (blue) with iron oxide (red) to produce the color of deep purple.<ref name=\"color\"/>\n\n==Boston College rivalry==\nHistorically, Holy Cross' major rival has been the [[Boston College Eagles|Eagles of Boston College]], especially in football. Boston College does not share this view as far as Holy Cross being a \"rival\". In 1896, Holy Cross and Boston College played the first football game between the two schools.\n\nTo accommodate larger crowds, the Holy Cross game was routinely held at larger venues off campus, with the 1916 matchup taking place at the newly constructed [[Fenway Park]]. A record 54,000 attended the 1922 game at [[Braves Field]], home of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] baseball team. On November 28, 1942, Holy Cross beat BC in a huge upset by a score of 55-12, a result that proved fortunate for the losing Eagles. The BC team had booked their victory party for a popular Boston nightclub, but canceled after the upset loss. As a result, the Eagles were not among the nearly 500 who died or the hundreds more who were injured when the nightclub [[Cocoanut Grove fire|caught fire that night]].\n\nBy the late 1970s the Holy Cross game had become more of a tradition than a rivalry, as Holy Cross football began to cease to be a major power. By 1980, the game was no longer part of the student ticket package, and was mostly attended by alumni. In 1986 Holy Cross changed the direction of its football program, joining the Division 1-AA [[Patriot League]], and terminated the series. BC had won 17 of the last 20 games.\n\nThe last basketball game between the two schools was played on January 17, 2006, a 63-53 win for Boston College at Worcester's [[DCU Center]].

One of the reasons behind the operational merger was to allow both teams to gain better leverage over their own broadcast rights; each party believed that it would obtain better individual deals, if they negotiated the rights collectively.\n\nTwo years earlier in 1997, [[Cablevision]] \u2013 which at the time had owned the Nets' television broadcaster, SportsChannel New York (later known as Fox Sports Net New York, and now known as [[MSG Plus]]) \u2013 became the sole owner to the television rights of all seven Major League Baseball, NBA and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] teams in the New York City [[media market|market]] when it acquired the competing [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] (previously owned by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] through its 1994 purchase of the network's former parent [[Gulf and Western Industries|Paramount Communications]]), which had held the broadcast rights to the Yankees since 1989. This led to [[monopoly]]-like tactics, including the shift of some games to the cable-exclusive [[MSG Metro Channels]], which had very limited distribution as Cablevision, [[Comcast]] and [[Time Warner Cable]] routinely fought over carriage agreements. Cablevision attempted to buy the Yankees outright, but could not agree to acceptable terms with [[George Steinbrenner]] and his partners.\n\nTo exit its MSG/Cablevision deal, the Yankees would have to give them the right to match any new right agreement and show a judge that a third party was willing to purchase their rights and launch a channel. Thus, new YankeeNets CEO Harvey Schiller hired IMG to provide a valuation for the prospective YankeeNets sport channel. IMG came back with an offer to partner on the channel with a guaranteed rights fees of $838 million.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mickle |first1=Tripp |title=An American Original |url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2013/03/11/Champions/Harvey-Schiller.aspx |accessdate=July 2, 2018 |work=Sports Business Journal |date=March 11, 2013 |language=en}}</ref> In 2000, YankeeNets and IMG proposed a forming a sports channel valued as high as $2.4 billion. Cablevision sued considering its valuing as \"outlandish\" to block the channel. In April 2001, the suite was settled such that in June 2001, [[Yankee Global Enterprises|YankeeNets]] paid to MSG to have the Yankee's TV right returned to them. IMG had been replaced by other investors, [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman, Sachs & Company]], the [[Quadrangle Group]], [[Leo Hindery Jr.]], chief executive of the network, and Amos Hostetter Jr., a billionaire cable veteran, who in total had a 40% share of the channel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sandomir |first1=Richard |title=YankeeNets Getting Own Cable Network |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/11/sports/sports-business-yankeenets-getting-own-cable-network.html |accessdate=July 2, 2018 |work=New York Times |date=September 11, 2001 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2003, the Yankees and Nets decided to part ways, with the Nets being sold to a group led by [[real estate]] developer [[Bruce Ratner]]. The sale did not include the Nets' ownership stake in YES (NJ Holdings), which remained with the pre-merger owners of the team. As part of the sale, the Nets signed a long-term deal to keep the team's game telecasts on YES. In 2004, YankeeNets was renamed Yankee Global Enterprises, which owns the Yankees and the minority share in YES as separate companies.<ref name=espn>{{cite news |title=YankeeNets owners complete deal to separate |url=http://www.espn.com/espn/sportsbusiness/news/story?id=1766675 |accessdate=July 2, 2018 |work=ESPN.com |agency=AP |date=March 24, 2004}}</ref> Therefore, the Yankees technically do not own YES.

Other original programming featured on YES includes: \n* ''Boston vs. New York Poker Challenge'' \u2013 a [[poker]] tournament matching Yankee fans against [[Boston Red Sox]] fans. Airing for two seasons, it was a co-production of YES and [[Boston]]-based regional sports channel [[New England Sports Network]] (NESN).\n* ''CenterStage'' \u2013 a weekly program hosted by Yankees play-by-play announcer [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]], featuring in-depth interviews with various celebrities.\n* ''[[The Michael Kay Show]]'' \u2013 a video simulcast of the radio show from [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate [[WEPN-FM]] (98.7 FM), featuring Michael Kay, [[Don La Greca]], and [[Peter Rosenberg]]. \n* ''Forbes SportsMoney'' \u2013 a financial magazine program produced as a joint venture between YES and ''[[Forbes]]'', focusing on the financial aspects of the sports industry.\n* ''Homegrown: The Path to Pinstripes'' \u2013 a reality show that showcases the development of future Yankees players on their Class-AAA team, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. As of 2019 the series has expanded with the addition of a spinoff, ''Homegrown: The Bridge to Brooklyn'', a look into the lives of the players of the Nets' [[NBA G League]] team the [[Long Island Nets]].\n* ''[[Mike's On|The Mike Francesa Show]]'' \u2013 a video simulcast of the popular [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]] (660 AM) radio show ''[[Mike's On]]'' with host [[Mike Francesa]] (2008-2015). YES also simulcasted Francesa's nationally syndicated radio show ''The NFL Now'' under the title ''Football Sunday with Mike Francesa''.\n* ''Nets Magazine'' \u2013 a weekly program featuring news, analysis and feature segments focusing on the Brooklyn Nets.\n* ''[[Yankees Classics]]'' \u2013 rebroadcasts of marquee New York Yankees games from previous years.\n* ''Yankees Magazine'' \u2013 a weekly program featuring news, analysis and feature segments focusing on the Yankees.\n* ''[[Yankeeography]]'' \u2013 a ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''-style program focusing on notable current and former Yankees personalities.\n* ''Yankees on Deck'' (formerly ''Kids on Deck'') \u2013 a children's program in which younger Yankee fans are given an inside look at what it is like to be a member of the Yankee organization.\n* ''Yankees-Steiner: Memories of the Game'' \u2013 a [[reality television|reality series]] based around Yankee-related, and other baseball and sports memorabilia; co-produced by Yankees-Steiner Collectibles, a joint venture of the Yankees and Steiner Sports Marketing and Memorabilia.\n* ''YES' Ultimate Road Trip'' (2005\u20132007) \u2013 a reality show that combined elements of ''[[The Real World]]'' and ''[[Road Rules]]'', following a group of Yankee fans following the team around the country throughout an entire 162-game season.\n* ''Yogi and a Movie'' \u2013 A showcase of sports movies featuring wraparound commentary segments hosted by Yankee [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] catcher [[Yogi Berra]].\n\n==Minor league baseball and college sports==\nSince the network's debut, YES has aired select telecasts of the Yankees' [[minor league baseball|minor league]] farm teams, primarily the Class-A (short season) [[Staten Island Yankees]] of the [[New York\u2013Penn League]]. Those games are produced by YES, utilizing the same graphics and announcers as seen during game telecasts of the major league Yankees.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2006, YES also broadcast games from the Yankees' former Class-AAA team, the [[Columbus Clippers]] of the [[International League]]. Those games were produced locally in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. After the 2006 season, the Yankees ended their affiliation with the Clippers, and became affiliated with the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders]] (formerly the Yankees and Red Barons). YES has only televised one RailRiders game, Masahiro Tanaka's minor league rehab start, the team also has local coverage within its [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]/[[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] market.\n\nThe network has also broadcast various college sports events including football and basketball games from the [[Ivy League]], basketball games from the [[Big 12 Conference]] (through [[ESPN Plus]]) and rebroadcasts of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football]] games. It also carries the coaches' shows of Notre Dame and the [[Penn State Nittany Lions]]. In 2011, YES began airing live broadcasts of college basketball games involving the [[Fordham University]]. As part of the formation of its programming deal with Fox Sports Networks, in September 2013, YES began broadcasting select FSN-produced college sports events intended for national broadcast on its regional sports networks, including football and basketball games from the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].\n\n===Relationships with New York Giants and Manchester United===\nIn 2000, YankeeNets entered into a marketing agreement with the [[New York Giants]]; this included awarding YES the exclusive rights to the [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise's magazine programs (including ''Giants Online'' and ''Giants on Deck'', which continued to air on the network after the YankeeNets breakup). The Giants' relationship with YES Network ended in 2007, at which time its team-related programming moved to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WNYW]] (channel 5) and [[MyNetworkTV]] owned-and-operated station [[WWOR-TV]] (channel 9), a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] owned by [[Fox Television Stations]] (whose sister company, the Fox network, owns broadcast rights to most games from the Giants home conference, the [[National Football Conference]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Special Features \u2013 Story \u2013 8.2 Fox 5 and My9 Expand Relationship \u2013 Giants.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.giants.com/news/special_features/story.asp?story_id=25713|website=[[New York Giants]]}}</ref>\n\nYankeeNets also maintained a similar relationship with English [[football (soccer)|football]] club [[Manchester United]]. YES broadcast [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] and classic United games produced by the team-owned [[Manchester United TV]] in the network's earlier days.\n\n===Other sports programming===\nThe YES Network also produces Yankees game broadcasts shown over-the-air on [[WPIX-TV]] using the same on-air talent seen on the cable network. From 2002 to 2004, [[WCBS-TV]] carried the Yankees broadcasts, with [[WWOR-TV|WWOR]] taking over those rights later. [[WLNY-TV]] held the local broadcast television rights to the Nets but no longer does. The Yankees package is also simulcast on other television stations in the team's designated market region.\n\nYES also offers a Spanish-language feed of all of its Yankees game telecasts through the [[second audio program]]; this feed can also be heard on New York radio station [[WADO]] (AM), which current holds the contract to carry the Yankees' Spanish-language broadcasts.\n\nThe network attempted to secure television rights to the [[New Jersey Devils]], formerly owned by an affiliate of YankeeNets; after the team was sold to a different ownership group, the Devils opted to renew their contract with MSG Network and FSN New York in 2005, under a long-term agreement.\n\nYES broadcasts [[NBA TV]]'s daily news and fantasy basketball shows (usually in the form of rebroadcasts, but occasionally showing live telecasts in the early morning drive time hours) and ''[[Marv Albert|The Marv Albert Show]]''. For a couple of years during the early 2000s, YES and NBA TV also both aired reruns of the basketball-centered drama series ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]''. The network also previously aired ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' during the week throughout the Major League Baseball regular season, following each episode's original Saturday broadcast on Fox.\n\nAs part of a multi-year agreement with MP & Silva, YES aired tape delayed broadcasts of [[Premier League]], [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]] matches involving [[Arsenal F.C.]]. In addition to airing Arsenal matches, the network aired select archived match telecasts, as well as the team's magazine shows, ''Arsenal World'' and ''Arsenal 360''. This agreement ended at the start of the 2012\u201313 Premier League season. Arsenal would get picked up by [[ONE World Sports]] while YES would gain partnership with [[Manchester City FC]].\n\nIn December 2014, YES announced it had acquired local broadcast rights to [[New York City FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], a subsidiary of Manchester City FC. Yankee Global Enterprises owns a 20% minority stake in the club, which is majority-owned by [[City Football Group]].<ref name=yes-nycfc>{{cite web|title=New York City Football Club and YES Network reach multi-year agreement|url=http://web.yesnetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20141218&content_id=104390598|website=YES Network|accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New York City FC matches televised on YES Network?

The feed is carried in both standard and high definition on most cable providers in the New York metropolitan area and nationwide on DirecTV.\n\n===YES Network HD===\n[[Image:YES HD.jpg|right|145px]]\n'''YES Network HD''' is a [[1080i]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of the network, which is carried on select cable providers (including [[Comcast]], [[Cablevision]], [[DirecTV]], [[RCN Corporation|RCN]], [[Charter Communications|Charter Spectrum]] and [[Verizon FiOS]]). {{As of|2019}}, YES is currently owned by YES majority owner [[Yankee Global Enterprises]] and before the Disney acquisition (Fox's SportsTime Ohio and other networks; all of those were acquisitions rather than Fox-launched networks) that transmitted their HD simulcasts in 1080i, rather than the company's preferred [[720p]] format.\n\nWhen it launched in mid-July 2004, YES HD initially only televised all Yankees home games, as well as away games involving the [[New York Mets]] and [[Boston Red Sox]], in high definition. In 2005, YES began televising all Yankees games played east of the [[Mississippi River]] in high definition, with the network's HD telecasts expanding to encompass virtually all of the Yankees and Nets games in 2006. In addition to game telecasts, the network now also broadcasts all of its studio shows in HD. All YES-produced Yankees and Nets game telecasts aired on WWOR-TV began broadcasting in HD in September 2006; however while the HD feed of the games is available to these outlets, the HD telecasts were not necessarily distributed to television stations outside of the New York City area that simulcast WWOR's game broadcasts.\n\nIn April 2007, YES converted the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of its primary [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] feed from full-screen to a [[letterbox]]ed [[4:3]] format, which is a downconversion from the [[16:9]] high definition feed. The network's use of the [[Active Format Description|AFD]] #10 broadcast flag to transmit its HD feed in this manner for broadcast in SD predates its use by other national cable networks such as [[Fox News Channel]], [[ESPN]] and [[CNN]].\n\nYES Network borrowed time on Cablevision's \"iO TV 1300\" service and on DirecTV to carry the first baseball game ever transmitted in [[3D television|3D]] on July 10 and 11, 2010, when the Yankees faced the [[Seattle Mariners]]; the 3D telecast of the game was also distributed to other cable providers.\n\n===National feed===\nYES Network maintains a national feed available to select cable providers outside of the New York City market \u2013 including [[Charter Communications|Spectrum]] (as well as areas once served by [[Bright House Networks]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Yankee Global YES Network comes to Bright House Networks|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2009/03/30/daily39.html|newspaper=Tampa Bay Business Journal|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=April 1, 2009}}</ref> (on its systems in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Orlando]]),  Verizon FiOS (in certain markets). The feed does not include the network's live game telecasts (with alternate programming airing in their place), however it does carry the pre-game and post-game shows that bookend Yankees and Nets games aired by YES within the market. This feed differs from the satellite feed of the network available on [[DirecTV]], in which Yankees and/or Nets games can be viewed outside of the teams' markets through a subscription to [[MLB Extra Innings]] and/or [[NBA League Pass]].\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Carriage disputes===\nAt its launch, YES became embroiled in a [[carriage dispute]] with Cablevision (which attempted to purchase the Yankees in 1998 and carried the team's games on MSG Network at the time of the channel's launch), leaving the Yankees' game telecasts not available to the provider's game telecasts for an entire year; this led the [[Government of New York (state)|New York state government]] to intervene and serve as negotiator for a temporary carriage agreement between YES and Cablevision. In 2004, the two sides eventually signed a long-term contract to carry the network on Cablevision's New York area systems. This situation was very similar to another lengthy dispute that Cablevision entered into with MSG Network, after that network assumed the regional cable television rights to the Yankees in [[1989 New York Yankees season|1989]] from Cablevision-owned SportsChannel New York.\n\n[[Dish Network]] remains{{When|date=April 2015}} the only pay television provider available in the New York City area that does not carry YES Network. The satellite provider has indicated that it would not offer the network unless it negotiates a lower per-channel subscriber fee due to concerns that the rates the network offered could force the provider to increase the pricing of its programming packages.<ref>{{cite news|title=Echostar's Dish Network is lone holdout in Cablevision, YES Network|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4189/is_20030328/ai_n10166462|newspaper=Long Island Business News|via=FindArticles.com|date=March 28, 2003}}</ref> YES, however, has a [[most favored nation]] clause with all of its cable and satellite providers, in which all of the network's other carriage agreements would be voided if it lowered its subscriber rate for a single provider. Former YES minority owner Goldman Sachs also maintains an ownership stake in Dish Network parent [[Echostar]].\n\nTime Warner Cable relocated YES from channel 30 to channel 53 on its New York City area systems in March 2008, soon after the New York City Council approved a measure to provide the Yankees public funding to build a new stadium. Simultaneously, Time Warner Cable moved business news channel [[Bloomberg Television]] to YES' former channel 30 slot, all while renegotiating its ten-year contract with Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] (owner of Bloomberg Television parent [[Bloomberg L.P.]]) and the city of New York.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bloomberg Keeps His Billions Separate From His Mayoral Obligations?

After this came to light, it was later rumored that, in response, Steinbrenner ordered YES not to show Zimmer on-camera during its Yankee telecasts.\n\nIn April 2005, YES declined to broadcast pre-game Opening Day festivities celebrating the Boston Red Sox' [[2004 World Series]] championship win prior to its telecast of a Red Sox home game against the Yankees at [[Fenway Park]]. YES was roundly criticized for this move, including its decision to use a fixed camera shot focused tightly on correspondent [[Kim Jones (reporter)|Kimberly Jones]] as she described the events surrounding her in general terms. Yankees players not only witnessed the ceremonies, but graciously applauded them from the top steps of their dugout.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boston Holds Its Party, but YES Just Says No|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/sports/baseball/12tv.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print&position=|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 12, 2005|accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref> Perhaps due to this incident, YES broadcast the majority of the ceremonies honoring the Red Sox' celebration of the 100th Anniversary of Fenway Park in 2012.\n\nDuring the 2005 season, New York City area newspapers reported that the post-game questions asked to Yankees manager [[Joe Torre]] by Kimberly Jones were being sent to her by top-level team executives (quite possibly on directives from George Steinbrenner), and that Torre did not feel comfortable answering them. For the 2006 and 2007 seasons, Torre, who had been paid a fee by YES to give exclusive interviews after each Yankees game, ended his agreement with the network. YES now sends its reporter to the regular pre-game and post-game media sessions with other broadcast outlets.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official

One of the reasons behind the operational merger was to allow both teams to gain better leverage over their own broadcast rights; each party believed that it would obtain better individual deals, if they negotiated the rights collectively.\n\nTwo years earlier in 1997, [[Cablevision]] \u2013 which at the time had owned the Nets' television broadcaster, SportsChannel New York (later known as Fox Sports Net New York, and now known as [[MSG Plus]]) \u2013 became the sole owner to the television rights of all seven Major League Baseball, NBA and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] teams in the New York City [[media market|market]] when it acquired the competing [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] (previously owned by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] through its 1994 purchase of the network's former parent [[Gulf and Western Industries|Paramount Communications]]), which had held the broadcast rights to the Yankees since 1989. This led to [[monopoly]]-like tactics, including the shift of some games to the cable-exclusive [[MSG Metro Channels]], which had very limited distribution as Cablevision, [[Comcast]] and [[Time Warner Cable]] routinely fought over carriage agreements. Cablevision attempted to buy the Yankees outright, but could not agree to acceptable terms with [[George Steinbrenner]] and his partners.\n\nTo exit its MSG/Cablevision deal, the Yankees would have to give them the right to match any new right agreement and show a judge that a third party was willing to purchase their rights and launch a channel. Thus, new YankeeNets CEO Harvey Schiller hired IMG to provide a valuation for the prospective YankeeNets sport channel. IMG came back with an offer to partner on the channel with a guaranteed rights fees of $838 million.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mickle |first1=Tripp |title=An American Original |url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2013/03/11/Champions/Harvey-Schiller.aspx |accessdate=July 2, 2018 |work=Sports Business Journal |date=March 11, 2013 |language=en}}</ref> In 2000, YankeeNets and IMG proposed a forming a sports channel valued as high as $2.4 billion. Cablevision sued considering its valuing as \"outlandish\" to block the channel. In April 2001, the suite was settled such that in June 2001, [[Yankee Global Enterprises|YankeeNets]] paid to MSG to have the Yankee's TV right returned to them. IMG had been replaced by other investors, [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman, Sachs & Company]], the [[Quadrangle Group]], [[Leo Hindery Jr.]], chief executive of the network, and Amos Hostetter Jr., a billionaire cable veteran, who in total had a 40% share of the channel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sandomir |first1=Richard |title=YankeeNets Getting Own Cable Network |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/11/sports/sports-business-yankeenets-getting-own-cable-network.html |accessdate=July 2, 2018 |work=New York Times |date=September 11, 2001 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2003, the Yankees and Nets decided to part ways, with the Nets being sold to a group led by [[real estate]] developer [[Bruce Ratner]]. The sale did not include the Nets' ownership stake in YES (NJ Holdings), which remained with the pre-merger owners of the team. As part of the sale, the Nets signed a long-term deal to keep the team's game telecasts on YES.

YES also simulcasted Francesa's nationally syndicated radio show ''The NFL Now'' under the title ''Football Sunday with Mike Francesa''.\n* ''Nets Magazine'' \u2013 a weekly program featuring news, analysis and feature segments focusing on the Brooklyn Nets.\n* ''[[Yankees Classics]]'' \u2013 rebroadcasts of marquee New York Yankees games from previous years.\n* ''Yankees Magazine'' \u2013 a weekly program featuring news, analysis and feature segments focusing on the Yankees.\n* ''[[Yankeeography]]'' \u2013 a ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''-style program focusing on notable current and former Yankees personalities.\n* ''Yankees on Deck'' (formerly ''Kids on Deck'') \u2013 a children's program in which younger Yankee fans are given an inside look at what it is like to be a member of the Yankee organization.\n* ''Yankees-Steiner: Memories of the Game'' \u2013 a [[reality television|reality series]] based around Yankee-related, and other baseball and sports memorabilia; co-produced by Yankees-Steiner Collectibles, a joint venture of the Yankees and Steiner Sports Marketing and Memorabilia.\n* ''YES' Ultimate Road Trip'' (2005\u20132007) \u2013 a reality show that combined elements of ''[[The Real World]]'' and ''[[Road Rules]]'', following a group of Yankee fans following the team around the country throughout an entire 162-game season.\n* ''Yogi and a Movie'' \u2013 A showcase of sports movies featuring wraparound commentary segments hosted by Yankee [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] catcher [[Yogi Berra]].\n\n==Minor league baseball and college sports==\nSince the network's debut, YES has aired select telecasts of the Yankees' [[minor league baseball|minor league]] farm teams, primarily the Class-A (short season) [[Staten Island Yankees]] of the [[New York\u2013Penn League]]. Those games are produced by YES, utilizing the same graphics and announcers as seen during game telecasts of the major league Yankees.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2006, YES also broadcast games from the Yankees' former Class-AAA team, the [[Columbus Clippers]] of the [[International League]]. Those games were produced locally in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. After the 2006 season, the Yankees ended their affiliation with the Clippers, and became affiliated with the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders]] (formerly the Yankees and Red Barons). YES has only televised one RailRiders game, Masahiro Tanaka's minor league rehab start, the team also has local coverage within its [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]/[[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] market.\n\nThe network has also broadcast various college sports events including football and basketball games from the [[Ivy League]], basketball games from the [[Big 12 Conference]] (through [[ESPN Plus]]) and rebroadcasts of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football]] games. It also carries the coaches' shows of Notre Dame and the [[Penn State Nittany Lions]]. In 2011, YES began airing live broadcasts of college basketball games involving the [[Fordham University]]. As part of the formation of its programming deal with Fox Sports Networks, in September 2013, YES began broadcasting select FSN-produced college sports events intended for national broadcast on its regional sports networks, including football and basketball games from the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].\n\n===Relationships with New York Giants and Manchester United===\nIn 2000, YankeeNets entered into a marketing agreement with the [[New York Giants]]; this included awarding YES the exclusive rights to the [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise's magazine programs (including ''Giants Online'' and ''Giants on Deck'', which continued to air on the network after the YankeeNets breakup). The Giants' relationship with YES Network ended in 2007, at which time its team-related programming moved to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WNYW]] (channel 5) and [[MyNetworkTV]] owned-and-operated station [[WWOR-TV]] (channel 9), a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] owned by [[Fox Television Stations]] (whose sister company, the Fox network, owns broadcast rights to most games from the Giants home conference, the [[National Football Conference]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Special Features \u2013 Story \u2013 8.2 Fox 5 and My9 Expand Relationship \u2013 Giants.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|url=http://www.giants.com/news/special_features/story.asp?story_id=25713|website=[[New York Giants]]}}</ref>\n\nYankeeNets also maintained a similar relationship with English [[football (soccer)|football]] club [[Manchester United]]. YES broadcast [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] and classic United games produced by the team-owned [[Manchester United TV]] in the network's earlier days.\n\n===Other sports programming===\nThe YES Network also produces Yankees game broadcasts shown over-the-air on [[WPIX-TV]] using the same on-air talent seen on the cable network. From 2002 to 2004, [[WCBS-TV]] carried the Yankees broadcasts, with [[WWOR-TV|WWOR]] taking over those rights later. [[WLNY-TV]] held the local broadcast television rights to the Nets but no longer does. The Yankees package is also simulcast on other television stations in the team's designated market region.\n\nYES also offers a Spanish-language feed of all of its Yankees game telecasts through the [[second audio program]]; this feed can also be heard on New York radio station [[WADO]] (AM), which current holds the contract to carry the Yankees' Spanish-language broadcasts.\n\nThe network attempted to secure television rights to the [[New Jersey Devils]], formerly owned by an affiliate of YankeeNets; after the team was sold to a different ownership group, the Devils opted to renew their contract with MSG Network and FSN New York in 2005, under a long-term agreement.\n\nYES broadcasts [[NBA TV]]'s daily news and fantasy basketball shows (usually in the form of rebroadcasts, but occasionally showing live telecasts in the early morning drive time hours) and ''[[Marv Albert|The Marv Albert Show]]''. For a couple of years during the early 2000s, YES and NBA TV also both aired reruns of the basketball-centered drama series ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]''. The network also previously aired ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' during the week throughout the Major League Baseball regular season, following each episode's original Saturday broadcast on Fox.\n\nAs part of a multi-year agreement with MP & Silva, YES aired tape delayed broadcasts of [[Premier League]], [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]] matches involving [[Arsenal F.C.]]. In addition to airing Arsenal matches, the network aired select archived match telecasts, as well as the team's magazine shows, ''Arsenal World'' and ''Arsenal 360''. This agreement ended at the start of the 2012\u201313 Premier League season. Arsenal would get picked up by [[ONE World Sports]] while YES would gain partnership with [[Manchester City FC]].\n\nIn December 2014, YES announced it had acquired local broadcast rights to [[New York City FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], a subsidiary of Manchester City FC. Yankee Global Enterprises owns a 20% minority stake in the club, which is majority-owned by [[City Football Group]].<ref name=yes-nycfc>{{cite web|title=New York City Football Club and YES Network reach multi-year agreement|url=http://web.yesnetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20141218&content_id=104390598|website=YES Network|accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New York City FC matches televised on YES Network?

The feed is carried in both standard and high definition on most cable providers in the New York metropolitan area and nationwide on DirecTV.\n\n===YES Network HD===\n[[Image:YES HD.jpg|right|145px]]\n'''YES Network HD''' is a [[1080i]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of the network, which is carried on select cable providers (including [[Comcast]], [[Cablevision]], [[DirecTV]], [[RCN Corporation|RCN]], [[Charter Communications|Charter Spectrum]] and [[Verizon FiOS]]). {{As of|2019}}, YES is currently owned by YES majority owner [[Yankee Global Enterprises]] and before the Disney acquisition (Fox's SportsTime Ohio and other networks; all of those were acquisitions rather than Fox-launched networks) that transmitted their HD simulcasts in 1080i, rather than the company's preferred [[720p]] format.\n\nWhen it launched in mid-July 2004, YES HD initially only televised all Yankees home games, as well as away games involving the [[New York Mets]] and [[Boston Red Sox]], in high definition. In 2005, YES began televising all Yankees games played east of the [[Mississippi River]] in high definition, with the network's HD telecasts expanding to encompass virtually all of the Yankees and Nets games in 2006. In addition to game telecasts, the network now also broadcasts all of its studio shows in HD. All YES-produced Yankees and Nets game telecasts aired on WWOR-TV began broadcasting in HD in September 2006; however while the HD feed of the games is available to these outlets, the HD telecasts were not necessarily distributed to television stations outside of the New York City area that simulcast WWOR's game broadcasts.\n\nIn April 2007, YES converted the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of its primary [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] feed from full-screen to a [[letterbox]]ed [[4:3]] format, which is a downconversion from the [[16:9]] high definition feed. The network's use of the [[Active Format Description|AFD]] #10 broadcast flag to transmit its HD feed in this manner for broadcast in SD predates its use by other national cable networks such as [[Fox News Channel]], [[ESPN]] and [[CNN]].\n\nYES Network borrowed time on Cablevision's \"iO TV 1300\" service and on DirecTV to carry the first baseball game ever transmitted in [[3D television|3D]] on July 10 and 11, 2010, when the Yankees faced the [[Seattle Mariners]]; the 3D telecast of the game was also distributed to other cable providers.\n\n===National feed===\nYES Network maintains a national feed available to select cable providers outside of the New York City market \u2013 including [[Charter Communications|Spectrum]] (as well as areas once served by [[Bright House Networks]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Yankee Global YES Network comes to Bright House Networks|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2009/03/30/daily39.html|newspaper=Tampa Bay Business Journal|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=April 1, 2009}}</ref> (on its systems in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Orlando]]),  Verizon FiOS (in certain markets). The feed does not include the network's live game telecasts (with alternate programming airing in their place), however it does carry the pre-game and post-game shows that bookend Yankees and Nets games aired by YES within the market. This feed differs from the satellite feed of the network available on [[DirecTV]], in which Yankees and/or Nets games can be viewed outside of the teams' markets through a subscription to [[MLB Extra Innings]] and/or [[NBA League Pass]].\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Carriage disputes===\nAt its launch, YES became embroiled in a [[carriage dispute]] with Cablevision (which attempted to purchase the Yankees in 1998 and carried the team's games on MSG Network at the time of the channel's launch), leaving the Yankees' game telecasts not available to the provider's game telecasts for an entire year; this led the [[Government of New York (state)|New York state government]] to intervene and serve as negotiator for a temporary carriage agreement between YES and Cablevision. In 2004, the two sides eventually signed a long-term contract to carry the network on Cablevision's New York area systems. This situation was very similar to another lengthy dispute that Cablevision entered into with MSG Network, after that network assumed the regional cable television rights to the Yankees in [[1989 New York Yankees season|1989]] from Cablevision-owned SportsChannel New York.\n\n[[Dish Network]] remains{{When|date=April 2015}} the only pay television provider available in the New York City area that does not carry YES Network. The satellite provider has indicated that it would not offer the network unless it negotiates a lower per-channel subscriber fee due to concerns that the rates the network offered could force the provider to increase the pricing of its programming packages.<ref>{{cite news|title=Echostar's Dish Network is lone holdout in Cablevision, YES Network|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4189/is_20030328/ai_n10166462|newspaper=Long Island Business News|via=FindArticles.com|date=March 28, 2003}}</ref> YES, however, has a [[most favored nation]] clause with all of its cable and satellite providers, in which all of the network's other carriage agreements would be voided if it lowered its subscriber rate for a single provider. Former YES minority owner Goldman Sachs also maintains an ownership stake in Dish Network parent [[Echostar]].\n\nTime Warner Cable relocated YES from channel 30 to channel 53 on its New York City area systems in March 2008, soon after the New York City Council approved a measure to provide the Yankees public funding to build a new stadium. Simultaneously, Time Warner Cable moved business news channel [[Bloomberg Television]] to YES' former channel 30 slot, all while renegotiating its ten-year contract with Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] (owner of Bloomberg Television parent [[Bloomberg L.P.]]) and the city of New York.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bloomberg Keeps His Billions Separate From His Mayoral Obligations?

After this came to light, it was later rumored that, in response, Steinbrenner ordered YES not to show Zimmer on-camera during its Yankee telecasts.\n\nIn April 2005, YES declined to broadcast pre-game Opening Day festivities celebrating the Boston Red Sox' [[2004 World Series]] championship win prior to its telecast of a Red Sox home game against the Yankees at [[Fenway Park]]. YES was roundly criticized for this move, including its decision to use a fixed camera shot focused tightly on correspondent [[Kim Jones (reporter)|Kimberly Jones]] as she described the events surrounding her in general terms. Yankees players not only witnessed the ceremonies, but graciously applauded them from the top steps of their dugout.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boston Holds Its Party, but YES Just Says No|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/sports/baseball/12tv.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print&position=|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 12, 2005|accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref> Perhaps due to this incident, YES broadcast the majority of the ceremonies honoring the Red Sox' celebration of the 100th Anniversary of Fenway Park in 2012.\n\nDuring the 2005 season, New York City area newspapers reported that the post-game questions asked to Yankees manager [[Joe Torre]] by Kimberly Jones were being sent to her by top-level team executives (quite possibly on directives from George Steinbrenner), and that Torre did not feel comfortable answering them. For the 2006 and 2007 seasons, Torre, who had been paid a fee by YES to give exclusive interviews after each Yankees game, ended his agreement with the network.

Following the early work of A. G. Fraser, the Budo Old Boys was established around 1909 including the development of an alumni football team.  Football practices took place regularly at the Coronation Ground at the Old Kampala, which became the Old Kampala Senior Secondary School Sports Ground. After the move of the Mengo High School from Namirembe to Budo Hill soon after 1927, the Budo Old Boys became the United Old Budonians Club.<ref name=\"Old Budonians Club\">{{cite web |url= http://budonian.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9&Itemid=11|title= Background |format= |work=Old Budonians Club |accessdate=2014-01-27}}</ref> Over the next two decades the United Budonians remained a dominant force in Ugandan football and won the Kampala and District League as late as 1949.<ref name=\"John Iliffe\">{{cite book |editor=John Iliffe |year=2005 |title=Honour in African History |isbn=0-521-83785-5|page=300 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, UK}}</ref>\n\n===Kabaka's Cup===\nThe Kampala Football Association (KFA) was established in 1924  and a major cup competition followed known as the Kabaka's Cup presented by [[Daudi Cwa II of Buganda|Kabaka Chwa II]].<ref name=\"Kaddu Sserunkuma\"/><ref name=\"Colonial Office 1957\">{{cite book |editor=Colonial Office |year=1957 |title=Uganda: Report for the year |isbn= |page=137 |publisher= H.M. Stationery Office|location= Great Britain}}</ref> Both the Budo School and the Old Boys fielded separate sides in the competition, each winning the trophy on a number of occasions. The nature of the competition eventually changed with teams like Public Works Department ''(PWD or Piida)'', Entebbe Government Printing Press ''(Puleesi)'', Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours ''(Leerwe)'' coming to prominence in the tournament. The game became more physical and as a consequence school teams like Budo School dropped out of the competition.<ref name=\"Old Budonians Club\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s the Kabaka's Cup was administered by the Uganda Football Association and more than 30 teams entered the competition.<ref name=\"Annual Report 1950\">{{cite book |editor=Public Relations and Social Welfare Department |year=1950 |title=Annual Report of the Public Relations and Social Welfare Department |isbn= |page=9 |publisher= |location= Uganda}}</ref> By 1957 political problems had arisen when the Buganda Football Association were refused permission by the parent body to run the Kabaka's Cup competition. In turn the Buganda Football Association suspended all clubs which entered for the Kabaka's Cup.\n\nUp until to the launch of the [[Ugandan Cup]] in 1971 the Kabaka's Cup remained the most prestigious cup competition in the country.  Other cup tournaments in the pre-independence years were the Aspro Cup, Buganda FA Challenge Cup, Coronation Cup, Luwangula Cup, Victory Cup and Wardle Cup.\n\n===Kampala and District Football League (KDFL)===\nThe main league in Uganda spanning at least three decades was the Kampala and District Football League (KDFL).  By 1966 the league had three tiers with a First Division, Second Division and a Third Division which was divided into two sections comprising a North Zone and a South Zone.  [[Kampala City Council FC]] competed in the Third Division South and gained promotion to the next level for the 1967 season.  Other teams that are known to have played in the KDFL include Aggrey Memorial, [[Simba FC|Army FC]], [[Bitumastic]], [[Coffee Kakira]], [[Express FC]], Kampala Police FC, KDS ''(Kampala District Bus Services)'', Kitegombwa, Luo Union, Mengo Old Boys, Mulago Hospital, Old Agrarians, [[Prisons FC Kampala]], Railways, Nsambya, Sudanese FC, UEB, United Budonians and Young Salumbey. Little is known about champion clubs in the KDFL other than United Budonians winning the league in 1949 and Police taking the title in 1953 and the Railway African Club football team winning the second division in the same season. [[Express FC]] clinched the Division One title in the 1964 season.\n\nThe demise of the KDFL began with the formation of the National Football League in 1968 but the two competitions were run concurrently for a few seasons and the KDFL was still operating in 1971.  The KDFL was then abandoned to allow room to a wider national competition with several divisions. Teams like [[Kampala City Council FC]], Nsambya and NIC became members of the newly formed second division of the National League.  In terms of records the highest goalscorer in KDFL history was Ali Kitonsa of [[Express FC]] who scored 54 goals in 18 appearances during the 1964 season. In terms of high scores Express defeated Kitegombwa 17\u20130 in the 1960 season although this result has probably been surpassed.\n\n===Key dates===\n{{Col-start}}\n{{Col-1-of-2}}\n*'''1897''' - R.

Following the early work of A. G. Fraser, the Budo Old Boys was established around 1909 including the development of an alumni football team.  Football practices took place regularly at the Coronation Ground at the Old Kampala, which became the Old Kampala Senior Secondary School Sports Ground. After the move of the Mengo High School from Namirembe to Budo Hill soon after 1927, the Budo Old Boys became the United Old Budonians Club.<ref name=\"Old Budonians Club\">{{cite web |url= http://budonian.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9&Itemid=11|title= Background |format= |work=Old Budonians Club |accessdate=2014-01-27}}</ref> Over the next two decades the United Budonians remained a dominant force in Ugandan football and won the Kampala and District League as late as 1949.<ref name=\"John Iliffe\">{{cite book |editor=John Iliffe |year=2005 |title=Honour in African History |isbn=0-521-83785-5|page=300 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, UK}}</ref>\n\n===Kabaka's Cup===\nThe Kampala Football Association (KFA) was established in 1924  and a major cup competition followed known as the Kabaka's Cup presented by [[Daudi Cwa II of Buganda|Kabaka Chwa II]].<ref name=\"Kaddu Sserunkuma\"/><ref name=\"Colonial Office 1957\">{{cite book |editor=Colonial Office |year=1957 |title=Uganda: Report for the year |isbn= |page=137 |publisher= H.M.

The nature of the competition eventually changed with teams like Public Works Department ''(PWD or Piida)'', Entebbe Government Printing Press ''(Puleesi)'', Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours ''(Leerwe)'' coming to prominence in the tournament. The game became more physical and as a consequence school teams like Budo School dropped out of the competition.<ref name=\"Old Budonians Club\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s the Kabaka's Cup was administered by the Uganda Football Association and more than 30 teams entered the competition.<ref name=\"Annual Report 1950\">{{cite book |editor=Public Relations and Social Welfare Department |year=1950 |title=Annual Report of the Public Relations and Social Welfare Department |isbn= |page=9 |publisher= |location= Uganda}}</ref> By 1957 political problems had arisen when the Buganda Football Association were refused permission by the parent body to run the Kabaka's Cup competition. In turn the Buganda Football Association suspended all clubs which entered for the Kabaka's Cup.\n\nUp until to the launch of the [[Ugandan Cup]] in 1971 the Kabaka's Cup remained the most prestigious cup competition in the country.  Other cup tournaments in the pre-independence years were the Aspro Cup, Buganda FA Challenge Cup, Coronation Cup, Luwangula Cup, Victory Cup and Wardle Cup.\n\n===Kampala and District Football League (KDFL)===\nThe main league in Uganda spanning at least three decades was the Kampala and District Football League (KDFL).  By 1966 the league had three tiers with a First Division, Second Division and a Third Division which was divided into two sections comprising a North Zone and a South Zone.  [[Kampala City Council FC]] competed in the Third Division South and gained promotion to the next level for the 1967 season.  Other teams that are known to have played in the KDFL include Aggrey Memorial, [[Simba FC|Army FC]], [[Bitumastic]], [[Coffee Kakira]], [[Express FC]], Kampala Police FC, KDS ''(Kampala District Bus Services)'', Kitegombwa, Luo Union, Mengo Old Boys, Mulago Hospital, Old Agrarians, [[Prisons FC Kampala]], Railways, Nsambya, Sudanese FC, UEB, United Budonians and Young Salumbey. Little is known about champion clubs in the KDFL other than United Budonians winning the league in 1949 and Police taking the title in 1953 and the Railway African Club football team winning the second division in the same season. [[Express FC]] clinched the Division One title in the 1964 season.\n\nThe demise of the KDFL began with the formation of the National Football League in 1968 but the two competitions were run concurrently for a few seasons and the KDFL was still operating in 1971.  The KDFL was then abandoned to allow room to a wider national competition with several divisions. Teams like [[Kampala City Council FC]], Nsambya and NIC became members of the newly formed second division of the National League.  In terms of records the highest goalscorer in KDFL history was Ali Kitonsa of [[Express FC]] who scored 54 goals in 18 appearances during the 1964 season. In terms of high scores Express defeated Kitegombwa 17-0 in the 1960 season although this result has probably been surpassed.\n\n===Key dates===\n{{Col-start}}\n{{Col-1-of-2}}\n*'''1897''' - R. H.

He obtained his medical degree in 1851 with the highest honours in [[anatomy]] and surgery.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1853 he was appointed assistant surgeon at [[University College Hospital]], becoming full surgeon in 1863, professor of clinical surgery in 1866, and consulting surgeon in 1874. In 1884 he became professor of surgery and pathology in the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. Specializing in surgery of the [[genito-urinary tract]], and in particular in that of the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], he studied in Paris under [[Jean Civiale]], who in the first quarter of the 19th century had developed a procedure to crush a [[Kidney stone|stone]] within the human bladder and who had invented an instrument for this [[minimally invasive]] surgery.\n\nAfter his return from Paris, Thompson soon acquired a reputation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n[[File:SirHenryThompsonBt.jpg|thumb|right|Thompson in a portrait painted by [[John Everett Millais]]]]\nIn 1863, when King [[Leopold I of Belgium]] was suffering from [[kidney stones]], Thompson was called to [[Brussels]] to consult in the case, and after some difficulties was allowed to perform the operation of [[lithotripsy]].

Nearly ten years later Thompson carried out a similar operation on the former Emperor [[Napol\u00e9on III]]; however, the Emperor died four days after, not from the surgical procedure, as was proved by the [[autopsy|post-mortem examination]], but from [[uremia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1874 Thompson helped in founding the ''[[Cremation Society of Great Britain]]'', of which he was the first president; he also did much toward the removal of the legal restrictions on [[cremation]]. He denounced the prevailing methods of [[death certificate|death certification]] in Great Britain; and in 1892 a select committee was appointed to inquire into the matter; its report, published the following year, was generally in line with his thinking.

About 1870 he began to collect Chinese [[porcelain]], in particular of old blue and white [[Nanking]]; in time his collection became so large that he could no longer find room for it, and most of it was sold. A catalogue of it, illustrated by himself and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]], was published in 1878.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe was also interested in [[astronomy]], and for a time maintained a private [[observatory]] in his house at [[Molesey]]. He presented the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] several instruments, including a photographic [[heliograph]] of 9-inch [[aperture]]; a 30-inch [[reflecting telescope]], and a large [[refracting telescope]] with a 26-inch object glass (of 22 feet [[focal length]]). The offer of the last instrument was made in 1894. Its manufacture was undertaken by [[Howard Grubb|Sir Howard Grubb]] of Dublin, and its erection was completed in 1897.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nSir Henry Thompson, [[knight]]ed in 1867, received a [[baronet]]cy in 1899, in connection with his telescope gifts to the National Observatory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1851 he married [[Kate Loder]], a pianist, who was stricken with [[paralysis]] soon afterwards. On his death, his only son, [[Henry Francis Herbert Thompson|Herbert]], a [[barrister]] and [[Egyptologist]], succeeded to the baronetcy. Of his two daughters, the elder (author of a valuable ''Handbook to the Public Picture Galleries of Europe'', first published in 1877) married [[Henry William Watkins]], [[Archdeacon of Durham]].  The younger daughter, Frances (Sophia) Cornwall Thompson, married the Rev. [[Henry de Candole]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  the only sibling of the WW1 poet [[Alec de Candole]]<ref>http://www.spanglefish.com/AlecdeCandole</ref>  They had no children.\n\n==Debate over vegetarianism==\n\nThompson was incorrectly cited and misquoted by vegetarians as being a supporter of [[vegetarianism]]. For example, he is cited as supporting a vegetarian diet in [[Gandhi]]'s essay ''The Superiority of Vegetarianism''. Thompson rejected excessive meat consumption and promoted a \"lighter\" diet but was not a vegetarian. He was involved in a debate over vegetarianism which led to controversy in the ''[[The Nineteenth Century (periodical)|Nineteenth Century]]'' magazine.<ref>Gregory, James. (2007). ''Of Victorians and Vegetarians: The Vegetarian Movement in Nineteenth-Century Britain''. Tauris Academic Studies. p. 85. ISBN 978-1-84511-379-7</ref>\n\nThompson authored ''Why Vegetarian?: A Reply to Critics'', in 1898.\n\n==Works==\nThe Royal College of Surgeons in 1852 awarded Thompson the Jacksonian Prize for an essay on the ''Pathology and Treatment of Stricture of the Urethra'' (on [[stenosis]] of the [[urethra]], a common condition in the times of [[gonorrhea]] and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]]); and again in 1860 for his essay on the ''Health and Morbid Anatomy of the [[Prostate Gland]]''. These two memoirs belong to [[urology]], his [[medical speciality]]. Besides devising operative improvements, he wrote books and papers dealing with them, including:\n*''Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Urinary Organs'', \n*''Practical Lithotomy and Lithotrity'', \n*''Tumours of the Bladder'', \n*''Suprapubic Lithotomy'', and \n*''Preventive Treatment of Calculus Disease'',\n*[https://archive.org/details/moderatedrinking00thomuoft/page/n6/mode/2up ''Moderate Drinking''], 1877.\n*[https://archive.org/details/pathologyandtre02thomgoog ''The Pathology and Treatment of Stricture of the Urethra and Urinary Fistulae''], 1885.\n*''[https://archive.org/details/101685802.nlm.nih.gov/mode/2up 'Why Vegetarian'?: A Reply to Critics]'', 1898.\n\nOther books of a medical character were ''Food and Feeding'', and ''Diet in Relation to Age and Activity'', both of which passed through several editions. He produced two successful novels, ''Charley Kingston's Aunt'' (1885) and ''All But'' (1886).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Thompson, Sir Henry|volume=26}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E003240b.htm|title=Thompson, Sir Henry, Bart (1820 - 1904)|publisher=Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Commons category|Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet}}\n{{Wikisource|Author:Henry Thompson}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041214210152/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/bookman/library/ROG/rog12.htm History of the Astrographic Department of the Royal Greenwich Observartory] highlights Sir Thompson's gifts of astronomical instruments.\n* {{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Henry|title=The Diseases of the prostate|url=https://archive.org/details/diseasesprostat00thomgoog|accessdate=17 May 2008|year=1883|publisher=J. & A.

It was successful, and in recognition of his skill Thompson was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to the King,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Sir Henry Thompson|journal=Medical Press and Circular|year=1904|volume=77|page=463|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UxoCAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=28 June 2008}}</ref> an appointment which was continued by [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]]. Nearly ten years later Thompson carried out a similar operation on the former Emperor [[Napol\u00e9on III]]; however, the Emperor died four days after, not from the surgical procedure, as was proved by the [[autopsy|post-mortem examination]], but from [[uremia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1874 Thompson helped in founding the ''[[Cremation Society of Great Britain]]'', of which he was the first president; he also did much toward the removal of the legal restrictions on [[cremation]]. He denounced the prevailing methods of [[death certificate|death certification]] in Great Britain; and in 1892 a select committee was appointed to inquire into the matter; its report, published the following year, was generally in line with his thinking. [[Woking Crematorium]] finally became the first of its kind in the UK. Thompson's last public duty for the society, in 1903, was to open [[Birmingham Crematorium]],<ref name=\"CSGB-History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html|title=History of the Society|date=1 January 1999|publisher=[[Cremation Society of Great Britain]]|accessdate=21 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224133412/http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html|archive-date=24 December 2013}}</ref> the country's ninth.<ref name=\"Dignity-110\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dignityfunerals.co.uk/crematoria/index.asp?pageid=17&storyid=41|title=Birmingham Crematorium commemorates 110th anniversary|publisher=Dignity plc|accessdate=21 December 2013}}</ref> He died in April 1904; his body was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html#thompson|title=History of the Society: Death of Sir Henry Thompson|date=1 January 1999|publisher=[[Cremation Society of Great Britain]]|accessdate=21 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224133412/http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html#thompson|archive-date=24 December 2013}}</ref> the first in London, which he had opened in 1902.<ref name=\"garden\">{{NHLE|num=1001575 |desc=Golders Green Crematorium |accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Carlo Pellegrini by Sir Henry Thompson.jpg|thumb|right|Thompson's portrait of [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]]]]\nThompson was also an artist, producing sketches and paintings, some of which were hung at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and in the [[Paris Salon]]. About 1870 he began to collect Chinese [[porcelain]], in particular of old blue and white [[Nanking]]; in time his collection became so large that he could no longer find room for it, and most of it was sold. A catalogue of it, illustrated by himself and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]], was published in 1878.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe was also interested in [[astronomy]], and for a time maintained a private [[observatory]] in his house at [[Molesey]]. He presented the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] several instruments, including a photographic [[heliograph]] of 9-inch [[aperture]]; a 30-inch [[reflecting telescope]], and a large [[refracting telescope]] with a 26-inch object glass (of 22 feet [[focal length]]). The offer of the last instrument was made in 1894. Its manufacture was undertaken by [[Howard Grubb|Sir Howard Grubb]] of Dublin, and its erection was completed in 1897.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nSir Henry Thompson, [[knight]]ed in 1867, received a [[baronet]]cy in 1899, in connection with his telescope gifts to the National Observatory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1851 he married [[Kate Loder]], a pianist, who was stricken with [[paralysis]] soon afterwards. On his death, his only son, [[Henry Francis Herbert Thompson|Herbert]], a [[barrister]] and [[Egyptologist]], succeeded to the baronetcy. Of his two daughters, the elder (author of a valuable ''Handbook to the Public Picture Galleries of Europe'', first published in 1877) married [[Henry William Watkins]], [[Archdeacon of Durham]].  The younger daughter, Frances (Sophia) Cornwall Thompson, married the Rev. [[Henry de Candole]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  the only sibling of the WW1 poet [[Alec de Candole]]<ref>http://www.spanglefish.com/AlecdeCandole</ref>  They had no children.\n\n==Debate over vegetarianism==\n\nThompson was incorrectly cited and misquoted by vegetarians as being a supporter of [[vegetarianism]]. For example, he is cited as supporting a vegetarian diet in [[Gandhi]]'s essay ''The Superiority of Vegetarianism''. Thompson rejected excessive meat consumption and promoted a \"lighter\" diet but was not a vegetarian. He was involved in a debate over vegetarianism which led to controversy in the ''[[The Nineteenth Century (periodical)|Nineteenth Century]]'' magazine.<ref>Gregory, James. (2007). ''Of Victorians and Vegetarians: The Vegetarian Movement in Nineteenth-Century Britain''. Tauris Academic Studies. p. 85. ISBN 978-1-84511-379-7</ref>\n\nThompson authored ''Why Vegetarian?: A Reply to Critics'', in 1898.\n\n==Works==\nThe Royal College of Surgeons in 1852 awarded Thompson the Jacksonian Prize for an essay on the ''Pathology and Treatment of Stricture of the Urethra'' (on [[stenosis]] of the [[urethra]], a common condition in the times of [[gonorrhea]] and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]]); and again in 1860 for his essay on the ''Health and Morbid Anatomy of the [[Prostate Gland]]''. These two memoirs belong to [[urology]], his [[medical speciality]]. Besides devising operative improvements, he wrote books and papers dealing with them, including:\n*''Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Urinary Organs'', \n*''Practical Lithotomy and Lithotrity'', \n*''Tumours of the Bladder'', \n*''Suprapubic Lithotomy'', and \n*''Preventive Treatment of Calculus Disease'',\n*[https://archive.org/details/pathologyandtre02thomgoog ''The pathology and treatment of stricture of the urethra and urinary fistulae'', 1885].\n\nOther books of a medical character were ''Food and Feeding'', and ''Diet in Relation to Age and Activity'', both of which passed through several editions. He produced two successful novels, ''Charley Kingston's Aunt'' (1885) and ''All But'' (1886).\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Thompson, Sir Henry|volume=26}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E003240b.htm|title=Thompson, Sir Henry, Bart (1820 - 1904)|publisher=Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Commons category|Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet}}\n{{Wikisource|Author:Henry Thompson}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041214210152/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/bookman/library/ROG/rog12.htm History of the Astrographic Department of the Royal Greenwich Observartory] highlights Sir Thompson's gifts of astronomical instruments.\n* {{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Henry|title=The Diseases of the prostate|url=https://archive.org/details/diseasesprostat00thomgoog|accessdate=17 May 2008|year=1883|publisher=J. & A.

It is the home of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise. It opened April 3, 2004, and hosted its first regular-season baseball game on April 12 of the same year, with the Phillies losing to the [[Cincinnati Reds]], 4\u20131.\n\nThe ballpark was built to replace the 33-year-old, now-demolished [[Veterans Stadium]], a [[American football|football]]/baseball multipurpose facility, and features a natural grass-and-dirt playing field and a number of Philadelphia-style food stands that serve [[cheesesteak]] sandwiches, [[hoagies]], [[Tastykake]]s, [[soft pretzels]], [[Yards Brewing Company|Yards]] and [[Yuengling]] beer, and many other regional specialties. The ballpark lies on the northeast corner of the Sports Complex, which includes [[Lincoln Financial Field]], the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]], and [[Xfinity Live!]], the Center's adjacent theme park and food court. The stadium seats 42,792.\n\n==History==\n\n===Planning===\nIn 1999, the Phillies and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] joined their [[western Pennsylvania]] counterparts, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], in making requests to replace both [[Veterans Stadium]] and [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]] with separate baseball and football stadiums. Pressure for new Philadelphia stadiums increased after a railing collapsed at The Vet during the 1998 [[Army\u2013Navy Game]], injuring eight cadets. The Pirates threatened to leave Pittsburgh in 1997, helping to convince the state legislature to approve funding for the four proposed stadiums. With their architectural plans already in place, [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] and the City of Pittsburgh approved the pacts swiftly, but debate in Philadelphia's city leadership continued even as Pittsburgh opened its stadiums, ([[PNC Park]] for the Pirates and [[Heinz Field]] for the Steelers), in 2001. The Eagles ultimately agreed to the site of a former food warehouse slightly southeast of Veterans Stadium. [[Lincoln Financial Field]] celebrated its grand opening in August 2003.\n[[File:\"Full House at Citizens Bank Park\" (Photo).jpg|thumb|left|The Phillies taking on the New York Mets at Citizens Bank Park]]\nThe Phillies originally sought to build a downtown ballpark similar to [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards|Baltimore]]'s, [[Coors Field|Denver]]'s, [[Great American Ball Park|Cincinnati]]'s, [[Progressive Field|Cleveland]]'s, [[Comerica Park|Detroit]]'s and [[AT&T Park|San Francisco]]'s. Various locations were proposed, including Broad and Spring Garden streets; Spring Garden and Delaware Avenue; and next to [[30th Street Station]] on the site of the former main post office. The team and the city announced that the site would be at 13th and Vine streets in [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Chinatown]], just north of Interstate 676, within walking distance of [[Center City Philadelphia|Center City]]. There was considerable support for a downtown ball park from business and labor and the city at large. But Chinatown residents protested, fearing a new ballpark would destroy their neighborhood. The City and team eventually settled on building at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex on the site of another abandoned food warehouse. In the years that followed, residents, fans, and owner [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]] expressed regret that the new ball park was not located in Center City. Regardless of location, however, the team set attendance records in [[2010 Philadelphia Phillies season|2010]] (3,647,249 fans, averaging 45,028) with all home games sold out for the first time in the team's long history (81), extending a sellout streak dating back to July of [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|2009]] to 123.<ref>[http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=mlb/teams/008/attendance.aspx?team=008 Phillies attendance figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125657/http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=mlb%2Fteams%2F008%2Fattendance.aspx%3Fteam%3D008 |date=2011-07-16 }}, sportsnetwork.com, retrieved October 6, 2010.</ref>\n\nChief architect of the new stadium was EwingCole's [[Stanley Cole (architect)|Stanley Cole]].<ref name=philly>{{cite news|first=Bonnie L.|last=Cook|title=Stanley M.

Ashburn Alley also features a memorabilia shop and a large bronze statue of Ashburn directly behind center field, as well as the [[flag of the United States|U.S. flag]], the flags of the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] and the City of [[Philadelphia]], a [[POW/MIA flag]] and the flags from the Phillies' championships (below).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Philadelphia Phillies|border=2}};\"|Year\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Philadelphia Phillies|border=2}};\"|Event\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Philadelphia Phillies|border=2}};\"|Championship\n|-\n| {{mlby|1915}}\n| [[1915 World Series]]\n| [[National League]] champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1950}}\n| [[1950 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1976}}\n| [[1976 National League Championship Series|1976 NLCS]]\n| [[National League East]] division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1977}}\n| [[1977 National League Championship Series|1977 NLCS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1978}}\n| [[1978 National League Championship Series|1978 NLCS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1980}}\n| [[1980 World Series]]\n| [[World Series]] champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1983}}\n| [[1983 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1993}}\n| [[1993 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|2007}}\n| [[2007 National League Division Series#Philadelphia vs. Colorado|2007 NLDS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|2008}}\n| [[2008 World Series]]\n| World Series champion\n|-\n|{{mlby|2009}}\n| [[2009 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n|{{mlby|2010}}\n| [[2010 National League Championship Series|2010 NLCS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n|{{mlby|2011}}\n| [[2011 National League Division Series#Philadelphia vs. St.Louis|2011 NLDS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|}\n\nFeatures of the Alley are:\n[[File:BullsBBQ.jpg|thumb|right|Bull's BBQ in Ashburn Alley]]\n[[File:Schmitter.jpg|thumb|The Schmitter]]\n*'''All-Star Walk''' \u2014 Granite markers pay tribute to Phillies players that have played in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] since its inception in 1933 and runs the length of Ashburn Alley.\n*'''Bull's BBQ''' \u2014 Relocated to left side of the scoreboard, out of the Alley (in the new \"Boardwalk Eats\" section), it is named in honor of and owned in part by former Phillies outfielder [[Greg Luzinski|Greg \"The Bull\" Luzinski]]. This southern-style [[barbecue]] features ribs, turkey legs along with pork, beef and chicken sandwiches and \"Bulldogs\" ([[kielbasa]]).\n*'''Seasons Pizza''' \u2013 A new pizza franchise in CBP that took over for Peace A Pizza starting in the 2008 season.\n*'''Planet Hoagie''' \u2013 Local franchise that makes [[hoagie]]s, including one named after a Phillies player each series.\n*'''Campo's''' \u2014 Philadelphia [[cheesesteaks]], replaced Rick's Steaks in 2009. The original Campo's opened in 1947.\n*'''[[Tony Luke's]]''' \u2014 Tony Luke's famous cheesesteaks and roast pork.\n*'''Games of Baseball''' \u2014 Sponsored by Citizens Bank, this interactive area features a video trivia game, where players compete for prizes, a run-the-bases game with the [[Phillie Phanatic]], and a \"Ring 'Em Up\" game (formerly a \"Pitch 'Em and Tip 'Em\" game) where you can throw at targets of a catcher.  Prior to 2010, a huge {{convert|22|ft|m}} high baseball themed pinball game was in this area. Players earn coupons and exchange them for prizes at a kiosk such as hats, shirts and other ballpark-imprinted memorabilia.\n*'''Harry The K's Bar and Grille''' \u2014 Named for late Phillies broadcaster [[Harry Kalas]], the bi-level bar and grill is built into the base of the [[scoreboard]], and serves finger foods and sandwiches, including \"The Schmitter\".\n[[File:Harry the K's Restaurant Menu Board, Citizens Bank Park.jpg|thumbnail|The menu board at Harry the K's Restaurant at Citizens Bank Park]]\n\n*'''Memory Lane''' and '''[[Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame|Phillies Wall of Fame]]''' \u2014 A history of baseball in Philadelphia is located behind the brick batting eye in center field, while the opposite wall commemorates members of the franchise who contributed to the franchise's history. It was in this area where [[Ryan Howard]] hit two of the park's longest home runs, on April 23, 2006 against the Marlins off Sergio Mitre, and against Aaron Harang of the Reds on June 27, 2007, currently the longest home run at Citizen's Bank Park at {{convert|505|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reuter|first1=Joel|title=bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8}}</ref> Second baseman [[Chase Utley]]'s homer was also into this area against the Astros on April 23, 2007 clearing the center wall and becoming only the second player to reach the Memory Lane area after Howard.\n*'''Exposed [[Bullpen]]s''' \u2014 Located in right-center field, the bi-level bullpens allow the fans to get very close to the players (especially the visiting team, who sit in the top level). Fans are allowed to heckle but must keep it clean. The section above the bullpen that contains the Phillies Wall of Fame is closed to the public about 30 minutes prior to first pitch and remains closed throughout the game, re-opening at the game's conclusion.\n*'''Rooftop Bleachers''' \u2014 Inspired by the 1920s and 1930s stands on North 20th Street outside [[Connie Mack Stadium|Shibe Park]], this area replicates the seating similar to that outside [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago. During the 2008 season, fans could go on top for $15 on Thursday home dates and get special food offers and events.\n*'''Starting Lineup (2004-2017)''' \u2014 The Phillies starting lineup that day was illustrated by giant {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} baseball cards as fans entered the left field gate.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, organist [[Paul Richardson (organist)|Paul Richardson]] performed from Ashburn Alley, as Citizens Bank Park was built without an organ booth.\n\n[[Image:spectrum panorama.jpg|thumb|center|550px|'''Citizens Bank Park''' (''right'') was the newest of the four locations comprising Philadelphia's \"Sports Complex\" when it opened in 2004; the four-decade-old '''[[Wachovia Spectrum]]''' (''center'') was the oldest (1967) (the arena closed October 31, 2009, and was demolished in 2011); to the left, tree-lined South Broad Street, the world's longest straight street; and the city's expansive skyline along the horizon to the north; in a photograph taken from the roof of the '''[[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]]''', built in 1996.]]\n\n===Other attractions===\n*'''Diamond and Hall of Fame Clubs''' \u2014 Two premium seating areas in the park. The Diamond Club, located behind home plate, includes an air-conditioned indoor club area with exclusive food and souvenir shops where ticket holders can watch batting practice on either side of the club (especially on rainy days). There are a total of 1,164 seats in the Diamond Club. A second level, called the Hall of Fame Club, is located between Sections 212 through 232. This air-conditioned area features exclusive food and souvenir stands akin to The Diamond Club, and also houses memorabilia from the teams' past going back to the 1880s, along with memorabilia from the Philadelphia Athletics. The Hall of Fame Club contains 6,600 seats. In addition to being an attraction to fans, the Hall of Fame level also houses the A/V crew on the first-base side of that level that controls the scoreboard and all other monitors throughout the park and is where [[Dan Baker (PA Announcer)|Dan Baker]] announces the game, as well as the press box, television, and radio booths.\n*'''High and Inside Pub''' \u2014 Located on the Terrace Level behind home plate, the area is open to groups before the ballgame, and the public once the games start.\n*'''Liberty Bell''' \u2014 Standing {{convert|102|ft|m}} above street level, this {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} mechanical, lighted replica of the [[Liberty Bell]] \"rings\" and lights up after every Phillies home run and victory. In recent years, the Phillies have promoted the [[hashtag]] \"#RingTheBell\".\n*'''New Era Phillies Team Store''' and ''''47 Alley Store''' \u2014 The team store is open year-round, and serves as the starting point for tours of the ballpark. The bi-level store features regular merchandise on the first level and player jerseys as well as Phanatic-themed items on the second level, while the Alley Store is open during all home games and features authentic replicas of older Phillies jerseys made by the famous Philadelphia retailer of vintage uniform shirts and caps, Mitchell and Ness, as well as other items. During the off-season, customizable jerseys are available in the main store when a stand next to the store is open during the season.\n*'''McFadden's Bar and Grille''' \u2014 Open year-round, this restaurant combined the McFadden's and Zanzibar Blue menus at the Third Base Gate. Since its opening, it has become a popular post-game (or event) site for the nearby Wells Fargo Center and Lincoln Financial Field. Closed in 2018.\n*'''Phanatic Phun Zone''' \u2014 Located at the First Base Gate plaza, this playground offers fun for guests eight years old and younger with slides, climb, explore and play games. A separate area for toddlers three years old and younger is found inside.\n*'''Phanatic Giant Shoe Slide''' \u2014 Located on the Terrace Level near home plate, kids could slide in and out of a replica of one of the Phanatic's sneakers.

It is the home of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise. It opened April 3, 2004, and hosted its first regular-season baseball game on April 12 of the same year, with the Phillies losing to the [[Cincinnati Reds]], 4\u20131.\n\nThe ballpark was built to replace the 33-year-old, now-demolished [[Veterans Stadium]], a [[American football|football]]/baseball multipurpose facility, and features a natural grass-and-dirt playing field and a number of Philadelphia-style food stands that serve [[cheesesteak]] sandwiches, [[hoagies]], [[Tastykake]]s, [[soft pretzels]], [[Yards Brewing Company|Yards]] and [[Yuengling]] beer, and many other regional specialties. The ballpark lies on the northeast corner of the Sports Complex, which includes [[Lincoln Financial Field]], the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]], and [[Xfinity Live!]], the Center's adjacent theme park and food court. The stadium seats 42,792.\n\n==History==\n\n===Planning===\nIn 1999, the Phillies and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] joined their [[western Pennsylvania]] counterparts, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], in making requests to replace both [[Veterans Stadium]] and [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]] with separate baseball and football stadiums. Pressure for new Philadelphia stadiums increased after a railing collapsed at The Vet during the 1998 [[Army\u2013Navy Game]], injuring eight cadets. The Pirates threatened to leave Pittsburgh in 1997, helping to convince the state legislature to approve funding for the four proposed stadiums. With their architectural plans already in place, [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] and the City of Pittsburgh approved the pacts swiftly, but debate in Philadelphia's city leadership continued even as Pittsburgh opened its stadiums, ([[PNC Park]] for the Pirates and [[Heinz Field]] for the Steelers), in 2001. The Eagles ultimately agreed to the site of a former food warehouse slightly southeast of Veterans Stadium. [[Lincoln Financial Field]] celebrated its grand opening in August 2003.\n[[File:\"Full House at Citizens Bank Park\" (Photo).jpg|thumb|left|The Phillies taking on the New York Mets at Citizens Bank Park]]\nThe Phillies originally sought to build a downtown ballpark similar to [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards|Baltimore]]'s, [[Coors Field|Denver]]'s, [[Great American Ball Park|Cincinnati]]'s, [[Progressive Field|Cleveland]]'s, [[Comerica Park|Detroit]]'s and [[AT&T Park|San Francisco]]'s. Various locations were proposed, including Broad and Spring Garden streets; Spring Garden and Delaware Avenue; and next to [[30th Street Station]] on the site of the former main post office. The team and the city announced that the site would be at 13th and Vine streets in [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Chinatown]], just north of Interstate 676, within walking distance of [[Center City Philadelphia|Center City]]. There was considerable support for a downtown ball park from business and labor and the city at large. But Chinatown residents protested, fearing a new ballpark would destroy their neighborhood. The City and team eventually settled on building at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex on the site of another abandoned food warehouse. In the years that followed, residents, fans, and owner [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]] expressed regret that the new ball park was not located in Center City. Regardless of location, however, the team set attendance records in [[2010 Philadelphia Phillies season|2010]] (3,647,249 fans, averaging 45,028) with all home games sold out for the first time in the team's long history (81), extending a sellout streak dating back to July of [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|2009]] to 123.<ref>[http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=mlb/teams/008/attendance.aspx?team=008 Phillies attendance figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125657/http://sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=mlb%2Fteams%2F008%2Fattendance.aspx%3Fteam%3D008 |date=2011-07-16 }}, sportsnetwork.com, retrieved October 6, 2010.</ref>\n\nChief architect of the new stadium was EwingCole's [[Stanley Cole (architect)|Stanley Cole]].<ref name=philly>{{cite news|first=Bonnie L.|last=Cook|title=Stanley M.

It is seen by Phillies fans as a compromise between the Phillies and their fans, many of whom wanted Citizens Bank Park named in honor of Ashburn.\n\nAshburn Alley is named for the slightly-overgrown grass which bordered the third base line at [[Shibe Park]] where Ashburn was famous for laying down bunts that stayed fair. The new Ashburn Alley, located near Ashburn's defensive position, is a walkway featuring restaurants, games and memorabilia from Phillies history.  Ashburn Alley also features a memorabilia shop and a large bronze statue of Ashburn directly behind center field, as well as the [[flag of the United States|U.S. flag]], the flags of the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] and the City of [[Philadelphia]], a [[POW/MIA flag]] and the flags from the Phillies' championships (below).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Philadelphia Phillies|border=2}};\"|Year\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Philadelphia Phillies|border=2}};\"|Event\n! style=\"text-align:center; {{Baseball primary style|Philadelphia Phillies|border=2}};\"|Championship\n|-\n| {{mlby|1915}}\n| [[1915 World Series]]\n| [[National League]] champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1950}}\n| [[1950 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1976}}\n| [[1976 National League Championship Series|1976 NLCS]]\n| [[National League East]] division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1977}}\n| [[1977 National League Championship Series|1977 NLCS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1978}}\n| [[1978 National League Championship Series|1978 NLCS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1980}}\n| [[1980 World Series]]\n| [[World Series]] champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1983}}\n| [[1983 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|1993}}\n| [[1993 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|2007}}\n| [[2007 National League Division Series#Philadelphia vs. Colorado|2007 NLDS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n| {{mlby|2008}}\n| [[2008 World Series]]\n| World Series champion\n|-\n|{{mlby|2009}}\n| [[2009 World Series]]\n| National League champion\n|-\n|{{mlby|2010}}\n| [[2010 National League Championship Series|2010 NLCS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|-\n|{{mlby|2011}}\n| [[2011 National League Division Series#Philadelphia vs. St.Louis|2011 NLDS]]\n| National League East division champion\n|}\n\nFeatures of the Alley are:\n[[File:BullsBBQ.jpg|thumb|right|Bull's BBQ in Ashburn Alley]]\n[[File:Schmitter.jpg|thumb|The Schmitter]]\n*'''All-Star Walk''' \u2014 Granite markers pay tribute to Phillies players that have played in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] since its inception in 1933 and runs the length of Ashburn Alley.\n*'''Bull's BBQ''' \u2014 Relocated to left side of the scoreboard, out of the Alley (in the new \"Boardwalk Eats\" section), it is named in honor of and owned in part by former Phillies outfielder [[Greg Luzinski|Greg \"The Bull\" Luzinski]]. This southern-style [[barbecue]] features ribs, turkey legs along with pork, beef and chicken sandwiches and \"Bulldogs\" ([[kielbasa]]).\n*'''Seasons Pizza''' \u2013 A new pizza franchise in CBP that took over for Peace A Pizza starting in the 2008 season.\n*'''Planet Hoagie''' \u2013 Local franchise that makes [[hoagie]]s, including one named after a Phillies player each series.\n*'''Campo's''' \u2014 Philadelphia [[cheesesteaks]], replaced Rick's Steaks in 2009.

Prior to 2010, a huge {{convert|22|ft|m}} high baseball themed pinball game was in this area.

It was in this area where [[Ryan Howard]] hit two of the park's longest home runs, on April 23, 2006 against the Marlins off Sergio Mitre, and against Aaron Harang of the Reds on June 27, 2007, currently the longest home run at Citizen's Bank Park at {{convert|505|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reuter|first1=Joel|title=bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1211802-the-longest-moon-shot-home-run-in-the-history-of-each-mlb-stadium/page/8}}</ref> Second baseman [[Chase Utley]]'s homer was also into this area against the Astros on April 23, 2007 clearing the center wall and becoming only the second player to reach the Memory Lane area after Howard.\n*'''Exposed [[Bullpen]]s''' \u2014 Located in right-center field, the bi-level bullpens allow the fans to get very close to the players (especially the visiting team, who sit in the top level). Fans are allowed to heckle but must keep it clean. The section above the bullpen that contains the Phillies Wall of Fame is closed to the public about 30 minutes prior to first pitch and remains closed throughout the game, re-opening at the game's conclusion.\n*'''Rooftop Bleachers''' \u2014 Inspired by the 1920s and 1930s stands on North 20th Street outside [[Connie Mack Stadium|Shibe Park]], this area replicates the seating similar to that outside [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago.

There are a total of 1,164 seats in the Diamond Club. A second level, called the Hall of Fame Club, is located between Sections 212 through 232. This air-conditioned area features exclusive food and souvenir stands akin to The Diamond Club, and also houses memorabilia from the teams' past going back to the 1880s, along with memorabilia from the Philadelphia Athletics. The Hall of Fame Club contains 6,600 seats. In addition to being an attraction to fans, the Hall of Fame level also houses the A/V crew on the first-base side of that level that controls the scoreboard and all other monitors throughout the park and is where [[Dan Baker (PA Announcer)|Dan Baker]] announces the game, as well as the press box, television, and radio booths.\n*'''High and Inside Pub''' \u2014 Located on the Terrace Level behind home plate, the area is open to groups before the ballgame, and the public once the games start.\n*'''Liberty Bell''' \u2014 Standing {{convert|102|ft|m}} above street level, this {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} mechanical, lighted replica of the [[Liberty Bell]] \"rings\" and lights up after every Phillies home run and victory. In recent years, the Phillies have promoted the [[hashtag]] \"#RingTheBell\".\n*'''New Era Phillies Team Store''' and ''''47 Alley Store''' \u2014 The team store is open year-round, and serves as the starting point for tours of the ballpark. The bi-level store features regular merchandise on the first level and player jerseys as well as Phanatic-themed items on the second level, while the Alley Store is open during all home games and features authentic replicas of older Phillies jerseys made by the famous Philadelphia retailer of vintage uniform shirts and caps, Mitchell and Ness, as well as other items. During the off-season, customizable jerseys are available in the main store when a stand next to the store is open during the season.\n*'''McFadden's Bar and Grille''' \u2014 Open year-round, this restaurant combined the McFadden's and Zanzibar Blue menus at the Third Base Gate. Since its opening, it has become a popular post-game (or event) site for the nearby Wells Fargo Center and Lincoln Financial Field. Closed in 2018.\n*'''Phanatic Phun Zone''' \u2014 Located at the First Base Gate plaza, this playground offers fun for guests eight years old and younger with slides, climb, explore and play games. A separate area for toddlers three years old and younger is found inside.\n*'''Phanatic Giant Shoe Slide''' \u2014 Located on the Terrace Level near home plate, kids could slide in and out of a replica of one of the Phanatic's sneakers.

The vote amassed less than 30% of the total eligible undergraduate student voting population. The Targum saw a reduction in funding of about 75% through student fees. The Targum responded by cutting its Friday print publication, decreasing its circulation to 5,000, and taking on a digital-first approach.\n\n==Referendum==\nIn order to secure student funding for the Daily Targum, the newspaper is required to hold a referendum every three years.
