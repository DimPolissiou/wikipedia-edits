The tubule has adjacent [[peritubular capillaries]] that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule. As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule, it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule: water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged (some are added, others are removed); first with the [[interstitial fluid]] outside the tubules, and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary. This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances. At the end of the tubule, the remaining fluid\u2014[[urine]]\u2014exits: it is composed of water, [[metabolic waste]], and [[toxins]].\n \nThe interior of Bowman's capsule, called Bowman's space, collects the filtrate from the filtering capillaries of the [[glomerular tuft]], which also contains [[mesangial cell]]s supporting these capillaries. These components function as the [[Renal physiology#Filtration|filtration]] unit and make up the [[renal corpuscle]]. The filtering structure (glomerular filtration barrier) has three layers composed of [[endothelial cell]]s, a [[basement membrane]], and [[podocyte]]s (foot processes). The tubule has five anatomically and functionally different parts: the [[proximal tubule]], which has a convoluted section the [[proximal convoluted tubule]] followed by a straight section (proximal straight tubule); the [[loop of Henle]], which has two parts, the descending loop of Henle (\"descending loop\") and the [[ascending loop of Henle]] (\"ascending loop\"); the [[distal convoluted tubule]] (\"distal loop\"); the [[connecting tubule]], and the [[collecting duct]]s. Nephrons have two lengths with different urine concentrating capacities: long juxtamedullary nephrons and short cortical nephrons.\n\nThe four mechanisms used to create and process the filtrate (the result of which is to convert blood to urine) are [[filtration]], [[reabsorption]], [[secretion]] and [[excretion]]. Filtration occurs in the [[glomerulus]] and is largely passive: it is dependent on the intracapillary blood pressure. About one-fifth of the plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries; four-fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries. Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman's capsule are [[blood proteins]], [[red blood cell]]s, [[white blood cell]]s and [[platelet]]s. Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day: 99% of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed. Reabsorption occurs in the [[renal tubule]]s and is either passive, due to [[diffusion]], or active, due to pumping against a concentration gradient. Secretion also occurs in the tubules and is active. Substances reabsorbed include: [[water]], [[sodium chloride]], [[glucose]], [[amino acid]]s, [[Lactic acid|lactate]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium phosphate]], [[uric acid]], and [[bicarbonate]]. Substances secreted include [[urea]], [[creatinine]], [[potassium]], [[hydrogen]], and [[uric acid]]. Some of the [[hormones]] which signal the tubules to alter the reabsorption or secretion rate, and thereby maintain homeostasis, include (along with the substance affected) [[vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone]] (water), [[aldosterone]] (sodium, potassium), [[parathyroid hormone]] (calcium, phosphate), [[atrial natriuretic peptide]] (sodium) and [[brain natriuretic peptide]] (sodium). A countercurrent system in the [[renal medulla]] provides the mechanism for generating a hypertonic interstitium, which allows the recovery of solute-free water from within the nephron and returning it to the venous vasculature when appropriate.\n\nSome diseases of the nephron predominantly affect either the glomeruli or the tubules. Glomerular diseases include [[diabetic nephropathy]], [[glomerulonephritis]] and [[IgA nephropathy]]; renal tubular diseases include [[acute tubular necrosis]] and [[polycystic kidney disease]].\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Physiology of Nephron.png|260px|thumb|right|Fig.1) Schematic diagram of the nephron (yellow), relevant circulation (red/blue), and the four methods of altering the filtrate.]] \nThe nephron is the functional unit of the kidney.<ref name=\"Pocock\">{{cite book|last1=Pocock|first1=Gillian|last2=Richards|first2=Christopher D.|title=Human physiology : the basis of medicine|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-856878-0|page=349|edition=3rd}}</ref> Each nephron is composed of a [[renal corpuscle]], the initial filtering component; and a renal tubule that processes and carries away the [[Filtration|filtered fluid]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of anatomy and physiology|last=J.|first=Tortora, Gerard|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|others=Derrickson, Bryan.|isbn=9780470233474|edition=12th|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=1024|oclc=192027371}}</ref>\n\n=== Renal corpuscle ===\n[[File:Filtration barrier.svg|thumb|260px|Fig.2) Schematic of the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB).\nA.

In other words, a ''juxtamedullary nephron'' is a nephron whose renal corpuscle is near the medulla, and whose [[proximal convoluted tubule]] and its associated [[loop of Henle]] occur deeper in the medulla than the other type of nephron, the [[cortical nephron]].\n\nThe juxtamedullary nephron comprises only 20\u201330% of the nephrons in the human kidney. However, it is this type of nephron which is most often depicted in illustrations of nephrons.\n\n== Functions ==\n[[File:2618 Nephron Secretion Reabsorption.jpg|thumb|Fig.3) Secretion and reabsorption of various substances throughout the nephron.]]\nThe nephron uses four mechanisms to convert blood into urine: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion of numerous substances.

It consists of a descending limb and an ascending limb. It begins in the cortex, receiving filtrate from the proximal convoluted tubule, extends into the medulla as the descending limb, and then returns to the cortex as the ascending limb to empty into the distal convoluted tubule. The primary role of the loop of Henle is to concentrate the salt in the interstitium, the tissue surrounding the loop.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nConsiderable differences aid in distinguishing the descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle. The [[Descending limb of loop of Henle|descending limb]] is permeable to water and noticeably less permeable to salt, and thus only indirectly contributes to the concentration of the interstitium. As the filtrate descends deeper into the [[Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] interstitium of the renal medulla, water flows freely out of the descending limb by [[osmosis]] until the tonicity of the filtrate and interstitium equilibrate. The hypertonicity of the medulla (and therefore concentration of urine) is determined in part by the size of the loop of Henle. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nUnlike the descending limb, the [[thin ascending limb of loop of Henle|thin ascending limb]] is impermeable to water, a critical feature of the [[countercurrent exchange]] mechanism employed by the loop. The ascending limb actively pumps sodium out of the filtrate, generating the hypertonic interstitium that drives countercurrent exchange. In passing through the ascending limb, the filtrate grows [[Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] since it has lost much of its sodium content. This hypotonic filtrate is passed to the [[distal convoluted tubule]] in the renal cortex.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Distal convoluted tubule===\nThe [[distal convoluted tubule]] has a different structure and function to that of the proximal convoluted tubule. Cells lining the tubule have numerous [[mitochondria]] to produce enough energy ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) for [[active transport]] to take place. Much of the ion transport taking place in the distal convoluted tubule is regulated by the [[endocrine system]]. In the presence of [[parathyroid hormone]], the distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs more calcium and secretes more phosphate. When [[aldosterone]] is present, more sodium is reabsorbed and more potassium secreted. [[Atrial natriuretic peptide]] causes the distal convoluted tubule to secrete more sodium.\n\n=== Connecting tubule ===\nThis is the final segment of the tubule before it enters the collecting duct system.\n\n=== Collecting duct system ===\n{{main|Collecting duct system}}\n[[File:Gray1133.png|thumbnail|Fig.6) Cross-sectional histologic preparation showing (b)small connecting tubules with simple columnar epithelium and (a) large connecting tubules with simple cuboidal epithelium.]]\n\nEach distal convoluted tubule delivers its filtrate to a [[collecting duct system|system of collecting ducts]], the first segment of which is the [[connecting tubule]]. The collecting duct system begins in the renal cortex and extends deep into the medulla. As the urine travels down the collecting duct system, it passes by the medullary interstitium which has a high sodium concentration as a result of the loop of Henle's [[Countercurrent exchange#In the kidney|countercurrent multiplier system]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nBecause it has a different origin during the [[development of the urinary and reproductive organs]] than the rest of the nephron, the collecting duct is sometimes not considered a part of the nephron. Instead of originating from the metanephrogenic blastema, the collecting duct originates from the [[ureteric bud]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThough the collecting duct is normally impermeable to water, it becomes permeable in the presence of [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH). ADH affects the function of [[aquaporins]], resulting in the reabsorption of water molecules as it passes through the collecting duct. Aquaporins are membrane proteins that selectively conduct water molecules while preventing the passage of ions and other solutes. As much as three-quarters of the water from urine can be reabsorbed as it leaves the collecting duct by osmosis. Thus the levels of ADH determine whether urine will be concentrated or diluted. An increase in ADH is an indication of [[dehydration]], while water sufficiency results in a decrease in ADH allowing for diluted urine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n[[Image:Kidney Nephron Cells.png|thumb|250px|Fig.7) \nCross-sectional diagram of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and adjacent structures: 1) top, yellow - distal convoluted tubule; 2) top, brown -macula densa cuboidal cells surrounding arterioles; 3) small blue cells - juxtaglomerular cells; 4) large blue cells - mesangial cells; 5) tan - podocytes lining [[Bowman's capsule]] adjacent to capillaries, and parietal layer of capsule, 6)center - five glomerular capillaries, and the 6)bottom, purple - exiting tubule.

It produces and secretes into the circulation the enzyme [[renin]] (angiotensinogenase), which cleaves [[angiotensinogen]] and results in the ten amino acid substance angiotensin-1 (A-1).  A-1 is then converted to angiotensin-2, a potent vasoconstrictor, by removing two amino acids: this is accomplished by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). This sequence of events is referred to as the [[renin\u2013angiotensin system]] (RAS) or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The JGA is located between the thick ascending limb and the afferent arteriole. It contains three components: the [[macula densa]], [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s, and [[extraglomerular mesangial cell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Clinical significance==\nDiseases of the nephron predominantly affect either the glomeruli or the tubules.

In other words, a ''juxtamedullary nephron'' is a nephron whose renal corpuscle is near the medulla, and whose [[proximal convoluted tubule]] and its associated [[loop of Henle]] occur deeper in the medulla than the other type of nephron, the [[cortical nephron]].\n\nThe juxtamedullary nephron comprises only 20\u201330% of the nephrons in the human kidney. However, it is this type of nephron which is most often depicted in illustrations of nephrons.\n\n== Functions ==\n[[File:2618 Nephron Secretion Reabsorption.jpg|thumb|Fig.3) Secretion and reabsorption of various substances throughout the nephron.]]\nThe nephron uses four mechanisms to convert blood into urine: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion of numerous substances. The structure and function of the epithelial cells lining the lumen change during the course of the nephron, and have segments named by their location and which reflects their different functions. {{citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[File:Kidney nephron molar transport diagram.svg|thumbnail|Fig.4) Diagram outlining movement of ions in nephron, with the collecting ducts on the right.]]\n[[File:Complex proximal tubule with acid base.svg|thumb|Fig.5) Proximal tubule cell showing pumps involved in acid base balance, left is the lumen of tubule]]\n\n===Proximal convoluted tubule===\nThe proximal tubule as a part of the nephron can be divided into an initial convoluted portion and a following straight (descending) portion.<ref name=boron743>{{cite book |author=Walter F. Boron |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |page=743 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc= |doi=|year=2005 }}</ref> Fluid in the filtrate entering the proximal convoluted tubule is reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries, including approximately two-thirds of the filtered salt and water and all filtered [[organic compound|organic]] solutes (primarily [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]]s).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Loop of Henle===\nThe [[loop of Henle]] is a U-shaped tube that extends from the proximal tubule. It consists of a descending limb and an ascending limb. It begins in the cortex, receiving filtrate from the proximal convoluted tubule, extends into the medulla as the descending limb, and then returns to the cortex as the ascending limb to empty into the distal convoluted tubule. The primary role of the loop of Henle is to concentrate the salt in the interstitium, the tissue surrounding the loop.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nConsiderable differences aid in distinguishing the descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle. The [[Descending limb of loop of Henle|descending limb]] is permeable to water and noticeably less permeable to salt, and thus only indirectly contributes to the concentration of the interstitium. As the filtrate descends deeper into the [[Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] interstitium of the renal medulla, water flows freely out of the descending limb by [[osmosis]] until the tonicity of the filtrate and interstitium equilibrate. The hypertonicity of the medulla (and therefore concentration of urine) is determined in part by the size of the loop of Henle. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nUnlike the descending limb, the [[thin ascending limb of loop of Henle|thin ascending limb]] is impermeable to water, a critical feature of the [[countercurrent exchange]] mechanism employed by the loop. The ascending limb actively pumps sodium out of the filtrate, generating the hypertonic interstitium that drives countercurrent exchange. In passing through the ascending limb, the filtrate grows [[Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] since it has lost much of its sodium content. This hypotonic filtrate is passed to the [[distal convoluted tubule]] in the renal cortex.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Distal convoluted tubule===\nThe [[distal convoluted tubule]] has a different structure and function to that of the proximal convoluted tubule. Cells lining the tubule have numerous [[mitochondria]] to produce enough energy ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) for [[active transport]] to take place. Much of the ion transport taking place in the distal convoluted tubule is regulated by the [[endocrine system]]. In the presence of [[parathyroid hormone]], the distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs more calcium and secretes more phosphate. When [[aldosterone]] is present, more sodium is reabsorbed and more potassium secreted. [[Atrial natriuretic peptide]] causes the distal convoluted tubule to secrete more sodium.\n\n=== Connecting tubule ===\nThis is the final segment of the tubule before it enters the collecting duct system.\n\n=== Collecting duct system ===\n{{main|Collecting duct system}}\n[[File:Gray1133.png|thumbnail|Fig.6) Cross-sectional histologic preparation showing (b)small connecting tubules with simple columnar epithelium and (a) large connecting tubules with simple cuboidal epithelium.]]\n\nEach distal convoluted tubule delivers its filtrate to a [[collecting duct system|system of collecting ducts]], the first segment of which is the [[connecting tubule]]. The collecting duct system begins in the renal cortex and extends deep into the medulla. As the urine travels down the collecting duct system, it passes by the medullary interstitium which has a high sodium concentration as a result of the loop of Henle's [[Countercurrent exchange#In the kidney|countercurrent multiplier system]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nBecause it has a different origin during the [[development of the urinary and reproductive organs]] than the rest of the nephron, the collecting duct is sometimes not considered a part of the nephron. Instead of originating from the metanephrogenic blastema, the collecting duct originates from the [[ureteric bud]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThough the collecting duct is normally impermeable to water, it becomes permeable in the presence of [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH). ADH affects the function of [[aquaporins]], resulting in the reabsorption of water molecules as it passes through the collecting duct. Aquaporins are membrane proteins that selectively conduct water molecules while preventing the passage of ions and other solutes. As much as three-quarters of the water from urine can be reabsorbed as it leaves the collecting duct by osmosis. Thus the levels of ADH determine whether urine will be concentrated or diluted. An increase in ADH is an indication of [[dehydration]], while water sufficiency results in a decrease in ADH allowing for diluted urine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n[[Image:Kidney Nephron Cells.png|thumb|250px|Fig.7) \nCross-sectional diagram of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and adjacent structures: 1) top, yellow - distal convoluted tubule; 2) top, brown -macula densa cuboidal cells surrounding arterioles; 3) small blue cells - juxtaglomerular cells; 4) large blue cells - mesangial cells; 5) tan - podocytes lining [[Bowman's capsule]] adjacent to capillaries, and parietal layer of capsule, 6)center - five glomerular capillaries, and the 6)bottom, purple - exiting tubule.

It produces and secretes into the circulation the enzyme [[renin]] (angiotensinogenase), which cleaves [[angiotensinogen]] and results in the ten amino acid substance angiotensin-1 (A-1).  A-1 is then converted to angiotensin-2, a potent vasoconstrictor, by removing two amino acids: this is accomplished by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). This sequence of events is referred to as the [[renin\u2013angiotensin system]] (RAS) or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The JGA is located between the thick ascending limb and the afferent arteriole. It contains three components: the [[macula densa]], [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s, and [[extraglomerular mesangial cell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Clinical significance==\nDiseases of the nephron predominantly affect either the glomeruli or the tubules.

It is a subsidiary of the [[Brunswick Boat Group]], a division of the [[Brunswick Corporation]]. Boston Whalers were originally produced in [[Massachusetts]], hence the name, but today are manufactured in [[Edgewater, Volusia County, Florida|Edgewater, Florida]].\n\n==History==\nRichard \"Dick\" Fisher graduated from Harvard University in 1936. He ran a company building small, lightweight boats out of [[balsa wood]]. He designed a [[rowboat]] and got the materials to build it, but he never completed it.\n\nIn the 1950s, [[polyurethane]] foam, a stiff, lightweight, buoyant material, was invented.  Fisher imagined it as a replacement for the lightweight balsa used in small boat construction, and in 1954 he constructed a small sailing dinghy filled with the foam, with a design similar to the [[Sunfish (sailboat)|Sunfish]].  He showed the finished product to his friend, [[naval architecture|naval architect]] C. Raymond Hunt.  Hunt recognized potential in the process, however he did not feel the design was particularly suited to sailboats.  Instead, he created a design based on the [[Hickman Sea Sled]] featuring a [[cathedral hull]].\n\nFisher built a prototype out of Styrofoam and epoxy. \"It had two keels,\" said Fisher, \"one inverted V between the runners and an anti-skid, anti-trip chine.\" Fisher tested the boat all that summer and thought it was \u201cthe greatest thing ever\u201d. That fall, Fisher started running the boat in rough weather, and found that the hull displayed issues with handling and [[cavitation]]. Under heavy load, and off-plane, the cavity in the middle of the hull forced air into the water, and then back into the prop.  Fisher approached Hickman, the original designer of the wooden Sea Sled for a solution. However, Hickman thought his design needed no modifications. Fisher contemplated putting \"some stuff on the bottom to move that airy water out of there.\" He used a method of trial and error, laying fiberglass on the bottom of the hull in the morning and running the boat behind his house when the glass cured. If the design did not work, he would bring it back to his house and start over.\n\nThis prototype boat began to have a slight V bottom and the two runners on the sides. Fisher then approached Hunt to examine the design changes. Hunt added his own design changes to the prototype; most notably, a third runner in the center of the hull. Fisher then built a prototype based on this new design to serve as a plug for the production mold.\n\nFisher and Hunt then took the boat on sea trials. One of these tests was to run the {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=on||}} boat from [[Cohasset, Massachusetts]] to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] and back, which is roughly {{convert|120|mi||||}}. During these sea trials, Fisher found another small flaw in the boats design: it was \"wetter than hell.\" \"A lot wetter,\" he said, \"than the other boat had been.\" The reason for this, according to him, was the {{convert|9|in|cm|adj=mid|-wide|}} sole throwing spray into the boat.<ref name=\"Plunkett2017\">{{cite book|author=Matthew D. Plunkett|title=Unsinkable: The History of Boston Whaler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I85EDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA18|date=1 September 2017|publisher=Motorbooks|isbn=978-0-7603-6000-2|page=18}}</ref> Since the mold was already made, it was modified by adding to the flat center between the three chines, turning it into a V-shape.

It is a subsidiary of the [[Brunswick Boat Group]], a division of the [[Brunswick Corporation]]. Boston Whalers were originally produced in [[Massachusetts]], hence the name, but today are manufactured in [[Edgewater, Volusia County, Florida|Edgewater, Florida]].\n\n==History==\nRichard \"Dick\" Fisher graduated from Harvard University in 1936. He ran a company building small, lightweight boats out of [[balsa wood]]. He designed a [[rowboat]] and got the materials to build it, but he never completed it.\n\nIn the 1950s, [[polyurethane]] foam, a stiff, lightweight, buoyant material, was invented.  Fisher imagined it as a replacement for the lightweight balsa used in small boat construction, and in 1954 he constructed a small sailing dinghy filled with the foam, with a design similar to the [[Sunfish (sailboat)|Sunfish]].  He showed the finished product to his friend, [[naval architecture|naval architect]] C. Raymond Hunt.  Hunt recognized potential in the process, however he did not feel the design was particularly suited to sailboats.  Instead, he created a design based on the [[Hickman Sea Sled]] featuring a [[cathedral hull]].\n\nFisher built a prototype out of Styrofoam and epoxy. \"It had two keels,\" said Fisher, \"one inverted V between the runners and an anti-skid, anti-trip chine.\" Fisher tested the boat all that summer and thought it was \u201cthe greatest thing ever\u201d. That fall, Fisher started running the boat in rough weather, and found that the hull displayed issues with handling and [[cavitation]]. Under heavy load, and off-plane, the cavity in the middle of the hull forced air into the water, and then back into the prop.  Fisher approached Hickman, the original designer of the wooden Sea Sled for a solution. However, Hickman thought his design needed no modifications. Fisher contemplated putting \"some stuff on the bottom to move that airy water out of there.\" He used a method of trial and error, laying fiberglass on the bottom of the hull in the morning and running the boat behind his house when the glass cured. If the design did not work, he would bring it back to his house and start over.\n\nThis prototype boat began to have a slight V bottom and the two runners on the sides. Fisher then approached Hunt to examine the design changes. Hunt added his own design changes to the prototype; most notably, a third runner in the center of the hull. Fisher then built a prototype based on this new design to serve as a plug for the production mold.\n\nFisher and Hunt then took the boat on sea trials. One of these tests was to run the {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=on||}} boat from [[Cohasset, Massachusetts]] to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] and back, which is roughly {{convert|120|mi||||}}. During these sea trials, Fisher found another small flaw in the boats design: it was \"wetter than hell.\" \"A lot wetter,\" he said, \"than the other boat had been.\" The reason for this, according to him, was the {{convert|9|in|cm|adj=mid|-wide|}} sole throwing spray into the boat.<ref name=\"Plunkett2017\">{{cite book|author=Matthew D.

It was forced to divest its holding companies and reorganize due to the passage of the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]]. Following the passage of the Act, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) selected the largest of the U.S. holding companies, Ebasco to be the test case of the law before the U.S. Supreme Court. The court case known as [[Securities and Exchange Commission v. Electric Bond and Share company]] was settled in favor of the SEC on March 28th 1938 <ref name=\"supreme court ruling\">{{cite web |title=Electric Bond & Share Co. v. SEC - 1938 |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/303/419/ |website=Justia |access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref>. It took twenty-five years of legal action by  the SEC to break up Ebasco and the other major U.S. electric holding companies until they conformed with the 1935 act. It was allowed to retain control of its foreign electric power holding company known as the American & Foreign Power Company (A&FP). After its reorganization, it became an [[investment company]], but soon turned into a major designer and engineer of both [[fossil fuel]] and [[nuclear power]] electric generation facilities. Its involvement in the 1983 financial collapse of the [[Washington Public Power Supply System]]'s five nuclear reactors led to Ebasco's demise because of the suspension of nuclear power orders and lawsuits that included numerous asbestos claims. The U.S. nuclear industry stopped all construction of new facilities following the 1979 nuclear meltdown at [[Three Mile Island]], going into decline because of radiation safety concerns and major construction cost overruns.\n[[File:Electric Bond and Share Company Holding Companies and investments.jpg|thumb|Electric Bond and Share Company investments]]\n\n==History==\nThe Electric Bond and Share Group was organized in 1905 as a [[holding company]] for electric utility company securities by the General Electric Company using its employees' retirement investment fund. The General Electric Company was originally known as the Edison Electric Company until [[J. P. Morgan]] pushed [[Thomas Edison]] and its president [[Samuel Insull]] out of the company in 1892. Morgan was known for his style of monopolization of major U.S. industries, called Morganization,<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{cite web |title=Morganization |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/morganization.asp |website=Investopedia.com |access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> that included [[AT&T]], [[U.S. Steel]] and a substantial part of the country's railroad companies. Morgan's takeover of General Electric took place just as Thomas Edison was losing his battle against [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[George Westinghouse]] over the contract to light the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]] as well as build the world's largest hydro-electric system at Niagara Falls. At the height on the [[war of the currents]], Westinghouse was forced to sell all of Tesla's [[alternating current]] patents to Morgan.<ref name=\"Edison vs. Tesla\">{{cite web |title=Edison vs. Westinghouse: A Shocking Rivalry |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/edison-vs-westinghouse-a-shocking-rivalry-102146036/ |website=Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roosevelt's Warning - Water Power Monopoly America's Greatest Menace 1923 Public Ownership Vol 7 No 7.png|thumb|Roosevelt's Warning - Water Power Monopoly America's Greatest Menace]]\nWith Morgan's acquisition of General Electric he used his position as the country's most powerful financier to set in motion a plan to monopolize the entire country's electric industry via the Electric Bond and Share Group. Until his death in 1913, Morgan was opposed to any form of government regulation. His firing of Samuel Insull resulted with Insull moving to Chicago, where he organized the second-largest holding company in the country, the Middle West Utilities Company<ref name=\"Insull empire\">{{cite web |title=Middle West Utilities and Sam Insull |url=https://lawaspect.com/middle-west-utilities-company-samuel-insull/ |website=LawAspect.com |access-date=February 10, 2019}}</ref> or what is known today as [[Exelon]]. Insull would actively promote the idea of a regulated [[Monopoly#Government-granted monopoly|monopoly]] because of the high cost of electrical infrastructure. About the same time as [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]]'s [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt#Trust busting and regulation|trust busting]] campaign against Morgan, Rockefeller and other elites was gaining national attention, the [[National Civic Federation]] (NCF) was formed.  It carried out extensive investigations and debates among prominent business men and organized labor over the issue of public vs. private ownership of electric power. Insull's public support for regulation helped popularize NCF's model legislation that quickly spread nationwide after the state of New York adopted its own variation. Morgan's son [[J. P. Morgan Jr.]] carried on with the House of Morgan, including his father's goal of a national electric monopoly but was up against the reformist progressive era. \n\nBy 1925, General Electric's Electric Bond & Share Group was the largest owner of U.S. and foreign electric companies holding over 10% of the country's companies as subsidiaries organized into five major holding companies.  General Electric made a purely symbolic gesture to reduce growing public anger by divesting control of the company leaving Morgan still in financial control.<ref name=\"ebasco history\">{{cite web |title=ebasco history |url=http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6713g3m |website=Snac Cooperative |access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> The Commonwealth and Southern Corporation, known today as the [[Southern Company]], and the reorganized Electric Bond And Share Company (EBASCo) were both part of J.

The commission's 48,000-page report included entire volumes for each of the country's major utility companies. The FTC valued EBASCo and its five holding companies at $3.5 billion, along with major investments in dozens of other major U.S. companies. Within the five main holding companies were 121 U.S. subsidiaries, along with a foreign holding company that operated in 16 countries and had 70 subsidies.\n\nBecause he was a strong proponent of public power, [[Franklin D.

In a joint session of the House and Senate, he pushed through the [[Emergency Banking Act]] along with [[Executive Order 6102]] that blocked the hoarding of gold and stopped the major New York banks from taking gold supplies out of the country.  Roosevelt then selected Ferdinand Pecora to investigate Morgan and the country's other major banks<ref name=\"Pecora\">{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Gilbert |title=The Man Who Busted the \u2018Banksters\u2019 |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-man-who-busted-the-banksters-932416/ |website=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref>. Both [[Pecora Commission|Pecora]] and the Federal Trade Commission investigations <ref name=\"Power Struggle\"></ref> exposed the fact that the electric industry was the most capital intensive industry. The May 24th, 1933 Pecora hearings rocked the country, focusing on J.P. Morgan and his financial empire, whose top lieutenants paid no taxes. In his 1939 book Wall Street Under Oath: The Story of Our Modern Money Changers, [[Ferdinand Pecora]] stated that \"Undoubtedly, this small group of highly placed financiers, controlling the very springs of economic activity, holds more real power than any similar group in the United States.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pecora |first1=Ferdinand |title=Wall Street Under Oath: The Story of Our Modern Money Changers |date=1939 |publisher=A.M> Kelley |isbn=978-0-678-00372-5}}</ref>\n\nThe 1933 [[Pecora Commission]] hearings identified the National City Company, known today as [[Citibank]], as the location where Morgan conducted EBASCo's investment operations, which played a prominent role in the passage of the [[Glass\u2013Steagall legislation]].

The act was used to break up the country's electric industry into regions confined by state boundaries so that state agencies could properly regulate each company. Each year, the SEC reported on the compliance status of the industry.  As of 1949, 210 holding companies affecting 918 of the country's electric companies had come under the SEC's legal jurisdiction and procedures, with 46 holding companies still active.  In its 1949 annual report,<ref name=\"sec report\">{{cite web |title=1949 SEC Annual Report |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/annual_report/1949.pdf |website=SEC.gov |access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref> the SEC documented the history of their order for EBASCo to break up its five major holding companies' combined assets worth $3.5 billion.\n\nIn 1940, congressional investigations of brokerage firms, insurance companies and their relationship to the electric industry exposed that Middle South Utilities, the Southern Group and Ebasco were all financed by Morgan Stanley,<ref name=\"Power Struggle\">{{cite book |last1=Rudolph |first1=Richard |last2=Ridley |first2=Scott |title=Power Struggle: The Hundred-Year War of Electricity |date=1986 |publisher=Harper & Row |isbn=0-06-015584-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/powerstrugglehun00rudo }}</ref> with Wall Street having financial influence over nearly 80% of the country's electric industry.\n\nFollowing the passage of the 1935 Act, Ebasco went into the U.S. court system in an attempt overturn the act but failed (see external links for major court cases). Ebasco was then required to register its holding companies and comply with SEC orders. On August 23, 1941, its holding company known as the National Power & Light Co. was ordered to break up its 27 subsidiaries. On March 22, 1949, the SEC signed off on the final breakup of National that included major holdings in Pennsylvania [[PPL Corporation]], the Carolinas and Alabama (see subsidiary list). \n\nOn August 22, 1942, the SEC ordered the breakup of Ebasco's holding companies known as American Power & Light Corp. that included 35 subsidiaries and the Electric Power & Light Corporation with its 24 subsidiaries. American appealed the ruling but lost before the U.S. Supreme Court on November 25, 1946. As of 1949, all but one of American's subsidiaries were in compliance. Electric Power and its sub-holding company United Gas Corporation finally agreed to its breakup on March 2, 1949. Electric Power was then re-organized as Middle South Utilities Inc. and is known today as [[Entergy]].\n\nIn 1939, proceedings before the SEC were initiated to break up EBASCo's American Gas & Electric Company. On December, 28, 1945, the agency agreed to allow it to retain control of its central region of subsidiaries in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, if it let go of its companies in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In 1946, it attempted to acquire the Continental Gas & Electric Corp. but was denied.  American Gas & Electric Company was finally spun off in 1958 to become [[American Electric Power]] (AEP).\n\nAs part of a national campaign to deregulate the electric industry, the Bush administration and Congress passed the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] that repealed the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n\n===EBASCo holding companies prior to 1935===\n[[File:1922 5-13 Electric World SZ Mitchell.png|thumb|1905-1933 President of EBASCo]]\nThe following EBASCo holding companies, which includes some of its subsidiaries came under enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission with the passage of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935. \n\n====American Gas & Electric Company====\nIncorporated in 1906, and controlled by EBASCo., American Gas & Electric Company was finally spun off in 1958 and became [[American Electric Power]].

With its agenda of enforcing patents, General Electric (GE) had been buying up electric stocks worldwide, but also started taking control of companies via its equipment sales and other services formerly performed by its holding company, the Electric Bond and Share Group.  In 1917, Electric Bond and Share Group's first major foreign electric acquisition, at the request of the U.S. government, to take control of electric production for two cities near the [[Panama Canal]] as a counter strategy against nearby German interests.   In 1920, Electric Bond obtained control of Guatemalan electric facilities that the U.S. government had seized from Germany during the war.   This was followed in 1922 by a dramatic burst of purchasing across central and South America that was followed the next year by the formation of the American & Foreign Power Company.\n\nIn 1925, GE would dispose of its Ebasco stocks because of negative public opinion, however GE's chairman continued to sit on American & Foreign Power's board of directors while its founding president Sydney Z.

Following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898 the country was forced into an exclusive relationship with the United States.  The U. S. allowed Cuba to be independent, but required it to operate under the [[Platt Amendment]] of 1901, turning it into an exclusive U.S. plantation colony with its sugar exports only allowed to be marketed in the U.S.   Business interests deployed a combination of [[Scientific racism]] and [[Scientific management]] practices that left the country exclusively in the hands of American companies.\n\nIt started in 1922 with GE's representative, Henry Catlin purchasing General [[Gerardo Machado]]'s electric company and then donating $500,000 to the general's successful bid to become Cuba's President in 1924<ref name=\"A&FP cuba2\">{{cite book |last1=O'Brien |first1=Thomas |title=The Revolutionary Mission American Enterprise in Latin America, 1900\u20131945 |date=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521663441 |pages=771-774}}</ref>.  GE would spend $100 million to purchase control of Cuba's entire electric infrastructure.   This led to 40 years of societal stresses, years of military dictatorships, the infamous [[Havana Conference|U.S. Mafia]] operations in Havana and the [[Cuban Revolution]] which allowed Cuba to  nationalize American & Foreign Power's control of the country's electric utilities.\n* Argentina - 100 different electric companies<ref name=\"A&FP Argentina\">{{cite web |title=July 6th 1929: Commercial Intelligence Journal |url=https://archive.org/details/commercialinte1929p2cana/page/n11 |website=archive.org |publisher=Canadian Government |accessdate=16 February 2019}}</ref>\n* Brazil\n* Canada - British Columbia Power Corporation\n* Chile - all major electric utilities <ref name=\"A&FP Argentina\"></ref>\n* China - 1929 Shanghai Power Company purchased for $32 million\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba - Cuba Electric Co. taken public by Cuba in 1960\n* Ecuador\n* Guatemala\n* India\n* Italy - Italian Superpower Corporation\n* Japan -  Two Companies\n* Mexico\n* Panama - 1917 purchased two companies at the request of the U.S. around the Panama Canal\n* Venezuela\n\nCOMMONWEALTH & SOUTHERN CORPORATION.\n\nELECTRIC INVESTORS, INC.

It was forced to divest its holding companies and reorganize due to the passage of the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]]. Following the passage of the Act, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) selected the largest of the U.S. holding companies, Ebasco to be the test case of the law before the U.S. Supreme Court. The court case known as [[Securities and Exchange Commission v. Electric Bond and Share company]] was settled in favor of the SEC on March 28th 1938 <ref name=\"supreme court ruling\">{{cite web |title=Electric Bond & Share Co. v. SEC - 1938 |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/303/419/ |website=Justia |access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref>. It took twenty-five years of legal action by  the SEC to break up Ebasco and the other major U.S. electric holding companies until they conformed with the 1935 act. It was allowed to retain control of its foreign electric power holding company known as the American & Foreign Power Company (A&FP). After its reorganization, it became an [[investment company]], but soon turned into a major designer and engineer of both [[fossil fuel]] and [[nuclear power]] electric generation facilities. Its involvement in the 1983 financial collapse of the [[Washington Public Power Supply System]]'s five nuclear reactors led to Ebasco's demise because of the suspension of nuclear power orders and lawsuits that included numerous asbestos claims. The U.S. nuclear industry stopped all construction of new facilities following the 1979 nuclear meltdown at [[Three Mile Island]], going into decline because of radiation safety concerns and major construction cost overruns.\n[[File:Electric Bond and Share Company Holding Companies and investments.jpg|thumb|Electric Bond and Share Company investments]]\n\n==History==\nThe Electric Bond and Share Group was organized in 1905 as a [[holding company]] for electric utility company securities by the General Electric Company using its employees' retirement investment fund. The General Electric Company was originally known as the Edison Electric Company until [[J. P. Morgan]] pushed [[Thomas Edison]] and its president [[Samuel Insull]] out of the company in 1892. Morgan was known for his style of monopolization of major U.S. industries, called Morganization,<ref name=\"Morgan\">{{cite web |title=Morganization |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/morganization.asp |website=Investopedia.com |access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> that included [[AT&T]], [[U.S. Steel]] and a substantial part of the country's railroad companies. Morgan's takeover of General Electric took place just as Thomas Edison was losing his battle against [[Nikola Tesla]] and [[George Westinghouse]] over the contract to light the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]] as well as build the world's largest hydro-electric system at Niagara Falls. At the height on the [[war of the currents]], Westinghouse was forced to sell all of Tesla's [[alternating current]] patents to Morgan.<ref name=\"Edison vs. Tesla\">{{cite web |title=Edison vs. Westinghouse: A Shocking Rivalry |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/edison-vs-westinghouse-a-shocking-rivalry-102146036/ |website=Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Roosevelt's Warning - Water Power Monopoly America's Greatest Menace 1923 Public Ownership Vol 7 No 7.png|thumb|Roosevelt's Warning - Water Power Monopoly America's Greatest Menace]]\nWith Morgan's acquisition of General Electric he used his position as the country's most powerful financier to set in motion a plan to monopolize the entire country's electric industry via the Electric Bond and Share Group. Until his death in 1913, Morgan was opposed to any form of government regulation. His firing of Samuel Insull resulted with Insull moving to Chicago, where he organized the second-largest holding company in the country, the Middle West Utilities Company<ref name=\"Insull empire\">{{cite web |title=Middle West Utilities and Sam Insull |url=https://lawaspect.com/middle-west-utilities-company-samuel-insull/ |website=LawAspect.com |access-date=February 10, 2019}}</ref> or what is known today as [[Exelon]]. Insull would actively promote the idea of a regulated [[Monopoly#Government-granted monopoly|monopoly]] because of the high cost of electrical infrastructure. About the same time as [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]]'s [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt#Trust busting and regulation|trust busting]] campaign against Morgan, Rockefeller and other elites was gaining national attention, the [[National Civic Federation]] (NCF) was formed.  It carried out extensive investigations and debates among prominent business men and organized labor over the issue of public vs. private ownership of electric power. Insull's public support for regulation helped popularize NCF's model legislation that quickly spread nationwide after the state of New York adopted its own variation. Morgan's son [[J. P. Morgan Jr.]] carried on with the House of Morgan, including his father's goal of a national electric monopoly but was up against the reformist progressive era. \n\nBy 1925, General Electric's Electric Bond & Share Group was the largest owner of U.S. and foreign electric companies holding over 10% of the country's companies as subsidiaries organized into five major holding companies.  General Electric made a purely symbolic gesture to reduce growing public anger by divesting control of the company leaving Morgan still in financial control.<ref name=\"ebasco history\">{{cite web |title=ebasco history |url=http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6713g3m |website=Snac Cooperative |access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> The Commonwealth and Southern Corporation, known today as the [[Southern Company]], and the reorganized Electric Bond And Share Company (EBASCo) were both part of J.

The commission's 48,000-page report included entire volumes for each of the country's major utility companies. The FTC valued EBASCo and its five holding companies at $3.5 billion, along with major investments in dozens of other major U.S. companies. Within the five main holding companies were 121 U.S. subsidiaries, along with a foreign holding company that operated in 16 countries and had 70 subsidies.\n\nBecause he was a strong proponent of public power, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] used the collapse of Samuel Insull's Middle West Utilities electric empire in June 1932<ref name=\"Insull empire\"></ref> as one of his most important election campaign issues.<ref name=\"FDR electric theory\">{{cite web |last1=Moris |first1=David  |title=Defending the Public Good: FDR\u2019s Portland Speech |url=https://ilsr.org/defending-public-good-fdrs-portland-speech/ |website=Institute For Local Self Reliance |access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref> The failed [[Giuseppe Zangara|assassination]] attempt on his life in February 1933 later became part of U.S. Marine Corps General [[Smedley Butler]]'s claim of a [[Business Plot]] against Roosevelt by J.

In a joint session of the House and Senate, he pushed through the [[Emergency Banking Act]] along with [[Executive Order 6102]] that blocked the hoarding of gold and stopped the major New York banks from taking gold supplies out of the country.  Roosevelt then selected Ferdinand Pecora to investigate Morgan and the country's other major banks<ref name=\"Pecora\">{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Gilbert |title=The Man Who Busted the \u2018Banksters\u2019 |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-man-who-busted-the-banksters-932416/ |website=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref>. Both [[Pecora Commission|Pecora]] and the Federal Trade Commission investigations <ref name=\"Power Struggle\"></ref> exposed the fact that the electric industry was the most capital intensive industry. The May 24th, 1933 Pecora hearings rocked the country, focusing on J.P. Morgan and his financial empire, whose top lieutenants paid no taxes. In his 1939 book Wall Street Under Oath: The Story of Our Modern Money Changers, [[Ferdinand Pecora]] stated that \"Undoubtedly, this small group of highly placed financiers, controlling the very springs of economic activity, holds more real power than any similar group in the United States.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pecora |first1=Ferdinand |title=Wall Street Under Oath: The Story of Our Modern Money Changers |date=1939 |publisher=A.M> Kelley |isbn=978-0-678-00372-5}}</ref>\n\nThe 1933 [[Pecora Commission]] hearings identified the National City Company, known today as [[Citibank]], as the location where Morgan conducted EBASCo's investment operations, which played a prominent role in the passage of the [[Glass\u2013Steagall legislation]].

The act was used to break up the country's electric industry into regions confined by state boundaries so that state agencies could properly regulate each company. Each year, the SEC reported on the compliance status of the industry.  As of 1949, 210 holding companies affecting 918 of the country's electric companies had come under the SEC's legal jurisdiction and procedures, with 46 holding companies still active.  In its 1949 annual report,<ref name=\"sec report\">{{cite web |title=1949 SEC Annual Report |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/annual_report/1949.pdf |website=SEC.gov |access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref> the SEC documented the history of their order for EBASCo to break up its five major holding companies' combined assets worth $3.5 billion.\n\nIn 1940, congressional investigations of brokerage firms, insurance companies and their relationship to the electric industry exposed that Middle South Utilities, the Southern Group and Ebasco were all financed by Morgan Stanley,<ref name=\"Power Struggle\">{{cite book |last1=Rudolph |first1=Richard |last2=Ridley |first2=Scott |title=Power Struggle: The Hundred-Year War of Electricity |date=1986 |publisher=Harper & Row |isbn=0-06-015584-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/powerstrugglehun00rudo }}</ref> with Wall Street having financial influence over nearly 80% of the country's electric industry.\n\nFollowing the passage of the 1935 Act, Ebasco went into the U.S. court system in an attempt overturn the act but failed (see external links for major court cases). Ebasco was then required to register its holding companies and comply with SEC orders. On August 23, 1941, its holding company known as the National Power & Light Co. was ordered to break up its 27 subsidiaries. On March 22, 1949, the SEC signed off on the final breakup of National that included major holdings in Pennsylvania [[PPL Corporation]], the Carolinas and Alabama (see subsidiary list). \n\nOn August 22, 1942, the SEC ordered the breakup of Ebasco's holding companies known as American Power & Light Corp. that included 35 subsidiaries and the Electric Power & Light Corporation with its 24 subsidiaries. American appealed the ruling but lost before the U.S. Supreme Court on November 25, 1946. As of 1949, all but one of American's subsidiaries were in compliance. Electric Power and its sub-holding company United Gas Corporation finally agreed to its breakup on March 2, 1949. Electric Power was then re-organized as Middle South Utilities Inc. and is known today as [[Entergy]].\n\nIn 1939, proceedings before the SEC were initiated to break up EBASCo's American Gas & Electric Company. On December, 28, 1945, the agency agreed to allow it to retain control of its central region of subsidiaries in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, if it let go of its companies in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In 1946, it attempted to acquire the Continental Gas & Electric Corp. but was denied.  American Gas & Electric Company was finally spun off in 1958 to become [[American Electric Power]] (AEP).\n\nAs part of a national campaign to deregulate the electric industry, the Bush administration and Congress passed the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] that repealed the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n\n===EBASCo holding companies prior to 1935===\n[[File:1922 5-13 Electric World SZ Mitchell.png|thumb|1905-1933 President of EBASCo]]\nThe following EBASCo holding companies, which includes some of its subsidiaries came under enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission with the passage of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935. \n\n====American Gas & Electric Company====\nIncorporated in 1906, and controlled by EBASCo., American Gas & Electric Company was finally spun off in 1958 and became [[American Electric Power]].

With its agenda of enforcing patents, General Electric (GE) had been buying up electric stocks worldwide, but also started taking control of companies via its equipment sales and other services formerly performed by its holding company, the Electric Bond and Share Group.  In 1917, Electric Bond and Share Group's first major foreign electric acquisition, at the request of the U.S. government, to take control of electric production for two cities near the [[Panama Canal]] as a counter strategy against nearby German interests.   In 1920, Electric Bond obtained control of Guatemalan electric facilities that the U.S. government had seized from Germany during the war.   This was followed in 1922 by a dramatic burst of purchasing across central and South America that was followed the next year by the formation of the American & Foreign Power Company.\n\nIn 1925, GE would dispose of its Ebasco stocks because of negative public opinion, however GE's chairman continued to sit on American & Foreign Power's board of directors while its founding president Sydney Z.

Following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898 the country was forced into an exclusive relationship with the United States.  The U. S. allowed Cuba to be independent, but required it to operate under the [[Platt Amendment]] of 1901, turning it into an exclusive U.S. plantation colony with its sugar exports only allowed to be marketed in the U.S.   Business interests deployed a combination of [[Scientific racism]] and [[Scientific management]] practices that left the country exclusively in the hands of American companies.\n\nIt started in 1922 with GE's representative, Henry Catlin purchasing General [[Gerardo Machado]]'s electric company and then donating $500,000 to the general's successful bid to become Cuba's President in 1924<ref name=\"A&FP cuba2\">{{cite book |last1=O'Brien |first1=Thomas |title=The Revolutionary Mission American Enterprise in Latin America, 1900\u20131945 |date=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521663441 |pages=771-774}}</ref>.  GE would spend $100 million to purchase control of Cuba's entire electric infrastructure.
