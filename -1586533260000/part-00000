Mazdaspeed is Mazda's in-house race and street car tuning arm and is highly involved in both amateur and professional motorsports.\n==Current products==\nThis is the current Mazda automobile listing internationally.\n\n===[[Kei car]]===\n* [[Mazda Carol|Carol]] \u2014 [[hatchback]] ([[Rebadging|badge-engineered]] [[Suzuki Alto]])\n* [[Autozam Scrum|Scrum]] \u2014 [[minivan]] and [[van|commercial van]] (badge-engineered [[Suzuki Carry|Suzuki Carry/Every]])\n* [[Mazda Flair|Flair]] \u2014 minivan (badge-engineered [[Suzuki Wagon R]])\n* [[Mazda Flair Wagon|Flair Wagon]] \u2014 minivan (badge-engineered [[Suzuki Spacia]])\n* [[Mazda Flair Crossover|Flair Crossover]] \u2014 [[Crossover (automobile)|Crossover SUV]] (badge-engineered [[Suzuki Hustler]])\n\n===[[Subcompact car|Subcompact]]===\n* [[Mazda Demio|Mazda2/Demio]] \u2014 hatchback and [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n\n===[[Compact car|Compact]]===\n* [[Mazda3|Mazda3/Axela]] \u2014 hatchback and sedan\n\n===[[Mid-size car|Mid-size]]===\n* [[Mazda6|Mazda6/Atenza]] \u2014 sedan and [[Station wagon|wagon]]\n\n===[[Sports car]]===\n* [[Mazda MX-5|MX-5/Roadster]] \u2014 [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]]\n\n===[[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]===\n* [[Mazda CX-3|CX-3]] \u2014 subcompact crossover SUV\n* [[Mazda CX-30|CX-30]] \u2014 compact crossover SUV\n* [[Mazda MX-30|MX-30]] \u2014 compact electric crossover SUV\n* [[Mazda CX-4|CX-4]] \u2014 compact crossover SUV (China)\n* [[Mazda CX-5|CX-5]] \u2014 compact crossover SUV\n* [[Mazda CX-8|CX-8]] \u2014 lengthened compact crossover SUV (Japan, Australia, and Malaysia)\n* [[Mazda CX-9|CX-9]] \u2014 mid-size SUV\n\n===[[Pickup truck]]===\n* [[Mazda BT-50|BT-50]] \u2014 badge-engineered [[Ford Ranger (T6)]]\n\n===[[Commercial vehicle]]===\n* [[Mazda Bongo|Bongo Brawny]] \u2014 badge-engineered [[Toyota HiAce]]\n* [[Mazda Familia Van|Familia Van]] \u2014 badge-engineered [[Toyota Probox]]\n* [[Mazda Titan|Titan]] \u2014 [[truck]] \u2014 badge-engineered [[Isuzu Elf]]\n\n==Discontinued vehicles==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* 1931\u20131960 [[Mazda-Go]] three-wheel truck\n* 1958\u20131964 [[Mazda Romper|Romper/D1100/D1500/D2000]] truck\n* 1959\u20131969 [[Mazda K360|K360]] three-wheel truck\n* 1959\u20131971 [[Mazda T600|T600]] three-wheel truck\n* 1959\u20131971 [[Mazda T series|T1100/T1500/T2000]] three-wheel truck\n* 1960\u20131966 [[Mazda R360|R360]] [[kei car]] [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n* 1961\u20131962 [[Mazda Carol|P360/P600 \"Carol\"]] kei car sedan\n* 1961\u20131966 [[Mazda Porter#B360/B600|B360/B600]] kei car pickup truck\n* 1961\u20132006 [[Mazda B-Series|B series/Proceed/REPU]] [[pickup truck]]\n* 1964\u20132003 [[Mazda Familia|Familia/323/Proteg\u00e9/R100]] [[compact car]]\n* 1965\u20131972 [[Mazda Light Bus| Light Bus Type A/C]] [[minibus]]\n* 1965\u20131977 [[Mazda Kraft|Kraft]] truck\n* 1966\u20131991 [[Mazda Luce|Luce/929/R130/RX-4/RX-9]] [[luxury car]]\n* 1967\u20131996 [[Mazda Cosmo|Cosmo/RX-5]] [[sports car]]\n* 1968\u20131980 [[Mazda Boxer|Boxer]] truck\n* 1968\u20131989 [[Mazda Porter|Porter]] small pickup truck\n* 1970\u20132002 [[Mazda Capella|Capella/626/RX-2/Cronos]] [[mid-size car]]\n* 1971\u20131978 [[Mazda Grand Familia|Grand Familia/808/818/RX-3]] compact car\n* 1972\u20131977 [[Mazda Carol|Chantez]] kei car\n* 1972\u20131997 [[Mazda Parkway|Parkway]] minibus\n* 1975\u20131978 [[Mazda Roadpacer|Roadpacer]] [[full-size car]]\n* 1978\u20132002 [[Mazda RX-7|RX-7/Savanna]] sports car\n* 1987\u20131990 [[Mazda Etude|Etude]] compact car\n* 1988\u20131992 [[Mazda Persona|Persona]] mid-size car\n* 1988\u20132002 [[Mazda 121|121]] compact car\n\n{{col-2}}\n* 1988\u20131997 [[Mazda MX-6|MX-6]] coup\u00e9\n* 1988\u20132016 [[Mazda MPV|MPV/Mazda8]] minivan\n* 1989\u20131995 [[Mazda Custom Cab|Custom Cab]] taxi\n* 1990\u20131998 [[Mazda Sentia|Sentia/929]] luxury car\n* 1990\u20131998 [[Mazda AZ-3|AZ-3]]/[[Mazda MX-3|MX-3]] coup\u00e9\n* 1990\u20131999 [[Mazda B series|Proceed Marvie]] SUV\n* 1991\u20131994 [[Mazda Navajo|Navajo]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]\n* 1993\u20131997 [[Mazda Lantis|Lantis/Astina]] compact car\n* 1993\u20132002 [[Mazda Millenia|Millenia/Xedos9/Eunos 800]] luxury car\n* 1994\u20132005 [[Suzuki Vitara|Proceed Levante]] SUV\n* 1994\u20132012 [[Mazda AZ-Wagon|AZ-Wagon]] kei car\n* 1998\u20132014 [[Mazda AZ-Offroad|AZ-Offroad]] SUV\n* 1999\u20132006 [[Mazda Laputa|Laputa]] kei car\n* 1999\u20132015 [[Mazda Premacy|Premacy/Mazda5]] small minivan\n* 2001\u20132011 [[Mazda Tribute|Tribute]] SUV\n* 2002\u20132008 [[Mazda Spiano|Spiano]] kei car\n* 2003\u20132012 [[Mazda RX-8|RX-8]] sports car\n* 2004\u20132015 [[Mazda Verisa|Verisa]] [[Subcompact car]]\n* 2007\u20132012 [[Mazda CX-7|CX-7]] [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]]\n* 2008\u20132018 [[Mazda Biante|Biante]] minivan\n* 2013\u20132017 [[Suzuki Ertiga#First generation (ZE;

He grounds Bill for a month and sends him home. His book appearance was in ''Horrid Henry Goes to Work'' and he is mentioned in \"Horrid Henry's Arch Enemy\". \n\nIn the TV series, he is referred to as Bob or Bob Sir, and the job he runs is Tingly Toothbrushes. He appeared in the adaptation of ''Horrid Henry Goes to Work'', and has  also appeared in \"Horrid Henry's Heist\" as the school inspector at the fancy dress party (where his character design looks like an older version of his son, Bossy Bill),  ''Horrid Henry's Skipping Lesson'' when he was in the park on his way to an appointment with Bill's headmaster and in ''Horrid Henry Helps Out''.\n\n===Bossy Bill===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Bill\n| series             = Horrid Henry\n| first              = Horrid Henry Goes to Work (Books and TV series)\n| last               =\n| portrayer          = \n| nickname           = Bossy Bill\n| species            = Human\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = Bob (Father)\n| franchise          = \n| image              = \n| alt                = \n| caption            = \n| first_major        = \n| first_minor        = \n| first_issue        = \n| first_date         = \n| last_major         = \n| last_minor         = \n| last_issue         = \n| last_date          = \n| firstgame          = \n| creator            = \n| based_on           = \n| adapted_by         = \n| voice              = [[Murad Ahmed]]\n| full_name          = \n| origin             = \n| home               = \n}}\nBossy Bill is the horrible, stuck-up son of Dad's boss.

When Peter was horrid, he will find excuses for him. A good example was that Peter sprayed Henry with a hose deliberately, even chasing him around the garden, but he ended up telling Henry that he should have got out of the way when Peter was \"watering the flowers\".

Although Henry's Mum and Dad have told her countless times that Henry is a boy and that Peter is six, Greta refuses to believe this, and usually doesn't hear, most likely due to her senility. Her senility is such that she once cooked cat food for the boys and believed that Fluffy is a dog named Fido.

He believes that life is unfair as the rest of the world is against him, so he fights \"against the tyranny of adults\". He is resistant to defeat as teachers, relatives and babysitters in the series try their best to avoid him. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him.\n\nHenry is very selfish, inconsiderate, stubborn, and rarely learns from his mistakes. He can also be bluntly honest, as seen when he tells his mother's boss what she calls her at work behind her back and is unafraid of telling people how much he hates them right to their faces. However, he is willing to act nice and collude with Margaret and even Peter, but only if it means he will get to have his own way. Most likely because of his young age, Henry can get frightened by talk of ghosts or monsters, and in one episode, is revealed to have a [[fear of needles]]. He is very imaginative, as he indulges in fantasies, usually transforming into terrifying creatures and attacking the source of his frustrations, and often has \"Eureka moments\" when the stories mention what he thinks is a \"spectacularly wonderful idea\". In every story, there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire.\n\nWhenever Henry thinks of a plan it is simply to get his own way, never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He is more often than not seen taking life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing, making him something of a complex character as well. It has also been further hinted that deep down, Henry never really means to be horrid, and only acts that way as a wanting to get attention and needing to feel important, especially when dealing with his younger brother Peter, implying he has low self-esteem.\n\n===Helpful Hari===\nShe is invited to Peter's party in ''Perfect Peter's Pirate Party'' and is in Peter's class.\n\n==I==\n\n===Inky Ian===\n\nInky Ian is a pupil who isn't very much in Henry's [[classroom]] who is only seen in the book version ''Horrid Henry and the Football Fiend''.\n\n==J==\n\n===Jazzy Jim===\nJazzy Jim is a minor character in Henry's class who likes music.

She teaches [[Horrid Henry (Character)|Horrid Henry]], and many of his classmates such as [[Rude Ralph]], [[Moody Margaret]] and [[Sour Susan]]. She seems to have a particular disliking towards Henry, which would be because it is usually his horrid behaviour which disrupts her class. She once said that Henry's class was the worst she ever taught. In very few episodes, her mother, Mrs Battle-Axe, has appeared, who appears to discipline her daughter greatly. She wears pointy glasses and has gray hair. She also wears a green cardigan, pale chartreuse top, brown skirt, and brownish stockings.

She is a spoilt brat. She is portrayed as the secondary main antagonist in the series and serves as Horrid Henry's archenemy. She lives next door to Horrid Henry and her best friend is Sour Susan. She has magenta hair in a spiky ponytail.\nHenry and Margaret are enemies; Margaret has a secret club and Henry has the Purple Hand Gang. She has an ability of screaming and always competes with Henry. She might have a crush on Henry, because in ''Perfect Peter's Revenge'', she is happy when Peter sends her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret. This is also seen in other episodes. She wears a violet [[tank top]] with white stripes, green [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] and a bottle-green skirt. Margaret, however, occasionally assists Henry in his plans, as seen in ''Horrid Henry's Horrid Revenge'' and ''Horrid Henry and the Big Dig'', though under the word of being the leader of the Purple Hand Gang for a day or a month or even a whole year you will never know how long it will be maybe a week or even every month/year/day/second/minute. She is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols. In the episode ''Horrid Henry Rockstar'' it is suggested that her full name is Margaret Millicent Maudita Smythe which she also uses in subsequent episodes. However she denies this when Rude Ralph asks her if this is true.\n\nAs the primary antagonist of the series, Moody Margaret is the most prominent arch-enemy of the series' protagonist, [[Horrid Henry]]. When Francesca Simon was in the process of creating this character, she suggested a boy called Moody Martin. However, her husband did not approve of the idea as it would be too much like Horrid Henry the main character. Thus, Martin became a female called Margaret. Margaret is depicted as being a self-absorbed, grumpy, spiteful, and cantankerous girl who shares an intense rivalry with Henry, and their opposing neighborhood clubs continuously develop practical jokes or conspiracies against one another. They have resorted to each other's companionship when left with no other options, but nonetheless detest one another and continuously plot against one another, especially in an attempt to soil each other's reputations. Margaret has a tendency to gloat about her various accomplishments in a ridiculously [[narcissistic]] fashion, looking down on others and domineering her friends and peers. True to this, she is resented by her best friend Sour Susan because of her rudeness, but Susan seems to have no other choice than to reluctantly obey Margaret's constant commands. Margaret viciously domineers the Secret Club in various plots formulated against Henry's corresponding Purple Hang Gang, and the two opposing sides share a mutual animosity. She is used to having her own way and is capable of releasing violent, piercing screeches when her demands remain unfulfilled.\n\n====Live-action====\n\n[[File:Scarlet Stitt Moody Margaret.jpg|150px|thumb|Movie poster for ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'' featuring Scarlet Stitt as Moody Margaret.]]\n* Scarlet Stitt portrays Moody Margaret in the 2011 movie, ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]''. At the beginning of the movie, She, Sour Susan and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Singing Soroya|Singing Soroya]] are in the Secret Club treehouse eating biscuits and arguing. Henry disguises himself as a spy, steals the biscuits and runs away but Margaret has also stolen his mighty magnet yoyo. Later, on his way home from school, Henry dodges a water balloon thrown by Margaret. He ducks behind a lamppost, waits for Margaret to walk past, throws a balloon filled with water that hovers over her head and finally, flicks a yoyo at the balloon which bursts and soaks Margaret. Margaret shrieks and throws another balloon at Henry but he ducks and it hits [[Perfect Peter]] instead.<br>The next day at school, Margaret hangs a pail filled with purple paint over the door, ties one end of a rope to it and the other end to the door's handle. Instead of Henry who gets painted, it is their teacher [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Battle-Axe|Miss Battle-Axe]] who falls for the trick. Battle-Axe blames it on Henry, giving Margaret a lucky escape. The next day, Miss Battle Axe's class is moved to [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Lovely|Miss Lovely]]'s class after the head sacks Miss Battle-Axe for not controlling the pupils. Margaret snatches Henry's bag and Henry tries to pull it back, resulting in a pot of \"Exploding Gross-Glue\" placed by the school inspectors to fly out. The glue bursts and hits Miss Lovely in the face. She too gets sacked and the head, and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Oddbod|Miss Oddbod]] bans Henry from entering the school's talent contest. As the school is going bankrupt, many children transfer to another school. Margaret and Henry both get transferred to a girls' school (Henry's Great-Aunt Greta transferred him there as she thinks he is a girl).<br>The girls in the school attack Henry for being a boy and try to attack Margaret too for being with Henry. The two of them escape and form an alliance to save their school. They do this by making Henry sneak into the talent contest and win it so he would be so famous but the plan fails. They try another plan which involves Henry going onto a game show to win the big cash prize so he can give it to Miss Oddbod so she can give it to the school inspectors to bribe them away as they were the ones trying to get the school closed down under the order of the head of a boys' school called [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]]. However, although Henry wins, the Best Boy's Club, Miss Lovely and Miss Oddbod had got Vic and the inspectors arrested so she lets Henry keep the money. At the very end, Margaret is seen in a fairy costume at Henry's party.\n\n====Animation====\n\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Moody Margaret is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols and is the series' most recurring villain. Margaret is represented just like she is in the books and seen as Henry's rival. However she is shown to be smarter. It has been hinted in some episodes, especially in series 4, that she may in fact admire Henry and wants to be his friend. She has shown a very keen interest in wanting to join The Purple Hand Gang. She might have a crush on Henry, e.g. in \"Perfect Peter's Revenge\", she was happy when Peter send her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret.

He is often referred to as a \"worm\" by Henry. Peter has a very effeminate attitude, liking flowers much like [[Walter the Softy]] in the [[Dennis the Menace (UK comics)|Dennis the Menace]] comic strips and [[Dennis the Menace (1996 TV series)|cartoon series]], believes in fairy tales, and is known to always do as he is told and treat others with respect. On several occasions, however, he has revealed that he is in reality, very whiny and spoiled. It is obvious that Peter likes to get back at Henry with the help of his parents, and he always [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally bribes]] them (e.g.: \"You're the best mum in the world! So Henry won't be getting any biscuits will he?\"), resulting in his parents favouring him. Aside from being spoiled, he shows aspects of being sort of like Moody Margaret, except that instead of using a bossy tone, he adopts a crying and sorrowful look to get what he wants.\n\nOften, Henry gets into trouble as a result of Peter telling Mum or Dad when he has done something wrong, usually with the phrases \"Mum/Dad! Henry's being horrid/mean!\" or \"Mum/Dad! Henry called me a [[worm]]/a toad/told me to shut up!\", and he even blames Henry for the most minor offences. He has been known to blame Henry for things Henry doesn't do. He is also similar to his friends as he hates dirt, is always tidy and always does as he is told, unlike Henry. He also expects praise for even the most minor things, such as \"being normal\", using his fork and knife, and also shows off how good he is, especially when Henry is being reprimanded. This, and the fact that he always asks them politely.\n\nAt times, Peter can be desperate for praise and attention; he gets his toys out just to tidy them again in the episode \"Horrid Henry And The Best Boys Club\". In the same episode, it is hinted he sees the other members of \"The Best Boys Club\" as underlings rather than actual friends as he immediately refuses Gordon's suggestion of taking turns to decide things. This suggests that he only acts perfect because he gets praised. At times, he tries to take credit for Henry's rare good deeds, as shown in ''Horrid Henry's Perfect Day'', and in ''Horrid Henry Horrid Headmaster'', when he recorded what Henry said when Henry discovered he had to fill end of term reports (\"No holiday for me, then.\"), then modified it into \"No holiday!\", causing the students to rebel. He seldom defies orders or complains about said orders, though it has been revealed that his sweet-natured personality is soiled with narcissism; he has indeed defied adults or rules in revenge against Henry or while attempting to frame him, and he derives pleasure from Henry's suffering and punishments for poor behavior, implying that he may actually not be much better than his brother. Despite all this, Henry will still help Peter out on occasion, such as rescuing him from a falling shelf in the cellar in ''Horrid Henry Trapped''.\n\n====Live-action====\n* In 2011's ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'', Perfect Peter is shown as a pure goody-goody and never shows his bad side.

She thinks that Henry is a little girl called Henrietta (or Henny in ''Horrid Henry's Underpants''), and that Peter is a teenager. This is reflected in the presents that she sends to the boys. Although Henry's Mum and Dad have told her countless times that Henry is a boy and that Peter is six, Greta refuses to believe this, and usually doesn't hear, most likely due to her senility. Her senility is such that she once cooked cat food for the boys and believed that Fluffy is a dog named Fido. She also mistook it to be the middle of the night when in fact it was only half past five in the afternoon. She wears a light pink sweater, a gold button studded in her white blouse, dark pink skirt, lavender shoes and a walking stick.\n\n===Greedy Graham===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Graham\n| series             = Horrid Henry\n| portrayer          = Wayne Forester\n| nickname           = Greedy Graham\n| gender             = Male\n}}\nGreedy Graham is a brown-haired obese boy who is always hungry and is often seen eating carrots and junk food in the earlier episodes.

He believes that life is unfair as the rest of the world is against him, so he fights \"against the tyranny of adults\". He is resistant to defeat as teachers, relatives and babysitters in the series try their best to avoid him. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him.\n\nHenry is very selfish, inconsiderate, stubborn, and rarely learns from his mistakes. He can also be bluntly honest, as seen when he tells his mother's boss what she calls her at work behind her back and is unafraid of telling people how much he hates them right to their faces. However, he is willing to act nice and collude with Margaret and even Peter, but only if it means he will get to have his own way. Most likely because of his young age, Henry can get frightened by talk of ghosts or monsters, and in one episode, is revealed to have a [[fear of needles]]. He is very imaginative, as he indulges in fantasies, usually transforming into terrifying creatures and attacking the source of his frustrations, and often has \"Eureka moments\" when the stories mention what he thinks is a \"spectacularly wonderful idea\". In every story, there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire.\n\nWhenever Henry thinks of a plan it is simply to get his own way, never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He is more often than not seen taking life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing, making him something of a complex character as well. It has also been further hinted that deep down, Henry never really means to be horrid, and only acts that way as a wanting to get attention and needing to feel important, especially when dealing with his younger brother Peter, implying he has low self-esteem.\n\n===Helpful Hari===\nShe is invited to Peter's party in ''Perfect Peter's Pirate Party'' and is in Peter's class.\n\n==I==\n\n===Inky Ian===\n\nInky Ian is a pupil who isn't very much in Henry's [[classroom]] who is only seen in the book version ''Horrid Henry and the Football Fiend''.\n\n==J==\n\n===Jazzy Jim===\nJazzy Jim is a minor character in Henry's class who likes music.

She teaches [[Horrid Henry (Character)|Horrid Henry]], and many of his classmates such as [[Rude Ralph]], [[Moody Margaret]] and [[Sour Susan]]. She seems to have a particular disliking towards Henry, which would be because it is usually his horrid behaviour which disrupts her class. She once said that Henry's class was the worst she ever taught. In very few episodes, her mother, Mrs Battle-Axe, has appeared, who appears to discipline her daughter greatly. She wears pointy glasses and has gray hair. She also wears a green cardigan, pale chartreuse top, brown skirt, and brownish stockings.

She is a spoilt brat. She is portrayed as the secondary main antagonist in the series and serves as Horrid Henry's archenemy. She lives next door to Horrid Henry and her best friend is Sour Susan. She has magenta hair in a spiky ponytail.\nHenry and Margaret are enemies; Margaret has a secret club and Henry has the Purple Hand Gang. She has an ability of screaming and always competes with Henry. She might have a crush on Henry, because in ''Perfect Peter's Revenge'', she is happy when Peter sends her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret. This is also seen in other episodes. She wears a violet [[tank top]] with white stripes, green [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] and a bottle-green skirt. Margaret, however, occasionally assists Henry in his plans, as seen in ''Horrid Henry's Horrid Revenge'' and ''Horrid Henry and the Big Dig'', though under the word of being the leader of the Purple Hand Gang for a day or a month or even a whole year you will never know how long it will be maybe a week or even every month/year/day/second/minute. She is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols. In the episode ''Horrid Henry Rockstar'' it is suggested that her full name is Margaret Millicent Maudita Smythe which she also uses in subsequent episodes. However she denies this when Rude Ralph asks her if this is true.\n\nAs the primary antagonist of the series, Moody Margaret is the most prominent arch-enemy of the series' protagonist, [[Horrid Henry]]. When Francesca Simon was in the process of creating this character, she suggested a boy called Moody Martin. However, her husband did not approve of the idea as it would be too much like Horrid Henry the main character. Thus, Martin became a female called Margaret. Margaret is depicted as being a self-absorbed, grumpy, spiteful, and cantankerous girl who shares an intense rivalry with Henry, and their opposing neighborhood clubs continuously develop practical jokes or conspiracies against one another. They have resorted to each other's companionship when left with no other options, but nonetheless detest one another and continuously plot against one another, especially in an attempt to soil each other's reputations. Margaret has a tendency to gloat about her various accomplishments in a ridiculously [[narcissistic]] fashion, looking down on others and domineering her friends and peers. True to this, she is resented by her best friend Sour Susan because of her rudeness, but Susan seems to have no other choice than to reluctantly obey Margaret's constant commands. Margaret viciously domineers the Secret Club in various plots formulated against Henry's corresponding Purple Hang Gang, and the two opposing sides share a mutual animosity. She is used to having her own way and is capable of releasing violent, piercing screeches when her demands remain unfulfilled.\n\n====Live-action====\n\n[[File:Scarlet Stitt Moody Margaret.jpg|150px|thumb|Movie poster for ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'' featuring Scarlet Stitt as Moody Margaret.]]\n* Scarlet Stitt portrays Moody Margaret in the 2011 movie, ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]''. At the beginning of the movie, She, Sour Susan and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Singing Soroya|Singing Soroya]] are in the Secret Club treehouse eating biscuits and arguing. Henry disguises himself as a spy, steals the biscuits and runs away but Margaret has also stolen his mighty magnet yoyo. Later, on his way home from school, Henry dodges a water balloon thrown by Margaret. He ducks behind a lamppost, waits for Margaret to walk past, throws a balloon filled with water that hovers over her head and finally, flicks a yoyo at the balloon which bursts and soaks Margaret. Margaret shrieks and throws another balloon at Henry but he ducks and it hits [[Perfect Peter]] instead.<br>The next day at school, Margaret hangs a pail filled with purple paint over the door, ties one end of a rope to it and the other end to the door's handle. Instead of Henry who gets painted, it is their teacher [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Battle-Axe|Miss Battle-Axe]] who falls for the trick. Battle-Axe blames it on Henry, giving Margaret a lucky escape. The next day, Miss Battle Axe's class is moved to [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Lovely|Miss Lovely]]'s class after the head sacks Miss Battle-Axe for not controlling the pupils. Margaret snatches Henry's bag and Henry tries to pull it back, resulting in a pot of \"Exploding Gross-Glue\" placed by the school inspectors to fly out. The glue bursts and hits Miss Lovely in the face. She too gets sacked and the head, and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Oddbod|Miss Oddbod]] bans Henry from entering the school's talent contest. As the school is going bankrupt, many children transfer to another school. Margaret and Henry both get transferred to a girls' school (Henry's Great-Aunt Greta transferred him there as she thinks he is a girl).<br>The girls in the school attack Henry for being a boy and try to attack Margaret too for being with Henry. The two of them escape and form an alliance to save their school. They do this by making Henry sneak into the talent contest and win it so he would be so famous but the plan fails. They try another plan which involves Henry going onto a game show to win the big cash prize so he can give it to Miss Oddbod so she can give it to the school inspectors to bribe them away as they were the ones trying to get the school closed down under the order of the head of a boys' school called [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]]. However, although Henry wins, the Best Boy's Club, Miss Lovely and Miss Oddbod had got Vic and the inspectors arrested so she lets Henry keep the money. At the very end, Margaret is seen in a fairy costume at Henry's party.\n\n====Animation====\n\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Moody Margaret is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols and is the series' most recurring villain.

He is often referred to as a \"worm\" by Henry. Peter has a very effeminate attitude, liking flowers much like [[Walter the Softy]] in the [[Dennis the Menace (UK comics)|Dennis the Menace]] comic strips and [[Dennis the Menace (1996 TV series)|cartoon series]], believes in fairy tales, and is known to always do as he is told and treat others with respect. On several occasions, however, he has revealed that he is in reality, very whiny and spoiled. It is obvious that Peter likes to get back at Henry with the help of his parents, and he always [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally bribes]] them (e.g.: \"You're the best mum in the world! So Henry won't be getting any biscuits will he?\"), resulting in his parents favouring him. Aside from being spoiled, he shows aspects of being sort of like Moody Margaret, except that instead of using a bossy tone, he adopts a crying and sorrowful look to get what he wants.\n\nOften, Henry gets into trouble as a result of Peter telling Mum or Dad when he has done something wrong, usually with the phrases \"Mum/Dad! Henry's being horrid/mean!\" or \"Mum/Dad! Henry called me a [[worm]]/a toad/told me to shut up!\", and he even blames Henry for the most minor offences. He has been known to blame Henry for things Henry doesn't do. He is also similar to his friends as he hates dirt, is always tidy and always does as he is told, unlike Henry. He also expects praise for even the most minor things, such as \"being normal\", using his fork and knife, and also shows off how good he is, especially when Henry is being reprimanded. This, and the fact that he always asks them politely.\n\nAt times, Peter can be desperate for praise and attention; he gets his toys out just to tidy them again in the episode \"Horrid Henry And The Best Boys Club\". In the same episode, it is hinted he sees the other members of \"The Best Boys Club\" as underlings rather than actual friends as he immediately refuses Gordon's suggestion of taking turns to decide things. This suggests that he only acts perfect because he gets praised. At times, he tries to take credit for Henry's rare good deeds, as shown in ''Horrid Henry's Perfect Day'', and in ''Horrid Henry Horrid Headmaster'', when he recorded what Henry said when Henry discovered he had to fill end of term reports (\"No holiday for me, then.\"), then modified it into \"No holiday!\", causing the students to rebel. He seldom defies orders or complains about said orders, though it has been revealed that his sweet-natured personality is soiled with narcissism; he has indeed defied adults or rules in revenge against Henry or while attempting to frame him, and he derives pleasure from Henry's suffering and punishments for poor behavior, implying that he may actually not be much better than his brother. Despite all this, Henry will still help Peter out on occasion, such as rescuing him from a falling shelf in the cellar in ''Horrid Henry Trapped''.\n\n====Live-action====\n* In 2011's ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'', Perfect Peter is shown as a pure goody-goody and never shows his bad side. He is one of the very few people who help save the school from [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]].\n\n====Animation====\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Perfect Peter is the most recurring character apart from Henry.\n\n===Perky Parveen===\nShe is in Peter's class and is invited to Peter's birthday party.

Some sources misattribute Guij\u00f3n's declarations to \"Allende's personal doctor\", Enrique Paris Roa, who was at La Moneda not in his professional role but as a member of Allende's cabinet. He does not appear to have made any such statement as he was executed shortly afterwards.<ref>Anne-Marie O'Connor, [http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/svolk/lat102200.htm Out of the Ashes], ''Los Angeles Times'' 22 October 2000.

However, Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Quiroga]] only confirmed the details in 1999.<ref name=Gonzalez/><ref name=Pape>Pape, Eric, [http://www.garella.com/rich/eric/exile.htm Five Degrees of Exile], ''[[Los Angeles Times]] Magazine'', 11 July 1999.

The definitive finding of suicide by international experts and the Chilean courts in 2011 seems to have put the controversy to rest. Almost all claims of an ongoing \"controversy\" regarding Allende's death seem to predate the 2011 investigations and the factual record left in its wake.\n\n[[Fidel Castro]], who had given President Allende the AK-47 used as the suicide weapon, provides an example of the speculation and political posturing that grew out of Allende's death and the Pinochet coup d'\u00e9tat. On 28 September 1973 (only two weeks after Allende's death), Castro told a Cuban crowd in [[Havana]]'s ''Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n'' that Allende had died in [[Palacio de La Moneda|La Moneda]] wrapped in a Chilean flag, firing at Pinochet troops with Fidel's rifle. Over the coming decades, the Cuban leader would continue to make public addresses using this version of events.\nCastro's public statements formed the basis of Robinson Rojas' 1975 book ''The murder of Allende and the end of the Chilean way to socialism''. Rojas asserted that the Chilean president had been killed by Pinochet's military forces while defending the palace.<ref>Rojas, Robinson (1985). ''The Murder of Allende and the End of the Chilean Way to Socialism''. Joanna Cotler Books.</ref>\n\nWith the [[Chilean transition to democracy|peaceful transition to democracy]] in Chile in 1990, the view that Allende committed suicide began to gain popular acceptance as different testimonies confirming the details of the suicide have become available in press and in documentary interviews.<ref name=Gonzalez/> Likewise, members of Allende's immediate family including his wife and his daughter, have never disputed that it was a suicide.<ref name=PERIODISTA>{{cite web |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/internacional/not_int239424,0.htm |title='&#39;EUA tentaram impedir posse de Allende, diz documento.'&#39; Washington: Associated Press-Ag\u00eancia Estado, '&#39;in'&#39; '&#39;O Estado de S.

The definitive finding of suicide by international experts and the Chilean courts in 2011 seems to have put the controversy to rest. Almost all claims of an ongoing \"controversy\" regarding Allende's death seem to predate the 2011 investigations and the factual record left in its wake.\n\n[[Fidel Castro]], who had given President Allende the AK-47 used as the suicide weapon, provides an example of the speculation and political posturing that grew out of Allende's death and the Pinochet coup d'\u00e9tat. On 28 September 1973 (only two weeks after Allende's death), Castro told a Cuban crowd in [[Havana]]'s ''Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n'' that Allende had died in [[Palacio de La Moneda|La Moneda]] wrapped in a Chilean flag, firing at Pinochet troops with Fidel's rifle. Over the coming decades, the Cuban leader would continue to make public addresses using this version of events.\nCastro's public statements formed the basis of Robinson Rojas' 1975 book ''The murder of Allende and the end of the Chilean way to socialism''. Rojas asserted that the Chilean president had been killed by Pinochet's military forces while defending the palace.<ref>Rojas, Robinson (1985). ''The Murder of Allende and the End of the Chilean Way to Socialism''.

It has been claimed that in the mid-1930s all [[Germans]] in [[Alta Verapaz]] were [[Nazis]]; {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} however, this claim is unfounded, as it is only anecdotal, and not all of German descent were in effect also Nazi. One writer does note that \"there wasn't a German [[finca]] where the Nazi flag did not occupy a place of honor, nor a German [[finquero]] who did not participate in local events organized by the Nazis.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\"\n\nIn 1938, a seminal event impacted the German community in [[La Verapaz]]; the [[Third Reich]] asking their expatriate citizens to vote on the German annexation of [[Austria]], the [[Anschluss]]. Some Germans in [[Guatemala]] held dual citizenship. A German boat anchored in [[Puerto Barrios]] to facilitate the vote. Those who attended were designated as sympathizers of [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name=\"Deutschland en la Verapaz\" /> In 1936, 381 Germans in Guatemala voted for [[Adolf Hitler]]. Subsequently, most of these were deported, under pressure from the [[United States]], for supporting the [[Nazi Party]].<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"/>\n\nCabinetry-maker Heinrich Gundelach and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] pastor [[Otto Langmann]] were founders of the Party's organization in [[Cob\u00e1n]]. According to the book ''Almas Gemelas'' by Regina Wagner, that same year (1938) the long-since present German School formed a [[Hitler Youth]], practiced the salute, and discussed [[National Socialist]] race theory, disregarding that the German school also had students of [[Jewish]] descent. Thomas M. Leonard notes in ''The General History of Guatemala'' that the [[Buenos Aires]] newspaper ''Cr\u00edtica de Buenos Aires'' reported in 1938 that [[Germany]] was building airfields in [[Guatemala]]. This claim was found to be untrue, but nonetheless garnered [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s alarm, considering Guatemala to be the core of Nazi [[propaganda]] in [[Central America]], as three quarters of the German population of the entire Central American isthmus at the time lived in Guatemala.<ref name=\"Revista D\">''Gemma Gil'' [http://servicios.prensalibre.com/pl/domingo/archivo/revistad/2007/noviembre07/181107/historia.shtml Fascismo en Guatemala] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122071748/http://servicios.prensalibre.com/pl/domingo/archivo/revistad/2007/noviembre07/181107/historia.shtml |date=2015-01-22 }} ''Revista D'' Guatemala, 18/12/2007.

The Turco-Mongols blockaded the harbour and attacked the fortifications with stone-throwing [[siege engines]], while the defenders, numbering only about 200 [[knight]]s, countered with arrows and incendiary projectiles. After two weeks of strong resistance against a far superior adversary, the [[Enceinte|outer wall]] was destroyed by [[Mining (military)|mining]] and breached. Some of the garrison managed to escape by sea, but the inhabitants and the city itself were destroyed.\n\nThe main sources for the siege are the Persian historians [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi]] and [[Mirkhwand]] and the Arab [[Ahmad ibn Arabshah]], who wrote in the service of Timur's successors. For the Knights of Rhodes, the official history of [[Giacomo Bosio]], written early in the seventeenth century, is an important source. From the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (Turkish) perspective, there is [[Ne\u015fri]] and the ''K\u00fcnh\u00fc'l-a\u1e2bb\u0101r'' of [[Mustafa \u00c2l\u00ee]]. For the Byzantines, there are [[Doukas (historian)|Doukas]] and [[Laonikos Chalkokondyles]]; for the Genoese, [[Agostino Giustiniani]].\n\n==Preparations==\nSmyrna had been captured by [[Smyrniote crusades|a crusade in 1344]] and became a Papal city. The Turks continued to control the inland acropolis, however, but the sea-castle allowed the crusaders to control the harbour. From 1374, the Knights of Rhodes were in charge of its defences.{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=8}} In 1400, Timur launched a war against the Ottoman Empire that culminated in his victory at the [[Battle of Ankara]] on 20 July 1402.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|p=41}}\n\nIn the aftermath of Ankara, the outpost of the [[Maona di Chio e di Focea|Genoese ''Maona'']] at [[Yenifo\u00e7a|New Phocaea]] sent a certain Galeazzo as an ambassador to Timur's camp to seek terms. He remained there three days, returning to New Phocaea with an agreement on 22 September.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}} A knight, Brother Dominic de Alamania,{{efn|On 17 February 1402, the grand master appointed Dominic commander for life of Rogera (an unidentified place) and [[Foinikas, Cyprus|Finica]] on Cyprus. These commanderies had an annual revenue totaling 1,000 florins. In exchange, Dominic gave the order 11,200 florins and was permitted thereafter to remit only 500 florins per year from Rogera and Finica.{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}}} was then sent to the island of [[Chios]], also belonging to the Genoese ''Maona'', in order to persuade the local leaders not to ally with Timur.{{sfn|Luttrell|1975|p=308}}{{sfn|Knobler|1995|pp=347\u201348}}\n\nWhile Timur's forces ravaged the Anatolian countryside, targeting Turkish settlements, the Knights of Rhodes prepared the defence of Smyrna. In 1398, under the direction of Brother Guillaume de Munte, a deep ditch had been dug across the promontory to separate the castle from the mainland. In 1402, the garrison of Smyrna numbered 200 knights under the command of the castellan [[\u00cd\u00f1igo de Alfaro]].{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}}{{sfn|Luttrell|1975|p=308}}{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=50}} The garrison's pay was raised to 100 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] per knight per year. To cover the increased costs of defence of Smyrna, the central convent authorised an extraordinary subvention of 20,000 florins from the priories.{{efn|3,200 from Saint-Gilles; 3,000 from France; 2,500 from Amposta; 2,500 from England; 2,000 from Auvergne; 2,000 from Catalonia; 1,500 from Castile and Le\u00f3n; 1,200 from Aquitaine; 1,000 from Germany and Bohemia; 800 from Champagne; and 800 from Toulouse.}}{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}\n\nDefensive preparations in the summer of 1402 were overseen by Admiral Buffilo Panizzatti,{{efn|Sometimes spelled Panizati or Panizato. He was the prior of [[Barletta]] from 4 March 1395. He was promoted to admiral prior to 5 June 1402, when the grand master authorised a payment of 740 gold [[ducat]]s from the revenues of the commandery of Cyprus to Buffilo for his two trips to Smyrna, one for training the garrison and another for constructing a \"[[palisade]]\".{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}}} with a view to strengthening the system of defence before the expected Turco-Mongol assault. Munitions, supplies, money and reinforcements were continually arriving in the port. The attitude of the garrison was confident.

He then ordered the left army under his grandson [[Muhammad Sultan Mirza]] and the right army under his son [[Miran Shah]] to join him. The central army began to bombard the fortifications across the isthmus with stone-throwers immediately, and set to work on undermining the walls.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}} At some point, the ditch was infilled.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=190}} Large covered platforms with huge wooden wheels were rolled up to the outer wall. Each could house 200 men. Equipped with ladders, they attempted, apparently without success, to scale the wall. The total besieging force numbered about 4,000 men.{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}\n\nAccording to the Timurid historians, Timur ordered Malik Shah to construct a large wooden platform on piles to block the entrance to the harbour, which took three days. Doukas, on the contrary, says that the harbour was filled with stones to block ships.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}} Within a few days, the left and right armies had arrived and a general bombardment was ordered. There is no reference to gunpowder, but [[naphtha]] and [[Greek fire]] were employed by the defenders. According to Sharaf ad-Din:\n<blockquote>\n[Siege] machines and battering rams broke up the walls and towers, the intrepid besieged never stopped throwing wheeled arrows [sic], pots of naphtha, Greek fire, rocket arrows and stones, without giving way. During this time, it rained so extraordinarily that it seemed that the world was to be destroyed and drowned in a second deluge.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|p=89: ''Les machines et les b\u00e9liers mirent en pi\u00e8ces les murs et les tours, les assi\u00e9g\u00e9s intr\u00e9pides ne cessaient de jeter des fl\u00e8ches en roue, des marmites de naphte, du feu gr\u00e9geois, des fl\u00e8ches en fus\u00e9e, et des pierres, sans se donner de rel\u00e2che. Pendant ce temps il pleuvait si extraordinairement qu'il semblait que l'univers se dut ab\u00eemer et noyer par un second d\u00e9luge''}}\n</blockquote>\nThe outer walls were breached after only two days of mining, when Timur ordered the [[fascine]]s supporting the tunnels lit. The result was an explosion that destroyed the wall and buried the defenders in rubble. Timur's forces then entered the city. After some desultory fighting, the Knights fled to their ships, while the Christian inhabitants were massacred. Some ships that were approaching the city with aid turned back in the face of the siege engines, either because of the danger of stone projectiles or because the heads of the massacred were launched at them. The city itself, or that part of it under crusader control, was completely destroyed.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}}{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=190}}{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=50}}{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}} The siege had lasted nearly fifteen days.

Following the lead of New Phocaea, it surrendered without a fight. [[Francesco II Gattilusio]], the lord of the island of [[Lesbos]], also surrendered to Muhammad Sultan and offered to pay tribute. The Genoese authorities on the island of Chios and the Ottoman prince [[\u0130sa \u00c7elebi]] both sent envoys to Timur at [[Ayasoluk]] offering to do homage. As a result of these surrenders, Timur gained control of two Aegean islands even though he had no navy.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}}{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=50}}\n\nThe siege of Smyrna was not widely reported in western Europe,{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}} but it did raise awareness of Timur's military power.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|p=92}} News of the loss of Smyrna had reached King [[Martin of Aragon]], via Byzantine channels, by 28 February 1403, for on that day he wrote a letter deeply critical of Timur to [[Henry III of Castile]]. In March, he mooted the idea of an anti-Timurid crusade to Pope [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]]. In general, however, the European attitude to Timur was more positive, since he had defeated the Ottomans who had been menacing the Byzantine Empire (and Smyrna) for decades.{{sfn|Knobler|1995|p=346}}{{sfn|Jackson|2014|p=240}}\n\nAccording to [[Andrea Redusio de Quero]] in his ''Chronicon Tarvisinum'', Timur took great pride in the conquest of Smyrna, since it had resisted so many Ottoman attempts before.{{sfn|Jackson|2014|p=245}}\n\nWith Smyrna lost and the Ottoman state in shambles, Philibert de Naillac took the opportunity to occupy the site of ancient [[Halicarnassus]] further south on the Anatolian coast sometime between 1402 and 1408. There he constructed the [[Bodrum Castle|Castle of Saint Peter]] (Petrounion, corrupted in Turkish as ''[[Bodrum]]'', meaning \"dungeon\").

The Turco-Mongols blockaded the harbour and attacked the fortifications with stone-throwing [[siege engines]], while the defenders, numbering only about 200 [[knight]]s, countered with arrows and incendiary projectiles. After two weeks of strong resistance against a far superior adversary, the [[Enceinte|outer wall]] was destroyed by [[Mining (military)|mining]] and breached. Some of the garrison managed to escape by sea, but the inhabitants and the city itself were destroyed.\n\nThe main sources for the siege are the Persian historians [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi]] and [[Mirkhwand]] and the Arab [[Ahmad ibn Arabshah]], who wrote in the service of Timur's successors. For the Knights of Rhodes, the official history of [[Giacomo Bosio]], written early in the seventeenth century, is an important source. From the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (Turkish) perspective, there is [[Ne\u015fri]] and the ''K\u00fcnh\u00fc'l-a\u1e2bb\u0101r'' of [[Mustafa \u00c2l\u00ee]]. For the Byzantines, there are [[Doukas (historian)|Doukas]] and [[Laonikos Chalkokondyles]]; for the Genoese, [[Agostino Giustiniani]].\n\n==Preparations==\nSmyrna had been captured by [[Smyrniote crusades|a crusade in 1344]] and became a Papal city. The Turks continued to control the inland acropolis, however, but the sea-castle allowed the crusaders to control the harbour. From 1374, the Knights of Rhodes were in charge of its defences.{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=8}} In 1400, Timur launched a war against the Ottoman Empire that culminated in his victory at the [[Battle of Ankara]] on 20 July 1402.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|p=41}}\n\nIn the aftermath of Ankara, the outpost of the [[Maona di Chio e di Focea|Genoese ''Maona'']] at [[Yenifo\u00e7a|New Phocaea]] sent a certain Galeazzo as an ambassador to Timur's camp to seek terms. He remained there three days, returning to New Phocaea with an agreement on 22 September.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}} A knight, Brother Dominic de Alamania,{{efn|On 17 February 1402, the grand master appointed Dominic commander for life of Rogera (an unidentified place) and [[Foinikas, Cyprus|Finica]] on Cyprus. These commanderies had an annual revenue totaling 1,000 florins. In exchange, Dominic gave the order 11,200 florins and was permitted thereafter to remit only 500 florins per year from Rogera and Finica.{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}}} was then sent to the island of [[Chios]], also belonging to the Genoese ''Maona'', in order to persuade the local leaders not to ally with Timur.{{sfn|Luttrell|1975|p=308}}{{sfn|Knobler|1995|pp=347\u201348}}\n\nWhile Timur's forces ravaged the Anatolian countryside, targeting Turkish settlements, the Knights of Rhodes prepared the defence of Smyrna. In 1398, under the direction of Brother Guillaume de Munte, a deep ditch had been dug across the promontory to separate the castle from the mainland. In 1402, the garrison of Smyrna numbered 200 knights under the command of the castellan [[\u00cd\u00f1igo de Alfaro]].{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}}{{sfn|Luttrell|1975|p=308}}{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=50}} The garrison's pay was raised to 100 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] per knight per year. To cover the increased costs of defence of Smyrna, the central convent authorised an extraordinary subvention of 20,000 florins from the priories.{{efn|3,200 from Saint-Gilles; 3,000 from France; 2,500 from Amposta; 2,500 from England; 2,000 from Auvergne; 2,000 from Catalonia; 1,500 from Castile and Le\u00f3n; 1,200 from Aquitaine; 1,000 from Germany and Bohemia; 800 from Champagne; and 800 from Toulouse.}}{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}\n\nDefensive preparations in the summer of 1402 were overseen by Admiral Buffilo Panizzatti,{{efn|Sometimes spelled Panizati or Panizato. He was the prior of [[Barletta]] from 4 March 1395. He was promoted to admiral prior to 5 June 1402, when the grand master authorised a payment of 740 gold [[ducat]]s from the revenues of the commandery of Cyprus to Buffilo for his two trips to Smyrna, one for training the garrison and another for constructing a \"[[palisade]]\".{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}}} with a view to strengthening the system of defence before the expected Turco-Mongol assault. Munitions, supplies, money and reinforcements were continually arriving in the port. The attitude of the garrison was confident. According to Timurid historians, the fortress was thought to be impregnable.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}}{{sfn|Luttrell|1975|p=308}}{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=50}} The [[Greek Orthodox|Greek Christian]] inhabitants of the countryside fled to the city for refuge.{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}\n\nIn order to avoid the costs of a siege, Timur sent two envoys, the ''[[mirza]]'' [[Pir Muhammad ibn Jahangir|Pir Muhammad]] and Sheikh Nur ed-Din, to the Knights commanding them to either convert to Islam or render him tribute (''[[jizya]]'').{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}} The command was refused, although Buonaccurso Grimani, an ambassador from [[Kingdom of Candia|Crete]] to Grand Master [[Philibert de Naillac]] on Rhodes, records that the grand master sent an embassy to Timur.{{sfn|Knobler|1995|pp=347\u201348}}\nAccording to the contemporary papal notary [[Dietrich of Nieheim]], Smyrna would have been spared had \u00cd\u00f1igo raised Timur's banner on the walls as he had been advised by a certain \"Christian bishop\", whom Dietrich does not name but who may have been [[Francis (bishop of Nakhchivan)|Francis]], [[bishop of Nakhchivan]].{{sfn|Jackson|2014|p=244}}\n\n==Siege==\n{{Timur's conquests}}\nTimur himself, at the head of his central army, arrived before Smyrna on 2 December 1402 ([[Islamic calendar|6 Jumada al-Awwal 805]]). He then ordered the left army under his grandson [[Muhammad Sultan Mirza]] and the right army under his son [[Miran Shah]] to join him. The central army began to bombard the fortifications across the isthmus with stone-throwers immediately, and set to work on undermining the walls.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}} At some point, the ditch was infilled.{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=190}} Large covered platforms with huge wooden wheels were rolled up to the outer wall. Each could house 200 men. Equipped with ladders, they attempted, apparently without success, to scale the wall. The total besieging force numbered about 4,000 men.{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}}\n\nAccording to the Timurid historians, Timur ordered Malik Shah to construct a large wooden platform on piles to block the entrance to the harbour, which took three days. Doukas, on the contrary, says that the harbour was filled with stones to block ships.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}} Within a few days, the left and right armies had arrived and a general bombardment was ordered. There is no reference to gunpowder, but [[naphtha]] and [[Greek fire]] were employed by the defenders. According to Sharaf ad-Din:\n<blockquote>\n[Siege] machines and battering rams broke up the walls and towers, the intrepid besieged never stopped throwing wheeled arrows [sic], pots of naphtha, Greek fire, rocket arrows and stones, without giving way. During this time, it rained so extraordinarily that it seemed that the world was to be destroyed and drowned in a second deluge.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|p=89: ''Les machines et les b\u00e9liers mirent en pi\u00e8ces les murs et les tours, les assi\u00e9g\u00e9s intr\u00e9pides ne cessaient de jeter des fl\u00e8ches en roue, des marmites de naphte, du feu gr\u00e9geois, des fl\u00e8ches en fus\u00e9e, et des pierres, sans se donner de rel\u00e2che. Pendant ce temps il pleuvait si extraordinairement qu'il semblait que l'univers se dut ab\u00eemer et noyer par un second d\u00e9luge''}}\n</blockquote>\nThe outer walls were breached after only two days of mining, when Timur ordered the [[fascine]]s supporting the tunnels lit. The result was an explosion that destroyed the wall and buried the defenders in rubble. Timur's forces then entered the city. After some desultory fighting, the Knights fled to their ships, while the Christian inhabitants were massacred. Some ships that were approaching the city with aid turned back in the face of the siege engines, either because of the danger of stone projectiles or because the heads of the massacred were launched at them. The city itself, or that part of it under crusader control, was completely destroyed.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}}{{sfn|Purton|2010|p=190}}{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=50}}{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}} The siege had lasted nearly fifteen days.

Following the lead of New Phocaea, it surrendered without a fight. [[Francesco II Gattilusio]], the lord of the island of [[Lesbos]], also surrendered to Muhammad Sultan and offered to pay tribute. The Genoese authorities on the island of Chios and the Ottoman prince [[\u0130sa \u00c7elebi]] both sent envoys to Timur at [[Ayasoluk]] offering to do homage. As a result of these surrenders, Timur gained control of two Aegean islands even though he had no navy.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|pp=88\u201390}}{{sfn|Nicolle|2007|p=50}}\n\nThe siege of Smyrna was not widely reported in western Europe,{{sfn|Delaville Le Roulx|1913|pp=284\u201386}} but it did raise awareness of Timur's military power.{{sfn|Alexandrescu-Dersca Bulgaru|1977|p=92}} News of the loss of Smyrna had reached King [[Martin of Aragon]], via Byzantine channels, by 28 February 1403, for on that day he wrote a letter deeply critical of Timur to [[Henry III of Castile]]. In March, he mooted the idea of an anti-Timurid crusade to Pope [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]]. In general, however, the European attitude to Timur was more positive, since he had defeated the Ottomans who had been menacing the Byzantine Empire (and Smyrna) for decades.{{sfn|Knobler|1995|p=346}}{{sfn|Jackson|2014|p=240}}\n\nAccording to [[Andrea Redusio de Quero]] in his ''Chronicon Tarvisinum'', Timur took great pride in the conquest of Smyrna, since it had resisted so many Ottoman attempts before.{{sfn|Jackson|2014|p=245}}\n\nWith Smyrna lost and the Ottoman state in shambles, Philibert de Naillac took the opportunity to occupy the site of ancient [[Halicarnassus]] further south on the Anatolian coast sometime between 1402 and 1408. There he constructed the [[Bodrum Castle|Castle of Saint Peter]] (Petrounion, corrupted in Turkish as ''[[Bodrum]]'', meaning \"dungeon\").
