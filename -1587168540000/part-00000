After lunch, Ramsay revealed himself and announced the grand prize for that season. After half of the chefs (the rookies) explain their credentials, the other half reveal themselves to actually be returning chefs from previous seasons, much to the rookies' shock. Ramsay then revealed that for the first time, he would be pitting rookies against veterans (rather than men against women), with the rookies cooking in the red kitchen under Sous Chef Christina, and the veterans cooking in the blue kitchen under Sous Chef Jocky.\n\n'''Team challenge/signature dish''': For this year, the veterans had to recreate the rookies' signature dishes. The rookies not only received the ingredients they wanted for their dishes, but also got to pick which veteran they wanted to cook against. Both teams had 45 minutes to cook their dishes, to be rated on a scale from 1-5. T and Motto each scored three points on shrimp and grits. Kevin received a perfect five on fish stew, but Kanae scored only three after Ramsay compared her side of plantains to a camel's turd. Roe scored three points over Scott's two on black bass, while Chris and Bret each received four points on mango glazed duck breast. Ariel and Jose both scored four points on scallops with parsnip, and both Scotley and Trev scored three points on snapper. Mia scored a perfect five on her grilled pork, but Jen scored only two because her pork was badly overcooked. Finally, both Gizzy and Heather scored perfect 5's on scallops and cucumber gazpacho, and the challenge ended tied at 29 points, only the second such occurrence in the signature dish challenge, after season 8. This was also the first time under the new scoring format that nobody's signature dish received a 1. For the tie-breaker, Ramsay called up Mia and Kevin to bring their dishes up again, and after a second look, he gave Mia's dish the edge, and the rookies won their first challenge.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The rookies celebrate their first challenge win with dinner at Charcoal in Venice Beach with Ramsay and Chef [[Josiah Citrin]]. The veterans prep for opening night by deshelling the sunflower seeds and detailing the mushrooms. Jen earned her teammates' ire for costing them the challenge, pureeing mushrooms for duxelle without cleaning them, and giving attitude to Sous Chef Jocky. She and Bret started to get on each other's nerves over their conflicting personalities, but started to warm up to him when he revealed his tattoos in memory of his deceased parents.\n\n'''Challenge \u2013 Part 1''': The teams were greeted to a Scottish funeral being held in the dining room. As Ramsay was about to reveal someone near and dear they were saying goodbye to, the episode ends on a cliffhanger.\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 268\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = A Fond Farewell\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|10|5}}\n| Viewers         = 2.66<ref name=\"18.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-5-2018/|title='The Cool Kids,' 'MacGyver,' everything else unchanged: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|website=TV by the Numbers|date=October 8, 2018|accessdate=October 8, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = \n'''Challenge \u2013 Part 2''': Continuing from the previous episode Ramsay revealed that the lobster risotto from the menu, which has been a staple dish since the beginning of the series, was going to be retired. Instead, each chef would have an opportunity to prepare their own risotto dish to be added to the menu for the entire season, with the winner also receiving a Punishment Pass, a one time advantage that allows the bearer to skip out on a punishment and join the winning team on their reward. The chefs had 45 minutes to cook their risottos, and Ramsay had each Sous Chef taste the dishes on their team and pick the top four. The rookies were represented by Chris, Gizzy, Mia, and Scott, while the veterans were represented by T, Roe, Ariel, and Bret. In the end, Bret's tomato risotto with grilled shrimp and asparagus beat out Mia's basil and split pea risotto with pancetta, and he won the challenge, although his emotional celebration annoyed the rookies.\n\n'''Before service''': Before service began, the Sous Chefs called both teams down to discuss the new menu items, but had to lecture the rookies for arriving late and separated. While prepping for service, Jocky became irritated with Trev for improperly scoring the Wellingtons, while Christina advised the rookies to use the veterans' arrogance to their advantage.\n\n'''Service''': [[Don McLean]], [[Annie Wersching]], [[Kyle Schmid]], and [[Courtney Sixx]] were seen at opening night, and a shrimp and pasta appetizer was served tableside by Roe and Scotley. The veterans were slowed by T serving a risotto that had more cheese than tomato and Trev serving mushy scallops in a small frying pan, but both recovered. On entrees, Bret accidentally sliced his lamb before bringing it to the pass, and Jen was late to serve the sauce for a pork chop. Despite those problems, the veterans finished service on a high note. In the red kitchen, Scott only fired one serving of shrimp for two risottos on order, and was caught cooking more shrimp for the tableside station despite it being Scotley's responsibility. The problems continued on entrees as Jose served raw halibut, Chris was caught writing down cooking times instead of helping Mia out on meat, and a communication breakdown occurred when nobody could recite an order correctly. After Mia served raw lamb, Ramsay finally had seen enough of the rookies' fragmented performance and threw them out of the kitchen, asking them to name two people for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': The rookies agreed to nominate Scott and Chris as they were the ones who were the most lost that night, but Ramsay called down Jose as well. During their pleas, Chris revealed that nine months prior to the competition, he had suffered a major accident that destroyed 90% of his face and also affected his memory. Ramsay was sympathetic, but made it clear that Chris needed to fight back. In the end, Chris and Jose were sent back in line and Scott was eliminated for being confused all night and failing to uphold his impressive resume. \n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \u201cScott remembers working with some of the biggest named chefs in the world. But whether they would remember him is another matter entirely. I know I won't remember him by tomorrow.\u201d\n\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 269\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Hell's Riders\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|10|12}}\n| Viewers         = 2.67<ref name=\"18.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-12-2018/|title='Speechless' and 'Dateline' adjust down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|website=TV by the Numbers|date=October 15, 2018|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = '''Team Challenge''': The chefs were tasked with cooking lunch for the Marine Corps. The menu included entrees that represented the air, land, and sea: chicken parmesan with angel hair pasta, New York strip and frittes, and fish and chips. For the rookies, Scotley constantly micromanaged Mia on the fish station, and his misdirection eventually caused a paper towel to catch fire. Gizzy was lectured for waiting for water to boil before putting in pasta. The veterans' service was bumpier, as Jen overdressed salad, leading Heather, who was supposed to be on French fries, to jump on the station much to Jen's annoyance. Kevin rushed Heather on fries after she forgot to delegate her station, causing an order to be sent back from the blue dining room for being undercooked. Ramsay berated the veterans for not communicating and giving up after Roe served soggy fish, but they rallied behind Kevin's leadership. Both teams reached their last ticket at the same time, but Ariel sent cold steak, allowing the rookies time to complete their ticket and win their second challenge in a row.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The rookies were rewarded with a trip to Paramount Ranch, where they would star in their own Western movie called \"Hell's Riders\", alongside Marino. Ramsay offered Bret the chance to join them using his punishment pass from the risotto challenge, and Bret accepted, irritating his teammates, who were tasked with preparing calamari for a tableside appetizer. Jen walked out of prep and broke down in tears after getting in an argument with Heather and Ariel over how to prepare beurre blanc sauce (ironically, they thought Jen's from the last prep session was better). Before service began, Ramsay and the sous chefs showed everyone the Hell's Riders trailer.\n\n'''Service''': [[Aly Michalka]] was in attendance despite not being mentioned in this service. Mia and Ariel served grilled calamari tableside. Both teams had relatively little trouble with appetizers, except for Motto cooking a risotto off the stove and making it too crunchy, and Trev taking too long to assemble cold appetizers, with Ramsay chiding him for taking a sip of water before serving the appetizers. On entrees, Jen served bland mashed potatoes for the first table, argued about it with Heather and Sous Chef Jocky when they tasted for her, and when Ramsay came in to check on the team, snidely asked what he was about to yell at her for. Scotley provided inconsistent times on his beef wellingtons, which caused Gizzy to overcook halibut, and Ramsay replaced her on the fish station with Jose. Mia entered the kitchen after finishing the tableside orders, helping Kanae catch up on garnish and Jose repeat an order from Sous Chef Christina. \n\n'''Automatic elimination''': Jen stalled the blue team with her garnishes and T called her out for not communicating times clearly. Ramsay and Jocky sent back her leeks, informing her that there was only enough for one of the two ducks on order. When Jen protested that she did send up enough leeks, Ramsay pulled the pan out from the dish tray and showed the entire team, but Jen accused Ramsay of throwing the pan of leeks under the hot pass to sabotage her. Ramsay dropped the pan on the floor in a fit of rage and escorted the veterans to the pantry room. All the while, Jen continued to shout that she would not be disrespected, until Ramsay was left with no choice but to order Jen to remove her jacket and leave through the front door. This marked the 9th time a contestant was eliminated during service. Afterwards, the veterans got their entrees out more quickly and neither kitchen made another error. \n\nAfter service, Ramsay announced to both teams that he sent Jen home for attacking his reputation. Then for the second time in two seasons, both teams were declared winners after an automatic disqualification, in lieu of the nomination process. Unlike most chefs who get eliminated during service, Jen still got her coat hung and picture burned at the end of the episode.\n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \u201cJen accused me of sabotaging her. The truth of the matter is the only thing that sabotaged Jen tonight was her cooking.\u201d\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 270\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Hell Freezes Over\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|10|19}}\n| Viewers         = 2.54<ref name=\"18.04\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-19-2018/|title='Last Man Standing' adjusts up: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|website=TV by the Numbers|date=October 22, 2018|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Everyone expressed shock over Jen's disrespectful attitude that led to her early departure. Chris, Jose, and Scotley relax in the hot tub while taking turns hitting on Mia, with Trev reassuring her that the two of them would get black jackets but not the other three. \n\n'''Team Challenge''': The sous chefs handed winter jackets to all the contestants. When they went outside, Ramsay had set up an artificial snow slope. He tasked each team to take four runs down the slope in sleds. The blue team finished first, and they were given a 10-second headstart to grab ingredients for the winter soup challenge, where each contestant had 45 minutes to prepare a soup. Ramsay brought in [[Traci Des Jardins]] and [[Brian Boitano]] as guest judges, and each judge would rate each soup from 1-3 stars. The veterans got off to a strong start as Trev scored 6 stars, Heather scored 8, Ariel scored 7, T scored 8, and Kevin scored 6. But Roe and Bret scored the minimum 3 stars due to insufficient seasoning and canned tomatoes, respectively. (Ironically, Bret saw a fellow competitor make the same mistake on the signature dish back in season 14) This left the veterans with a score of 41. For the rookies, Mia scored the maximum 9 stars, Motto scored 6, Gizzy scored a perfect 9, Chris scored the minimum 3, Jose scored 7, and Scotley scored 8 for a total of 42, automatically giving the rookies the win before Kanae's soup was tasted. Kanae managed to score a perfect 9 as well to make the final score 51-41, and it was the rookies' third challenge win in a row.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The rookies were rewarded with a day and night of pampering at L'Horizon Resort in Palm Springs and dinner at Sopa, while the veterans had to shovel out the snow and prepare both kitchens for service. Bret took his poor performance very personally, drawing his teammates' ire. Trev struggled to poach eggs during prep, earning Sous-Chef Jocky's criticism once again.\n\n'''Service''': [[Hayley Orrantia]] was in attendance. In addition, each team received VIP guests at their respective chef's table. The blue team had [[Cheryl Hines]] and [[Rachael Harris]], and the red team had [[Morgan Spurlock]]. Gizzy and Bret served tableside clam chowder, but both struggled. The former was criticized for entering the kitchen while attempting to help Mia on flatbreads, while the latter worked slowly, socialized with the customers, and held up his team. Scotley and Mia argued on appetizers, prompting Sous-Chef Christina to intervene. On entrees, Chris forgot about a pork chop for Spurlock's table that Ramsay had put into the oven before service opened, and Ramsay found it burned completely black. Kevin served cold New York strip, while Motto overcooked steak but recovered. On the next ticket, Kevin overcooked and undercooked lamb chops while rejecting Trev's assistance, leading Ramsay to march the entire blue team into the pantry. When Kevin served the lamb raw again, Ramsay stepped in to cook it himself. Even though nobody was ejected, Ramsay declared both teams losers due to their careless errors and regression from the previous week. \n\n'''Team Change''': The blue team nominated Kevin and Trev, while the red team nominated Chris and Gizzy. After questioning the nominees, Ramsay first asked Kevin and Gizzy for their jackets, only to ask Kevin to go the red team and Gizzy to the blue team. Then he asked for Trev's jacket, only to send him to the red team as well. It seemed as though Chris would be eliminated, but Ramsay merely sent him back in line and warned him it was his last chance. Finally, Ramsay sent Mia and Kanae to the blue team and Bret to the red team, effectively ending the Rookies vs. Veterans experiment in favor of the traditional battle of the sexes, only in opposite color jackets, as the men are now the red team and the women are the blue team. This is the most people in the show's history to switch teams in a single season with six. Notably, Trev was also temporarily transferred to the red team during his first Hell's Kitchen appearance. \n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \"Rookies, veterans... the only title I really care about is Executive Chef. It's time to see who will lead and who will fall.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 271\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Fish Out of Water\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|11|2}}\n| Viewers         = 2.50<ref name=\"18.05\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-nov-2-2018/|title='Last Man Standing' adjusts up, 'Dynasty' adjusts down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 5, 2018|accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Jose and Kevin reflect on the impact their kids have had on their lives.\n\n'''Team Challenge''': Ramsay greeted the chefs with a performance from composer [[Stephan Moccio]], in order to illustrate the importance of working in several different styles. He then asked Marino and the sous chefs to drop a giant fish from the ceiling, in order to introduce today's challenge: the seven chefs on each team would cook halibut in a different manner. Ramsay brought in David Lefevre as a guest judge. Gizzy beat Bret on grilled, despite her concerns that her fish was overcooked. Mia beat Chris on steamed, but Kevin put the men on the board by beating Roe on poached. Kanae beat Scotley on smoked, while Ariel and Jose each scored on shallow-fried. Motto beat Heather on pan-seared to keep the men's hopes alive, but T beat Trev on oven-baked, to give the women their first challenge win of the season by the score of 5-3. \n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women went on a virtual reality adventure and received Vitamix blenders, while the men had to compost food waste in manure, during which it started raining. Motto was the only one not to complain about the work, as he grew up on a farm and was used to it.\n \n'''Service''': Guests in attendance for this service include [[Stephanie Beatriz]], [[Carly Hughes]] and [[Sarah Shahi]]. Chris and Heather served tableside mussels, but the former was scolded for loitering in the dining room waiting for table side orders instead of helping in the kitchen. However, none of Chris's teammates wanted his help until Kevin let him take over on fish. Nonetheless, Chris still managed to send raw scallops. In the blue kitchen, Ariel brought up two orders of scallops not knowing that T had overcooked one of them. However, T managed to quickly recover and serve acceptable scallops. On entrees, Mia was caught checking wellingtons by slicing them in the middle instead of at the ends, prompting Ramsay to warn her teammates to communicate with her. In addition, Gizzy's concerns over undercooking her lamb chops caused T to momentarily take over, but Ramsay confirmed they were perfect, and proceeded to lecture T over not letting Gizzy drive her section. Other than that, the women finished service with no further issues. The men had a much bumpier service. Bret served perfect wellingtons, but Scotley failed to communicate with him on garnish, and proceeded to misinform Kevin to cook one salmon when two were on order. This led Kevin to drench the salmon in butter in an attempt to get it up on time. When it came up raw, Ramsay proceeded to take over the ticket and sent the men into the pantry to regroup, where Scotley irked Kevin by stating that he couldn't keep an eye on the pass anymore. After Bret served cold sauce for a Wellington, a frustrated Ramsay threw the men out while the women finished their last ticket. After service, Ramsay pulled Gizzy aside and advised her to find her voice.\n\n'''Elimination''': The men nominated Scotley and Kevin, although Motto pushed for Bret to go up for getting the team kicked out. After a tough decision, Kevin was eliminated for being nominated twice in a row and not showing the same passion and desire as he did back in Season 6. Before Kevin left, Ramsay gave him encouragement and told him that he was already a successful and talented chef outside Hell's Kitchen. \n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \"Kevin was a standout in his first time in Hell's Kitchen. Unfortunately, this time around, he seemed more determined to head back to the ski slopes than to the Las Vegas Strip.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 272\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = Hot Potato\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|11|9}}\n| Viewers         = 2.82<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-nov-9-2018/|title='Last Man Standing, 'MacGyver,' everything else unchanged: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = \n'''Team Challenge''': For their next challenge, both teams had to make a dish using potato as the main ingredient, and had to collect plastic body parts from Mr. Potato Head to collect their ingredients. Former ''[[Top Chef]]'' contestant [[Richard Blais]] was invited as a guest judge. Because the blue team had an extra dish, Kanae's dish was chosen to sit out due to clunky presentation. The men did well with both Chris and Bret scoring perfect tens, while Trev and Scotley scored six and eight respectively; however, Jose only scored four while Motto scored the minimum two. For the women, Mia once again had a perfect score of ten, while Ariel and Roe both scored near perfect nines, and Heather scored six, but T and Gizzy only scored three. The score was tied at 40 apiece, but Ramsay and Blais deemed Chris' lobster shepherd's pie as the best dish overall, and the men won the challenge. Afterwards, Ramsay and Blais tasted Kanae's dish and told the women it would have received eight points had it been used.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The men visited Animal Tracks and ate lunch at a gourmet food truck, while the women had to prep 100 pounds of potatoes for Steak Night. Kanae got frustrated with T, as it was the latter who not only underperformed but also pushed the hardest to drop the former's dish.\n\n'''Chris's Exit''': Returning from the reward, Chris starts to feel anxious, questioning his credibility in the competition, before confiding in Sous Chef Christina of his wish to leave the competition, as he had not fully recovered from his accident nine months ago and was experiencing emotional turmoil. After Christina informed Ramsay, although he was upset by Chris's decision, he allowed him to leave to seek help, as the latter's mental health was more important.  This made Chris the tenth person to withdraw from the competition, and the first to do so since his teammate, Bret, in season 14. Ramsay did not issue a statement on Chris's departure, but his hung jacket and already burnt picture could be seen next to T and Scotley's when they were later eliminated.\n\n'''Service''': Sitting at the chef's tables were [[Kelsea Ballerini]] for the red team and [[Cornelius Smith Jr.]] for the blue team. Also attending the service was [[Titus Welliver]]. Despite being shorthanded five to seven, the men had a near perfect service, with Ramsay in particular praising Jose and Trev on appetizers and meat respectively. The only problems were Motto briefly forgetting entree orders until Ramsay got him back on track, and some of Scotley's fish being improperly scored, which he attempted to blame Trev for. On the other side, Mia turned in a strong performance on appetizers. However the women completely stalled on entrees when Kanae's branzino for the firefighter six top fell apart, forcing them to refire the table, only for Kanae to serve the branzino raw. Their service went further south when T and Heather's filets came out raw and overcooked repeatedly. Eventually, T stopped communicating with Heather, feeling that the latter wasn't doing her job properly, only to bring up another raw steak on the very next ticket. This drove Ramsay past the breaking point, and he proceeded to kick the women out of the kitchen and task them with naming two nominees for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': The women considered Kanae, but ultimately nominated T and Heather, disappointing Ramsay as both of them were runner-ups in their previous seasons. T was eliminated for her poor performance on meat and refusal to communicate with Heather during service, but before leaving Ramsay told T that while she was a very talented chef, he couldn't look past the fact that all the other contestants were performing better than her.\n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \"As a former runner-up, I expected T to come back full of swagger and skill. Sadly, she came back with double the swagger, but only a fraction of the skill.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 273\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Last Chef Standing\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|11|16}}\n| Viewers         = 2.81<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-nov-16-2018/|title='Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' adjusts up: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 19, 2018|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = \n'''Team Challenge''': To test the teams' communication and teamwork skills, Ramsay gave them 40 minutes to cook five entrees from the menu (spaghetti and meatballs, veal scallopini piccata, crispy fried chicken, shrimp and grits, and cioppino). Because the blue team had an extra member, Gizzy volunteered to sit out. Every 8 minutes, Ramsay asked both teams to kick out one member at a time, until only Motto and Ariel were left in their respective kitchens; with 90 seconds to go, Ramsay allowed the chefs back into their kitchens for plating. The women won the challenge 4-3 as Trev forgot to plate the fish for the men's cioppino, reminiscent of a similar error he made during season 8's Taste It Now Make It challenge.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women went go-karting, while the men were forced to take in a delivery of corn and peas, and shuck them for service. During the punishment, Trev suffered a mild allergic reaction and Sous Chef Christina sent him to see a medic, but Scotley was unsympathetic due to Trev already costing them the challenge, even mocking the former by calling him a \"baby girl\".\n\n'''Cook For Your Life Challenge''': For the second season in a row, the Cook For Your Life Challenge took the place of a normal dinner service. This time, Ramsay put on the block the first three chefs from each team to leave the kitchen during the previous challenge. These were Bret, Jose, and Scotley from the red team, and Gizzy, Roe, and Heather from the blue team. The six chefs were then tasked in creating their own entree dishes in 45 minutes.\n\n'''Elimination''': Both Bret's frutti di mare pasta and Heather's coconut curry poached lobster tail beat out Roe's grilled swordfish, but Roe was able to beat out Gizzy's rustic grilled bass. Jose's pan seared salmon and chorizo hash also beat out Gizzy's dish, leaving her to go against Scotley, who had taken over her position in Atlanta. In the end, Scotley's ahi tuna with red lentils won out, and Gizzy was eliminated for leaving the scales on the bass. Before leaving, Ramsay told Gizzy that while she came into the competition strong, she soon lost her confidence later on (as evidenced by sitting out of the challenge and the lack of creativity and conviction in her dish), but urged her not to give up on her dreams.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"I had such high hopes for Gizzy from day one, but if she truly can't believe in herself, then I can't believe in her either.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 274\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = One Hell of a Party\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|12|7}}\n| Viewers         = 2.68<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-dec-7-2018/|title='Hell's Kitchen' adjusts down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=December 10, 2018|accessdate=December 10, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Trev expressed disappointment that Scotley was not eliminated, while Mia takes exception to Bret cussing and calling her \"sweetheart\".\n\n'''Team Challenge''': After showing pictures of the chefs (along with the staff and Ramsay himself) in their teenage years, Ramsay announced for that night's service, he was hosting his youngest daughter [[Matilda Ramsay|Tilly]]'s Sweet 16th birthday party. Both teams had to create a tasting menu for the party, consisting of two appetizers, two meat entrees, and one vegetarian entree, with one point being awarded for each dish that Tilly decides to put on the menu. During the challenge, Tilly asked two things of her dad: personal sized four layer cakes for all the guests, and to control his swearing during dinner service. Motto's confetti tuna and Kanae's Asian kebabs scored over Roe's and Scotley's scallops (due to being served with ricotta cheese and being raw, respectively) on appetizers. Tilly also picks Mia's vegetarian entree over Trev's because she loves mushrooms, as well as Jose's fish and chips and Heather's filet mignon. The women won the challenge 4-2 after Tilly picks Ariel's grilled chicken over Bret's baked ziti, which she found to be too rich.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women spent the day at a Malibu mansion with a drive-by from an artisan ice cream truck, much to Mia's delight, while the men had to make folding paper decorations along with the four layered cakes Tilly asked for, and also set up a mobile photo booth for the party guests. During the punishment, Bret suffered from rapid heartbeat, requiring medical attention. However, he refused to go to the hospital for further testing after his symptoms subsided, not wanting a repeat of season 14 when health issues sent him home early.\n\n'''Dinner service''': [[Thomas Barbusca]] was at tonight's service. The men had a near perfect service for the second time in a row, thanks to strong performances from Scotley on appetizers, Jose on meat, and Motto on fish. Bret burned sweet potato fries and Trev put too much garlic in spinach after ignoring Scotley's warning, but both of them managed to quickly recover. On the other side, the women went through appetizers fine, save for Kanae requiring Heather's help after poorly slicing ahi tuna, but fell apart on entrees. Roe undercooked steak twice, earning the entire team a trip to the pantry. Mia's first attempt at fish didn't have enough batter, and the refire was raw. The last straw for Ramsay was Ariel sending up a raw halibut for Tilly's table. Ariel protested that she had a properly cooked one she meant to send, but the livid Ramsay would have none of it. The women were promptly kicked out of the kitchen as the three male rookies (Scotley, Motto, and Jose) completed their remaining tables for them.\n\n'''Elimination''': The women nominated Roe and Mia for elimination, despite Roe pushing for Ariel to go up for getting the team kicked out. During her plea, Mia falsely accused Kanae of not properly setting up the fish station. Nevertheless, Roe was eliminated for her poor performance on the meat station, which was ironically her strongest station when she was on season 13.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \u201cLast time she was here, Roe was a tour de force on the meat station. But tonight her performance left me as cold as a raw New York strip.\u201d\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 275\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = What Happens in Vegas\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|12|14}}\n| Viewers         = 2.66<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-dec-14-2018/|title=\u2018Fresh Off the Boat\u2019 adjusts down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=December 17, 2018|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Mia and Kanae get into an argument in the dorms over the former throwing the latter under the bus during the previous elimination, as Ariel and Heather break it up.\n\n'''Team Challenge''': The chefs were introduced to the Chinese food challenge with a dragon dance performance outside. Ramsay asked selected contestants to pick an opponent to cook against, and the opponent would pick the protein (spot prawns, black cod, pork tenderloin, duck breast, chicken breast) to cook with. Scotley was the extra member on the red team not picked, so he was assigned chicken breast, and the blue team had to select one of their members to cook the extra chicken dish, which turned out to be Kanae. Ramsay brought in ''Top Chef'' contestant Shirley Chung as a guest judge. Mia scored over Trev on pork tenderloin, Bret scored over Heather on cod, Scotley scored over Kanae on chicken breast, and Ariel scored over Motto on duck breast to tie the score at 2. Kanae then beat Jose on prawns to give the women their third consecutive challenge win.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women flew to Las Vegas with Christina for the night, staying in a private villa in the Nobu hotel, while the men had to make fortune cookies from scratch. Scotley did very little during the punishment, even taking a break to make burgers for a snack and then boiling some of the eggs earmarked for the fortune cookies. This angered Trev, who voiced his concerns to Heather in the dorms, and annoyed his teammates during prep the next day by constantly ordering them around.\n\n'''Dinner service''': Guests in attendance included Olympic medalists [[David Plummer (swimmer)|David Plummer]] and [[Allison Schmitt]], and [[Los Angeles Kings]] players [[Tanner Pearson]] and [[Tyler Toffoli]], as well as a ten-top occupied by Beacher\u2019s Madhouse performers that both teams had to serve at the same time. Other than Kanae dropping two scallops on the first table of appetizers and not understanding Ramsay's command \u201cOut in one\u201d, the women had a near flawless performance thanks to Ariel on meat, serving their half of the ten-top well before the men did. The men, on the other hand, struggled all night due to their lack of cohesion, with Trev and Jose in particular having trouble working together on the fish station. Jose micromanaged Trev's work on their station and attempted to take over after Trev sent raw scallops, but he was scolded for sending up the scallops in a pan rather than a tray. However, Trev managed to rebound and successfully cook the scallops. Things did not get better on entrees. Trev severely burned salmon, and Jose's refire attempt fell apart, leading Ramsay to furiously question who was running the section. After Ariel served perfect lamb chops, Ramsay used them to show the men how meat was supposed to be cooked. Scotley tore the pastry on a Wellington while slicing it, so Ramsay asked Bret to show Scotley how to slice them. His next attempt was raw, so Ramsay compared them to Ariel\u2019s Wellingtons to make a further example. After the women finished service, Ramsay brought them into the red kitchen to help the men, who were kicked out and asked for two nominees after Jose served raw salmon. The women served nearly two-thirds of the red tables in addition to all their own.\n\n'''Elimination''': Ramsay angrily demanded an explanation of the men\u2019s terrible service, which Jose blamed on a \u201cbad vibe\u201d. Trev and Scotley then got into a massive argument about each other\u2019s behavior during punishment, which Jose pointed to as evidence of his assertion. Bret then announced that the team had nominated Scotley and Trev, while seriously considering Jose as well. Ramsay was frustrated, but called down the three nominees. Ramsay was disappointed in Trev for being accused by Scotley of walking around with a clipboard but sent him back in line after hearing his plea. Despite Jose being the worst performer of the night, Scotley was eliminated for declining performances after a strong start.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"I really hoped that Scotley would be the Big Bad Wolf at my restaurant in Las Vegas. But after his performance tonight, I could not let him in, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin.\" \n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 276\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n| Title           = Poor Trev\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|01|04}}\n| Viewers         = 2.50<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-jan-4-2019/|title='Fresh Off the Boat,' 'MacGyver,' 'The Cool Kids,' all other shows hold: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 7, 2019|accessdate=January 7, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = \n'''Team Challenge''': Ramsay revealed that the eighteenth annual blind taste test would be their next challenge, and for that year, the chefs tasted gelatos infused with different flavors. As one chef from each team tasted, their teammates were seated on a stool and would have spaghetti, marinara sauce, and Parmesan cheese dumped on them respectively should the taster get multiple incorrect answers. Trev failed to score any points, resulting in Jose getting all three ingredients dumped on him, while Heather got two, with Kanae getting blasted with only spaghetti. Motto scored an impressive three, but Mia continued her hot streak in challenges with a perfect four, becoming the fourth contestant in Hell's Kitchen to achieve such a feat. Ariel scored three over Bret's two, resulting in Motto getting blasted with spaghetti. On the final round, while both Jose and Kanae identified coffee, the women won the challenge 10-6 as it was now impossible for the men to catch up.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women went to Southern California\u2019s Premiere Korean Spa for a day of pampering while the men had to clean up the mess in the dining room, polish all the silverware for the private dinner service, and make gelato by hand. Trev suffered a crisis of confidence as a result of costing his team the challenge, believing he couldn't win without showing he had a decent palate, but was calmed down and encouraged by Heather in the dorms. During the punishment, he suffered a lot of merciless teasing and mocking from his teammates after breaking the ice cream churner, but knew he had to bounce back.\n\n'''Dinner service''': For one night only, Hell's Kitchen was closed for a charity night service. The men cooked for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], whose table featured Sabrina Soto, [[Kevin Zegers]] and [[Parker Young]]. The women cooked for [[Waterkeeper Alliance]], whose table featured [[Camryn Manheim]], her son [[Milo Manheim|Milo]], [[Dylan Bruno]], and [[Chad Lowe]]. The menu that night featured a five-course Italian meal, with each chef in charge of a course. On the scallops course, Mia led effectively although sometimes too quietly for Ramsay's liking. Motto was derailed by Trev serving scallops seared on only one side, and the entire team plating slowly. After the course was served, Ramsay discovered an entire tray of wasted scallops, prompting Trev and Bret arguing over who was responsible. Both Ariel and Bret led the branzino course with only minor problems; Kanae took the foil off the tray of fish, nearly letting it get cold, while some of Jose's salad was bruised. Trev led the carbonara course vocally and effectively, with Ramsay calling it the best executed course so far, but Kanae was slowed by Heather plating inconsistent amounts of pasta on each of their plates, forcing the team to restart plating. On the veal saltimbocca course, while Heather had no problems, Jose struggled to give her and Ramsay accurate timings and failed to check the veal chops, which led to seven of them, including Soto's, being returned for being raw. Infuriated and embarrassed, Ramsay cooked the refires himself as both teams got desserts out. The men were named clear losers and asked for two nominees. \n\n'''Elimination''': Trev announced that the nominees were Jose and, much to Ramsay's shock, himself. Trev's teammates all wanted him gone, on the grounds that he constantly sucked up to Ramsay and denied responsibility for the burnt scallops and raw veal. On the other hand, Trev countered that Bret and Motto also had a role in cooking the scallops and veal, respectively. Ramsay ultimately eliminated Jose, much to everyone else's chagrin, for his poor leadership on his course and allowing the raw veal to leave the kitchen without checking them first, but gave him encouragement.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"On a night when it should have been Hell\u2019s Kitchen giving back to some amazing charities, it was charities that ended up giving back Jose\u2019s raw veal.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 277\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Devilish Desserts\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|01|11}}\n| Viewers         = 2.92<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-jan-11-2019/|title='MacGyver' adjusts down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 14, 2019|accessdate=January 14, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = \n'''Team Challenge''': The challenge was a three-on-three showdown to see which team could make the better lineup of desserts to impress Ramsay and restaurateur Valerie Gordon, each of whom would each give each dessert between one and five points.  The blue team had an extra dish, and Heather's unappetizing-looking bread pudding was left out of the lineup. Kanae's deconstructed tiramisu scored only three points, as it had a cherry glaze that Valerie compared to cough syrup. Motto gave the red team an early lead with his s'mores-inspired bread pudding, scoring seven points. Mia's deconstructed apple and mascarpone tart (which was only deconstructed because she had to improvise when her actual tart kept crumbling on her) was overpowered by ginger and scored four. Bret's arancini balls only scored the minimum two because they were undercooked to a degree that Valerie described as ''al dente'', opening the door for the blue team.  Ariel took advantage with her Thai lime and beet tart, scoring an impressive seven. This left Trev needing five points for the red team to tie, and six to win. However, his chocolate and avocado \"kisses,\" an attempt at a healthy dessert, tasted awful and also scored the minimum two points. Thus, the blue team won the challenge 14-11.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women had lunch at the Joey Woodland Hills restaurant with sous chef Jocky, and then went on a $2,000 shopping spree ($500 per team member) to high-end culinary store [[Sur La Table]]. Heather was in a poor mood almost the entire time due to her dessert being left out of the challenge, even though her team still managed to win without it.  Meanwhile, the men had to break down 600 pounds of ice by hand into ice cubes for cocktails. Bret and Motto being so annoyed by Trev's lack of cooperation in carrying out the task (even though Trev had insisted on doing his part of the task on his own), and mocked Trev both to his face and behind his back. Before service, Trev expressed his concerns to sous chef Christina about earning Bret and Motto's respect, and asked if it would be possible to discuss opportunities for advancement after the competition.\n\n'''Dinner service''': The VIP guests were [[Randall Park]] at the blue chef's table and [[Malcolm Smith (American football)|Malcolm Smith]] at the red. Both teams got through appetizers with no trouble, except for Mia being unable to taste the risotto due to a shellfish allergy; Ramsay suggested that Mia cook the carbonara and Ariel take the risotto instead. On entr\u00e9es, Heather overcooked a New York strip steak, and Ramsay stepped in after Kanae served raw salmon for the chef's table, but the women finished no other issues. The men, on the other hand, were plagued by miscommunication and lack of cohesion all night. Bret and Motto failed to answer when Trev asked for a time on fish and garnish, causing Trev to serve a raw Wellington. On the next ticket, Trev forgot to put the herb crust on a lamb chop (which he claimed to never have cooked before), but luckily, Motto was able to inform Trev before Ramsay saw it. However, Trev proceeded to overcook one of the two lamb chops, while Bret cooked halibut in a dirty pan. After Bret served raw salmon to Smith's five-month-pregnant wife and Trev's Wellington for Smith fell apart, an irate and embarrassed Ramsay kicked the men out for the fourth time this season.\n\n'''Elimination''': Ramsay asked the men for one nominee, but Bret and Trev both blamed each other for the service's failure, so Ramsay called both of them down. To the relief of Bret and Motto, Trev was finally eliminated for his third consecutive nomination (and fourth overall), worsening performances, refusal to take responsibility for his mistakes, and losing the respect of his teammates. Nonetheless, Ramsay praised him for his passion and dedication and wished him luck in his culinary career. After Trev left, Ramsay warned Bret to step up his game, and asked the women for a volunteer to move to the red team the next day in order to even the numbers.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Trevor is one of the most passionate chefs I've ever had in Hell's Kitchen.

This makes Mia the third person in the show's history to switch back to their original team, after Autumn from season seven and Trev from season eight. Immediately afterwards, however, Ramsay announced that the chefs would be competing in a series of challenges to win a black jacket, and the lone chef who did not win one would be sent home.\n\n'''Black Jackets Challenge 1''': For their first challenge, each chef had to punch a hole to collect their ingredients: protein, two vegetables, starch, and a wildcard. They then had 45 minutes to cook their dishes using the ingredients. Motto, Bret, Ariel, and Mia all got good reviews, while Kanae's dish was praised for its flavors but criticized for raw green beans. Heather's dish received the worst review, as she didn't let her duck (which she had never cooked before) rest long enough, and her potato puree came out gummy because it was put in a Vitamix blender. In the end, Ariel's pan seared scallops and Mia's filet mignon were deemed the best of the six and won the first two black jackets; this makes Ariel the sixth person to earn a black jacket twice. The two were rewarded by spending their day at the Black Jackets Lounge. They also got to watch live feeds of the ongoing challenges, but the feed would cut out as Ramsay was about to announce the results.\n\n'''Black Jackets Challenge 2''': For their second challenge, the remaining four chefs had to spin a wheel to determine the four ingredients they would all need to use, which were quail, eggplant, baby leeks, and cauliflower. Heather spun the quail, which distressed her due to her inexperience with duck and quail. They then had to cook their own dish using those ingredients in 45 minutes. Bret and Motto had the two best dishes, as Heather left a lemon wedge in her quail and also removed the wings and legs, while Kanae's cauliflower puree was of poor consistency. Bret and Motto won their black jackets, and joined Ariel and Mia at the Black Jackets Lounge, leaving Heather and Kanae to compete in the final challenge.\n\n'''Black Jackets Challenge 3''': For the final challenge, Heather and Kanae had 45 minutes to make their own surf and turf dish. Heather burned her hand late in the challenge but managed to finish, presenting a traditional filet mignon and lobster tail with broccoli rabe and mashed potatoes, while Kanae made an Asian inspired pork chop and prawns with coconut cilantro rice.\n\n'''Elimination''': After tasting both their dishes, Ramsay gave Heather the final black jacket, much to the disappointment of the other chefs, who felt that she had played it too safe in her dish.  (Ironically, Heather had received the ''first'' black jacket in season 16, the first season to feature the black jacket challenge, rather than the ''last'' one.)  Therefore, despite being more ambitious and taking more risks with her dish, Kanae was eliminated from the competition for underseasoning her rice and making her prawns too sweet. Before Kanae left, Ramsay said that she would have a bright future in the culinary industry, hoping that one day she would become an Executive Chef. Ramsay gave no comment on Kanae's elimination, and she did not receive the coat hanging and portrait burning sequence.\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 279\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = An Episode of Firsts\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|01|25}}\n| Viewers         = 2.66<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-jan-25-2019/|title='Dynasty' adjusts down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 28, 2019|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = As the final five celebrated in the Black Jacket Lounge, Bret revealed that having earned a black jacket meant a lot to him as he fell victim to his circumstances when he was younger, nearly facing a 30-year prison sentence.\n\n'''Individual Challenge''': The next day, the final five received breakfast from the Sous Chefs in the form of Ramsay's eggs Benedict, which Ariel and Mia took extra time to analyze. Their premonitions proved correct when Ramsay announced the Taste It Now Make It Challenge, and tasked the five to recreate the dish. Both Bret and Heather were disqualified for serving broken Hollandaise sauce. Motto, who elected not to taste Ramsay's sample plate, was also eliminated for being the only person to identify prosciutto but not Canadian bacon. Ariel and Mia each got one component of the hollandaise sauce correct (paprika and shallots, respectively), so Ramsay declared both of them winners.\n\n'''Reward/Punishment''': Ariel and Mia went with the sous chefs on an indoor skydiving experience, along with having lunch at Sweet Butter, while the remaining chefs had to clean the dorms.\n\n'''Dinner service''': [[Kelli Berglund]] and [[Drew Van Acker]] were in attendance in addition to [[Los Angeles Rams]] players [[Rodger Saffold]], [[Tyler Higbee]], and [[Jared Goff]]. The chefs struggled with communication and timing all night. Ariel put in a strong performance on appetizers, but Heather fell behind on the fish station, requiring Motto's help, and struggled to communicate to Ariel and Motto when the scallops would be ready. Because of this, Motto brought the scallops up to the pass two minutes before Ariel's risotto was ready, but after that, appetizers ran smoothly. On entrees, Bret served a raw New York strip and Ramsay scolded him for not communicating with Motto. Motto managed to get the refire accepted, but the order was slightly delayed due to Bret sending up the sauce late. Mia froze on garnish and did not respond when Bret asked for a time, while Heather stalled the kitchen on the Rams' table when the salmon skin broke off, requiring Motto to help her out again. After a communication breakdown caused Motto to get confused over how many fish were on order, Ramsay got the chefs back on track, and dinner service continued with no other problems. Despite completing service, Ramsay was not happy as they did not maintain their strong start, and tasked the final five to nominate two people for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': Heather and Mia were nominated, even though the latter argued for Bret, for having two steaks sent back. Ramsay polled the other three on who should leave; Motto and Ariel voted for Heather while Bret voted for Mia. Ramsay agreed and eliminated Heather for her worsening performances, making excuses for her mistakes, and not showing the same strength she had back in Season 16. Heather was the last of the former runners-up to be eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Too many times, Heather blamed her mistakes on having a bad day.  I'm not looking for apologies, I'm looking for an executive chef.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 280\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n| Title           = What's Your Motto?\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|02|01}}\n| Viewers         = 3.08<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-feb-1-2019/|title='Hell's Kitchen' adjusts up: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=February 4, 2019|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Shortly before midnight, Ramsay called everyone down and introduced them to Dan Drake, founder of pancake catering company Dancakes, who used pancakes to draw portraits of the four contestants as well as Ramsay. Ramsay announced the challenge, which was to create an innovative dish to be prepared and served tableside for many esteemed chefs visiting Hell's Kitchen.\n\n'''Individual Challenge:''' Guest judges included Ted Hopson, Geoff Baumberger, Michael Fiorelli, and Joel Miller. Ariel made duck meatball (albondigas) dumplings in pozole soup, while the others made shrimp dishes inspired by their heritages (Italian, Puerto Rican, Cajun). Motto nearly dropped his pan for one table while telling them a story about a cookoff he was in. For another table, he worked so slowly that he was nearly unable to serve them in time. Mia forgot the name of the shrimp that she was using in her dish when prompted, but charmed her guests with her Puerto Rican demeanor.  Bret unsettled several guests by describing his many seafood-based tattoos.  Ariel's story about her prior experience in season six and her drive to, at the very least, finish better this season, elicited sympathy from her guests. In the end, Ariel won the challenge and chose Bret to join her on the reward, out of veteran solidarity and sympathy of the many punishments he faced.\n\n'''Reward/punishment:''' While Ariel and Bret enjoyed a day at the beach, horseback riding, and a personal massage session in Malibu, Mia and Motto had to wash, peel, zest, and juice citrus fruits at the bar to make sangrias for the upcoming dinner service.\n\n'''Dinner service:''' Attending service were [[Amber Rose]], [[Neen Williams]], and [[Curt Menefee]]. The final four took turns running the pass, and had to be on the lookout for sabotages from Ramsay and the sous chefs. Bret caught Christina making a carbonara with spaghetti instead of tagliatelle and rejected Ariel's undercooked scallops, but ironically missed orzo pasta being used in place of rice for his own risotto. Ariel noticed Jocky giving her tuna tartare instead of beef tartare and sent back Bret's scrambled carbonara, but couldn't taste the difference between fennel and onion puree. Mia spotted monkfish wellington instead of lobster, but missed a ribeye in place of New York strip and Bret's garlicky risotto. However, she recovered to reject Ariel's bland mashed potatoes as well as another one of Bret's cracked carbonaras. Motto noticed that Marino had given him a ticket with salmon tartare, which wasn't on the menu, and attempted to send back a pork chop for being undercooked, only for Ramsay to inform him that it was actually a veal chop. Ramsay was relatively pleased by the service, and asked the four chefs to nominate someone whom they felt did not deserve to advance to the final.\n\n'''Motto's exit:''' Bret and Mia nominated each other, but Motto shocked everyone by nominating himself. Motto revealed his desire and obligation to take everything he had learned at Hell's Kitchen to upgrade the culinary landscape in his hometown of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], and announced his decision to Ramsay at the elimination ceremony. Ramsay was disappointed in this, but praised Motto's tenacity and sincerity, asked Motto to call him to discuss opportunities when he was finished, and allowed him to keep his jacket.  Motto did not get a jacket hanging and picture burning scene, and no statement was issued regarding his departure.\n\nRamsay then announced Ariel as the first finalist, but before it was revealed whether Bret or Mia would be the second, the episode ended on a cliffhanger.\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 281\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n| Title           = A Rollercoaster Ride\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|02|08}}\n| Viewers         = 3.17<ref name=\"18.15&18.16\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-feb-8-2019/|title='Blindspot' adjusts up: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=February 11, 2019|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Continuing from the previous episode, Ramsay named Mia as the second finalist and eliminated Bret, but praised him for his unmatched passion, reminded him how proud of him his parents would have been, and allowed him to keep his jacket. He then assigned Ariel to Sous Chef Christina and Mia to Sous Chef Jocky, who would help them prepare a tasting menu consisting of one cold and hot appetizer and one seafood, chicken, and beef entree.\n\nThe next morning, Ramsay brought in Ariel's and Mia's parents. He took the final two to brunch, where he announced that [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] had been closed for the day, and they would be able to ride the rides with their parents all afternoon including [[Viper (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Viper]]. Ariel and Mia quickly realized that both of their menus were quite similar, due to their desires to incorporate their respective Latin heritages. That evening, Ramsay and his daughter Holly joined them and told them there was one more roller coaster to go on that had not yet been opened to the public: [[Full Throttle (roller coaster)|Full Throttle]]. He led Mia and Ariel to it, where they were greeted by a live audience.\n\n'''Challenge:''' Ariel and Mia were given 60 minutes to create their menus with the help of their sous chefs. Ramsay brought in various guest judges to rate the dishes on a scale from 1 to 10. Mia beat Ariel 9-8 on the cold appetizer and chicken entree, but Ariel did the same on the hot appetizer and seafood entree, which meant that chef Michael Cimarusti would break the tie on the steak entree. He gave Ariel 8 and Mia 9, which gave Mia the challenge win and the first choice of the returning chefs from the season to form a brigade for the final dinner service. Mia picked Roe, Trev, Jose, and Heather. Ariel picked Kanae, Bret, Motto, and was left with Scotley. The chefs and the sous chefs then all got on Full Throttle for one last ride before heading back to Hell's Kitchen.\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 282\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n| Title           = The Grand Finale\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|02|08}}\n| Viewers         = 3.17<ref name=\"18.15&18.16\"/>\n| ShortSummary    = In the season recap at the beginning of the episode, Chris, Kanae, and Motto each had their pictures burned.\n\n'''Pre-service:''' Ariel had no trouble getting her team to buy in to her menu, but Roe, Heather, and Trev had trouble pronouncing several of Mia's dishes' names and got annoyed with her micromanagement during prep. Heather in particular was not pleased to have to work for Mia. Ramsay liked Mia's menu, but asked Ariel to re-season every one of her dishes.\n\n'''Dinner service:''' The finalists' families plus [[Matt Barkley]], [[Jessie Graff]], and [[Yael Grobglas]] were in attendance for the last dinner service while [[Marcia Clark]] and [[JB Smoove]] sat at Ariel's and Mia's chef's tables respectively. Both Mia and Ariel got through appetizers smoothly. Mia had to remind Trev to salt his risotto, and Kanae needed Motto's help after burning dumplings, but they all recovered. On entrees, Roe undercooked pork and overcooked sea bass, the latter of which forced Mia to refire an entire table. In the red kitchen, Scotley nearly burned ribcap until Ariel reminded him to pay attention to his station. Bret bounced back after sending a cold steak, but when he served raw chicken twice for the Six Flags executive staff table, Ramsay yelled at him to wake up. Despite the minor hiccups, both teams finished service on a strong note.\n\n'''Winner''': As per Hell's Kitchen tradition, Mia and Ariel stood in front of two doors. Ariel's door opened, making her the eighteenth winner of Hell's Kitchen and the second winner in a row who was appearing on the show a second time. Mia took her defeat graciously. Having grown close to Mia through their positive competitive rivalry during the competition, Ariel promised to keep a job opening for Mia in Las Vegas if the opportunity arose, and hung her picture in the Hall of Fame. \n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Since the first time she was here, Ariel has grown tenfold as a chef. She is fiercely talented, extremely determined and a commanding leader. I could not be more pleased to have her as my executive chef of Hell\u2019s Kitchen in Las Vegas.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}}}</onlyinclude><!-- Please be careful not to delete this tag when adding episodes.

This season features eight new contestants battling eight returning veterans. For the first time, the winner of this season will receive a position as an executive chef at Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen Restaurant at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].\n\nThis is the first season since season 1 to not begin with men on the blue team and women on the red team. It is also the second of the last  two seasons to feature a chef eliminated during service, the second season, along with season 17, that no chef from the winning team was eliminated, and the first season since season 5 where two chefs quit. This is also the first season to have a chef quit before the finals, and the first season since season 17 to have two eliminated chefs keep their jackets. Ariel Contreras-Fox, who previously finished in third place on Season 6, won the competition; she is the second consecutive returnee, and sixth consecutive woman to do so. She is also the tenth contestant to win the competition without being nominated for elimination once, after Kimberly-Ann Ryan, Meghan Gill,\nLa Tasha McCutchen, Christina Wilson, Holli Ugalde, Dave Levey, Danny Veltri, Heather West, and Michael Wray.\n\n==Opening sequence==\n\nThe introduction for season 18 was recycled from the [[Hell's Kitchen (American season 17)|previous season]] except for the title card, which shows the rookies on the left side and the veterans on the right side.\n\n==Chefs==\n\nSixteen chefs competed in season 18.<ref name=officialpressrelease>{{cite press release|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2018/09/13/for-first-time-ever-rookies-take-on-veterans-in-the-all-new-season-of-hells-kitchen-premiering-friday-september-28-on-fox-96504/20180913fox01/|date= September 13, 2018| accessdate=November 18, 2018|title=For First Time Ever, Rookies Take on Veterans in the All-New Season of \"Hell's Kitchen,\" Premiering Friday, September 28, on Fox|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting]]}}</ref>\n\n===Rookies===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" \"style=text-align:center\"<!-- Do NOT remove any of the quotation marks from this line.

After lunch, Ramsay revealed himself and announced the grand prize for that season. After half of the chefs (the rookies) explain their credentials, the other half reveal themselves to actually be returning chefs from previous seasons, much to the rookies' shock. Ramsay then revealed that for the first time, he would be pitting rookies against veterans (rather than men against women), with the rookies cooking in the red kitchen under Sous Chef Christina, and the veterans cooking in the blue kitchen under Sous Chef Jocky.\n\n'''Team challenge/signature dish''': For this year, the veterans had to recreate the rookies' signature dishes. The rookies not only received the ingredients they wanted for their dishes, but also got to pick which veteran they wanted to cook against. Both teams had 45 minutes to cook their dishes, to be rated on a scale from 1-5. T and Motto each scored three points on shrimp and grits. Kevin received a perfect five on fish stew, but Kanae scored only three after Ramsay compared her side of plantains to a camel's turd. Roe scored three points over Scott's two on black bass, while Chris and Bret each received four points on mango glazed duck breast. Ariel and Jose both scored four points on scallops with parsnip, and both Scotley and Trev scored three points on snapper. Mia scored a perfect five on her grilled pork, but Jen scored only two because her pork was badly overcooked. Finally, both Gizzy and Heather scored perfect 5's on scallops and cucumber gazpacho, and the challenge ended tied at 29 points, only the second such occurrence in the signature dish challenge, after season 8. This was also the first time under the new scoring format that nobody's signature dish received a 1. For the tie-breaker, Ramsay called up Mia and Kevin to bring their dishes up again, and after a second look, he gave Mia's dish the edge, and the rookies won their first challenge.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The rookies celebrate their first challenge win with dinner at Charcoal in Venice Beach with Ramsay and Chef [[Josiah Citrin]]. The veterans prep for opening night by deshelling the sunflower seeds and detailing the mushrooms. Jen earned her teammates' ire for costing them the challenge, pureeing mushrooms for duxelle without cleaning them, and giving attitude to Sous Chef Jocky. She and Bret started to get on each other's nerves over their conflicting personalities, but started to warm up to him when he revealed his tattoos in memory of his deceased parents.\n\n'''Challenge \u2013 Part 1''': The teams were greeted to a Scottish funeral being held in the dining room. As Ramsay was about to reveal someone near and dear they were saying goodbye to, the episode ends on a cliffhanger.\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 268\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = A Fond Farewell\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|10|5}}\n| Viewers         = 2.66<ref name=\"18.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-5-2018/|title='The Cool Kids,' 'MacGyver,' everything else unchanged: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|website=TV by the Numbers|date=October 8, 2018|accessdate=October 8, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = \n'''Challenge \u2013 Part 2''': Continuing from the previous episode Ramsay revealed that the lobster risotto from the menu, which has been a staple dish since the beginning of the series, was going to be retired. Instead, each chef would have an opportunity to prepare their own risotto dish to be added to the menu for the entire season, with the winner also receiving a Punishment Pass, a one time advantage that allows the bearer to skip out on a punishment and join the winning team on their reward. The chefs had 45 minutes to cook their risottos, and Ramsay had each Sous Chef taste the dishes on their team and pick the top four. The rookies were represented by Chris, Gizzy, Mia, and Scott, while the veterans were represented by T, Roe, Ariel, and Bret. In the end, Bret's tomato risotto with grilled shrimp and asparagus beat out Mia's basil and split pea risotto with pancetta, and he won the challenge, although his emotional celebration annoyed the rookies.\n\n'''Before service''': Before service began, the Sous Chefs called both teams down to discuss the new menu items, but had to lecture the rookies for arriving late and separated. While prepping for service, Jocky became irritated with Trev for improperly scoring the Wellingtons, while Christina advised the rookies to use the veterans' arrogance to their advantage.\n\n'''Service''': [[Don McLean]], [[Annie Wersching]], [[Kyle Schmid]], and [[Courtney Sixx]] were seen at opening night, and a shrimp and pasta appetizer was served tableside by Roe and Scotley. The veterans were slowed by T serving a risotto that had more cheese than tomato and Trev serving mushy scallops in a small frying pan, but both recovered. On entrees, Bret accidentally sliced his lamb before bringing it to the pass, and Jen was late to serve the sauce for a pork chop. Despite those problems, the veterans finished service on a high note. In the red kitchen, Scott only fired one serving of shrimp for two risottos on order, and was caught cooking more shrimp for the tableside station despite it being Scotley's responsibility. The problems continued on entrees as Jose served raw halibut, Chris was caught writing down cooking times instead of helping Mia out on meat, and a communication breakdown occurred when nobody could recite an order correctly. After Mia served raw lamb, Ramsay finally had seen enough of the rookies' fragmented performance and threw them out of the kitchen, asking them to name two people for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': The rookies agreed to nominate Scott and Chris as they were the ones who were the most lost that night, but Ramsay called down Jose as well. During their pleas, Chris revealed that nine months prior to the competition, he had suffered a major accident that destroyed 90% of his face and also affected his memory. Ramsay was sympathetic, but made it clear that Chris needed to fight back. In the end, Chris and Jose were sent back in line and Scott was eliminated for being confused all night and failing to uphold his impressive resume. \n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \u201cScott remembers working with some of the biggest named chefs in the world. But whether they would remember him is another matter entirely. I know I won't remember him by tomorrow.\u201d\n\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 269\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Hell's Riders\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|10|12}}\n| Viewers         = 2.67<ref name=\"18.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-12-2018/|title='Speechless' and 'Dateline' adjust down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|website=TV by the Numbers|date=October 15, 2018|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = '''Team Challenge''': The chefs were tasked with cooking lunch for the Marine Corps. The menu included entrees that represented the air, land, and sea: chicken parmesan with angel hair pasta, New York strip and frittes, and fish and chips. For the rookies, Scotley constantly micromanaged Mia on the fish station, and his misdirection eventually caused a paper towel to catch fire. Gizzy was lectured for waiting for water to boil before putting in pasta. The veterans' service was bumpier, as Jen overdressed salad, leading Heather, who was supposed to be on French fries, to jump on the station much to Jen's annoyance. Kevin rushed Heather on fries after she forgot to delegate her station, causing an order to be sent back from the blue dining room for being undercooked. Ramsay berated the veterans for not communicating and giving up after Roe served soggy fish, but they rallied behind Kevin's leadership. Both teams reached their last ticket at the same time, but Ariel sent cold steak, allowing the rookies time to complete their ticket and win their second challenge in a row.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The rookies were rewarded with a trip to Paramount Ranch, where they would star in their own Western movie called \"Hell's Riders\", alongside Marino. Ramsay offered Bret the chance to join them using his punishment pass from the risotto challenge, and Bret accepted, irritating his teammates, who were tasked with preparing calamari for a tableside appetizer. Jen walked out of prep and broke down in tears after getting in an argument with Heather and Ariel over how to prepare beurre blanc sauce (ironically, they thought Jen's from the last prep session was better). Before service began, Ramsay and the sous chefs showed everyone the Hell's Riders trailer.\n\n'''Service''': [[Aly Michalka]] was in attendance despite not being mentioned in this service. Mia and Ariel served grilled calamari tableside. Both teams had relatively little trouble with appetizers, except for Motto cooking a risotto off the stove and making it too crunchy, and Trev taking too long to assemble cold appetizers, with Ramsay chiding him for taking a sip of water before serving the appetizers. On entrees, Jen served bland mashed potatoes for the first table, argued about it with Heather and Sous Chef Jocky when they tasted for her, and when Ramsay came in to check on the team, snidely asked what he was about to yell at her for. Scotley provided inconsistent times on his beef wellingtons, which caused Gizzy to overcook halibut, and Ramsay replaced her on the fish station with Jose. Mia entered the kitchen after finishing the tableside orders, helping Kanae catch up on garnish and Jose repeat an order from Sous Chef Christina. \n\n'''Automatic elimination''': Jen stalled the blue team with her garnishes and T called her out for not communicating times clearly. Ramsay and Jocky sent back her leeks, informing her that there was only enough for one of the two ducks on order. When Jen protested that she did send up enough leeks, Ramsay pulled the pan out from the dish tray and showed the entire team, but Jen accused Ramsay of throwing the pan of leeks under the hot pass to sabotage her. Ramsay dropped the pan on the floor in a fit of rage and escorted the veterans to the pantry room. All the while, Jen continued to shout that she would not be disrespected, until Ramsay was left with no choice but to order Jen to remove her jacket and leave through the front door. This marked the 9th time a contestant was eliminated during service. Afterwards, the veterans got their entrees out more quickly and neither kitchen made another error. \n\nAfter service, Ramsay announced to both teams that he sent Jen home for attacking his reputation. Then for the second time in two seasons, both teams were declared winners after an automatic disqualification, in lieu of the nomination process. Unlike most chefs who get eliminated during service, Jen still got her coat hung and picture burned at the end of the episode.\n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \u201cJen accused me of sabotaging her. The truth of the matter is the only thing that sabotaged Jen tonight was her cooking.\u201d\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 270\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Hell Freezes Over\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|10|19}}\n| Viewers         = 2.54<ref name=\"18.04\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-19-2018/|title='Last Man Standing' adjusts up: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|website=TV by the Numbers|date=October 22, 2018|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Everyone expressed shock over Jen's disrespectful attitude that led to her early departure. Chris, Jose, and Scotley relax in the hot tub while taking turns hitting on Mia, with Trev reassuring her that the two of them would get black jackets but not the other three. \n\n'''Team Challenge''': The sous chefs handed winter jackets to all the contestants. When they went outside, Ramsay had set up an artificial snow slope. He tasked each team to take four runs down the slope in sleds. The blue team finished first, and they were given a 10-second headstart to grab ingredients for the winter soup challenge, where each contestant had 45 minutes to prepare a soup. Ramsay brought in [[Traci Des Jardins]] and [[Brian Boitano]] as guest judges, and each judge would rate each soup from 1-3 stars. The veterans got off to a strong start as Trev scored 6 stars, Heather scored 8, Ariel scored 7, T scored 8, and Kevin scored 6. But Roe and Bret scored the minimum 3 stars due to insufficient seasoning and canned tomatoes, respectively. (Ironically, Bret saw a fellow competitor make the same mistake on the signature dish back in season 14) This left the veterans with a score of 41. For the rookies, Mia scored the maximum 9 stars, Motto scored 6, Gizzy scored a perfect 9, Chris scored the minimum 3, Jose scored 7, and Scotley scored 8 for a total of 42, automatically giving the rookies the win before Kanae's soup was tasted. Kanae managed to score a perfect 9 as well to make the final score 51-41, and it was the rookies' third challenge win in a row.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The rookies were rewarded with a day and night of pampering at L'Horizon Resort in Palm Springs and dinner at Sopa, while the veterans had to shovel out the snow and prepare both kitchens for service. Bret took his poor performance very personally, drawing his teammates' ire. Trev struggled to poach eggs during prep, earning Sous-Chef Jocky's criticism once again.\n\n'''Service''': [[Hayley Orrantia]] was in attendance. In addition, each team received VIP guests at their respective chef's table. The blue team had [[Cheryl Hines]] and [[Rachael Harris]], and the red team had [[Morgan Spurlock]]. Gizzy and Bret served tableside clam chowder, but both struggled. The former was criticized for entering the kitchen while attempting to help Mia on flatbreads, while the latter worked slowly, socialized with the customers, and held up his team. Scotley and Mia argued on appetizers, prompting Sous-Chef Christina to intervene. On entrees, Chris forgot about a pork chop for Spurlock's table that Ramsay had put into the oven before service opened, and Ramsay found it burned completely black. Kevin served cold New York strip, while Motto overcooked steak but recovered. On the next ticket, Kevin overcooked and undercooked lamb chops while rejecting Trev's assistance, leading Ramsay to march the entire blue team into the pantry. When Kevin served the lamb raw again, Ramsay stepped in to cook it himself. Even though nobody was ejected, Ramsay declared both teams losers due to their careless errors and regression from the previous week. \n\n'''Team Change''': The blue team nominated Kevin and Trev, while the red team nominated Chris and Gizzy. After questioning the nominees, Ramsay first asked Kevin and Gizzy for their jackets, only to ask Kevin to go the red team and Gizzy to the blue team. Then he asked for Trev's jacket, only to send him to the red team as well. It seemed as though Chris would be eliminated, but Ramsay merely sent him back in line and warned him it was his last chance. Finally, Ramsay sent Mia and Kanae to the blue team and Bret to the red team, effectively ending the Rookies vs. Veterans experiment in favor of the traditional battle of the sexes, only in opposite color jackets, as the men are now the red team and the women are the blue team. This is the most people in the show's history to switch teams in a single season with six. Notably, Trev was also temporarily transferred to the red team during his first Hell's Kitchen appearance. \n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \"Rookies, veterans... the only title I really care about is Executive Chef.

He then asked Marino and the sous chefs to drop a giant fish from the ceiling, in order to introduce today's challenge: the seven chefs on each team would cook halibut in a different manner. Ramsay brought in David Lefevre as a guest judge. Gizzy beat Bret on grilled, despite her concerns that her fish was overcooked. Mia beat Chris on steamed, but Kevin put the men on the board by beating Roe on poached. Kanae beat Scotley on smoked, while Ariel and Jose each scored on shallow-fried. Motto beat Heather on pan-seared to keep the men's hopes alive, but T beat Trev on oven-baked, to give the women their first challenge win of the season by the score of 5-3. \n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women went on a virtual reality adventure and received Vitamix blenders, while the men had to compost food waste in manure, during which it started raining. Motto was the only one not to complain about the work, as he grew up on a farm and was used to it.\n \n'''Service''': Guests in attendance for this service include [[Stephanie Beatriz]], [[Carly Hughes]] and [[Sarah Shahi]]. Chris and Heather served tableside mussels, but the former was scolded for loitering in the dining room waiting for table side orders instead of helping in the kitchen. However, none of Chris's teammates wanted his help until Kevin let him take over on fish. Nonetheless, Chris still managed to send raw scallops. In the blue kitchen, Ariel brought up two orders of scallops not knowing that T had overcooked one of them. However, T managed to quickly recover and serve acceptable scallops. On entrees, Mia was caught checking wellingtons by slicing them in the middle instead of at the ends, prompting Ramsay to warn her teammates to communicate with her. In addition, Gizzy's concerns over undercooking her lamb chops caused T to momentarily take over, but Ramsay confirmed they were perfect, and proceeded to lecture T over not letting Gizzy drive her section. Other than that, the women finished service with no further issues. The men had a much bumpier service. Bret served perfect wellingtons, but Scotley failed to communicate with him on garnish, and proceeded to misinform Kevin to cook one salmon when two were on order. This led Kevin to drench the salmon in butter in an attempt to get it up on time. When it came up raw, Ramsay proceeded to take over the ticket and sent the men into the pantry to regroup, where Scotley irked Kevin by stating that he couldn't keep an eye on the pass anymore. After Bret served cold sauce for a Wellington, a frustrated Ramsay threw the men out while the women finished their last ticket. After service, Ramsay pulled Gizzy aside and advised her to find her voice.\n\n'''Elimination''': The men nominated Scotley and Kevin, although Motto pushed for Bret to go up for getting the team kicked out. After a tough decision, Kevin was eliminated for being nominated twice in a row and not showing the same passion and desire as he did back in Season 6. Before Kevin left, Ramsay gave him encouragement and told him that he was already a successful and talented chef outside Hell's Kitchen. \n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \"Kevin was a standout in his first time in Hell's Kitchen. Unfortunately, this time around, he seemed more determined to head back to the ski slopes than to the Las Vegas Strip.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 272\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = Hot Potato\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|11|9}}\n| Viewers         = 2.82<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-nov-9-2018/|title='Last Man Standing, 'MacGyver,' everything else unchanged: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = \n'''Team Challenge''': For their next challenge, both teams had to make a dish using potato as the main ingredient, and had to collect plastic body parts from Mr. Potato Head to collect their ingredients. Former ''[[Top Chef]]'' contestant [[Richard Blais]] was invited as a guest judge. Because the blue team had an extra dish, Kanae's dish was chosen to sit out due to clunky presentation. The men did well with both Chris and Bret scoring perfect tens, while Trev and Scotley scored six and eight respectively; however, Jose only scored four while Motto scored the minimum two. For the women, Mia once again had a perfect score of ten, while Ariel and Roe both scored near perfect nines, and Heather scored six, but T and Gizzy only scored three. The score was tied at 40 apiece, but Ramsay and Blais deemed Chris' lobster shepherd's pie as the best dish overall, and the men won the challenge. Afterwards, Ramsay and Blais tasted Kanae's dish and told the women it would have received eight points had it been used.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The men visited Animal Tracks and ate lunch at a gourmet food truck, while the women had to prep 100 pounds of potatoes for Steak Night. Kanae got frustrated with T, as it was the latter who not only underperformed but also pushed the hardest to drop the former's dish.\n\n'''Chris's Exit''': Returning from the reward, Chris starts to feel anxious, questioning his credibility in the competition, before confiding in Sous Chef Christina of his wish to leave the competition, as he had not fully recovered from his accident nine months ago and was experiencing emotional turmoil. After Christina informed Ramsay, although he was upset by Chris's decision, he allowed him to leave to seek help, as the latter's mental health was more important.  This made Chris the tenth person to withdraw from the competition, and the first to do so since his teammate, Bret, in season 14. Ramsay did not issue a statement on Chris's departure, but his hung jacket and already burnt picture could be seen next to T and Scotley's when they were later eliminated.\n\n'''Service''': Sitting at the chef's tables were [[Kelsea Ballerini]] for the red team and [[Cornelius Smith Jr.]] for the blue team. Also attending the service was [[Titus Welliver]]. Despite being shorthanded five to seven, the men had a near perfect service, with Ramsay in particular praising Jose and Trev on appetizers and meat respectively. The only problems were Motto briefly forgetting entree orders until Ramsay got him back on track, and some of Scotley's fish being improperly scored, which he attempted to blame Trev for. On the other side, Mia turned in a strong performance on appetizers. However the women completely stalled on entrees when Kanae's branzino for the firefighter six top fell apart, forcing them to refire the table, only for Kanae to serve the branzino raw. Their service went further south when T and Heather's filets came out raw and overcooked repeatedly. Eventually, T stopped communicating with Heather, feeling that the latter wasn't doing her job properly, only to bring up another raw steak on the very next ticket. This drove Ramsay past the breaking point, and he proceeded to kick the women out of the kitchen and task them with naming two nominees for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': The women considered Kanae, but ultimately nominated T and Heather, disappointing Ramsay as both of them were runner-ups in their previous seasons. T was eliminated for her poor performance on meat and refusal to communicate with Heather during service, but before leaving Ramsay told T that while she was a very talented chef, he couldn't look past the fact that all the other contestants were performing better than her.\n\n'''Ramsay's Comment''': \"As a former runner-up, I expected T to come back full of swagger and skill. Sadly, she came back with double the swagger, but only a fraction of the skill.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 273\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Last Chef Standing\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|11|16}}\n| Viewers         = 2.81<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-nov-16-2018/|title='Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' adjusts up: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 19, 2018|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = \n'''Team Challenge''': To test the teams' communication and teamwork skills, Ramsay gave them 40 minutes to cook five entrees from the menu (spaghetti and meatballs, veal scallopini piccata, crispy fried chicken, shrimp and grits, and cioppino). Because the blue team had an extra member, Gizzy volunteered to sit out. Every 8 minutes, Ramsay asked both teams to kick out one member at a time, until only Motto and Ariel were left in their respective kitchens; with 90 seconds to go, Ramsay allowed the chefs back into their kitchens for plating. The women won the challenge 4-3 as Trev forgot to plate the fish for the men's cioppino, reminiscent of a similar error he made during season 8's Taste It Now Make It challenge.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women went go-karting, while the men were forced to take in a delivery of corn and peas, and shuck them for service. During the punishment, Trev suffered a mild allergic reaction and Sous Chef Christina sent him to see a medic, but Scotley was unsympathetic due to Trev already costing them the challenge, even mocking the former by calling him a \"baby girl\".\n\n'''Cook For Your Life Challenge''': For the second season in a row, the Cook For Your Life Challenge took the place of a normal dinner service. This time, Ramsay put on the block the first three chefs from each team to leave the kitchen during the previous challenge. These were Bret, Jose, and Scotley from the red team, and Gizzy, Roe, and Heather from the blue team. The six chefs were then tasked in creating their own entree dishes in 45 minutes.\n\n'''Elimination''': Both Bret's frutti di mare pasta and Heather's coconut curry poached lobster tail beat out Roe's grilled swordfish, but Roe was able to beat out Gizzy's rustic grilled bass. Jose's pan seared salmon and chorizo hash also beat out Gizzy's dish, leaving her to go against Scotley, who had taken over her position in Atlanta. In the end, Scotley's ahi tuna with red lentils won out, and Gizzy was eliminated for leaving the scales on the bass. Before leaving, Ramsay told Gizzy that while she came into the competition strong, she soon lost her confidence later on (as evidenced by sitting out of the challenge and the lack of creativity and conviction in her dish), but urged her not to give up on her dreams.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"I had such high hopes for Gizzy from day one, but if she truly can't believe in herself, then I can't believe in her either.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 274\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = One Hell of a Party\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|12|7}}\n| Viewers         = 2.68<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-dec-7-2018/|title='Hell's Kitchen' adjusts down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=December 10, 2018|accessdate=December 10, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Trev expressed disappointment that Scotley was not eliminated, while Mia takes exception to Bret cussing and calling her \"sweetheart\".\n\n'''Team Challenge''': After showing pictures of the chefs (along with the staff and Ramsay himself) in their teenage years, Ramsay announced for that night's service, he was hosting his youngest daughter [[Matilda Ramsay|Tilly]]'s Sweet 16th birthday party. Both teams had to create a tasting menu for the party, consisting of two appetizers, two meat entrees, and one vegetarian entree, with one point being awarded for each dish that Tilly decides to put on the menu. During the challenge, Tilly asked two things of her dad: personal sized four layer cakes for all the guests, and to control his swearing during dinner service. Motto's confetti tuna and Kanae's Asian kebabs scored over Roe's and Scotley's scallops (due to being served with ricotta cheese and being raw, respectively) on appetizers. Tilly also picks Mia's vegetarian entree over Trev's because she loves mushrooms, as well as Jose's fish and chips and Heather's filet mignon. The women won the challenge 4-2 after Tilly picks Ariel's grilled chicken over Bret's baked ziti, which she found to be too rich.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women spent the day at a Malibu mansion with a drive-by from an artisan ice cream truck, much to Mia's delight, while the men had to make folding paper decorations along with the four layered cakes Tilly asked for, and also set up a mobile photo booth for the party guests. During the punishment, Bret suffered from rapid heartbeat, requiring medical attention. However, he refused to go to the hospital for further testing after his symptoms subsided, not wanting a repeat of season 14 when health issues sent him home early.\n\n'''Dinner service''': [[Thomas Barbusca]] was at tonight's service. The men had a near perfect service for the second time in a row, thanks to strong performances from Scotley on appetizers, Jose on meat, and Motto on fish. Bret burned sweet potato fries and Trev put too much garlic in spinach after ignoring Scotley's warning, but both of them managed to quickly recover. On the other side, the women went through appetizers fine, save for Kanae requiring Heather's help after poorly slicing ahi tuna, but fell apart on entrees. Roe undercooked steak twice, earning the entire team a trip to the pantry. Mia's first attempt at fish didn't have enough batter, and the refire was raw. The last straw for Ramsay was Ariel sending up a raw halibut for Tilly's table. Ariel protested that she had a properly cooked one she meant to send, but the livid Ramsay would have none of it. The women were promptly kicked out of the kitchen as the three male rookies (Scotley, Motto, and Jose) completed their remaining tables for them.\n\n'''Elimination''': The women nominated Roe and Mia for elimination, despite Roe pushing for Ariel to go up for getting the team kicked out. During her plea, Mia falsely accused Kanae of not properly setting up the fish station. Nevertheless, Roe was eliminated for her poor performance on the meat station, which was ironically her strongest station when she was on season 13.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \u201cLast time she was here, Roe was a tour de force on the meat station. But tonight her performance left me as cold as a raw New York strip.\u201d\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 275\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = What Happens in Vegas\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2018|12|14}}\n| Viewers         = 2.66<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-dec-14-2018/|title=\u2018Fresh Off the Boat\u2019 adjusts down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=December 17, 2018|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Mia and Kanae get into an argument in the dorms over the former throwing the latter under the bus during the previous elimination, as Ariel and Heather break it up.\n\n'''Team Challenge''': The chefs were introduced to the Chinese food challenge with a dragon dance performance outside. Ramsay asked selected contestants to pick an opponent to cook against, and the opponent would pick the protein (spot prawns, black cod, pork tenderloin, duck breast, chicken breast) to cook with. Scotley was the extra member on the red team not picked, so he was assigned chicken breast, and the blue team had to select one of their members to cook the extra chicken dish, which turned out to be Kanae. Ramsay brought in ''Top Chef'' contestant Shirley Chung as a guest judge. Mia scored over Trev on pork tenderloin, Bret scored over Heather on cod, Scotley scored over Kanae on chicken breast, and Ariel scored over Motto on duck breast to tie the score at 2. Kanae then beat Jose on prawns to give the women their third consecutive challenge win.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women flew to Las Vegas with Christina for the night, staying in a private villa in the Nobu hotel, while the men had to make fortune cookies from scratch. Scotley did very little during the punishment, even taking a break to make burgers for a snack and then boiling some of the eggs earmarked for the fortune cookies. This angered Trev, who voiced his concerns to Heather in the dorms, and annoyed his teammates during prep the next day by constantly ordering them around.\n\n'''Dinner service''': Guests in attendance included Olympic medalists [[David Plummer (swimmer)|David Plummer]] and [[Allison Schmitt]], and [[Los Angeles Kings]] players [[Tanner Pearson]] and [[Tyler Toffoli]], as well as a ten-top occupied by Beacher\u2019s Madhouse performers that both teams had to serve at the same time. Other than Kanae dropping two scallops on the first table of appetizers and not understanding Ramsay's command \u201cOut in one\u201d, the women had a near flawless performance thanks to Ariel on meat, serving their half of the ten-top well before the men did. The men, on the other hand, struggled all night due to their lack of cohesion, with Trev and Jose in particular having trouble working together on the fish station. Jose micromanaged Trev's work on their station and attempted to take over after Trev sent raw scallops, but he was scolded for sending up the scallops in a pan rather than a tray. However, Trev managed to rebound and successfully cook the scallops. Things did not get better on entrees. Trev severely burned salmon, and Jose's refire attempt fell apart, leading Ramsay to furiously question who was running the section. After Ariel served perfect lamb chops, Ramsay used them to show the men how meat was supposed to be cooked. Scotley tore the pastry on a Wellington while slicing it, so Ramsay asked Bret to show Scotley how to slice them. His next attempt was raw, so Ramsay compared them to Ariel\u2019s Wellingtons to make a further example. After the women finished service, Ramsay brought them into the red kitchen to help the men, who were kicked out and asked for two nominees after Jose served raw salmon. The women served nearly two-thirds of the red tables in addition to all their own.\n\n'''Elimination''': Ramsay angrily demanded an explanation of the men\u2019s terrible service, which Jose blamed on a \u201cbad vibe\u201d. Trev and Scotley then got into a massive argument about each other\u2019s behavior during punishment, which Jose pointed to as evidence of his assertion. Bret then announced that the team had nominated Scotley and Trev, while seriously considering Jose as well. Ramsay was frustrated, but called down the three nominees. Ramsay was disappointed in Trev for being accused by Scotley of walking around with a clipboard but sent him back in line after hearing his plea. Despite Jose being the worst performer of the night, Scotley was eliminated for declining performances after a strong start.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"I really hoped that Scotley would be the Big Bad Wolf at my restaurant in Las Vegas.

As one chef from each team tasted, their teammates were seated on a stool and would have spaghetti, marinara sauce, and Parmesan cheese dumped on them respectively should the taster get multiple incorrect answers. Trev failed to score any points, resulting in Jose getting all three ingredients dumped on him, while Heather got two, with Kanae getting blasted with only spaghetti. Motto scored an impressive three, but Mia continued her hot streak in challenges with a perfect four, becoming the fourth contestant in Hell's Kitchen to achieve such a feat. Ariel scored three over Bret's two, resulting in Motto getting blasted with spaghetti. On the final round, while both Jose and Kanae identified coffee, the women won the challenge 10-6 as it was now impossible for the men to catch up.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women went to Southern California\u2019s Premiere Korean Spa for a day of pampering while the men had to clean up the mess in the dining room, polish all the silverware for the private dinner service, and make gelato by hand. Trev suffered a crisis of confidence as a result of costing his team the challenge, believing he couldn't win without showing he had a decent palate, but was calmed down and encouraged by Heather in the dorms. During the punishment, he suffered a lot of merciless teasing and mocking from his teammates after breaking the ice cream churner, but knew he had to bounce back.\n\n'''Dinner service''': For one night only, Hell's Kitchen was closed for a charity night service. The men cooked for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], whose table featured Sabrina Soto, [[Kevin Zegers]] and [[Parker Young]]. The women cooked for [[Waterkeeper Alliance]], whose table featured [[Camryn Manheim]], her son [[Milo Manheim|Milo]], [[Dylan Bruno]], and [[Chad Lowe]]. The menu that night featured a five-course Italian meal, with each chef in charge of a course. On the scallops course, Mia led effectively although sometimes too quietly for Ramsay's liking. Motto was derailed by Trev serving scallops seared on only one side, and the entire team plating slowly. After the course was served, Ramsay discovered an entire tray of wasted scallops, prompting Trev and Bret arguing over who was responsible. Both Ariel and Bret led the branzino course with only minor problems; Kanae took the foil off the tray of fish, nearly letting it get cold, while some of Jose's salad was bruised. Trev led the carbonara course vocally and effectively, with Ramsay calling it the best executed course so far, but Kanae was slowed by Heather plating inconsistent amounts of pasta on each of their plates, forcing the team to restart plating. On the veal saltimbocca course, while Heather had no problems, Jose struggled to give her and Ramsay accurate timings and failed to check the veal chops, which led to seven of them, including Soto's, being returned for being raw. Infuriated and embarrassed, Ramsay cooked the refires himself as both teams got desserts out. The men were named clear losers and asked for two nominees. \n\n'''Elimination''': Trev announced that the nominees were Jose and, much to Ramsay's shock, himself. Trev's teammates all wanted him gone, on the grounds that he constantly sucked up to Ramsay and denied responsibility for the burnt scallops and raw veal. On the other hand, Trev countered that Bret and Motto also had a role in cooking the scallops and veal, respectively. Ramsay ultimately eliminated Jose, much to everyone else's chagrin, for his poor leadership on his course and allowing the raw veal to leave the kitchen without checking them first, but gave him encouragement.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"On a night when it should have been Hell\u2019s Kitchen giving back to some amazing charities, it was charities that ended up giving back Jose\u2019s raw veal.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 277\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Devilish Desserts\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|01|11}}\n| Viewers         = 2.92<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-jan-11-2019/|title='MacGyver' adjusts down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 14, 2019|accessdate=January 14, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = \n'''Team Challenge''': The challenge was a three-on-three showdown to see which team could make the better lineup of desserts to impress Ramsay and restaurateur Valerie Gordon, each of whom would each give each dessert between one and five points.  The blue team had an extra dish, and Heather's unappetizing-looking bread pudding was left out of the lineup. Kanae's deconstructed tiramisu scored only three points, as it had a cherry glaze that Valerie compared to cough syrup. Motto gave the red team an early lead with his s'mores-inspired bread pudding, scoring seven points. Mia's deconstructed apple and mascarpone tart (which was only deconstructed because she had to improvise when her actual tart kept crumbling on her) was overpowered by ginger and scored four. Bret's arancini balls only scored the minimum two because they were undercooked to a degree that Valerie described as ''al dente'', opening the door for the blue team.  Ariel took advantage with her Thai lime and beet tart, scoring an impressive seven. This left Trev needing five points for the red team to tie, and six to win. However, his chocolate and avocado \"kisses,\" an attempt at a healthy dessert, tasted awful and also scored the minimum two points. Thus, the blue team won the challenge 14-11.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women had lunch at the Joey Woodland Hills restaurant with sous chef Jocky, and then went on a $2,000 shopping spree ($500 per team member) to high-end culinary store [[Sur La Table]]. Heather was in a poor mood almost the entire time due to her dessert being left out of the challenge, even though her team still managed to win without it.  Meanwhile, the men had to break down 600 pounds of ice by hand into ice cubes for cocktails. Bret and Motto being so annoyed by Trev's lack of cooperation in carrying out the task (even though Trev had insisted on doing his part of the task on his own), and mocked Trev both to his face and behind his back. Before service, Trev expressed his concerns to sous chef Christina about earning Bret and Motto's respect, and asked if it would be possible to discuss opportunities for advancement after the competition.\n\n'''Dinner service''': The VIP guests were [[Randall Park]] at the blue chef's table and [[Malcolm Smith (American football)|Malcolm Smith]] at the red. Both teams got through appetizers with no trouble, except for Mia being unable to taste the risotto due to a shellfish allergy; Ramsay suggested that Mia cook the carbonara and Ariel take the risotto instead. On entr\u00e9es, Heather overcooked a New York strip steak, and Ramsay stepped in after Kanae served raw salmon for the chef's table, but the women finished no other issues. The men, on the other hand, were plagued by miscommunication and lack of cohesion all night. Bret and Motto failed to answer when Trev asked for a time on fish and garnish, causing Trev to serve a raw Wellington. On the next ticket, Trev forgot to put the herb crust on a lamb chop (which he claimed to never have cooked before), but luckily, Motto was able to inform Trev before Ramsay saw it. However, Trev proceeded to overcook one of the two lamb chops, while Bret cooked halibut in a dirty pan. After Bret served raw salmon to Smith's five-month-pregnant wife and Trev's Wellington for Smith fell apart, an irate and embarrassed Ramsay kicked the men out for the fourth time this season.\n\n'''Elimination''': Ramsay asked the men for one nominee, but Bret and Trev both blamed each other for the service's failure, so Ramsay called both of them down. To the relief of Bret and Motto, Trev was finally eliminated for his third consecutive nomination (and fourth overall), worsening performances, refusal to take responsibility for his mistakes, and losing the respect of his teammates. Nonetheless, Ramsay praised him for his passion and dedication and wished him luck in his culinary career. After Trev left, Ramsay warned Bret to step up his game, and asked the women for a volunteer to move to the red team the next day in order to even the numbers.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Trevor is one of the most passionate chefs I've ever had in Hell's Kitchen.

This makes Mia the third person in the show's history to switch back to their original team, after Autumn from season seven and Trev from season eight. Immediately afterwards, however, Ramsay announced that the chefs would be competing in a series of challenges to win a black jacket, and the lone chef who did not win one would be sent home.\n\n'''Black Jackets Challenge 1''': For their first challenge, each chef had to punch a hole to collect their ingredients: protein, two vegetables, starch, and a wildcard. They then had 45 minutes to cook their dishes using the ingredients. Motto, Bret, Ariel, and Mia all got good reviews, while Kanae's dish was praised for its flavors but criticized for raw green beans. Heather's dish received the worst review, as she didn't let her duck (which she had never cooked before) rest long enough, and her potato puree came out gummy because it was put in a Vitamix blender. In the end, Ariel's pan seared scallops and Mia's filet mignon were deemed the best of the six and won the first two black jackets; this makes Ariel the sixth person to earn a black jacket twice. The two were rewarded by spending their day at the Black Jackets Lounge. They also got to watch live feeds of the ongoing challenges, but the feed would cut out as Ramsay was about to announce the results.\n\n'''Black Jackets Challenge 2''': For their second challenge, the remaining four chefs had to spin a wheel to determine the four ingredients they would all need to use, which were quail, eggplant, baby leeks, and cauliflower. Heather spun the quail, which distressed her due to her inexperience with duck and quail. They then had to cook their own dish using those ingredients in 45 minutes. Bret and Motto had the two best dishes, as Heather left a lemon wedge in her quail and also removed the wings and legs, while Kanae's cauliflower puree was of poor consistency. Bret and Motto won their black jackets, and joined Ariel and Mia at the Black Jackets Lounge, leaving Heather and Kanae to compete in the final challenge.\n\n'''Black Jackets Challenge 3''': For the final challenge, Heather and Kanae had 45 minutes to make their own surf and turf dish. Heather burned her hand late in the challenge but managed to finish, presenting a traditional filet mignon and lobster tail with broccoli rabe and mashed potatoes, while Kanae made an Asian inspired pork chop and prawns with coconut cilantro rice.\n\n'''Elimination''': After tasting both their dishes, Ramsay gave Heather the final black jacket, much to the disappointment of the other chefs, who felt that she had played it too safe in her dish.  (Ironically, Heather had received the ''first'' black jacket in season 16, the first season to feature the black jacket challenge, rather than the ''last'' one.)  Therefore, despite being more ambitious and taking more risks with her dish, Kanae was eliminated from the competition for underseasoning her rice and making her prawns too sweet. Before Kanae left, Ramsay said that she would have a bright future in the culinary industry, hoping that one day she would become an Executive Chef. Ramsay gave no comment on Kanae's elimination, and she did not receive the coat hanging and portrait burning sequence.\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 279\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = An Episode of Firsts\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|01|25}}\n| Viewers         = 2.66<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-jan-25-2019/|title='Dynasty' adjusts down: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=January 28, 2019|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = As the final five celebrated in the Black Jacket Lounge, Bret revealed that having earned a black jacket meant a lot to him as he fell victim to his circumstances when he was younger, nearly facing a 30-year prison sentence.\n\n'''Individual Challenge''': The next day, the final five received breakfast from the Sous Chefs in the form of Ramsay's eggs Benedict, which Ariel and Mia took extra time to analyze. Their premonitions proved correct when Ramsay announced the Taste It Now Make It Challenge, and tasked the five to recreate the dish. Both Bret and Heather were disqualified for serving broken Hollandaise sauce. Motto, who elected not to taste Ramsay's sample plate, was also eliminated for being the only person to identify prosciutto but not Canadian bacon. Ariel and Mia each got one component of the hollandaise sauce correct (paprika and shallots, respectively), so Ramsay declared both of them winners.\n\n'''Reward/Punishment''': Ariel and Mia went with the sous chefs on an indoor skydiving experience, along with having lunch at Sweet Butter, while the remaining chefs had to clean the dorms.\n\n'''Dinner service''': [[Kelli Berglund]] and [[Drew Van Acker]] were in attendance in addition to [[Los Angeles Rams]] players [[Rodger Saffold]], [[Tyler Higbee]], and [[Jared Goff]]. The chefs struggled with communication and timing all night. Ariel put in a strong performance on appetizers, but Heather fell behind on the fish station, requiring Motto's help, and struggled to communicate to Ariel and Motto when the scallops would be ready. Because of this, Motto brought the scallops up to the pass two minutes before Ariel's risotto was ready, but after that, appetizers ran smoothly. On entrees, Bret served a raw New York strip and Ramsay scolded him for not communicating with Motto. Motto managed to get the refire accepted, but the order was slightly delayed due to Bret sending up the sauce late. Mia froze on garnish and did not respond when Bret asked for a time, while Heather stalled the kitchen on the Rams' table when the salmon skin broke off, requiring Motto to help her out again. After a communication breakdown caused Motto to get confused over how many fish were on order, Ramsay got the chefs back on track, and dinner service continued with no other problems. Despite completing service, Ramsay was not happy as they did not maintain their strong start, and tasked the final five to nominate two people for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': Heather and Mia were nominated, even though the latter argued for Bret, for having two steaks sent back. Ramsay polled the other three on who should leave; Motto and Ariel voted for Heather while Bret voted for Mia. Ramsay agreed and eliminated Heather for her worsening performances, making excuses for her mistakes, and not showing the same strength she had back in Season 16. Heather was the last of the former runners-up to be eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Too many times, Heather blamed her mistakes on having a bad day.  I'm not looking for apologies, I'm looking for an executive chef.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 280\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n| Title           = What's Your Motto?\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|02|01}}\n| Viewers         = 3.08<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-feb-1-2019/|title='Hell's Kitchen' adjusts up: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=February 4, 2019|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Shortly before midnight, Ramsay called everyone down and introduced them to Dan Drake, founder of pancake catering company Dancakes, who used pancakes to draw portraits of the four contestants as well as Ramsay. Ramsay announced the challenge, which was to create an innovative dish to be prepared and served tableside for many esteemed chefs visiting Hell's Kitchen.\n\n'''Individual Challenge:''' Guest judges included Ted Hopson, Geoff Baumberger, Michael Fiorelli, and Joel Miller. Ariel made duck meatball (albondigas) dumplings in pozole soup, while the others made shrimp dishes inspired by their heritages (Italian, Puerto Rican, Cajun). Motto nearly dropped his pan for one table while telling them a story about a cookoff he was in. For another table, he worked so slowly that he was nearly unable to serve them in time. Mia forgot the name of the shrimp that she was using in her dish when prompted, but charmed her guests with her Puerto Rican demeanor.  Bret unsettled several guests by describing his many seafood-based tattoos.  Ariel's story about her prior experience in season six and her drive to, at the very least, finish better this season, elicited sympathy from her guests. In the end, Ariel won the challenge and chose Bret to join her on the reward, out of veteran solidarity and sympathy of the many punishments he faced.\n\n'''Reward/punishment:''' While Ariel and Bret enjoyed a day at the beach, horseback riding, and a personal massage session in Malibu, Mia and Motto had to wash, peel, zest, and juice citrus fruits at the bar to make sangrias for the upcoming dinner service.\n\n'''Dinner service:''' Attending service were [[Amber Rose]], [[Neen Williams]], and [[Curt Menefee]]. The final four took turns running the pass, and had to be on the lookout for sabotages from Ramsay and the sous chefs. Bret caught Christina making a carbonara with spaghetti instead of tagliatelle and rejected Ariel's undercooked scallops, but ironically missed orzo pasta being used in place of rice for his own risotto. Ariel noticed Jocky giving her tuna tartare instead of beef tartare and sent back Bret's scrambled carbonara, but couldn't taste the difference between fennel and onion puree. Mia spotted monkfish wellington instead of lobster, but missed a ribeye in place of New York strip and Bret's garlicky risotto. However, she recovered to reject Ariel's bland mashed potatoes as well as another one of Bret's cracked carbonaras. Motto noticed that Marino had given him a ticket with salmon tartare, which wasn't on the menu, and attempted to send back a pork chop for being undercooked, only for Ramsay to inform him that it was actually a veal chop. Ramsay was relatively pleased by the service, and asked the four chefs to nominate someone whom they felt did not deserve to advance to the final.\n\n'''Motto's exit:''' Bret and Mia nominated each other, but Motto shocked everyone by nominating himself. Motto revealed his desire and obligation to take everything he had learned at Hell's Kitchen to upgrade the culinary landscape in his hometown of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], and announced his decision to Ramsay at the elimination ceremony. Ramsay was disappointed in this, but praised Motto's tenacity and sincerity, asked Motto to call him to discuss opportunities when he was finished, and allowed him to keep his jacket.  Motto did not get a jacket hanging and picture burning scene, and no statement was issued regarding his departure.\n\nRamsay then announced Ariel as the first finalist, but before it was revealed whether Bret or Mia would be the second, the episode ended on a cliffhanger.\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 281\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n| Title           = A Rollercoaster Ride\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|02|08}}\n| Viewers         = 3.17<ref name=\"18.15&18.16\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-feb-8-2019/|title='Blindspot' adjusts up: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=February 11, 2019|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Continuing from the previous episode, Ramsay named Mia as the second finalist and eliminated Bret, but praised him for his unmatched passion, reminded him how proud of him his parents would have been, and allowed him to keep his jacket. He then assigned Ariel to Sous Chef Christina and Mia to Sous Chef Jocky, who would help them prepare a tasting menu consisting of one cold and hot appetizer and one seafood, chicken, and beef entree.\n\nThe next morning, Ramsay brought in Ariel's and Mia's parents. He took the final two to brunch, where he announced that [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] had been closed for the day, and they would be able to ride the rides with their parents all afternoon including [[Viper (Six Flags Magic Mountain)|Viper]]. Ariel and Mia quickly realized that both of their menus were quite similar, due to their desires to incorporate their respective Latin heritages. That evening, Ramsay and his daughter Holly joined them and told them there was one more roller coaster to go on that had not yet been opened to the public: [[Full Throttle (roller coaster)|Full Throttle]]. He led Mia and Ariel to it, where they were greeted by a live audience.\n\n'''Challenge:''' Ariel and Mia were given 60 minutes to create their menus with the help of their sous chefs. Ramsay brought in various guest judges to rate the dishes on a scale from 1 to 10. Mia beat Ariel 9-8 on the cold appetizer and chicken entree, but Ariel did the same on the hot appetizer and seafood entree, which meant that chef Michael Cimarusti would break the tie on the steak entree. He gave Ariel 8 and Mia 9, which gave Mia the challenge win and the first choice of the returning chefs from the season to form a brigade for the final dinner service. Mia picked Roe, Trev, Jose, and Heather. Ariel picked Kanae, Bret, Motto, and was left with Scotley. The chefs and the sous chefs then all got on Full Throttle for one last ride before heading back to Hell's Kitchen.\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 18)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 282\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n| Title           = The Grand Finale\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|02|08}}\n| Viewers         = 3.17<ref name=\"18.15&18.16\"/>\n| ShortSummary    = In the season recap at the beginning of the episode, Chris, Kanae, and Motto each had their pictures burned.\n\n'''Pre-service:''' Ariel had no trouble getting her team to buy in to her menu, but Roe, Heather, and Trev had trouble pronouncing several of Mia's dishes' names and got annoyed with her micromanagement during prep. Heather in particular was not pleased to have to work for Mia. Ramsay liked Mia's menu, but asked Ariel to re-season every one of her dishes.\n\n'''Dinner service:''' The finalists' families plus [[Matt Barkley]], [[Jessie Graff]], and [[Yael Grobglas]] were in attendance for the last dinner service while [[Marcia Clark]] and [[JB Smoove]] sat at Ariel's and Mia's chef's tables respectively. Both Mia and Ariel got through appetizers smoothly. Mia had to remind Trev to salt his risotto, and Kanae needed Motto's help after burning dumplings, but they all recovered. On entrees, Roe undercooked pork and overcooked sea bass, the latter of which forced Mia to refire an entire table. In the red kitchen, Scotley nearly burned ribcap until Ariel reminded him to pay attention to his station. Bret bounced back after sending a cold steak, but when he served raw chicken twice for the Six Flags executive staff table, Ramsay yelled at him to wake up. Despite the minor hiccups, both teams finished service on a strong note.\n\n'''Winner''': As per Hell's Kitchen tradition, Mia and Ariel stood in front of two doors. Ariel's door opened, making her the eighteenth winner of Hell's Kitchen and the second winner in a row who was appearing on the show a second time. Mia took her defeat graciously. Having grown close to Mia through their positive competitive rivalry during the competition, Ariel promised to keep a job opening for Mia in Las Vegas if the opportunity arose, and hung her picture in the Hall of Fame. \n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Since the first time she was here, Ariel has grown tenfold as a chef. She is fiercely talented, extremely determined and a commanding leader. I could not be more pleased to have her as my executive chef of Hell\u2019s Kitchen in Las Vegas.\"\n| LineColor       = #A9BA9D\n}}}}</onlyinclude><!-- Please be careful not to delete this tag when adding episodes.

The term \"off-the-grid\" traditionally refers to not being connected to the [[electrical grid]], but can also include other utilities like water, gas, and sewer systems, and can scale from residential homes to small communities. Off-the-grid living allows for buildings and people to be self-sufficient, which is advantageous in isolated locations where normal utilities cannot reach and is attractive to those who want to reduce environmental impact and cost of living. Generally, an off-grid building must be able to supply energy and potable water for itself, as well as manage food, waste and wastewater.\n\n==Energy Solutions==\n[[File:CableFree Solar Battery Powered Radio Base Site installed in Greece .jpg|thumb|A CableFree Off-Grid Solar plus Battery Powered Radio Base Site installed in Greece]]\nEnergy for electrical power and heating can be generated on-site with [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[solar power|solar]] (particularly with [[photovoltaics]]), [[wind power|wind]], or [[micro hydro]].

This solves intermittency issues caused by the non-constant production of renewables and allows for variations in building loads. Common batteries include the lead-acid battery and lithium-ion battery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motherearthnews.com/renewable-energy/off-grid-battery-options-zm0z19jjzbut|title=Off-Grid Battery Options|last=Scheckel|first=Paul|website=Mother Earth News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==== Hybrid Energy Systems ====\nIn order to protect against intermittency issues and system failures, many off-grid communities create hybrid energy systems. These combine traditional renewables like solar PV, and wind, with more constant sources of power like micro-hydro or even diesel generators. Tfective than extending grids to isolated communities.\n\n==Water & sanitation==\nWater is a crucial consideration in the off-grid environment, which must be collected, used, and disposed of efficiently to make use of the environment. There are many ways to supply water for indoor domestic use, which vary based on local access and preference.\n\n=== ''Sources'' ===\n\n==== Local water bodies ====\nNearby streams, ponds, rivers, and lakes are easy access points for fresh water. Oceans can also be considered with proper desalination.\n\n==== Wells and springs ====\nThis traditional method involves digging down to where water is present and abundant underground, usually to the [[water table]] or to an aquifer, and bringing it up for use, or collecting at springs where underground water comes to the surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motherearthnews.com/nature-and-environment/off-grid-water-systems-zmaz00jjzgoe|title=Off-Grid Water Systems - Nature and Environment|last=Vivian|first=John|website=Mother Earth News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Systems for bringing underground water to buildings include wind and solar driven pumps or hand pumps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://morningchores.com/off-grid-water-systems/|title=Off-Grid Water Systems: 8 Viable Solutions to Bring Water to Your Homestead|date=2016-10-10|website=MorningChores|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Well water should be tested on a regular basis and when changes in the water\u2019s taste, odor, or appearance occur to ensure its quality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lhsfna.org/index.cfm/lifelines/july-2016/how-safe-is-your-well-water/|title=How Safe Is Your Well Water? - LHSFNA|website=www.lhsfna.org|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==== Rain catchments ====\nThis system relies on the weather to provide water.

Coastal communities may benefit by getting water from the ocean through the use of desalination plants that remove salt.\n\n==== Water Softening ====\nThe presence of certain minerals in water creates hard water which can clogs pipes over time, interfere with soap and detergents, and can leave scum on glasses and dishes. [[Water softening]] systems introduce sodium and potassium ions which make the minerals hard minerals precipitate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/hardness.pdf|title=Hardness in Drinking Water|last=|first=|date=2011|website=World Health Organization|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Usage and Sanitation'' ===\nFor off-grid buildings, efficient use of water is needed to prevent water supplies from running out. While this is ultimately habit-dependent, measures involve low-flow fixtures for faucets, shower heads, and toilets which decreases the flow rate of faucets or the volume of water per flush to reduce total water used. Water can be eliminated in toilets through the uses of a [[Composting toilet|composting]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accidentalhippies.com/2017/07/25/off-grid-waste-septic/|title=All About Off Grid Wastewater: Options, Septic, Code, and Advice|date=2017-07-25|website=Accidental Hippies|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Automatic leak detectors and tap closures can reduce amounts of wasted water. Greywater recycling can further save on water by reusing water from faucets, showers, dishwashers, and clothes washers. This is done through storing and treating the greywater, which can then be reused as a non-potable water source.\n\nIf an off-grid home is not connected to a sewer system, a [[wastewater]] system must also be included. On-site wastewater management is usually done through storage and leaching. This involves storing [[greywater]] and blackwater in a septic tank or aeration tank to be treated, which is connected to a leaching field that slowly allows the water to percolate out into the ground. While more and expensive waste water treatment options are also available, this is a common reliable means to dispose of waste water without polluting the environment,\n\n== Environmental impact and sustainability ==\nBecause off-grid buildings and communities mainly rely on upon renewable energy, off-grid living is generally good for the environment with little negative impact. Hybrid energy systems also provide communities with a sustainable way to live without the dependence and cost of being connected to public infrastructure which can be unreliable in developing countries. Generally, isolated concerns of environmental impacts are the use diesel generators, which produce greenhouse gases, batteries, which use many resources to make and can be [[Hazardous waste|hazardous]], and pollution in natural environments from solid waste and wastewater. It is prudent to note that, while the concerns below address negative environmental impacts, going off-grid as a whole is a viable option to help reduce impacts on the environment when replacing grid-connected buildings that contribute global warming and climate change.\n\n===== Diesel generator concerns in Canadian off-grid communities =====\nCanada has about 175 aboriginal and northern off-grid communities, defined as \"a community that is neither connected to the North American electrical grid nor to the piped natural gas network; it is permanent or long-term (5 years or more), and the settlements have at least 10 permanent buildings.\"<ref name=\"DevelopmentCanada\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1314295992771/1314296121126|title=Off-Grid Communities|date=2012-05-01|website=Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|accessdate=2012-11-08}}\n</ref>\n[[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]] lists the following environmental concerns for these off-grid communities:\n\n* Burning large amounts of diesel produces substantial [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.  This contributes to climate change which negatively affects communities.\n* Fuel must be transported long distances by airplane, truck or barge, leading to a greater risk of fuel spills.\n* The transportation of fuel by trucks on winter roads impacts the environment negatively through high greenhouse gas emissions from the vehicles.\n* Fuel spills may take place while the fuel is being transported and stored, posing environmental risks.  \n* Fuel tank leaks contaminate soil and groundwater.\n* Generators can be [[Noise pollution|noisy and disruptive]], especially in quiet, remote communities.\n* Emissions from diesel generators could contribute to health problems in community members.<ref name=\"DevelopmentCanada\" />\n\nThe environmental impacts of the systems used in off-grid buildings must also be considered due to [[embodied energy]], [[Embodied carbon emissions|embodied carbon]], choice and source of materials, which can contribute to world issues such as climate change, air, water, and soil pollution, resource depletion and more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aberilla|first=Jhud Mikhail|last2=Gallego-Schmid|first2=Alejandro|last3=Stamford|first3=Laurence|last4=Azapagic|first4=Adisa|date=January 2020|title=Design and environmental sustainability assessment of small-scale off-grid energy systems for remote rural communities|journal=Applied Energy|volume=258|pages=114004|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114004|issn=0306-2619|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===== [[Life-cycle assessment]] of off-grid electric systems =====\n\n* The lowest impacts of a hybrid micro-grid system are with a solar PV, wind turbine, and lead-acid battery\n* Highest impacts are associated a wind turbine, diesel generator, lead-acid battery system\n* Hybridization is found to reduce environmental impacts by 40% for off-grid electricity\n* Batteries are a big contributor to mineral resource depletion\n* Solar PV has lower global climate change effects than wind turbines, but wind turbines have a lower land area use.\n\n=== ''Sustainable Communities'' ===\nThe concept of a sustainable off-grid [[community]] must take into consideration the basic needs of all who live in the [[community]]. To become truly [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]], the [[community]] would need to provide all of its own [[Electric power|electrical power]], food, shelter and [[water]]. Using [[renewable energy]], an on-site [[water]] source, [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[vertical farming]] techniques is paramount in taking a community off the grid. A recent concept design by Eric Wichman shows a multi-family community, which combines all of these technologies into one [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]] neighborhood. To grow the community you simply add neighborhoods using the same model as the first. A self-sustained community reduces its impact on the environment by controlling its [[waste]] and [[carbon footprint]].\n\n===''Economic consideration''===\nIn situations where [[grid parity]] has been reached, it becomes cheaper to generate one's own electricity rather than purchasing it from the grid. This depends on equipment costs, the availability of renewable energy sources, and the cost of a grid connection. For example, in certain remote areas a grid connection would be prohibitively expensive, resulting in grid parity being reached immediately.\n\nIt is often done to residential buildings only occasionally occupied, such as vacation cabins, to avoid high initial costs of traditional utility connections. Other people choose to live in houses where the cost of outside utilities is prohibitive, or such a distance away as to be impractical. In his book ''How to live off-grid'' [[Nick Rosen]] lists seven reasons for going off-grid. The top two are saving money, and reducing the carbon footprint. Others include [[Survivalism|survivalists]], preparing for the collapse of the [[peak oil|oil economy]] and bringing life back to the countryside.<ref name=\"Penguin\" />\n\n====Off-grid power for marginalized communities====\nReliable centralized electricity systems have provided supply constancy which has bolstered societies and their economies.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bouffard|first=Fran\u00e7ois|last2=Kirschen|first2=Daniel S.|date=2008|title=Centralised and distributed electricity systems|journal=Energy Policy|language=en|volume=36|issue=12|pages=4504\u20134508|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.09.060}}</ref> Electricity provides opportunities for improved productivity, learning, and hygienic end-uses in the home, such as cooking without the use of polluting biomass fuel sources, yet as of 2016, 20 percent of people world wide lived without it.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Ben|last2=Cloke|first2=Jon|last3=Brown|first3=Ed|date=2016|title=Communities of energy: Communities of energy|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/18017/|journal=Economic Anthropology|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=133\u2013144|doi=10.1002/sea2.12050}}</ref> Bridging the gap from the current under-provision of grid electricity to universal access has been projected to require US$17 trillion and 30 years even on a rigorous timetable.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=International Energy and Poverty|last=Guruswamy|first=Lakshman|date=2015-08-20|isbn=9781315762203|doi=10.4324/9781315762203}}</ref> Researchers have argued that a lack of centralized energy infrastructure can result in low resilience to damage to productivity and property from changing climates and severe weather.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Alstone|first=Peter|last2=Gershenson|first2=Dimitry|last3=Kammen|first3=Daniel M.|date=2015|title=Decentralized energy systems for clean electricity access|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=305\u2013314|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..305A|doi=10.1038/nclimate2512|issn=1758-678X}}</ref> In addition, the advantages of central power generation and distribution are receding in the face of climatic degradation due to fossil fuel powered generation, vulnerabilities to extreme weather events and electronic manipulation, and increasingly complex design and regulatory processes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDecentralized, off-grid energy systems can constitute a sustainable interim alternative to extending national grids to rural customers.<ref name=\":3\" /> Those using limited off-grid power as a stepping stool to eventual grid access can accumulate energy efficient knowledge, behavior, and products that confer added resiliency while grid networks increase in reliability<ref name=\":3\" /> and [[carbon neutrality]].

On-site wastewater management is usually done through storage and leaching. This involves storing [[greywater]] and blackwater in a septic tank or aeration tank to be treated, which is connected to a leaching field that slowly allows the water to percolate out into the ground. While more and expensive waste water treatment options are also available, this is a common reliable means to dispose of waste water without polluting the environment,\n\n== Environmental impact and sustainability ==\nBecause off-grid buildings and communities mainly rely on upon renewable energy, off-grid living is generally good for the environment with little negative impact. Hybrid energy systems also provide communities with a sustainable way to live without the dependence and cost of being connected to public infrastructure which can be unreliable in developing countries. Generally, isolated concerns of environmental impacts are the use diesel generators, which produce greenhouse gases, batteries, which use many resources to make and can be [[Hazardous waste|hazardous]], and pollution in natural environments from solid waste and wastewater. It is prudent to note that, while the concerns below address negative environmental impacts, going off-grid as a whole is a viable option to help reduce impacts on the environment when replacing grid-connected buildings that contribute global warming and climate change.\n\n===== Diesel generator concerns in Canadian off-grid communities =====\nCanada has about 175 aboriginal and northern off-grid communities, defined as \"a community that is neither connected to the North American electrical grid nor to the piped natural gas network; it is permanent or long-term (5 years or more), and the settlements have at least 10 permanent buildings.\"<ref name=\"DevelopmentCanada\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1314295992771/1314296121126|title=Off-Grid Communities|date=2012-05-01|website=Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|accessdate=2012-11-08}}\n</ref>\n[[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]] lists the following environmental concerns for these off-grid communities:\n\n* Burning large amounts of diesel produces substantial [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.  This contributes to climate change which negatively affects communities.\n* Fuel must be transported long distances by airplane, truck or barge, leading to a greater risk of fuel spills.\n* The transportation of fuel by trucks on winter roads impacts the environment negatively through high greenhouse gas emissions from the vehicles.\n* Fuel spills may take place while the fuel is being transported and stored, posing environmental risks.  \n* Fuel tank leaks contaminate soil and groundwater.\n* Generators can be [[Noise pollution|noisy and disruptive]], especially in quiet, remote communities.\n* Emissions from diesel generators could contribute to health problems in community members.<ref name=\"DevelopmentCanada\" />\n\nThe environmental impacts of the systems used in off-grid buildings must also be considered due to [[embodied energy]], [[Embodied carbon emissions|embodied carbon]], choice and source of materials, which can contribute to world issues such as climate change, air, water, and soil pollution, resource depletion and more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aberilla|first=Jhud Mikhail|last2=Gallego-Schmid|first2=Alejandro|last3=Stamford|first3=Laurence|last4=Azapagic|first4=Adisa|date=January 2020|title=Design and environmental sustainability assessment of small-scale off-grid energy systems for remote rural communities|journal=Applied Energy|volume=258|pages=114004|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114004|issn=0306-2619|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===== [[Life-cycle assessment]] of off-grid electric systems =====\n\n* The lowest impacts of a hybrid micro-grid system are with a solar PV, wind turbine, and lead-acid battery\n* Highest impacts are associated a wind turbine, diesel generator, lead-acid battery system\n* Hybridization is found to reduce environmental impacts by 40% for off-grid electricity\n* Batteries are a big contributor to mineral resource depletion\n* Solar PV has lower global climate change effects than wind turbines, but wind turbines have a lower land area use.\n\n=== ''Sustainable Communities'' ===\nThe concept of a sustainable off-grid [[community]] must take into consideration the basic needs of all who live in the [[community]]. To become truly [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]], the [[community]] would need to provide all of its own [[Electric power|electrical power]], food, shelter and [[water]]. Using [[renewable energy]], an on-site [[water]] source, [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[vertical farming]] techniques is paramount in taking a community off the grid. A recent concept design by Eric Wichman shows a multi-family community, which combines all of these technologies into one [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]] neighborhood. To grow the community you simply add neighborhoods using the same model as the first. A self-sustained community reduces its impact on the environment by controlling its [[waste]] and [[carbon footprint]].\n\n===''Economic consideration''===\nIn situations where [[grid parity]] has been reached, it becomes cheaper to generate one's own electricity rather than purchasing it from the grid. This depends on equipment costs, the availability of renewable energy sources, and the cost of a grid connection. For example, in certain remote areas a grid connection would be prohibitively expensive, resulting in grid parity being reached immediately.\n\nIt is often done to residential buildings only occasionally occupied, such as vacation cabins, to avoid high initial costs of traditional utility connections. Other people choose to live in houses where the cost of outside utilities is prohibitive, or such a distance away as to be impractical. In his book ''How to live off-grid'' [[Nick Rosen]] lists seven reasons for going off-grid. The top two are saving money, and reducing the carbon footprint. Others include [[Survivalism|survivalists]], preparing for the collapse of the [[peak oil|oil economy]] and bringing life back to the countryside.<ref name=\"Penguin\" />\n\n====Off-grid power for marginalized communities====\nReliable centralized electricity systems have provided supply constancy which has bolstered societies and their economies.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bouffard|first=Fran\u00e7ois|last2=Kirschen|first2=Daniel S.|date=2008|title=Centralised and distributed electricity systems|journal=Energy Policy|language=en|volume=36|issue=12|pages=4504\u20134508|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.09.060}}</ref> Electricity provides opportunities for improved productivity, learning, and hygienic end-uses in the home, such as cooking without the use of polluting biomass fuel sources, yet as of 2016, 20 percent of people world wide lived without it.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Ben|last2=Cloke|first2=Jon|last3=Brown|first3=Ed|date=2016|title=Communities of energy: Communities of energy|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/18017/|journal=Economic Anthropology|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=133\u2013144|doi=10.1002/sea2.12050}}</ref> Bridging the gap from the current under-provision of grid electricity to universal access has been projected to require US$17 trillion and 30 years even on a rigorous timetable.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=International Energy and Poverty|last=Guruswamy|first=Lakshman|date=2015-08-20|isbn=9781315762203|doi=10.4324/9781315762203}}</ref> Researchers have argued that a lack of centralized energy infrastructure can result in low resilience to damage to productivity and property from changing climates and severe weather.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Alstone|first=Peter|last2=Gershenson|first2=Dimitry|last3=Kammen|first3=Daniel M.|date=2015|title=Decentralized energy systems for clean electricity access|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=305\u2013314|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..305A|doi=10.1038/nclimate2512|issn=1758-678X}}</ref> In addition, the advantages of central power generation and distribution are receding in the face of climatic degradation due to fossil fuel powered generation, vulnerabilities to extreme weather events and electronic manipulation, and increasingly complex design and regulatory processes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDecentralized, off-grid energy systems can constitute a sustainable interim alternative to extending national grids to rural customers.<ref name=\":3\" /> Those using limited off-grid power as a stepping stool to eventual grid access can accumulate energy efficient knowledge, behavior, and products that confer added resiliency while grid networks increase in reliability<ref name=\":3\" /> and [[carbon neutrality]].

Ross won the World Series with the [[Boston Red Sox]] in [[2013 Boston Red Sox season|2013]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]] in [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|2016]].

The Auburn Tigers would advance to the College World Series, getting knocked out in the 2nd round by [[Stanford Cardinal baseball|Stanford]]. He transferred to the University of Florida after the 1997 season, and played one additional season of college baseball for the [[Florida Gators baseball]] team in 1998.  Ross is one of the few players to have played in the [[College World Series]] with two different colleges, first with the Tigers in [[1997 College World Series|1997]], and then the Gators in [[1998 College World Series|1998]].

Ross hit his 1st major league home run off Grace with two outs in the 9th inning, capping a 19-1 win. Ross's Dodger career was stalled, however, by the large number of catchers in the Dodger system.  [[Paul Lo Duca]] was the starting catcher through most of Ross's time in Los Angeles, and teammates like [[Brent Mayne]], [[Koyie Hill]], and [[Todd Hundley]] competed with him for playing time. Ross stayed with the team until 2004.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates / San Diego Padres===\nThe Dodgers sold Ross's contract to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] on March 30, 2005. After 40 games with the Pirates, he was traded to the [[San Diego Padres]] on July 28, 2005 for [[infielder]] [[J. J. Furmaniak]].

LaRue was the one most frequently cited, but no deal was made by the July 31 trade deadline. Ostensibly, Ross was the number-one catcher.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, LaRue was traded to the [[Kansas City Royals]] for a player to be named later. Ross's 2007 season started with 4 hits in 38 [[at-bat]]s with no home runs and 17 [[strikeout]]s. On April 21, 2007, his slump hit rock bottom when with runners on first and second base, he grounded into a rare 5\u20134\u20133 [[triple play]] against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].
