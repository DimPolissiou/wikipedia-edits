Attenborough is portrayed by [[Eric Idle]] as effusive and simpering. A portrayal similar to that seen in Monty Python can be seen in the early series of ''[[Spitting Image]]'', when Attenborough's caricature regularly appeared to thank others for an imaginary award.\n\nIn 2012 Attenborough was portrayed by [[Simon Callow]] in the [[BBC Four]] biopic ''The Best Possible Taste'', about [[Kenny Everett]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of oldest and youngest

Attenborough's first major credited role was provided in [[Brian Desmond Hurst]]'s ''[[The Hundred Pound Window]]'' (1944) playing Tommy Draper who helps rescue his accountant father who has taken a wrong turn in life. Attenborough's film career had begun in 1942, however, in an uncredited role as a sailor deserting his post under fire in the [[No\u00ebl Coward]]/[[David Lean]] production ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' (his name and character were omitted from the original release-print credits), a role that helped type-cast him for many years as a [[spiv]] in films like ''[[London Belongs to Me]]'' (1948), ''[[Morning Departure]]'' (1950) and his breakthrough role as [[Pinkie Brown]] in [[John Boulting]]'s film adaptation of [[Graham Greene]]'s novel ''[[Brighton Rock (1947 film)|Brighton Rock]]'' (1947), a role that he had previously played to great acclaim at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in 1942.\n\nIn 1949, exhibitors voted him the sixth most popular British actor at the box office.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2759831 |title=Bob Hope Takes Lead from Bing In Popularity. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] (ACT: 1926\u20131954) |location=ACT |date=31 December 1949 |access-date=27 April 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nEarly in his stage career, Attenborough starred in the [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[The Mousetrap]]'', which went on to become the world's longest running stage production.

Attenborough is portrayed by [[Eric Idle]] as effusive and simpering. A portrayal similar to that seen in Monty Python can be seen in the early series of ''[[Spitting Image]]'', when Attenborough's caricature regularly appeared to thank others for an imaginary award.\n\nIn 2012 Attenborough was portrayed by [[Simon Callow]] in the [[BBC Four]] biopic ''The Best Possible Taste'', about [[Kenny Everett]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of oldest and youngest

It is the seat of the [[List of bishops of Lund|Bishop of Lund]] and the main church of the [[Diocese of Lund]]. It was built as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the [[archiepiscopal see]] of all the [[Nordic countries]], dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.\n\nLund Cathedral has been called \"the most powerful representative of [[Romanesque architecture]] in the Nordic countries\". Its main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"[[Fin (troll)|The giant Finn and his wife]]\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658, the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1688. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes implemented during the 19th century were extensive; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and works of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. Lund was at the time part of Denmark. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over church policy in Denmark.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby, Lund Municipality|Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see overseeing all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The [[crypt]], the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Lund Dom Chor.JPG|thumb|right|The [[apse]] is the most well-preserved part of the original exterior]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a [[bishopric]] and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have prompted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates of the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars of the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin to be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} One of the main functions of the crypt appears to have been as a place where [[baptism]]s were conducted.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=4}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, for example in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe to Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was similar to the one seen today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were made to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, the need for  repairs was continuous for the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of [[Helgo Zettervall]]]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the structure in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while at the same time making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] was appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately managed to implement most of his ideas into the new restored cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862, Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades in effect rebuild the cathedral largely in line with the proposal from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] designs.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13\u201314}}<ref name=byggnaden>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/byggnaden/|title= En kyrka i st\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring|trans-title= A constantly changing church|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral.

In 1837, it was dismantled. It was restored at the initiative of architect {{ill|Theodor W\u00e5hlin|sv}} and the Danish clock-maker Julius Bertram Larsen and re-inaugurated in 1923. The upper part, which is original, is the clock, while the lower part, a reconstruction, is a calendar. Twice every day the two knights on the top clash their swords. The clock then plays the tune ''[[In dulci jubilo]]'' and a procession of figures parades across the face of the clock.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=125\u2013126}} Three astronomical clocks of similar design are preserved in Europe.

Two of the bronze columns are crowned by angels, and the third one by a statuette of Saint Lawrence, holding a gridiron, the symbol of his martyrdom. It probably dates from the middle of the 14th century, while the two angel-bearing columns may be somewhat later. Saint Lawrence's column is approximately {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall (and the saint {{convert|70|cm|inch}}), while the columns with angels are slightly smaller.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=114}} The three columns were probably made in [[L\u00fcbeck]] or [[Hamburg]].

The artist was [[Johannes Ganssog]] from [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] in present-day Germany. It is technically skillfully attached to one of the pillars of the nave, and it is entered through a stair cut inside the pillar. The building material is sandstone, black [[limestone]] and black and white [[marble]], and it is partially painted and [[gilding|gilded]].

The simple Romanesque [[sarcophagus]], which has an inscription in Latin and a depiction of the bishop, is located in the apse of the crypt. It dates from the middle of the 12th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=48}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=46}} The crypt also contains the much larger grave monument of the last archbishop, {{ill|Birger Gunnersen|sv}}, which is centrally placed in the crypt. It is of a kind which is not unusual in continental Europe but very unusual in the Nordic countries: a large stone sarcophagus decorated on all sides with sculptures in high relief and with a full-scale depiction of the bishop in full dress on the lid. It was made by Adam van D\u00fcren in 1512.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=94}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=48\u201349}} The cathedral's largest grave monument is that of bishop [[Hans Brostorp]], who died in 1497 and who during his lifetime inaugurated the [[University of Copenhagen]]. The monument is made of limestone from [[Gotland]] and decorated in low relief.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=47}}\n\nThe nave and the aisles contain several memorial plaques and [[epitaph]]s.

The oldest epitaph of the cathedral commemorates the owner of [[Krageholm Castle]] {{ill|Lave Brahe|sv}} (1500\u20131567) and his wife [[G\u00f6rvel Fadersdotter (Sparre)]] (1509 or 1517 \u2013 1605).{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Flora==\n[[File:Flickr - Sigfrid Lundberg - Wall-rue, Asplenium ruta-muraria.jpg|thumb|right|[[Asplenium ruta-muraria|Wall-rue]] growing on the [[apse]]]]\nSeveral surveys and descriptions of the [[flora]] of the cathedral, like the plants that grow on its walls, have been made. The first to describe the flora of the cathedral was [[Daniel Rolander]], one of the [[apostles of Linnaeus]], who made a list of the [[vascular plant]]s, [[moss]]es and [[lichen]] he found growing on the building in 1771.{{sfn|Johansson|1993|p=25}} It was rediscovered in the 20th century and published in 1931. [[Elias Magnus Fries]] also made observations about the flora of the cathedral during the first half of the 19th century. More systematic surveys of the flora of the building have been published in 1922 and in 1993 (the latter only encompassing lichen).{{sfn|Johansson|1993|p=25}} Of the species observed growing on the cathedral, the minute [[fern]] [[Asplenium ruta-muraria|wall-rue]] was mentioned as early as 1756 by {{ill|Anders Tidstr\u00f6m|sv}} and is perhaps the most conspicuous member of the cathedral flora.{{sfn|Gertz|1923|p=458}} When the lichen flora was surveyed in 1993, 15 species were discovered.

Its main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"[[Fin (troll)|The giant Finn and his wife]]\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658, the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1688. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes implemented during the 19th century were extensive; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and works of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. Lund was at the time part of Denmark. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over church policy in Denmark.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby, Lund Municipality|Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see overseeing all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The [[crypt]], the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Lund Dom Chor.JPG|thumb|right|The [[apse]] is the most well-preserved part of the original exterior]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a [[bishopric]] and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have prompted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates of the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars of the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin to be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} One of the main functions of the crypt appears to have been as a place where [[baptism]]s were conducted.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=4}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, for example in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe to Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was similar to the one seen today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were made to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, the need for  repairs was continuous for the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of [[Helgo Zettervall]]]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the structure in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while at the same time making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] was appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately managed to implement most of his ideas.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862, Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades in effect rebuild the cathedral largely in line with the proposal from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] designs.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13\u201314}}<ref name=byggnaden>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/byggnaden/|title= En kyrka i st\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring|trans-title= A constantly changing church|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral.

A relief in the south transept displaying the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] flanked by Saint Lawrence and Saint Canute is similar to the portal relief van D\u00fcren made a couple of years earlier at [[Glimmingehus]].{{sfn|Svanberg|1996|p=196\u2013197}}\n\n===Altarpiece===\nThe medieval main [[altarpiece]] was donated to the cathedral in 1398 by [[Ide Pedersdatter Falk]].<ref name=kor>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/hogkoret/|title= Gyllene mosaik och korstolar fr\u00e5n 1300-talet|trans-title= Golden mosaics and choir stalls from the 14th century|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref> The altarpiece is stylistically similar to a group of altarpieces from northern Germany. Its central panel depicts the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], surrounded by two rows of 40 saints, 26 of which are original. Twelve figures have been taken from other medieval altarpieces, while two of the added figures are from the 17th century. The altarpiece is {{convert|7.6|m|ft}} wide but is missing an original pair of wings.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=20\u201323}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=112\u2013113}}\n\n===Choir stalls===\n[[File:Lunds Domkyrka korstolar h\u00f6ger om koret.JPG|thumb|right|The right side of the choir, showing parts of the choir stalls (right) and the main altarpiece (left)]]\nThe choir contains two rows of medieval choir stalls containing in total 78 seats. The wooden stalls date from the end of the 14th century, probably commissioned by archbishop Nils J\u00f6nson some time between 1361 and 1379. Clearly made by several different wood carvers, they are approximately {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall without their gables and decorated with carved details. These are biblical scenes from both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]], but the stalls also contain [[misericord]]s portraying animals and other small details. Their style is [[Gothic art|High Gothic]] and they are stylistically linked with contemporary art from the Rhine Valley. They are among the largest wooden Gothic sculptures to survive in the Nordic countries, and have been described as being of internationally high quality.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=24\u201332}} The choir stalls in Lund Cathedral also lent stylistic inspiration to the choir stalls in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] and [[St. Bendt's Church, Ringsted]].{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=24\u201332}}{{sfn|Dun\u00e9r|1984|p=1\u20139}}\n\nSlightly older than the choir stalls is a [[Cathedra|bishop's throne]] which survives in a damaged state and is placed in the south transept. It is somewhat similar in construction to the choir stalls but stylistically different and more closely related to contemporary art from north Germany.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=32\u201335}} Currently placed next to the bishop's chair is also a Gothic [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] in the form of a {{convert|5|m|ft}} tall, decorated wooden pillar. It contains two cabinets surmounted by a statuette of a female saint and crowned by a hexagonal spire. The tabernacle was repaired by Brunius in the 19th century. The saint may  be {{ill|Ida von Toggenburg|de}}.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=36\u201337}}\n\n===Astronomical clock===\n{{Main|Horologium mirabile Lundense}}\n[[File:Lunds astronomiska ur-2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[astronomical clock]]]]\nThe [[astronomical clock]] of Lund Cathedral, presently located at the west end of the north aisle, dates from the late Middle Ages and was installed in Lund Cathedral {{circa}} 1425. In 1837, it was dismantled. It was restored at the initiative of architect {{ill|Theodor W\u00e5hlin|sv}} and the Danish clock-maker Julius Bertram Larsen and re-inaugurated in 1923. The upper part, which is original, is the clock, while the lower part, a reconstruction, is a calendar. Twice every day the two knights on the top clash their swords. The clock then plays the tune ''[[In dulci jubilo]]'' and a procession of figures parades across the face of the clock.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=125\u2013126}} Three astronomical clocks of similar design are preserved in Europe.

Two of the bronze columns are crowned by angels, and the third one by a statuette of Saint Lawrence, holding a gridiron, the symbol of his martyrdom. It probably dates from the middle of the 14th century, while the two angel-bearing columns may be somewhat later. Saint Lawrence's column is approximately {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall (and the saint {{convert|70|cm|inch}}), while the columns with angels are slightly smaller.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=114}} The three columns were probably made in [[L\u00fcbeck]] or [[Hamburg]].

The artist was [[Johannes Ganssog]] from [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] in present-day Germany. It is technically skillfully attached to one of the pillars of the nave, and it is entered through a stair cut inside the pillar. The building material is sandstone, black [[limestone]] and black and white [[marble]], and it is partially painted and [[gilding|gilded]].

The simple Romanesque [[sarcophagus]], which has an inscription in Latin and a depiction of the bishop, is located in the apse of the crypt. It dates from the middle of the 12th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=48}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=46}} The crypt also contains the much larger grave monument of the last archbishop, {{ill|Birger Gunnersen|sv}}, which is centrally placed in the crypt. It is of a kind which is not unusual in continental Europe but very unusual in the Nordic countries: a large stone sarcophagus decorated on all sides with sculptures in high relief and with a full-scale depiction of the bishop in full dress on the lid. It was made by Adam van D\u00fcren in 1512.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=94}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=48\u201349}} The cathedral's largest grave monument is that of bishop [[Hans Brostorp]], who died in 1497 and who during his lifetime inaugurated the [[University of Copenhagen]]. The monument is made of limestone from [[Gotland]] and decorated in low relief.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=47}}\n\nThe nave and the aisles contain several memorial plaques and [[epitaph]]s. Several commemorate bishops, such as {{ill|Johan Engestr\u00f6m|sv}} (1699\u20131777) and {{ill|Nils Hessl\u00e9n|sv}} (1728\u20131811), and professors at Lund University, e.g. {{ill|Eberhard Rosenblad|sv}} (1714\u20131796) and {{ill|Erasmus Sack|sv}} (1633\u20131697). The oldest epitaph of the cathedral commemorates the owner of [[Krageholm Castle]] {{ill|Lave Brahe|sv}} (1500\u20131567) and his wife [[G\u00f6rvel Fadersdotter (Sparre)]] (1509 or 1517 \u2013 1605).{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Flora==\n[[File:Flickr - Sigfrid Lundberg - Wall-rue, Asplenium ruta-muraria.jpg|thumb|right|[[Asplenium ruta-muraria|Wall-rue]] growing on the [[apse]]]]\nSeveral surveys and descriptions of the [[flora]] of the cathedral, like the plants that grow on its walls, have been made. The first to describe the flora of the cathedral was [[Daniel Rolander]], one of the [[apostles of Linnaeus]], who made a list of the [[vascular plant]]s, [[moss]]es and [[lichen]] he found growing on the building in 1771.{{sfn|Johansson|1993|p=25}} It was rediscovered in the 20th century and published in 1931. [[Elias Magnus Fries]] also made observations about the flora of the cathedral during the first half of the 19th century. More systematic surveys of the flora of the building have been published in 1922 and in 1993 (the latter only encompassing lichen).{{sfn|Johansson|1993|p=25}} Of the species observed growing on the cathedral, the minute [[fern]] [[Asplenium ruta-muraria|wall-rue]] was mentioned as early as 1756 by {{ill|Anders Tidstr\u00f6m|sv}} and is perhaps the most conspicuous member of the cathedral flora.{{sfn|Gertz|1923|p=458}} When the lichen flora was surveyed in 1993, 15 species were discovered.

The name \"Normandy\" reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. \"Northman\") origins.\n\nThe descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] and intermarried with the area's inhabitants and became the [[Normans]] \u2013 a [[Norman language|Norman French]]-speaking mixture of [[Scandinavia]]ns, [[Hiberno-Norse]], [[Orkney|Orcadians]], [[Danelaw|Anglo-Danish]], and indigenous [[Franks]] and [[Gauls]].\n\n[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene39.jpg|Landing in England scene from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], depicting ships coming in and horses landing|thumb]]\nRollo's descendant [[William I of England|William, Duke of Normandy]] became king of England in 1066 in the [[Norman Conquest]] beginning with the [[Battle of Hastings]], while retaining the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants. In 1204, during the reign of [[John of England|King John]], mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], while insular Normandy (the [[Channel Islands]]) remained under English control. In 1259, [[Henry III of England]] recognised the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]]. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of mainland Normandy.\n\nWith the rise of [[William the Conqueror]] the North Sea and Channel began to lose some of their importance. The new order oriented most of England and Scandinavia's trade south, toward the [[Mediterranean]] and the Orient.\n\nAlthough the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands (except for [[Chausey]]) are [[Crown dependencies]] of the [[The Crown|British Crown]]. Thus the [[Loyal toast]] in the Channel Islands is ''La Reine, notre Duc'' (\"The Queen, our Duke\"). The British monarch is understood to ''not'' be the Duke of Normandy in regards of the French region of Normandy described herein, by virtue of the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris of 1259]], the surrender of French possessions in 1801, and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to [[Salic Law]] which excludes inheritance through female heirs.\n\nFrench Normandy was occupied by English forces during the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1346\u20131360 and again in 1415\u20131450.\n\n=== England and Britain: Naval superpower ===\n[[File:Elizabeth I Watching Defeat of Spanish Armada by an unknown artist, 16th century.jpg|thumb|The [[Spanish Armada]] off the English coast in 1588]]\n[[File:La bataille des Cadinaux en novembre 1759.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] which ended the [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|French invasion plans]] in 1759]]\nFrom the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], English foreign policy concentrated on preventing invasion across the Channel by ensuring no major European power controlled the potential Dutch and Flemish invasion ports. Her climb to the pre-eminent [[sea power]] of the world began in 1588 as the attempted invasion of the [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated by the combination of outstanding naval tactics by the English and the Dutch under command of [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]] with [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] second in command, and the following stormy weather. Over the centuries the [[Royal Navy]] slowly grew to be the most powerful in the world.<ref>{{cite web\n| last =britishbattles.com\n| title =The Spanish Armada: Sir Francis Drake\n| year =2007\n| url =http://www.britishbattles.com/spanish-war/spanish-armada.htm\n| accessdate =24 July 2007\n| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110223140400/http://www.britishbattles.com/spanish-war/spanish-armada.htm\n| archive-date =23 February 2011\n| url-status =live\n}}</ref>\n\nThe building of the [[British Empire]] was possible only because the [[Royal Navy]] eventually managed to exercise unquestioned control over the seas around Europe, especially the Channel and the North Sea. During the [[Seven Years' War]], France attempted to [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|launch an invasion of Britain]]. To achieve this France needed to gain control of the Channel for several weeks, but was thwarted following the British naval victory at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in 1759.\n\nAnother significant challenge to British domination of the seas came during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[Battle of Trafalgar]] took place off the coast of Spain against a combined French and Spanish fleet and was won by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], ending [[Napoleon]]'s plans for a cross-Channel invasion and securing British dominance of the seas for over a century.\n\n=== First World War ===\nThe exceptional strategic importance of the Channel as a tool for blockade was recognised by the First Sea Lord [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]] in the years before [[World War I]]. \"Five keys lock up the world! Singapore, the Cape, [[Alexandria]], Gibraltar, Dover.\"<ref>{{Cite book| author=Geoffrey Miller| url=http://www.manorhouse.clara.net/book3/chapter2.htm| title=The Millstone: Chapter 2| accessdate=1 November 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716113342/http://www.manorhouse.clara.net/book3/chapter2.htm| archive-date=16 July 2011| url-status=live}} quoting Fisher, ''Naval Necessities I'', p. 219</ref> However, on 25 July 1909 [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]] made the first Channel crossing from [[Calais]] to [[Dover]] in an aeroplane. Bl\u00e9riot's crossing signalled the end of the Channel as a barrier-moat for England against foreign enemies.\n\nBecause the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' surface fleet could not match the British Grand Fleet, the Germans developed [[submarine warfare]], which was to become a far greater threat to Britain. The [[Dover Patrol]] was set up just before the war started to escort cross-Channel troopships and to prevent submarines from sailing in the Channel, obliging them to travel to the Atlantic via the much longer route around Scotland.\n\nOn land, the German army attempted to capture Channel ports in the [[Race to the Sea]] but although the trenches are often said to have stretched \"from the frontier of Switzerland to the English Channel\", they reached the coast at the North Sea. Much of the British war effort in [[Flanders]] was a bloody but successful strategy to prevent the Germans reaching the Channel coast.\n\nAt the outset of the war, an attempt was made to block the path of [[U-boat]]s through the Dover Strait with [[naval mine]]fields. By February 1915, this had been augmented by a {{convert|25|km|mi}} stretch of light steel netting called the [[Dover Barrage]], which it was hoped would ensnare submerged submarines. After initial success, the Germans learned how to pass through the barrage, aided by the unreliability of British mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/doverbarrage.htm|title=First World War.com - Encyclopedia - The Dover Barrage|website=www.firstworldwar.com|access-date=21 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918001536/http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/doverbarrage.htm|archive-date=18 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> On 31 January 1917, the Germans restarted [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] leading to dire Admiralty predictions that submarines would defeat Britain by November,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| archive-url=https://archive.today/20080310175335/http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| url-status=dead| archive-date=10 March 2008| title=U-Boat warfare at the Atlantic during World War I| publisher=German Notes| accessdate=1 November 2008 }}</ref> the most dangerous situation Britain faced in either world war.\n\nThe [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917 was fought to reduce the threat by capturing the submarine bases on the Belgian coast, though it was the introduction of [[convoy]]s and not capture of the bases that averted defeat. In April 1918 the Dover Patrol carried out the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] against the U-boat bases. During 1917, the Dover Barrage was re-sited with improved mines and more effective nets, aided by regular patrols by small warships equipped with powerful searchlights. A German attack on these vessels resulted in the [[Battle of Dover Strait (1917)|Battle of Dover Strait in 1917]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E_TE_ARPXdMC&pg=PA74&dq=%22Dover+Barrage%22+1917#v=onepage&q=%22Dover%20Barrage%22%201917&f=false |first=Robert M. |last=Grant |title=U-Boats Destroyed: The Effect of Anti-Submarine Warfare 1914\u20131918 |publisher=Periscope Publishing Ltd |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-904381-00-6 |pages=74\u201375}}</ref> A much more ambitious attempt to improve the barrage, by installing eight massive concrete towers across the strait was called the [[Admiralty M-N Scheme]] but only two towers were nearing completion at the end of the war and the project was abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sotonwss.org.uk/blackjack/Sep09BJ.pdf|title=''Black Jack'' (Quarterly Magazine Southampton Branch World Ship Society) Issue No: 152 Autumn 2009: (p.6) SHOREHAM TOWERS \u2013 One of the Admiralty's greatest engineering secrets, Reproduced from Engineering & Technology IET Magazine May 2009|access-date=21 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513143827/http://www.sotonwss.org.uk/blackjack/Sep09BJ.pdf|archive-date=13 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe naval blockade in the Channel and North Sea was one of the decisive factors in the German defeat in 1918.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://uboat.net/history/wwi/part6.htm| title=His Imperial German Majesty's U-boats in WWI: 6.

Successful invasions include the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] and the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, while the concentration of excellent harbours in the Western Channel on Britain's south coast made possible the largest amphibious invasion of all time, the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944.

Rollo had besieged Paris but in 911 entered [[vassal]]age to the king of the [[Western Francia|West Franks]] [[Charles the Simple]] through the [[Treaty of St.-Claire-sur-Epte]]. In exchange for his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and [[fealty]], Rollo legally gained the territory he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name \"Normandy\" reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. \"Northman\") origins.\n\nThe descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] and intermarried with the area's inhabitants and became the [[Normans]] \u2013 a [[Norman language|Norman French]]-speaking mixture of [[Scandinavia]]ns, [[Hiberno-Norse]], [[Orkney|Orcadians]], [[Danelaw|Anglo-Danish]], and indigenous [[Franks]] and [[Gauls]].\n\n[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene39.jpg|Landing in England scene from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], depicting ships coming in and horses landing|thumb]]\nRollo's descendant [[William I of England|William, Duke of Normandy]] became king of England in 1066 in the [[Norman Conquest]] beginning with the [[Battle of Hastings]], while retaining the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants. In 1204, during the reign of [[John of England|King John]], mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], while insular Normandy (the [[Channel Islands]]) remained under English control. In 1259, [[Henry III of England]] recognised the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]]. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of mainland Normandy.\n\nWith the rise of [[William the Conqueror]] the North Sea and Channel began to lose some of their importance. The new order oriented most of England and Scandinavia's trade south, toward the [[Mediterranean]] and the Orient.\n\nAlthough the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands (except for [[Chausey]]) are [[Crown dependencies]] of the [[The Crown|British Crown]]. Thus the [[Loyal toast]] in the Channel Islands is ''La Reine, notre Duc'' (\"The Queen, our Duke\"). The British monarch is understood to ''not'' be the Duke of Normandy in regards of the French region of Normandy described herein, by virtue of the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris of 1259]], the surrender of French possessions in 1801, and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to [[Salic Law]] which excludes inheritance through female heirs.\n\nFrench Normandy was occupied by English forces during the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1346\u20131360 and again in 1415\u20131450.\n\n=== England and Britain: Naval superpower ===\n[[File:Elizabeth I Watching Defeat of Spanish Armada by an unknown artist, 16th century.jpg|thumb|The [[Spanish Armada]] off the English coast in 1588]]\n[[File:La bataille des Cadinaux en novembre 1759.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] which ended the [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|French invasion plans]] in 1759]]\nFrom the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], English foreign policy concentrated on preventing invasion across the Channel by ensuring no major European power controlled the potential Dutch and Flemish invasion ports. Her climb to the pre-eminent [[sea power]] of the world began in 1588 as the attempted invasion of the [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated by the combination of outstanding naval tactics by the English and the Dutch under command of [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]] with [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] second in command, and the following stormy weather.

During the [[Seven Years' War]], France attempted to [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|launch an invasion of Britain]]. To achieve this France needed to gain control of the Channel for several weeks, but was thwarted following the British naval victory at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in 1759.\n\nAnother significant challenge to British domination of the seas came during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[Battle of Trafalgar]] took place off the coast of Spain against a combined French and Spanish fleet and was won by Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], ending [[Napoleon]]'s plans for a cross-Channel invasion and securing British dominance of the seas for over a century.\n\n=== First World War ===\nThe exceptional strategic importance of the Channel as a tool for blockade was recognised by the First Sea Lord [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]] in the years before [[World War I]]. \"Five keys lock up the world!

Bl\u00e9riot's crossing signalled the end of the Channel as a barrier-moat for England against foreign enemies.\n\nBecause the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' surface fleet could not match the British Grand Fleet, the Germans developed [[submarine warfare]], which was to become a far greater threat to Britain. The [[Dover Patrol]] was set up just before the war started to escort cross-Channel troopships and to prevent submarines from sailing in the Channel, obliging them to travel to the Atlantic via the much longer route around Scotland.\n\nOn land, the German army attempted to capture Channel ports in the [[Race to the Sea]] but although the trenches are often said to have stretched \"from the frontier of Switzerland to the English Channel\", they reached the coast at the North Sea. Much of the British war effort in [[Flanders]] was a bloody but successful strategy to prevent the Germans reaching the Channel coast.\n\nAt the outset of the war, an attempt was made to block the path of [[U-boat]]s through the Dover Strait with [[naval mine]]fields. By February 1915, this had been augmented by a {{convert|25|km|mi}} stretch of light steel netting called the [[Dover Barrage]], which it was hoped would ensnare submerged submarines. After initial success, the Germans learned how to pass through the barrage, aided by the unreliability of British mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/doverbarrage.htm|title=First World War.com - Encyclopedia - The Dover Barrage|website=www.firstworldwar.com|access-date=21 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918001536/http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/doverbarrage.htm|archive-date=18 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> On 31 January 1917, the Germans restarted [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] leading to dire Admiralty predictions that submarines would defeat Britain by November,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| archive-url=https://archive.today/20080310175335/http://www.germannotes.com/hist_ww1_uboat.shtml| url-status=dead| archive-date=10 March 2008| title=U-Boat warfare at the Atlantic during World War I| publisher=German Notes| accessdate=1 November 2008 }}</ref> the most dangerous situation Britain faced in either world war.\n\nThe [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917 was fought to reduce the threat by capturing the submarine bases on the Belgian coast, though it was the introduction of [[convoy]]s and not capture of the bases that averted defeat. In April 1918 the Dover Patrol carried out the [[Zeebrugge Raid]] against the U-boat bases. During 1917, the Dover Barrage was re-sited with improved mines and more effective nets, aided by regular patrols by small warships equipped with powerful searchlights.

The CSA was dissolved in 1999 and was succeeded by two separate organisations: [[CSA (Ltd)]] and the [[Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation]] (CSPF). Both observe and authenticate cross-Channel swims in the Strait of Dover. The Channel Crossing Association was set up at about this time to cater for unorthodox crossings.\n\nThe team with the most number of Channel swims to its credit is the [[The Serpentine|Serpentine]] Swimming Club in London,<ref>serpentineswimmingclub.com {{cite web| url=http://serpentineswimmingclub.com/long-distance-swimmers| title=Serpentine Swimming Club| accessdate=4 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912055658/http://serpentineswimmingclub.com/long-distance-swimmers/| archive-date=12 September 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> followed by the International [[Sri Chinmoy]] Marathon Team.<ref>srichinmoyraces.org {{cite web| url=http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/channel/channel_swimmers/channel_swimmers_list| title=Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team| accessdate=4 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317091724/http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/channel/channel_swimmers/channel_swimmers_list| archive-date=17 March 2009| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 2005, 811 people had completed 1,185 verified crossings under the rules of the CSA, the CSA (Ltd), the CSPF and Butlins.\n\nThe number of swims conducted under and ratified by the Channel Swimming Association to 2005 was 982 by 665 people.

{"title_page": "Web accessibility", "text_new": "{{Hatnote|For [[Wikipedia]]'s accessibility guidelines, see [[Wikipedia:Accessibility]].}}\n{{Disability}}\n'''Web accessibility''' is the [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusive practice]] of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, [[website]]s on the [[World Wide Web]] by people with physical [[disabilities]], situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, generally all users have equal [[access to information]] and functionality.\n\nFor example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful [[HTML]], with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and/or text-to-Braille hardware. When text and images are large and/or enlargeable, it is easier for users with poor sight to read and understand the content. When links are underlined (or otherwise differentiated) as well as colored, this ensures that [[color blind]] users will be able to notice them. When [[clickable]] links and areas are large, this helps users who cannot control a [[computer mouse|mouse]] with precision. When pages are not coded in a way that hinders navigation by means of the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] alone, or a single [[switch access]] device alone, this helps users who cannot use a mouse or even a standard keyboard. When videos are [[closed caption]]ed or a [[sign language]] version is available, deaf and hard-of-hearing users can understand the video. When flashing effects are avoided or made optional, users prone to [[seizure]]s caused by these effects are not put at risk. And when content is written in plain language and illustrated with instructional diagrams and animations, users with [[dyslexia]] and [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]] are better able to understand the content. When sites are correctly built and maintained, all of these users can be accommodated without decreasing the [[usability]] of the site for non-disabled users.\n\nThe needs that Web accessibility aims to address include:\n* '''Visual:''' [[Visual impairment]]s including [[blindness]], various common types of [[low vision]] and poor eyesight, various types of [[color blindness]];\n* '''Motor/mobility:''' e.g. difficulty or inability to use the hands, including tremors, muscle slowness, loss of fine muscle control, etc., due to conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[stroke]];\n* '''Auditory:''' [[Deafness]] or [[hearing impairment]]s, including individuals who are [[hard of hearing]];\n* '''Seizures:''' Photo epileptic [[seizure]]s caused by visual strobe or flashing effects.\n* '''Cognitive and intellectual:''' [[Developmental disabilities]], [[Learning disability|learning difficulties]] ([[dyslexia]], [[dyscalculia]], etc.), and [[cognitive disabilities]] (PTSD, Alzheimer's) of various origins, affecting memory, attention, developmental \"maturity\", problem-solving and logic skills, etc.\n\nAccessibility is not confined to the list above, rather it extends to anyone who is experiencing any permanent, temporary or situational disability. Situational disability refers to someone who may be experiencing a boundary based on the current experience. For example, a person may be situationally one-handed if they are carrying a baby. Web accessibility should be mindful of users experiencing a wide variety of barriers.\n\n==Assistive technologies used for web browsing==\nIndividuals living with a disability use [[Assistive technology|assistive technologies]] such as the following to enable and assist web browsing:\n* Screen reader software, which can read out, using synthesized speech, either selected elements of what is being displayed on the monitor (helpful for users with reading or learning difficulties), or which can read out everything that is happening on the computer (used by blind and vision impaired users).\n* Braille terminals, consisting of a [[refreshable braille display]] which renders text as [[braille]] characters (usually by means of raising pegs through holes in a flat surface) and either a mainstream keyboard or a braille keyboard.\n* [[Screen magnifier|Screen magnification]] software, which enlarges what is displayed on the computer monitor, making it easier to read for vision impaired users.\n* [[Speech recognition]] software that can accept spoken commands to the computer, or turn dictation into grammatically correct text \u2013 useful for those who have difficulty using a mouse or a keyboard.\n* Keyboard overlays, which can make typing easier or more accurate for those who have motor control difficulties.\n* Access to subtitled or sign language videos for deaf people.\n\n==Guidelines on accessible web design==\n\n===Web Content Accessibility Guidelines===\n{{Main|Web Content Accessibility Guidelines}}\n\nIn 1999 the [[Web Accessibility Initiative]], a project by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines#WCAG 1.0|WCAG 1.0]].\n\nOn 11 December 2008, the WAI released the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines#WCAG 2.0|WCAG 2.0]] as a Recommendation. WCAG 2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral. Though web designers can choose either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive guidelines on how to create accessible websites. Governments are steadily adopting the WCAG 2.0 as the accessibility standard for their own websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.powermapper.com/blog/post/Government-Accessibility-Standards.aspx

There is some debate on the matter; multiple courts and the U.S. Department of Justice have taken the position that the ADA requires website and app operators and owners to take affirmative steps to make their websites and apps accessible to disabled persons and compatible with common assistive technologies such as the JAWS screen reader, while other courts have taken the position that the ADA does not apply online.  The U.S. Department of Justice has endorsed the WCAG2.0AA standard as an appropriate standard for accessibility in multiple settlement agreements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleIII_2010/titleIII_2010_regulations.htm|title=Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities|website=www.ada.gov|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nNumerous lawsuits challenging websites and mobile apps on the basis of the ADA have been filed since 2017. These cases appears spurred by a 2017 case, ''Gil v. Winn Dixie Stores'', in which a federal court in Florida ruled that [[Winn Dixie]]'s website must be accessible. Around 800 cases related to web accessibility were filed in 2017, and over 2,200 were filed in 2018. Additionally, though the Justice Department had stated in 2010 that they would publish guidelines for web accessibility, they reversed this plan in 2017, also spurring legal action against inaccessible sites.<ref name=\"dominos\"/>\n\nA notable lawsuit related to the ADA was filed against [[Domino's Pizza]] by a blind user who could not use Domino's mobile app. At the federal district level, the court rules in favor of Domino's as the Justice Department had not established the guidelines for accessibility, but this was appealed to the [[Ninth Circuit]]. The Ninth Circuit overruled the district court, ruling that because Domino's is a brick-and-mortar store, which must meet the ADA, and the mobile app an extension of their services, their app must also be compliant with the ADA. Domino's has petitioned to the Supreme Court, backed by many other restaurants and retail chains, arguing that this decision impacts their [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] since handicapped customers have other, more accessible means to order.<ref name=\"dominos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/dominos-asks-supreme-court-to-say-disability-protections-dont-apply-online.html | title = A blind man couldn't order pizza from Domino's.

These audits, a type of [[system testing]], identify accessibility problems that exist within a website, and provide advice and guidance on the steps that need to be taken to correct these problems.\n\nA range of methods are used to audit websites for [[accessibility]]:\n* Automated tools are available which can identify some of the problems that are present. Depending on the tool the result may vary widely making it difficult to compare test results.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krantz|first=Peter|title=Pitfalls of Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools|url=http://www.standards-schmandards.com/2009/pitfalls-of-web-accessibility-evaluation-tools/|publisher=Standards-schmandards.com|accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>\n* Expert technical reviewers, knowledgeable in web design technologies and accessibility, can review a representative selection of pages and provide detailed feedback and advice based on their findings.\n* User testing, usually overseen by technical experts, involves setting tasks for ordinary users to carry out on the website, and reviewing the problems these users encounter as they try to carry out the tasks.\n\nEach of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses:\n* Automated tools can process many pages in a relatively short length of time, but can only identify some of the accessibility problems that might be present in the website.\n* Technical expert review will identify many of the problems that exist, but the process is time consuming, and many websites are too large to make it possible for a person to review every page.\n* User testing combines elements of usability and accessibility testing, and is valuable for identifying problems that might otherwise be overlooked, but needs to be used knowledgeably to avoid the risk of basing design decisions on one user's preferences.\n\nIdeally, a combination of methods should be used to assess the accessibility of a website.\n\n==Remediating inaccessible websites==\nOnce an accessibility audit has been conducted, and accessibility errors have been identified, the errors will need to be remediated in order to ensure the site is compliant with accessibility errors. The traditional way of correcting an inaccessible site is to go back into the source code, reprogram the error, and then test to make sure the bug was fixed. If the website is not scheduled to be revised in the near future, that error (and others) would remain on the site for a lengthy period of time, possibly violating accessibility guidelines. Because this is a complicated process, many website owners choose to build accessibility into a new site design or re-launch, as it can be more efficient to develop the site to comply with accessibility guidelines, rather than to remediate errors later.\n\nWith the progress in [[AI]] technology, web accessibility has become more accessible. With 3rd party addons that leverage AI and [[Machine Learning]],  it is possible to offer changes to the [[website design]] without altering the source code. This way, a website can be accessible to different types of users without the need to adjust the website for every accessibility equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility|title=Ai for Accessibility |date=13 March 2020|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Accessible Web applications and WAI-ARIA==\nFor a Web page to be accessible all important semantics about the page's functionality must be available so that assistive technology can understand and process the content and adapt it for the user.  \nHowever, as content becomes more and more complex, the standard HTML tags and attributes become inadequate in providing semantics reliably. Modern Web applications often apply scripts to elements to control their functionality and to enable them to act as a control or other dynamic component. These custom components or widgets do not provide a way to convey semantic information to the user agent.\n[[WAI-ARIA]] (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a specification<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/ |title=Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0 |date=12 December 2012 |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |accessdate=18 December 2012 }}</ref> published by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] that specifies how to increase the [[accessibility]] of [[dynamic content]] and [[Elements of graphical user interfaces|user interface components]] developed with [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]] and related technologies.\nARIA enables accessibility by enabling the author to provide all the semantics to fully describe its supported behaviour. It also allows each element to expose its current states and properties and its relationships between other elements. Accessibility problems with the focus and tab index are also corrected.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Accessible publishing]]\n* [[Augmentative and alternative communication]]\n* [[Blue Beanie Day]]\n*

design]]\n[[Category:Usability]]\n", "text_old": "{{Hatnote|For [[Wikipedia]]'s accessibility guidelines, see [[Wikipedia:Accessibility]].}}\n{{Disability}}\n'''Web accessibility''' is the [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusive practice]] of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, [[website]]s on the [[World Wide Web]] by people with physical [[disabilities]], situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, generally all users have equal [[access to information]] and functionality.\n\nFor example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful [[HTML]], with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and/or text-to-Braille hardware. When text and images are large and/or enlargeable, it is easier for users with poor sight to read and understand the content. When links are underlined (or otherwise differentiated) as well as colored, this ensures that [[color blind]] users will be able to notice them. When [[clickable]] links and areas are large, this helps users who cannot control a [[computer mouse|mouse]] with precision. When pages are not coded in a way that hinders navigation by means of the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] alone, or a single [[switch access]] device alone, this helps users who cannot use a mouse or even a standard keyboard. When videos are [[closed caption]]ed or a [[sign language]] version is available, deaf and hard-of-hearing users can understand the video. When flashing effects are avoided or made optional, users prone to [[seizure]]s caused by these effects are not put at risk. And when content is written in plain language and illustrated with instructional diagrams and animations, users with [[dyslexia]] and [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]] are better able to understand the content. When sites are correctly built and maintained, all of these users can be accommodated without decreasing the [[usability]] of the site for non-disabled users.\n\nThe needs that Web accessibility aims to address include:\n* '''Visual:''' [[Visual impairment]]s including [[blindness]], various common types of [[low vision]] and poor eyesight, various types of [[color blindness]];\n* '''Motor/mobility:''' e.g. difficulty or inability to use the hands, including tremors, muscle slowness, loss of fine muscle control, etc., due to conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[stroke]];\n* '''Auditory:''' [[Deafness]] or [[hearing impairment]]s, including individuals who are [[hard of hearing]];\n* '''Seizures:''' Photo epileptic [[seizure]]s caused by visual strobe or flashing effects.\n* '''Cognitive and intellectual:''' [[Developmental disabilities]], [[Learning disability|learning difficulties]] ([[dyslexia]], [[dyscalculia]], etc.), and [[cognitive disabilities]] (PTSD, Alzheimer's) of various origins, affecting memory, attention, developmental \"maturity\", problem-solving and logic skills, etc.\n\nAccessibility is not confined to the list above, rather it extends to anyone who is experiencing any permanent, temporary or situational disability. Situational disability refers to someone who may be experiencing a boundary based on the current experience. For example, a person may be situationally one-handed if they are carrying a baby. Web accessibility should be mindful of users experiencing a wide variety of barriers.\n\n==Assistive technologies used for web browsing==\nIndividuals living with a disability use [[Assistive technology|assistive technologies]] such as the following to enable and assist web browsing:\n* Screen reader software, which can read out, using synthesized speech, either selected elements of what is being displayed on the monitor (helpful for users with reading or learning difficulties), or which can read out everything that is happening on the computer (used by blind and vision impaired users).\n* Braille terminals, consisting of a [[refreshable braille display]] which renders text as [[braille]] characters (usually by means of raising pegs through holes in a flat surface) and either a mainstream keyboard or a braille keyboard.\n* [[Screen magnifier|Screen magnification]] software, which enlarges what is displayed on the computer monitor, making it easier to read for vision impaired users.\n* [[Speech recognition]] software that can accept spoken commands to the computer, or turn dictation into grammatically correct text \u2013 useful for those who have difficulty using a mouse or a keyboard.\n* Keyboard overlays, which can make typing easier or more accurate for those who have motor control difficulties.\n* Access to subtitled or sign language videos for deaf people.\n\n==Guidelines on accessible web design==\n\n===Web Content Accessibility Guidelines===\n{{Main|Web Content Accessibility Guidelines}}\n\nIn 1999 the [[Web Accessibility Initiative]], a project by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines#WCAG 1.0|WCAG 1.0]].\n\nOn 11 December 2008, the WAI released the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines#WCAG 2.0|WCAG 2.0]] as a Recommendation. WCAG 2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral. Though web designers can choose either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive guidelines on how to create accessible websites. Governments are steadily adopting the WCAG 2.0 as the accessibility standard for their own websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.powermapper.com/blog/post/Government-Accessibility-Standards.aspx

On 14 December of the same year, the second version was published, including suggestions made to the first version of the paper. On 7 May 2007, the accessibility guidelines of the paper became compulsory to all federal websites. The current version of the paper, which follows the WCAG 2.0 guidelines, is named '''e-MAG, Modelo de {{not a typo|Acessibilidade}} de Governo Eletr\u00f4nico''' (Electronic Government Accessibility Model), and is maintained by Brazilian [[Ministry of Planning, Budget, and Management]].\n\nThe paper can be viewed and downloaded at its official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.governoeletronico.gov.br/acoes-e-projetos/e-MAG |title=e-MAG \u2013 Modelo de Acessibilidade de Governo Eletr\u00f4nico |publisher=GovernoEletronico.gov.br |accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nIn 2011, the Government of Canada began phasing in the implementation of a new set of web standards that are aimed at ensuring government websites are accessible, usable, interoperable and optimized for mobile devices. These standards replace Common Look and Feel 2.0 (CLF 2.0) Standards for the Internet.\n\nThe first of these four standards, Standard on Web Accessibility<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601|title=Standard on Web Accessibility|date=2 August 2011|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref> came into full effect on 31 July 2013.

This is an approved code of practice and its provisions have the force of legally binding statutory obligations. It states that a public body can achieve compliance with Section 28(2) by \"reviewing existing practices for electronic communications in terms of accessibility against relevant guidelines and standards\", giving the example of \"Double A conformance with the Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)\".\n\n===Israel===\nThe Israeli Ministry of Justice recently published regulations requiring Internet websites to comply with Israeli standard 5568, which is based on the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. The main differences between the Israeli standard and the W3C standard concern the requirements to provide captions and texts for audio and video media. The Israeli standards are somewhat more lenient, reflecting the current technical difficulties in providing such captions and texts in Hebrew.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928203000/http://israeltechnologylaw.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/website-accessibility-requirements/|title=Israel Technology Law Blog, Website Accessibility Requirements}}</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nIn Italy, web accessibility is ruled by the so-called \"[[Stanca Act|Legge Stanca]]\" (Stanca Act), formally Act n.4 of 9 January 2004, officially published on the [[Gazzetta Ufficiale]] on 17 January 2004.

The [[Manila Accessible Information and Communications Technologies Design Recommendations]] was drafted and adopted in 2003.\n\n===Spain===\nIn Spain, UNE 139803 is the norm entrusted to regulate web accessibility. This standard is based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inteco.es/Accesibilidad/difusion/Normativa/Descarga/DescargaUNE_139803 |title=La norma UNE 139803:2004 constituye la base de la certificaci\u00f3n en Accesibilidad Web. |publisher=INTECO |accessdate=16 December 2012 |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden, Verva, the Swedish Administrative Development Agency is responsible for a set of guidelines for Swedish public sector web sites. Through the guidelines, web accessibility is presented as an integral part of the overall development process and not as a separate issue. The Swedish guidelines contain criteria which cover the entire lifecycle of a website; from its conception to the publication of live web content. These criteria address several areas which should be considered, including:\n* accessibility\n* usability\n* web standards\n* privacy issues\n* information architecture\n* developing content for the web\n* Content Management Systems (CMS) / authoring tools selection.\n* development of web content for mobile devices.\n\nAn English translation was released in April 2008: Swedish National Guidelines for Public Sector Websites.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swedish National Guidelines for Public Sector Websites|url=http://arkiv.edelegationen.se/verva/upload/english/swedish-guidelines-public-sector-websites.pdf|website=arkiv.edelegationen.se|publisher=VERVA|date=April 2008}}</ref> The translation is based on the latest version of Guidelines which was released in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standards-schmandards.com/2006/swe-guidelines/ |title=New Version of Guidelines for Swedish Public Sector Web Sites |year=2006 |author=Peter Krantz |publisher=standards-schmandards.com |accessdate=18 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the [[UK]], the [[Equality Act 2010]] does not refer explicitly to website accessibility, but makes it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities. The Act applies to anyone providing a service; public, private and voluntary sectors. The ''Code of Practice: Rights of Access \u2013 Goods, Facilities, Services and Premises'' document<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/pas78.pdf |title=A guide to good practice in commissioning accessible websites |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |accessdate=18 December 2012 }}</ref> published by the government's [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] to accompany the Act does refer explicitly to websites as one of the \"services to the public\" which should be considered covered by the Act.\n\nIn December 2010 the UK released the standard ''[[BS 8878|BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility. Code of practice]]''. This standard effectively supersedes PAS 78 (pub. 2006).  PAS 78, produced by the [[Disability Rights Commission]] and\nsable by disabled people. The standard has been designed to introduce non-technical professionals to improved accessibility, usability and user experience for disabled and older people.<ref>{{cite web|title=BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility.

BS 8878 is consistent with the [[Equality Act 2010]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents |title=Equality Act 2010 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> and is referenced in the UK government's e-Accessibility Action Plan as the basis of updated advice on developing accessible online services. It includes recommendations for:\n\n* Involving disabled people in the development process and using automated tools to assist with accessibility testing\n* The management of the guidance and process for upholding existing accessibility guidelines and specifications.\n\nBS 8878 is intended for anyone responsible for the policies covering web product creation within their organization, and governance against those policies. It additionally assists people responsible for promoting and supporting equality and inclusion initiatives within organizations and people involved in the procurement, creation or training of web products and content. A summary of BS 8878<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ |title=BS 8878 web accessibility standards \u2013 all you need to know |publisher=Hassell Inclusion |accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> is available to help organisations better understand how the standard can help them embed accessibility and inclusive design in their business-as-usual processes.\n\nOn 28 May 2019, BS 8878 was superseded by ISO 30071-1, the international Standard that built on BS 8878 and expanded it for international use. A summary of how ISO 30071-1 relates to BS 8878<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hassellinclusion.com/iso-30071-1/ |title=ISO 30071-1 digital accessibility standards (supersedes BS 8878) \u2013 all you need to know |publisher=Hassell Inclusion |accessdate=28 May 2019}}</ref> is available to help organisations understand the new Standard.\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] requires all Federal agencies' electronic and information technology to be accessible to those with disabilities. Both members of the public and federal employees have the right to access this technology, such as computer hardware and software, websites, phone systems, and copiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards|title=About the Section 508 Standards \u2013 United States Access Board|first=Dave|last=Yanchulis|website=www.access-board.gov|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>  \nAlso, [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability for entities receiving federal funds and has been cited in multiple lawsuits against organizations such as hospitals that receive federal funds through medicare/medicaid.\n\nIn addition, [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990#Title III\u2014public accommodations (and commercial facilities)|Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.  There is some debate on the matter; multiple courts and the U.S. Department of Justice have taken the position that the ADA requires website and app operators and owners to take affirmative steps to make their websites and apps accessible to disabled persons and compatible with common assistive technologies such as the JAWS screen reader, while other courts have taken the position that the ADA does not apply online.  The U.S. Department of Justice has endorsed the WCAG2.0AA standard as an appropriate standard for accessibility in multiple settlement agreements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleIII_2010/titleIII_2010_regulations.htm|title=Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities|website=www.ada.gov|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nNumerous lawsuits challenging websites and mobile apps on the basis of the ADA have been filed since 2017. These cases appears spurred by a 2017 case, ''Gil v. Winn Dixie Stores'', in which a federal court in Florida ruled that [[Winn Dixie]]'s website must be accessible. Around 800 cases related to web accessibility were filed in 2017, and over 2,200 were filed in 2018. Additionally, though the Justice Department had stated in 2010 that they would publish guidelines for web accessibility, they reversed this plan in 2017, also spurring legal action against inaccessible sites.<ref name=\"dominos\"/>\n\nA notable lawsuit related to the ADA was filed against [[Domino's Pizza]] by a blind user who could not use Domino's mobile app. At the federal district level, the court rules in favor of Domino's as the Justice Department had not established the guidelines for accessibility, but this was appealed to the [[Ninth Circuit]]. The Ninth Circuit overruled the district court, ruling that because Domino's is a brick-and-mortar store, which must meet the ADA, and the mobile app an extension of their services, their app must also be compliant with the ADA. Domino's has petitioned to the Supreme Court, backed by many other restaurants and retail chains, arguing that this decision impacts their [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] since handicapped customers have other, more accessible means to order.<ref name=\"dominos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/dominos-asks-supreme-court-to-say-disability-protections-dont-apply-online.html | title = A blind man couldn't order pizza from Domino's.

These audits, a type of [[system testing]], identify accessibility problems that exist within a website, and provide advice and guidance on the steps that need to be taken to correct these problems.\n\nA range of methods are used to audit websites for [[accessibility]]:\n* Automated tools are available which can identify some of the problems that are present. Depending on the tool the result may vary widely making it difficult to compare test results.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krantz|first=Peter|title=Pitfalls of Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools|url=http://www.standards-schmandards.com/2009/pitfalls-of-web-accessibility-evaluation-tools/|publisher=Standards-schmandards.com|accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>\n* Expert technical reviewers, knowledgeable in web design technologies and accessibility, can review a representative selection of pages and provide detailed feedback and advice based on their findings.\n* User testing, usually overseen by technical experts, involves setting tasks for ordinary users to carry out on the website, and reviewing the problems these users encounter as they try to carry out the tasks.\n\nEach of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses:\n* Automated tools can process many pages in a relatively short length of time, but can only identify some of the accessibility problems that might be present in the website.\n* Technical expert review will identify many of the problems that exist, but the process is time consuming, and many websites are too large to make it possible for a person to review every page.\n* User testing combines elements of usability and accessibility testing, and is valuable for identifying problems that might otherwise be overlooked, but needs to be used knowledgeably to avoid the risk of basing design decisions on one user's preferences.\n\nIdeally, a combination of methods should be used to assess the accessibility of a website.\n\n==Remediating inaccessible websites==\nOnce an accessibility audit has been conducted, and accessibility errors have been identified, the errors will need to be remediated in order to ensure the site is compliant with accessibility errors. The traditional way of correcting an inaccessible site is to go back into the source code, reprogram the error, and then test to make sure the bug was fixed. If the website is not scheduled to be revised in the near future, that error (and others) would remain on the site for a lengthy period of time, possibly violating accessibility guidelines. Because this is a complicated process, many website owners choose to build accessibility into a new site design or re-launch, as it can be more efficient to develop the site to comply with accessibility guidelines, rather than to remediate errors later.\n\nWith the progress in [[AI]] technology, web accessibility has become more accessible. With 3rd party addons that leverage AI and [[Machine Learning]],  it is possible to offer changes to the [[website design]] without altering the source code. This way, a website can be accessible to different types of users without the need to adjust the website for every accessibility equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility|title=Ai for Accessibility |date=13 March 2020|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Accessible Web applications and WAI-ARIA==\nFor a Web page to be accessible all important semantics about the page's functionality must be available so that assistive technology can understand and process the content and adapt it for the user.  \nHowever, as content becomes more and more complex, the standard HTML tags and attributes become inadequate in providing semantics reliably. Modern Web applications often apply scripts to elements to control their functionality and to enable them to act as a control or other dynamic component. These custom components or widgets do not provide a way to convey semantic information to the user agent.\n[[WAI-ARIA]] (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a specification<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/ |title=Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0 |date=12 December 2012 |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |accessdate=18 December 2012 }}</ref> published by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] that specifies how to increase the [[accessibility]] of [[dynamic content]] and [[Elements of graphical user interfaces|user interface components]] developed with [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]] and related technologies.\nARIA enables accessibility by enabling the author to provide all the semantics to fully describe its supported behaviour. It also allows each element to expose its current states and properties and its relationships between other elements. Accessibility problems with the focus and tab index are also corrected.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Accessible publishing]]\n* [[Augmentative and alternative communication]]\n* [[Computer accessibility]]\n*

He teams up with the teenage Boggs twins \u2013 '''Cindy Mae''' and '''Woody''' \u2013 and the trio solves confusing mysteries that baffle '''Sheriff Muletrain''' and his overeager, but dimwitted deputy '''Goofer McGee'''. Buford's abilities are expanded with ears that revolve like radar dishes, and his nose responds to clues like a Geiger counter. But Buford has two weaknesses: when the moon comes out, he howls his heart out, often at the most perilous moments and he also has a running feud with a karate-whacking raccoon.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rovin |first1=Jeff |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |isbn=0-13-275561-0 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc00rovi/page/38/mode/2up/ |page=38}}</ref>\n\n*'''''The Galloping Ghost''''': Nugget Nose is the short and feisty ghost of an Old West gold prospector who finds adventure riding his invisible horse. He is also a guardian to two teenage cowgirls, '''Wendy''' and '''Rita''', who work at the Fuddy Dude Ranch owned by grouchy, old '''Fenwick Fuddy'''. Whenever Fuddy threatens to fire the girls, Nugget makes himself invisible and becomes a helping friend. He is always battling Fuddy and takes delight in harassing him in odd and humorous ways. When the girls are in trouble, Wendy summons Nugget by rubbing on her special gold nugget necklace.\n\n''The Buford Files'' and ''The Galloping Ghost'' originally aired separately as segments on ''[[Yogi's Space Race]]'' from September 9, 1978, to January 27, 1979.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/50/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=50-51}}</ref> Following the cancellation of ''Yogi's Space Race'', both segments were repackaged and spun off in their own half-hour series from February 3 to September 1, 1979.
