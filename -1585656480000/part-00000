{"title_page": "Deaths in November 2002", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2019}}\n{{Deaths in month TOC}}\nThe following is a list of '''notable deaths in November 2002'''.\n\nEntries for each day are listed <u>alphabetically</u> by surname. A typical entry lists information in the following sequence:\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent country of citizenship (if applicable), reason for notability, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n<!--\n \n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Please include a reference to a reliable source. If a Wikipedia article for the deceased does not yet exist, please reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, please consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the deceased \"notable\". If you report the death of a subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, please consider starting one, provided that the deceased is notable. Please include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid overlinking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, please include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n\n==November 2002==\n\n===1===\n*[[Ekrem Akurgal]], 91, Turkish archaeologist.\n*[[Yisrael Amir]], 99, [[Israeli Air Force]] commander.\n*[[David Bartleet]], 73, British Anglican prelate, [[Bishop of Tonbridge]].\n*[[Edward Brooke (fencer)|Edward Brooke]], 85, Canadian Olympic fencer ([[1952 Summer Olympics]]: [[Fencing at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's foil|men's foil]], [[Fencing at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's \u00e9p\u00e9e|men's \u00e9p\u00e9e]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234215/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/br/edward-brooke-1.html|title=Edward Brooke|work=[[Sports-Reference]] / Olympic Sports|accessdate=2019-04-30}}</ref>\n*[[Nicholas John Bua]], 77, American judge ([[United States federal judge|U.S. District Judge]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fjc.gov/node/1378496|title=Bua, Nicholas John|work=[[Federal Judicial Center]]|accessdate=2019-03-18}}</ref>\n*[[Amadou Ciss\u00e9 Dia]], 87, Senegalese politician and playwright.\n*[[K\u00e4te Jaenicke]], 79, German theater and film actress.\n*[[Lester Morgan]], 26, Costa Rican professional football goalkeeper, suicide.\n*[[Keith A.

It is a set of safety procedures intended to improve the chances of avoiding or surviving [[Diving hazards and precautions|accidents]] in or [[underwater|under water]] by having divers dive in a group of two or sometimes three. When using the buddy system, members of the group dive together and co-operate with each other, so that they can help or [[diver rescue|rescue]] each other in the event of an emergency.<ref name=SPUMShalstead /> This is most effective if both divers are competent in all relevant skills and sufficiently aware of the situation that they can respond in time, which is a matter of both attitude and competence.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n\nIn [[recreational diving]], a pair of divers is usually best for buddy diving. With threesomes, one diver can easily lose the attention of the other two. (Groups with more than three divers are not using the buddy system.) The system is likely to be effective in mitigating out-of-air emergencies, non-diving medical emergencies and entrapment in [[rope]]s or [[Net (device)|net]]s. When used with the [[buddy check]] it can help avoid the omission, misuse and failure of [[diving equipment]].\n\n{{quote|The buddy system is the situation which occurs when two divers of similar interest and equal experience and ability share a dive, continuously monitoring each other throughout the entry, the dive and the exit, and remaining within such distance that they could render immediate assistance to each other if required.<ref name=SPUMShalstead/>|[[Bob Halstead]]|''Line dancing and the buddy system''}}\n\nIn [[technical diving]] activities such as [[cave diving]], threesomes are considered an acceptable practice.<ref name=exley /> This is usually referred to as team diving to distinguish it from buddy diving in pairs.\n\nWhen professional divers dive as buddy pairs their responsibility to each other is specified as part of standard operating procedures, code of practice or governing legislation.\n\n== Purpose ==\nBuddy diving is intended to enhance the safety of scuba diving by having two or three competent divers acting as safety divers for each other during a dive in conditions that are within their capabilities, and using equipment that is familiar to all team members. In principle, each diver is capable of rendering assistance to the other in any reasonably foreseeable contingency, and willing to do so within the scope of acceptable personal risk.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\nThe buddy divers are mutually responsible for the safety of the buddy pair above and below the water, and this responsibility commences when the divers prepare for the dive. It is assumed that it is unlikely that both divers will experience the same problem at the same time, allowing the diver  not in trouble to assist when the other diver has difficulties.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n\nThis purpose is theoretically fulfilled by the buddy assisting the diver to kit up, checking that the diver's equipment is correctly assembled and mounted, assisting the diver into the water where appropriate, checking for leaks, monitoring gas usage, providing an alternate breathing gas supply in case of an emergency, performing a rescue if the diver is unable to manage an emergency, and assisting the diver out of the water after the dive if appropriate.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" /> This system can mitigate high-risk emergencies when performed to the standards. This is not a controversial issue. This level of assistance requires the buddy to be familiar with the diver's equipment in detail, including the adjustment of harness and emergency release of weighting systems, control of inflation and dump valves, siting and attachment of secondary demand valve, knife and any other safety equipment. Recreational divers may be trained in some or all of these skills depending on their certification.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" /> The buddy system is not considered sufficient on its own, Dive planning, medical and physical fitness to dive, suitable and correctly functioning equipment, appropriate surface support, skills, experience and knowledge are all part of the diving safety system.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" /> To be fully effective, the buddy system is applied to an agreed dive plan, with effective communications, the willingness and ability to assist each other in all reasonably foreseeable circumstances associated with the dive plan, and the will to follow the dive plan.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n\n== Requirements ==\nFor the buddy system to function effectively, each buddy must be sufficiently competent to provide the required service, and be present when it is needed. Several conditions must exist for the buddy system to succeed:<!--ref: SADoL CoP for Scientific diving? DIR fundamentals? -->\n*The divers must know and accept the dive plan.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n*Equipment must be compatible with the dive plan, and reasonably foreseeable contingencies.\n*Divers must be fit to dive in the expected conditions.\n*They must be competent to perform the dive plan and carry out procedures to deal with reasonably foreseeable contingencies.<ref name=\"CoP Scientific\" />\n*The divers must know how to operate their own and their buddy's equipment, as they may have to operate it under stressful conditions.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n*They must be willing to accept increased personal risk in the event that they need to assist a distressed buddy, and must understand when such risk becomes unacceptable.\n*They must remain in the immediate vicinity of each other during the entire dive, close enough to communicate adequately and to render assistance in time.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n*Divers must monitor and communicate as needed to remain aware of the status of themselves and other team members, their decompression status and their life-support equipment throughout the dive, from entering the water until the last diver leaves the water.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n*Both divers are equally responsible for ensuring that they know where the other is, and that the other knows where they are at all times. This is the usual point at which the buddy system fails and divers are separated, making all the other conditions irrelevant. At this point they have lost the potential assistance of the buddy which is the main purpose of the system. Sometimes they find each other again. Usually nobody dies.\n\nMost recreational divers never advance to a high level of competency as might be indicated by certification and experience, and furthermore, many divers do not dive sufficiently frequently to maintain their skills.<ref name=Coleman /> Nevertheless, they are routinely expected to provide assistance to their dive buddies in the event of an emergency, and are also routinely allocated to dive with complete strangers who may be using unfamiliar equipment. It is standard practice for many, if not most diving charter organisations to allocate buddy pairs among divers they have never assessed for competence on the basis of their certification and claimed experience. Optimal conditions are seldom encountered on open-water recreational dives.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n\n=== Alternatives ===\nThe three alternatives, [[solo diving]], diving in teams of three, and diving as an individual in a large group, may have disadvantages when compared to the buddy system, especially for the novice:\n#Although solo diving is practiced by some recreational divers, it is only considered acceptably safe if the diver is totally self-sufficient.<ref name=\"Carney 2007\" /> This usually entails a completely redundant gas supply, such as a [[diving cylinder|pony bottle or an isolation manifold]], and the competence to use it in an emergency. Self-rescue is not possible in some cases, such as severe cases of entrapment in ropes and nets and during medical emergencies where the diver loses consciousness or is otherwise severely impaired in their ability to respond appropriately.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n#Three diver teams can be effective for safety and backup, as generally, a problem that requires assistance affects only one diver, and having two divers to assist can be helpful. However, this procedure requires a considerably greater level of attention to group coherence. It is usually used by technical divers in cave and wreck penetration, where the advantages are sufficient to compensate for the added task loading, and the divers are competent to manage the additional complexity.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n#The system of group diving, where a group of tourists are taken on a sightseeing tour of a dive site by a dive leader and \"sheepdog\" assistant, who brings up the rear and herds the stragglers, is often practiced when the visibility is sufficient for it to be practicable. The divers in such groups may be entirely unfamiliar with each other. In this system, especially in large groups, poor visibility or strong currents, the weak, inexperienced, or inattentive individual divers can easily become detached from the group and lose the protection of stronger or more competent divers in the group. Communication is often difficult in these groups leading to increased risk, but they are not left with sole responsibility for a stranger of unknown competence. The \"sheepdog\" assistant is given the responsibility of being buddy to all the divers in the group, while not having a buddy of their own.<ref name=DavisSPUMS1990 />\n\n== History ==\nScuba diving has roots in the many small and enthusiastic snorkelling and spearfishing clubs in the decades just before and after the Second World War.<ref name=\"Dugan 1965\" /> After the invention of the \"aqualung\" by [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau|Cousteau]] and Gagnan, the first commercially underwater breathing apparatus became available for sale for sporting purposes in the late 1940s. As the new sport of scuba diving rapidly expanded through the 1950s, several sporting organisations\u2014notably the [[YMCA]]\u2014began programmes to train swimming enthusiasts in this new aquatic pastime, and began to codify what they believed were proper practises for this expanding sport.<ref name=\"Dugan 1966\" /> The YMCA considered the buddy system a useful corollary to the \"never swim alone\" rule of their swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau himself independently implemented a buddy system from the earliest days of exploratory diving after a number of harrowing diving incidents.<ref name=\"Hanna 2006\" /> The buddy system did have some useful aspects: cross checking of equipment before dives,  facilitating assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA remained a major force in the development of [[diver certification]] for the first 50 years of the sport. When these programmes were adopted by the emerging scuba certification agencies such as NAUI, PADI, and BS-AC, buddy diving developed into one of the two most widely known rules of the activity: \"Never hold your breath,\" and \"Never dive alone.\"<ref name=\"Brennan 1970\" />\n\nThe official terminology of recreational diving defines only the two extremes: buddy/team diving, and [[solo diving]]. In practice, many dives are somewhere between these extremes, in a continuum with some informal descriptors, and many behaviours deviate from the buddy diving standard.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Procedures==\n\n===Pairing of buddies===\nOpinions differ in how best to form buddy teams among a group of divers. One school of thought holds that buddies should always be closely matched in skills, experience, and interests so that one diver does not hold back the other in achieving an enjoyable dive.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This becomes particularly true when a diver is on an especially expensive or unique diving trip or holiday. This is a suitable arrangement for purely recreational dives. The problem with this approach is that it also pairs up ''inexperience'' \u2013 which can be dangerous if a diving emergency arises (fortunately, this is not statistically very often).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The alternative is to buddy-up a more experienced diver with a less experienced buddy to counter this \"experience gap\". This also helps to advance diving skills by having one buddy essentially act as a tutor. The [[British Sub Aqua Club]] strongly encourages and practices this approach, which is appropriate in a club environment where non-instructing members assist in post-certification training.<ref name=\"BsacSafeDiving\" /> The problems with this system, are that they may limit the more experienced diver's opportunity to dive as he would have wished, and that the less experienced diver is not an ideal buddy to the more experienced diver, who must take an unbalanced share of responsibility, and this constitutes an informal training scenario.  Compatibility problems are magnified when divers who do not know one another are paired off as buddies by the dive operator.<ref name=\"Halstead2004\" /> Numerous harrowing stories abound about diving with \"the tail-end-Charlie\" or the \"buddy from hell\" out of such practices.<ref name=\"divernet\" /> The \"perfect buddy\" is a long term friend or acquaintance, a partner who matches one's own high level of diving skills, who has the same interests, the same stamina and fitness, and who enjoys the companionship in sharing enjoyable diving.<ref name=\"Halstead 2000\" />  Although the principal reason for instituting the buddy system is the mitigation of the risks in diving, the sharing of diving experiences and the enjoyment of being paired together with a friend, family member, or keen fellow enthusiast while on a dive ranks very highly in the reasons many divers enjoy the recreation of scuba diving.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Equipment use and tasks within the buddy team===\nThe buddy system is expected to provide a level of [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] within the pair of divers, as a safety backup in case of any equipment failure. Within the overall buddy pair almost all equipment can be seen as part of a combined \"redundant system\": two tanks, two depth gauges/ [[dive computer]]s, two lights, two knives or line-cutters, \u2013 even two brains. During the dive, measurement instruments (gauges, dive computers, compass, etc.) are available to cross-check one another, a second set of life support equipment (i.e. gas supply) is there as a backup in case of a failure in one of the divers' systems.  Sometimes a single special-purpose but non-critical piece of equipment is shared by the buddy team, like a single [[Surface marker buoy|deployable surface marker buoy]] on which to ascend and mark the team\u2019s position or a single underwater metal detector. For the system to work effectively, a buddy team must have a shared and agreed dive plan, and both divers must accept the responsibilities of executing it.<ref name=\"Orr 2007a\" />  The plan will specify the basic parameters of the dive such as maximum depth, route, duration, critical breathing gas pressures and decompression plan, who will lead and who follows, buddy separation procedures, etc. and the dive objectives: is it general sightseeing, to view a wreck, photography,  hunting a type of game?. In technical diving, these objectives often become much more complex and very specific \u2013 penetration of a particular part of a cave to a particular point. Many diving objectives require allocation of specific roles and responsibilities.  For example, in lobster hunting on the west coast of America, buddy teams often split into assigned roles of hunter-game catcher, and stower-catchbag carrier, and overall dive success depends on teamwork and carrying out assigned roles.<ref name=\"Barsky 2000\" />\n\n===Provision of emergency breathing gas===\nAn important aspect of the buddy function is providing breathing gas in an out of air (OOA) emergency.  This can happen in the event of a regulator failure or using up most of the breathing gas while inattentive, distracted, or dealing with an urgent problem. Part of an effective buddy system is preventing and avoiding out of air emergencies by effective gas management, and effectively managing emergencies when they do occur in spite of diligent monitoring.<ref name=\"Davis 2019\" />\n\nIn the early years of scuba, each diver carried a single second-stage regulator, and in the case of an out of air emergency, the buddy pair made an emergency ascent to the surface while the two divers took turns buddy breathing from the mouthpiece of remaining functional scuba set.<ref name=\"Brennan 1970a\" />  Though this system worked effectively enough in a swimming pool or in open water practice sessions, and sometimes worked for skilled and disciplined divers in actual emergencies, in some cases stress and physical difficulties made it fail.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nTo simplify the procedure for air sharing, the recreational diving industry moved to a configuration that provided each diver an additional second-stage regulator, as a backup to the primary. The backup is known variously as the ''octopus stage'', ''backup'', ''secondary'', or (obsolescent) ''safe second''. The term ''octopus'' came about because several regulator and other hoses hanging from the first stage made the unit look a bit like an octopus.<ref name=\"Graver 1985\" />  Two general systems have evolved for carrying and deploying the backup demand valve\u2014one more prevalent in recreational diving and the other commonly found in technical diving (although some crossover exists). In both systems, each diver carries two demand valves. They may be attached to the first-stage regulator of a single tank or to two first stage regulators of twin cylinders. The primary regulator is for normal breathing during the dive, and the secondary regulator (\"octopus\") is a backup for oneself or an out-of-air buddy.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nTwo basic procedures are in common use: Donating the primary and donating the octopus.\n\n====Donating the primary====\n[[File:DecompressionPrepEdit.JPG|thumb|230px|The long hose - note looping about divers neck]]\nA system recommended by some organisations, mostly those involved in technical diving (GUE,<ref name=\"evolution\" /> CMAS-ISA, other tech and cave diving groups) is to equip the regulator normally used throughout the dive (the \"primary\") with a long hose, typically {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} long. This is the regulator that is donated to a diver who is out of air. The \"secondary\" or \"backup\" regulator is then reserved for the donor diver and is on a short hose, suspended just under the chin by a \"necklace\" that can break free in an emergency. The principal advantage is that the diver who is in trouble receives a regulator that is known to be working and provides breathing gas appropriate for the current depth\u2014and quite possibly gets air more quickly than if the clipped off octopus were donated. Donation of the long hose is particularly beneficial for cave and wreck penetration diving where divers sharing air may need to pass through small openings, as the hose length lets them swim in single file where necessary. The length of the hose also allows the divers to swim side-by-side or one above the other in all possible arrangements. Another advantage is that the secondary regulator stows out of the way, protected from strong water flow, contamination and snags, and where the diver can notice if it leaks\u2014but remains accessible without requiring the use of hands, as divers can pick up the mouthpiece by dipping their chin.<ref name=\"Jablonski 2006\" /><ref name=\"hog1997\" />  This arrangement is slightly more cumbersome to use and requires greater skill to wear, deploy and recover. Benefits may not outweigh disadvantages for open water divers in relatively low hazard conditions.<ref name=\"Rowley 2009\" /><ref name=\"Rowley 2009a\" />\n\n====Donating the octopus====\n[[File:Buzo.jpg|thumb|230px|The recreational octopus - note color and placement in \"Golden Triangle\"]]\nThe octopus is usually clearly marked, the convention is a yellow hose and yellow second stage though a luminescent green is sometimes favoured. Many dive equipment manufacturers provide secondary regulators marked exactly to this standard and \"tune\" them specifically to the role of octopus. The octopus second stage is usually stowed in an easily located, accessible position and is easily detachable from the device that holds it. Most recreational agencies recommend or specify<ref name=\"Reed 2010\" /><ref name=\"PADI 2010\" /> that this position be in the \"Golden Triangle\" drawn between a divers chin and nipples.<ref name=\"Orr 2007\" /> The octopus hose is usually made long enough (1.2 metres (4&nbsp;ft)) so that the divers are not inconveniently crowded against one another when the octopus regulator is in use.  The procedure to provide the octopus is that the donor diver hands over the octopus<ref name=\"Graver 2003\"  />\u2014but if a buddy does not notice the buddy\u2019s distress, the out-of-air diver has been taught to take the stowed octopus.  An advantage with this method is that donor handover is consistent in both octopus handover and for handover of any independent bailout device such as a removable pony bottle.  As part of pre-dive checks, the team should review the procedure for handing-over or accessing the octopus in out-of-air emergency. In recreational diving, if good gas management practice has been followed, either buddy should have sufficient air for both to safely ascend to the surface, even if the emergency occurs at the end of the dive. This may not be the case where an unplanned decompression obligation exists.<ref name=\"Gilliam 1995\" />\n\n=== Standardisation of configurations as a safety advantage ===\nIt is helpful if divers wear their equipment in a way that follows standardised conventions so that buddy partners know where to access that equipment if called on to assist their buddy. As there are several conventions, and divers who do not follow locally popular conventions, it is important for divers planning to dive as buddies to familiarise themselves with the configuration used by the other in the pre-dive checks.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Communication between buddies===\n{{further|Diver communications}}\nDiving takes place in what Cousteau called \"[[The Silent World]].\"  The relative silence of the sea is one of the enjoyable aspects of scuba diving, but does not help foster natural means of communication within a buddy team.  If they haven't invested in expensive full-face masks that incorporate through-water voice transmission, buddy divers must communicate via non-audible means: standardized hand signals or submersible writing slates.<ref name=\"RSTC signals\" />\n\n====Hand signals====\n[[File:Diving signal ok.jpg|thumb|Diving signal ok]]\nIn an effort to insure universal, easily understood signals between divers,<ref name=\"Batin 2007\" /> the [[Recreational Scuba Training Council]] agencies together defined a set of [[Diver communications#Hand signals|hand signals]] intended for universal use, which are taught to diving students early in their entry level diving courses.<ref name=\"RSTC signals\" />  Hand signals may also have more than one variation that may benefit when one hand is occupied, or in limited visibility.\n\n====Underwater slates====\nUnderwater slates are useful when there is more detailed information to communicate or remember.  A large variety of designs are available. Some clip to the divers BCD, some fit into pockets, some integrated with other units such as the compass and some attach to the wrist or forearm with bungee straps.  The basic parts comprise just an underwater pencil attached to a plastic board by a short tether, and a way to attach these to a convenient point on the diver's equipment.  Slates are particularly useful for information that must be written down prior to a dive and referenced during the dive: elements of the dive plan (depths, durations, decompression schedule) or a drawn map of the dive area.<ref name=\"Prosser\" />\n\n====Buddy lines====\nA buddy line is a line or strap physically tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low visibility conditions. A buddy line is usually a short length of about two meters with a floating element between divers to reduce risk of snagging on the bottom.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A buddy line is a means of communication. It doesn't need to be particularly strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads. Divers may communicate by [[Diver communications#Rope signals|rope signals]], but more usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. Divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency, which is done via a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one free hand.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Other communication methods====\n\nIn more advanced diving (particularly penetration diving) divers often use additional [[Diver communications|underwater communication]] methods, including signalling with lights, pulls along connecting lines, or tapping on tanks.<ref name=\"Prosser\" />\n\nUltrasonic signalling devices that attract the buddy's attention by vibration have been marketed and may have some limited utility.<ref name=\"Gronfeldt 2016\" />\n\nGiving the lack of an auditory communication medium, it is surprising just how easily used and effective these types of underwater communication tools can be for the buddy team when they are fully utilized.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== Responsibility ==\n\nWith buddy diving, each of the divers is presumed to have a responsibility to the other.<ref name=LoThesis /> The actual legal responsibilities may vary between jurisdictions and are seldom if ever clear. The buddies are expected to monitor each other, to stay close enough together to help in an emergency, to behave safely and to follow the plan agreed by the group before the dive.<ref name=SPUMShalstead/> When the system fails, it is generally because one of the divers does not fulfill his or her responsibilities as a buddy.<ref name=UHMSabstract /> If one of the divers is incapable of providing the expected assistance the buddy system has already failed.\n\nThe responsibilities of each buddy during a recreational dive are generally accepted to be:<ref name=\"Graver 1984\" /><ref name=\"Batin 2007a\" /><ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" /> \n* Forming an agreed dive plan (dive objective, course to follow, depth limits and distance from exit point), agreeing on air pressure at which the dive is terminated and ascent started, who leads and who follows, and reviewing possible emergency measures\n* Helping a buddy get in and out of their equipment, particularly in assisting donning of heavier items of diving equipment and adjusting hard to reach items\n* Checking the buddy\u2019s equipment setup before the dive to assure that it is complete, in proper working order and configuration prior to the dive\n* Keeping track of the other buddy and staying together for the entire dive \u2013 maintaining a separation that can be closed up within only a couple of seconds\n* Maintaining active communication throughout the dive by hand signals and regular monitoring of each other's gauges\u2014and checking that the buddy is okay with the conditions and progress of the dive via such hand signals\n* Managing dive duration and profile by following the most limiting conditions indicated by the gauges and dive computers\n* If separation does occur, searching to reestablish contact with the buddy for one minute, and if that fails safely returning to the surface to re-establish contact\n* In the case of a dive emergency, assisting a buddy to extricate from the danger\u2014particularly in the case of entanglement, out of air situations, or rescue assistance for an immobilized or unresponsive buddy\n\nThese responsibilities may not be legally binding. A recreational diver is not normally expected to take unacceptable risks to their own safety to assist another recreational diver.<ref name=Coleman />\n\nThe US Navy does not require buddy diving in all circumstances, but it does specify that buddy divers are responsible for both the assigned task and each other's safety. They must:<ref name=usn />\n* maintain contact by keeping the dive partner in sight or if the visibility is poor, by using a buddy line. \n* know the meaning of all hand and line-pull signals.\n* acknowledge signals immediately and assume that the failure of a buddy to respond indicates an emergency.\n* monitor the activity and apparent condition of the buddy, and if it appears abnormal, investigate the cause and take immediate appropriate action. \n* never leave the buddy unless the buddy is trapped or entangled and cannot be freed without additional assistance. In this case, the diver must mark the position of the distressed diver with a line and float or other locating device. \n* have a lost-diver plan for every dive, and follow the plan if contact is broken.\n* if one member of a dive team aborts a dive, for any reason, the other member must also abort and both must surface, and\n* know the proper method of buddy breathing.\n\nOther professional divers' buddy responsibilities are likely to be similar.\n\n==Disadvantages of the buddy system==\n\nWith the increased popularity of solo diving as a possible alternative to the buddy system, there has been debate as to what really constitutes safe diving practise and how divers can best control the risks associated with their sport.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />  Statistically speaking, scuba is a reasonably safe activity,<ref name=\"bandolier\" /> with incidents of injury below several other \"risk\" sports such as football, horse riding or even tennis.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Yet unlike these other sports, scuba divers are in a hostile environment for which humans are not adapted, breathing from a portable and limited capacity life support system. Under these conditions, fatality is always a possible outcome, as even simple equipment or procedural problems can be mishandled. In dealing with this reality a number of major concerns about potentially inherent flaws or negative impacts that can exist within the buddy system have been identified.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> Few, if any, of these problems, are defects in the concept of the buddy system, they are problems with the application of the system.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n\n{{quote|Every time I read, in a accident {{sic}} report, that the buddy system failed, I get livid. The buddy system does not fail, it is the people using it that have the problems. The system is fine, it is the implementation that falls down.<ref name=\"Egstrom 1992\" />|Glen Egstrom|''Emergency air sharing''}}\n\n* The amount of discipline, effort, and attention needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has other things to do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that there won't be a problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer often annoys at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n* The main charge made against the buddy system as practiced is that it has been grossly overrated as a means of risk mitigation. Critics say that the buddy system acts as a crutch to give unjustified confidence to divers who individually do not have either the skills or the discipline to adequately deal with any real diving problems.<ref name=Coutanche2006 /><ref name=Halstead/><ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> This creates a situation where divers become dependent on the \"security blanket\" of being with another diver. The reality may be that the buddy diver on which many divers depend is often no better able to handle an emergency than the dependent buddy.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> The fostering of this false security by diving agencies that overemphasise the effectiveness of the buddy system, develops a sense of complacency in divers about their capability to deal with these problems, a capability which they often do not have.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> This complacency holds divers back from focusing on improving their lifesaving skills and capabilities.\n* Critics state that the proponents of the buddy system project the image of a \u201ctotally reliable buddy\u201d that does not, in fact, exist in reality.<ref name=\"Halstead\" /><ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> Some buddies lack skills or experience and some are unfit. The major problem is that certain diver personality types are outright dangers; these types have been described as \" the untrained diver\", \"the high-flyer\", \"the falsely confident diver\", \"the angry diver\",<ref name=\"Halstead\" /> or \"the buddy from hell\".<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />  The bad buddy problem is compounded by training that compels a diver to \u201cstick with his buddy\u201d no matter what, leading to the situation that it is the bad buddy who sets the criteria of how (badly) the dive is carried out. Both the solo diving and the buddy diving community have come to a similar conclusion on how to best address the issues of safety in both systems \u2013 self-sufficiency. In the buddy system, this means that ''both'' divers are capable of looking after themselves and sorting out almost any problems, but they still dive together as a backup to further enhance their safety as well as to share and enjoy their diving experience.<ref name=\"Wade 2011\" />\n* Divers are more likely to attempt a dive they are uneasy with if they feel they would let the buddy down if they canceled.<ref name=\"Halstead\" />\n* Given the emphasis on the requirement that all buddy divers be able to aid their buddy in an emergency, over the last decade there have been some agency-approved diving practices established where certain types of buddies do not actually meet this criterion. This is evident in the practice of scuba diving for children. Initiated by PADI, in an effort to expand scuba diving into the realm of becoming a \u201cfamily activity\u201d like skiing, the certification of children has been adopted by most other recreational diving agencies with their own diving programmes for children.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} These typically include two levels, depending on the child's age. PADI has six courses/levels for children,<ref name=\"PADI 2016\" /> in which a child from the age of 10 can become a buddy diver in open water situations. The other buddy in this team can be a certified parent or a dive professional. Serious concerns have been expressed about this general policy of having child buddies,<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\" /> among the concerns is the mental anguish and psychological damage that may be caused to a child who fails to rescue a buddy parent.<ref name=\"Warren 2001\" /> The first child buddy death in British waters occurred in 2008.<ref name=\"Smith 2008\" /> The first double fatality of a buddy pair in which one diver was a minor occurred with a British father and son in Gozo in 2006.<ref name=\"BBC News 2006\" /> Proponents of dive training for children point to the great enjoyment and sense of wonderment the children feel when introduced to the underwater world<ref name=\"Baliadvertiser\" /> and point out that other family sporting activities also have unfortunate incidents of serious injury to children.\n\n===Liability of the diving buddy===\n\nLiability issues strongly affect the structure of the diving industry, its organisation and even the implementation of recommended diving practices \u2013 and this is very much the case with buddy diving.  Diving is a risky sport, where serious accidents occasionally occur. In an increasingly [[Lawsuit|litigious]] world, accidents trigger a search for \u201cblame\u201d, and aspersions of blame often trigger ensuing litigation. It is a natural thing for those who may face the potential risks of litigation to take measures to mitigate these risks.  Diving certification agencies must necessarily insure themselves against liability risks and must act to minimise the cost of this insurance for both themselves and their operatives. The buddy system, beneficial as it can be in enhancing diver safety, has the legal effect of  creating an involved intermediary person between the certifying agency and any injured party, an intermediary who could be easily identified as not having provided \u201cduty of care\u201d if an accident occurs.<ref name=Coleman />  This may afford a legal cushion for the agency, or trainer, or boat - but it is not exactly good news for someone acting in the role of a buddy. The more skilled the buddy partner, the more these duties of care may be assumed to increase.\n\nLiability waivers are signed whenever a diver interacts with an operative of the diving industry, e.g. the training agent or dive boat.<ref name=\"BDL\" /> No such waiver is commonplace for the buddy in a buddy team. As case law develops, more precedents become established for situations where buddy action may make them particularly liable.<ref name=Coleman/>  It is recommended{{by whom|date=April 2013}} now that buddy divers carry insurance that provides coverage of themselves against legal actions by buddies, particularly if diving takes place in those countries where a culture of litigation may exist.  This is particularly necessary for scuba diving professionals who earn a living in the recreational diving industry, when they \"buddy-up\"  More experienced/more qualified divers are also considered to bear a higher duty of care for their less qualified buddies,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and therefore a serious burden can be placed on a vacationing diver asked to buddy up with a stranger, especially in litigious jurisdictions.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal bar|Underwater diving }}\n* {{annotated link|Rule of thirds (diving)}}\n* {{annotated link|Solo diving}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em |refs=\n\n<ref name=\"bandolier\">{{cite web |url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Risk/sports.html |title=Risk of dying and sporting activities |date=8 August 2008 |publisher=Bandolier |accessdate=8 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904102144/http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Risk/sports.html |archivedate=4 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Baliadvertiser\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baliadvertiser.biz/articles/feature/2011/scuba_diving.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124105853/http://baliadvertiser.biz/articles/feature/2011/scuba_diving.html |archivedate=2011-11-24 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Barsky 2000\">{{cite book|last=Barsky |first=Kristine |title=California Lobster Diving |publisher=Hammerhead Press |date=2000 |pages=45\u201350 |isbn=0-9674305-2-6}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Batin 2007\">{{cite book |last=Batin |first=John |title=The Scuba Diving Handbook |publisher=A.C.

It is a set of safety procedures intended to improve the chances of avoiding or surviving [[Diving hazards and precautions|accidents]] in or [[underwater|under water]] by having divers dive in a group of two or sometimes three. When using the buddy system, members of the group dive together and co-operate with each other, so that they can help or [[diver rescue|rescue]] each other in the event of an emergency.<ref name=SPUMShalstead /> This is most effective if both divers are competent in all relevant skills and sufficiently aware of the situation that they can respond in time, which is a matter of both attitude and competence.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n\nIn [[recreational diving]], a pair of divers is usually best for buddy diving. With threesomes, one diver can easily lose the attention of the other two. (Groups with more than three divers are not using the buddy system.) The system is likely to be effective in mitigating out-of-air emergencies, non-diving medical emergencies and entrapment in [[rope]]s or [[Net (device)|net]]s. When used with the [[buddy check]] it can help avoid the omission, misuse and failure of [[diving equipment]].\n\n{{quote|The buddy system is the situation which occurs when two divers of similar interest and equal experience and ability share a dive, continuously monitoring each other throughout the entry, the dive and the exit, and remaining within such distance that they could render immediate assistance to each other if required.<ref name=SPUMShalstead/>|[[Bob Halstead]]|''Line dancing and the buddy system''}}\n\nIn [[technical diving]] activities such as [[cave diving]], threesomes are considered an acceptable practice.<ref name=exley /> This is usually referred to as team diving to distinguish it from buddy diving in pairs.\n\nWhen professional divers dive as buddy pairs their responsibility to each other is specified as part of standard operating procedures, code of practice or governing legislation.\n\n== Purpose ==\nBuddy diving is intended to enhance the safety of scuba diving by having two or three competent divers acting as safety divers for each other during a dive in conditions that are within their capabilities, and using equipment that is familiar to all team members. In principle, each diver is capable of rendering assistance to the other in any reasonably foreseeable contingency, and willing to do so within the scope of acceptable personal risk.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\nThe buddy divers are mutually responsible for the safety of the buddy pair above and below the water, and this responsibility commences when the divers prepare for the dive. It is assumed that it is unlikely that both divers will experience the same problem at the same time, allowing the diver  not in trouble to assist when the other diver has difficulties.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n\nThis purpose is theoretically fulfilled by the buddy assisting the diver to kit up, checking that the diver's equipment is correctly assembled and mounted, assisting the diver into the water where appropriate, checking for leaks, monitoring gas usage, providing an alternate breathing gas supply in case of an emergency, performing a rescue if the diver is unable to manage an emergency, and assisting the diver out of the water after the dive if appropriate.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" /> This system can mitigate high risk emergencies when performed to the standards. This is not a controversial issue. This level of assistance requires the buddy to be familiar with the diver's equipment in detail, including the adjustment of harness and emergency release of weighting systems, control of inflation and dump valves, siting and attachment of secondary demand valve, knife and any other safety equipment. Recreational divers may be trained in some or all of these skills depending on their certification.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" /> The buddy system is not considered sufficient on its own, Dive planning, medical and physical fitness to dive, suitable and correctly functioning equipment, appropriate surface support, skills, experience and knowledge are all part of the diving safety system.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" /> To be fully effective, the buddy system is applied to an agreed dive plan, with effective communications, the willingness and ability to assist each other in all reasonably foreseeable circumstances associated with the dive plan, and the will to follow the dive plan.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n\n== Requirements ==\nFor the buddy system to function effectively, each buddy must be sufficiently competent to provide the required service, and be present when it is needed. Several conditions must exist for the buddy system to succeed:<!--ref: SADoL CoP for Scientific diving? DIR fundamentals? -->\n*The divers must know and accept the dive plan.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n*Equipment must be compatible with the dive plan, and reasonably foreseeable contingencies.\n*Divers must be fit to dive in the expected conditions.\n*They must be competent to perform the dive plan and carry out procedures to deal with reasonably foreseeable contingencies.<ref name=\"CoP Scientific\" />\n*The divers must know how to operate their own and their buddy's equipment, as they may have to operate it under stressful conditions.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n*They must be willing to accept increased personal risk in the event that they need to assist a distressed buddy, and must understand when such risk becomes unacceptable.\n*They must remain in the immediate vicinity of each other during the entire dive, close enough to communicate adequately and to render assistance in time.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n*Divers must monitor and communicate as needed to remain aware of the status of themselves and other team members, their decompression status and their life-support equipment throughout the dive, from entering the water until the last diver leaves the water.<ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" />\n*Both divers are equally responsible for ensuring that they know where the other is, and that the other knows where they are at all times. This is the usual point at which the buddy system fails and divers are separated, making all the other conditions irrelevant. At this point they have lost the potential assistance of the buddy which is the main purpose of the system. Sometimes they find each other again. Usually nobody dies.\n\nMost recreational divers never advance to a high level of competency as might be indicated by certification and experience, and furthermore, many divers do not dive sufficiently frequently to maintain their skills.<ref name=Coleman /> Nevertheless, they are routinely expected to provide assistance to their dive buddies in the event of an emergency, and are also routinely allocated to dive with complete strangers who may be using unfamiliar equipment. It is standard practice for many, if not most diving charter organisations to allocate buddy pairs among divers they have never assessed for competence on the basis of their certification and claimed experience. Optimal conditions are seldom encountered on open-water recreational dives.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n\n=== Alternatives ===\nThe three alternatives, [[solo diving]], diving in teams of three, and diving as an individual in a large group, may have disadvantages when compared to the buddy system, especially for the novice:\n#Although solo diving is practiced by some recreational divers, it is only considered acceptably safe if the diver is totally self-sufficient.<ref name=\"Carney 2007\" /> This usually entails a completely redundant gas supply, such as a [[diving cylinder|pony bottle or an isolation manifold]], and the competence to use it in an emergency. Self-rescue is not possible in some cases, such as severe cases of entrapment in ropes and nets and during medical emergencies where the diver loses consciousness or is otherwise severely impaired in their ability to respond appropriately.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n#Three diver teams can be effective for safety and backup, as generally, a problem that requires assistance affects only one diver, and having two divers to assist can be helpful. However, this procedure requires a considerably greater level of attention to group coherence. It is usually used by technical divers in cave and wreck penetration, where the advantages are sufficient to compensate for the added task loading, and the divers are competent to manage the additional complexity.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n#The system of group diving, where a group of tourists are taken on a sightseeing tour of a dive site by a dive leader and \"sheepdog\" assistant, who brings up the rear and herds the stragglers, is often practiced when the visibility is sufficient for it to be practicable. The divers in such groups may be entirely unfamiliar with each other. In this system, especially in large groups, poor visibility or strong currents, the weak, inexperienced, or inattentive individual divers can easily become detached from the group and lose the protection of stronger or more competent divers in the group. Communication is often difficult in these groups leading to increased risk, but they are not left with sole responsibility for a stranger of unknown competence. The \"sheepdog\" assistant is given the responsibility of being buddy to all the divers in the group, while not having a buddy of their own.<ref name=DavisSPUMS1990 />\n\n== History ==\nScuba diving has roots in the many small and enthusiastic snorkelling and spearfishing clubs in the decades just before and after the Second World War.<ref name=\"Dugan 1965\" /> After the invention of the \"aqualung\" by [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau|Cousteau]] and Gagnan, the first commercially underwater breathing apparatus became available for sale for sporting purposes in the late 1940s. As the new sport of scuba diving rapidly expanded through the 1950s, several sporting organisations\u2014notably the [[YMCA]]\u2014began programmes to train swimming enthusiasts in this new aquatic pastime, and began to codify what they believed were proper practises for this expanding sport.<ref name=\"Dugan 1966\" /> The YMCA considered the buddy system a useful corollary to the \"never swim alone\" rule of their swimming and lifesaving programmes. Cousteau himself independently implemented a buddy system from the earliest days of exploratory diving after a number of harrowing diving incidents.<ref name=\"Hanna 2006\" /> The buddy system did have some useful aspects: cross checking of equipment before dives,  facilitating assistance for possible entanglement problems or equipment failures, and enhancement of the social nature of diving. The YMCA remained a major force in the development of [[diver certification]] for the first 50 years of the sport. When these programmes were adopted by the emerging scuba certification agencies such as NAUI, PADI, and BS-AC, buddy diving developed into one of the two most widely known rules of the activity: \"Never hold your breath,\" and \"Never dive alone.\"<ref name=\"Brennan 1970\" />\n\nThe official terminology of recreational diving defines only the two extremes: buddy/team diving, and [[solo diving]]. In practice, many dives are somewhere between these extremes, in a continuum with some informal descriptors, and many behaviours deviate from the buddy diving standard.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Procedures==\n\n===Pairing of buddies===\nOpinions differ in how best to form buddy teams among a group of divers. One school of thought holds that buddies should always be closely matched in skills, experience, and interests so that one diver does not hold back the other in achieving an enjoyable dive.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This becomes particularly true when a diver is on an especially expensive or unique diving trip or holiday. This is a suitable arrangement for purely recreational dives. The problem with this approach is that it also pairs up ''inexperience'' \u2013 which can be dangerous if a diving emergency arises (fortunately, this is not statistically very often).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The alternative is to buddy-up a more experienced diver with a less experienced buddy to counter this \"experience gap\". This also helps to advance diving skills by having one buddy essentially act as a tutor. The [[British Sub Aqua Club]] strongly encourages and practices this approach, which is appropriate in a club environment where non-instructing members assist in post-certification training.<ref name=\"BsacSafeDiving\" /> The problems with this system, are that they may limit the more experienced diver's opportunity to dive as he would have wished, and that the less experienced diver is not an ideal buddy to the more experienced diver, who must take an unbalanced share of responsibility, and this constitutes an informal training scenario.  Compatibility problems are magnified when divers who do not know one another are paired off as buddies by the dive operator.<ref name=\"Halstead2004\" /> Numerous harrowing stories abound about diving with \"the tail-end-Charlie\" or the \"buddy from hell\" out of such practices.<ref name=\"divernet\" /> The \"perfect buddy\" is a long term friend or acquaintance, a partner who matches one's own high level of diving skills, who has the same interests, the same stamina and fitness, and who enjoys the companionship in sharing enjoyable diving.<ref name=\"Halstead 2000\" />  Although the principal reason for instituting the buddy system is the mitigation of the risks in diving, the sharing of diving experiences and the enjoyment of being paired together with a friend, family member, or keen fellow enthusiast while on a dive ranks very highly in the reasons many divers enjoy the recreation of scuba diving.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Equipment use and tasks within the buddy team===\nThe buddy system is expected to provide a level of [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] within the pair of divers, as a safety backup in case of any equipment failure. Within the overall buddy pair almost all equipment can be seen as part of a combined \"redundant system\": two tanks, two depth gauges/ [[dive computer]]s, two lights, two knives or line-cutters, \u2013 even two brains. During the dive, measurement instruments (gauges, dive computers, compass etc.) are available to cross check one another, a second set of life support equipment (i.e. gas supply) is there as a backup in case of a failure in one of the divers' systems.  Sometimes a single special-purpose but non-critical piece of equipment is shared by the buddy team, like a single [[Surface marker buoy|deployable surface marker buoy]] on which to ascend and mark the team\u2019s position or a single underwater metal detector. For the system to work effectively, a buddy team must have a shared and agreed dive plan, and both divers must accept the responsibilities of executing it.<ref name=\"Orr 2007a\" />  The plan will specify the basic parameters of the dive such as maximum depth, route, duration, critical breathing gas pressures and decompression plan, who will leads and who follows, buddy separation procedures, etc. and the dive objectives: is it general sightseeing, to view a wreck, photography,  hunting a type of game?. In technical diving these objectives often become much more complex and very specific \u2013 penetration of a particular part of a cave to a particular point. Many diving objectives require allocation of specific roles and responsibilities.  For example, in lobster hunting on the west coast of America, buddy teams often split into assigned roles of hunter-game catcher, and stower-catchbag carrier, and overall dive success depends on teamwork and carrying out assigned roles.<ref name=\"Barsky 2000\" />\n\n===Provision of emergency breathing gas===\nAn important aspect of the buddy function is providing breathing gas in an out of air (OOA) emergency.  This can happen in the event of a regulator failure or using up most of the breathing gas while inattentive, distracted, or dealing with an urgent problem. Part of an effetive buddy system is preventing and avoiding out of air emergencies by effective gas management, and effectively managing emergencies when they do occur in spite of diligent monitoring.<ref name=\"Davis 2019\" />\n\nIn the early years of scuba, each diver carried a single second-stage regulator, and in the case of an out of air emergency, the buddy pair made an emergency ascent to the surface while the two divers took turns buddy breathing from the mouthpiece of remaining functional scuba set.<ref name=\"Brennan 1970a\" />  Though this system worked effectively enough in a swimming pool or in open water practice sessions, and sometimes worked for skilled and disciplined divers in actual emergencies, in some cases stress and physical difficulties made it fail.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nTo simplify the procedure for air sharing, the recreational diving industry moved to a configuration that provided each diver an additional second-stage regulator, as a backup to the primary. The backup is known variously as the ''octopus stage'', ''backup'', ''secondary'', or (obsolescent) ''safe second''. The term ''octopus'' came about because several regulator and other hoses hanging from the first stage made the unit look a bit like an octopus.<ref name=\"Graver 1985\" />  Two general systems have evolved for carrying and deploying the backup demand valve\u2014one more prevalent in recreational diving and the other commonly found in technical diving (although some crossover exists). In both systems, each diver carries two demand valves. They may be attached to the first-stage regulator of a single tank or to two first stage regulators of twin cylinders. The primary regulator is for normal breathing during the dive, and the secondary regulator (\"octopus\") is a backup for oneself or an out-of-air buddy.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nTwo basic procedures are in common use: Donating the primary and donating the octopus.\n\n====Donating the primary====\n[[File:DecompressionPrepEdit.JPG|thumb|230px|The long hose - note looping about divers neck]]\nA system recommended by some organisations, mostly those involved in technical diving (GUE,<ref name=\"evolution\" /> CMAS-ISA, other tech and cave diving groups) is to equip the regulator normally used throughout the dive (the \"primary\") with a long hose, typically {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} long. This is the regulator that is donated to a diver who is out of air. The \"secondary\" or \"backup\" regulator is then reserved for the donor diver and is on a short hose, suspended just under the chin by a \"necklace\" that can break free in an emergency. The principal advantage is that the diver who is in trouble receives a regulator that is known to be working and provides breathing gas appropriate for the current depth\u2014and quite possibly gets air more quickly than if the clipped off octopus were donated. Donation of the long hose is particularly beneficial for cave and wreck penetration diving where divers sharing air may need to pass through small openings, as the hose length lets them swim in single file where necessary. The length of the hose also allows the divers to swim side-by-side or one above the other in all possible arrangements. Another advantage is that the secondary regulator stows out of the way, protected from strong water flow, contamination and snags, and where the diver can notice if it leaks\u2014but remains accessible without requiring the use of hands, as divers can pick up the mouthpiece by dipping their chin.<ref name=\"Jablonski 2006\" /><ref name=\"hog1997\" />  This arrangement is slightly more cumbersome to use and requires greater skill to wear, deploy and recover. Benefits may not outweigh disadvantages for open water divers in relatively low hazard conditions.<ref name=\"Rowley 2009\" /><ref name=\"Rowley 2009a\" />\n\n====Donating the octopus====\n[[File:Buzo.jpg|thumb|230px|The recreational octopus - note color and placement in \"Golden Triangle\"]]\nThe octopus is usually clearly marked, the convention is a yellow hose and yellow second stage though a luminescent green is sometimes favoured. Many dive equipment manufacturers provide secondary regulators marked exactly to this standard and \"tune\" them specifically to the role of octopus. The octopus second stage is usually stowed in an easily located, accessible position and is easily detachable from the device that holds it. Most recreational agencies recommend or specify<ref name=\"Reed 2010\" /><ref name=\"PADI 2010\" /> that this position be in the \"Golden Triangle\" drawn between a divers chin and nipples.<ref name=\"Orr 2007\" /> The octopus hose is usually made long enough (1.2 metres (4&nbsp;ft)) so that the divers are not inconveniently crowded against one another when the octopus regulator is in use.  The procedure to provide the octopus is that the donor diver hands over the octopus<ref name=\"Graver 2003\"  />\u2014but if a buddy does not notice the buddy\u2019s distress, the out-of-air diver has been taught to take the stowed octopus.  An advantage with this method is that donor handover is consistent in both octopus handover and for handover of any independent bailout device such as a removable pony bottle.  As part of pre-dive checks, the team should review the procedure for handing-over or accessing the octopus in out-of-air emergency. In recreational diving, if good gas management practice has been followed, either buddy should have sufficient air for both to safely ascend to the surface, even if the emergency occurs at the end of the dive. This may not be the case where an unplanned decompression obligation exists.<ref name=\"Gilliam 1995\" />\n\n=== Standardisation of configurations as a safety advantage ===\nIt is helpful if divers wear their equipment in a way that follows standardised conventions so that buddy partners know where to access that equipment if called on to assist their buddy. As there are several conventions, and divers who do not follow locally popular conventions, it is important for divers planning to dive as buddies to familiarise themselves with the configuration used by the other in the pre-dive checks.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Communication between buddies===\n{{further|Diver communications}}\nDiving takes place in what Cousteau called \"[[The Silent World]].\"  The relative silence of the sea is one of the enjoyable aspects of scuba diving, but does not help foster natural means of communication within a buddy team.  If they haven't invested in expensive full-face masks that incorporate through-water voice transmission, buddy divers must communicate via non-audible means: standardized hand signals or submersible writing slates.<ref name=\"RSTC signals\" />\n\n====Hand signals====\n[[File:Diving signal ok.jpg|thumb|Diving signal ok]]\nIn an effort to insure universal, easily understood signals between divers,<ref name=\"Batin 2007\" /> the [[Recreational Scuba Training Council]] agencies together defined a set of [[Diver communications#Hand signals|hand signals]] intended for universal use, which are taught to diving students early in their entry level diving courses.<ref name=\"RSTC signals\" />  Hand signals may also have more than one variation that may benefit when one hand is occupied, or in limited visibility.\n\n====Underwater slates====\nUnderwater slates are useful when there is more detailed information to communicate or remember.  A large variety of designs are available. Some clip to the divers BCD, some fit into pockets, some integrated with other units such as the compass and some attach to the wrist or forearm with bungee straps.  The basic parts comprise just an underwater pencil attached to a plastic board by a short tether, and a way to attach these to a convenient point on the diver's equipment.  Slates are particularly useful for information that must be written down prior to a dive and referenced during the dive: elements of the dive plan (depths, durations, decompression schedule) or a drawn map of the dive area.<ref name=\"Prosser\" />\n\n====Buddy lines====\nA buddy line is a line or strap physically tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low visibility conditions. A buddy line is usually a short length of about two meters with a floating element between divers to reduce risk of snagging on the bottom.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A buddy line is a means of communication. It doesn't need to be particularly strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads. Divers may communicate by [[Diver communications#Rope signals|rope signals]], but more usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. Divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency, which is done via a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one free hand.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n====Other communication methods====\n\nIn more advanced diving (particularly penetration diving) divers often use additional [[Diver communications|underwater communication]] methods, including signalling with lights, pulls along connecting lines, or tapping on tanks.<ref name=\"Prosser\" />\n\nUltrasonic signalling devices that attract the buddy's attention by vibration have been marketed and may have some limited utility.<ref name=\"Gronfeldt 2016\" />\n\nGiving the lack of an auditory communication medium, it is surprising just how easily used and effective these types of underwater communication tools can be for the buddy team when they are fully utilized.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== Responsibility ==\n\nWith buddy diving, each of the divers is presumed to have a responsibility to the other.<ref name=LoThesis /> The actual legal responsibilities may vary between jurisdictions and are seldom if ever clear. The buddies are expected to monitor each other, to stay close enough together to help in an emergency, to behave safely and to follow the plan agreed by the group before the dive.<ref name=SPUMShalstead/> When the system fails, it is generally because one of the divers does not fulfill his or her responsibilities as a buddy.<ref name=UHMSabstract /> If one of the divers is incapable of providing the expected assistance the buddy system has already failed.\n\nThe responsibilities of each buddy during a recreational dive are generally accepted to be:<ref name=\"Graver 1984\" /><ref name=\"Batin 2007a\" /><ref name=\"BSAC Sport Diving 1985\" /> \n* Forming an agreed dive plan (dive objective, course to follow, depth limits and distance from exit point), agreeing on air pressure at which the dive is terminated and ascent started, who leads and who follows, and reviewing possible emergency measures\n* Helping a buddy get in and out of their equipment, particularly in assisting donning of heavier items of diving equipment and adjusting hard to reach items\n* Checking the buddy\u2019s equipment setup before the dive to assure that it is complete, in proper working order and configuration prior to the dive\n* Keeping track of the other buddy and staying together for the entire dive \u2013 maintaining a separation that can be closed up within only a couple of seconds\n* Maintaining active communication throughout the dive by hand signals and regular monitoring of each other's gauges\u2014and checking that the buddy is okay with the conditions and progress of the dive via such hand signals\n* Managing dive duration and profile by following the most limiting conditions indicated by the gauges and dive computers\n* If separation does occur, searching to reestablish contact with the buddy for one minute, and if that fails safely returning to the surface to re-establish contact\n* In the case of a dive emergency, assisting a buddy to extricate from the danger\u2014particularly in the case of entanglement, out of air situations, or rescue assistance for an immobilized or unresponsive buddy\n\nThese responsibilities may not be legally binding. A recreational diver is not normally expected to take unacceptable risks to their own safety to assist another recreational diver.<ref name=Coleman />\n\nThe US Navy does not require buddy diving in all circumstances, but it does specify that buddy divers are responsible for both the assigned task and each other's safety. They must:<ref name=usn />\n* maintain contact by keeping the dive partner in sight or if the visibility is poor, by using a buddy line. \n* know the meaning of all hand and line-pull signals.\n* acknowledge signals immediately and assume that the failure of a buddy to respond indicates an emergency.\n* monitor the activity and apparent condition of the buddy, and if it appears abnormal, investigate the cause and take immediate appropriate action. \n* never leave the buddy unless the buddy is trapped or entangled and cannot be freed without additional assistance. In this case the diver must mark the position of the distressed diver with a line and float or other locating device. \n* have a lost-diver plan for every dive, and follow the plan if contact is broken.\n* if one member of a dive team aborts a dive, for any reason, the other member must also abort and both must surface, and\n* know the proper method of buddy breathing.\n\nOther professional divers' buddy responsibilities are likely to be similar.\n\n==Disadvantages of the buddy system==\n\nWith the increased popularity of solo diving as a possible alternative to the buddy system, there has been debate as to what really constitutes safe diving practise and how divers can best control the risks associated with their sport.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />  Statistically speaking, scuba is a reasonably safe activity,<ref name=\"bandolier\" /> with incidents of injury below several other \"risk\" sports such as football, horse riding or even tennis.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Yet unlike these other sports, scuba divers are in a hostile environment for which humans are not adapted, breathing from a portable and limited capacity life support system. Under these conditions, fatality is always a possible outcome, as even simple equipment or procedural problems can be mishandled. In dealing with this reality a number of major concerns about potentially inherent flaws or negative impacts that can exist within the buddy system have been identified.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> Few, if any, of these problems, are defects in the concept of the buddy system, they are problems with the application of the system.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n\n{{quote|Every time I read, in a accident {{sic}} report, that the buddy system failed, I get livid. The buddy system does not fail, it is the people using it that have the problems. The system is fine, it is the implementation that falls down.<ref name=\"Egstrom 1992\" />|Glen Egstrom|''Emergency air sharing''}}\n\n* The amount of discipline, effort, and attention needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has other things to do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that there won't be a problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer often annoys at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />\n* The main charge made against the buddy system as practiced is that it has been grossly overrated as a means of risk mitigation. Critics say that the buddy system acts as a crutch to give unjustified confidence to divers who individually do not have either the skills or the discipline to adequately deal with any real diving problems.<ref name=Coutanche2006 /><ref name=Halstead/><ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> This creates a situation where divers become dependent on the \"security blanket\" of being with another diver. The reality may be that the buddy diver on which many divers depend is often no better able to handle an emergency than the dependent buddy.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> The fostering of this false security by diving agencies that overemphasise the effectiveness of the buddy system, develops a sense of complacency in divers about their capability to deal with these problems, a capability which they often do not have.<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> This complacency holds divers back from focusing on improving their lifesaving skills and capabilities.\n* Critics state that the proponents of the buddy system project the image of a \u201ctotally reliable buddy\u201d that does not, in fact, exist in reality.<ref name=\"Halstead\" /><ref name=\"Powell 2011\" /> Some buddies lack skills or experience and some are unfit. The major problem is that certain diver personality types are outright dangers; these types have been described as \" the untrained diver\", \"the high-flyer\", \"the falsely confident diver\", \"the angry diver\",<ref name=\"Halstead\" /> or \"the buddy from hell\".<ref name=\"Powell 2011\" />  The bad buddy problem is compounded by training that compels a diver to \u201cstick with his buddy\u201d no matter what, leading to the situation that it is the bad buddy who sets the criteria of how (badly) the dive is carried out. Both the solo diving and the buddy diving community have come to a similar conclusion on how to best address the issues of safety in both systems \u2013 self-sufficiency. In the buddy system, this means that ''both'' divers are capable of looking after themselves and sorting out almost any problems, but they still dive together as a backup to further enhance their safety as well as to share and enjoy their diving experience.<ref name=\"Wade 2011\" />\n* Divers are more likely to attempt a dive they are uneasy with if they feel they would let the buddy down if they canceled.<ref name=\"Halstead\" />\n* Given the emphasis on the requirement that all buddy divers be able to aid their buddy in an emergency, over the last decade there have been some agency-approved diving practices established where certain types of buddies do not actually meet this criterion. This is evident in the practice of scuba diving for children. Initiated by PADI, in an effort to expand scuba diving into the realm of becoming a \u201cfamily activity\u201d like skiing, the certification of children has been adopted by most other recreational diving agencies with their own diving programmes for children.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} These typically include two levels, depending on the child's age. PADI has six courses/levels for children,<ref name=\"PADI 2016\" /> in which a child from the age of 10 can become a buddy diver in open water situations. The other buddy in this team can be a certified parent or a dive professional. Serious concerns have been expressed about this general policy of having child buddies,<ref name=\"Taylor 2001\" /> among the concerns is the mental anguish and psychological damage that may be caused to a child who fails to rescue a buddy parent.<ref name=\"Warren 2001\" /> The first child buddy death in British waters occurred in 2008.<ref name=\"Smith 2008\" /> The first double fatality of a buddy pair in which one diver was a minor occurred with a British father and son in Gozo in 2006.<ref name=\"BBC News 2006\" /> Proponents of dive training for children point to the great enjoyment and sense of wonderment the children feel when introduced to the underwater world<ref name=\"Baliadvertiser\" /> and point out that other family sporting activities also have unfortunate incidents of serious injury to children.\n\n===Liability of the diving buddy===\n\nLiability issues strongly affect the structure of the diving industry, its organisation and even the implementation of recommended diving practices \u2013 and this is very much the case with buddy diving.  Diving is a risky sport, where serious accidents occasionally occur. In an increasingly [[Lawsuit|litigious]] world, accidents trigger a search for \u201cblame\u201d, and aspersions of blame often trigger ensuing litigation. It is a natural thing for those who may face the potential risks of litigation to take measures to mitigate these risks.  Diving certification agencies must necessarily insure themselves against liability risks and must act to minimise the cost of this insurance for both themselves and their operatives. The buddy system, beneficial as it can be in enhancing diver safety, has the legal effect of  creating an involved intermediary person between the certifying agency and any injured party, an intermediary who could be easily identified as not having provided \u201cduty of care\u201d if an accident occurs.<ref name=Coleman />  This may afford a legal cushion for the agency, or trainer, or boat - but it is not exactly good news for someone acting in the role of a buddy. The more skilled the buddy partner, the more these duties of care may be assumed to increase.\n\nLiability waivers are signed whenever a diver interacts with an operative of the diving industry, e.g. the training agent or dive boat.<ref name=\"BDL\" /> No such waiver is commonplace for the buddy in a buddy team. As case law develops, more precedents become established for situations where buddy action may make them particularly liable.<ref name=Coleman/>  It is recommended{{by whom|date=April 2013}} now that buddy divers carry insurance that provides coverage of themselves against legal actions by buddies, particularly if diving takes place in those countries where a culture of litigation may exist.  This is particularly necessary for scuba diving professionals who earn a living in the recreational diving industry, when they \"buddy-up\"  More experienced/more qualified divers are also considered to bear a higher duty of care for their less qualified buddies,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and therefore a serious burden can be placed on a vacationing diver asked to buddy up with a stranger, especially in litigious jurisdictions.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal bar|Underwater diving }}\n* {{annotated link|Rule of thirds (diving)}}\n* {{annotated link|Solo diving}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em |refs=\n\n<ref name=\"bandolier\">{{cite web |url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Risk/sports.html |title=Risk of dying and sporting activities |date=8 August 2008 |publisher=Bandolier |accessdate=8 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904102144/http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Risk/sports.html |archivedate=4 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Baliadvertiser\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baliadvertiser.biz/articles/feature/2011/scuba_diving.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124105853/http://baliadvertiser.biz/articles/feature/2011/scuba_diving.html |archivedate=2011-11-24 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Barsky 2000\">{{cite book|last=Barsky |first=Kristine |title=California Lobster Diving |publisher=Hammerhead Press |date=2000 |pages=45\u201350 |isbn=0-9674305-2-6}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Batin 2007\">{{cite book |last=Batin |first=John |title=The Scuba Diving Handbook |publisher=A.C.

The company is best known for its line of interchangeable-barrel, single-shot pistols and rifles. Thompson/Center also manufactures [[muzzle-loading]] rifles and is credited with creating the resurgence of their use in the 1970s.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, Warren Center developed an unusual break-action, single-shot pistol in his basement workshop that later became known as the Contender. Meanwhile, the K.W. Thompson Tool Company had been searching for a product to manufacture year-round. In 1965, Warren Center joined the K.W. Thompson Tool Company, and together, they announced Warren Center's Contender pistol in 1967. Although it sold for more than comparable hunting revolvers, the flexibility of being able to shoot multiple calibers by simply changing out the barrel and sights and its higher accuracy soon made it popular with handgun hunters.<ref name=\"Zwoll\">{{cite book | last = Van Zwoll | first = Wayne| title = Hunter's Guide to Long-Range Shooting | publisher = Stackpole Books| year = 2006| location = | page = 332 | isbn = }}</ref> As K.W. Thompson Tool began marketing Center's Contender pistol, the company name was changed to Thompson/Center Arms Company. Then, in 1970, Thompson/Center created the modern black powder industry, introducing Warren Center's Hawken-styled black powder muzzle-loader rifle.<ref name=\"CS1\">{{cite book | last = Stephens | first = Charles| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Thompson/Center Contender Pistol: How To Tune, Time, Load, And Shoot For Accuracy | publisher = Paladin Press| year = 1996| location = Boulder, CO | pages = 64 | isbn = 978-0-87364-885-1 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2007, Thompson/Center was purchased by [[Smith & Wesson]].<ref>[http://ir.smith-wesson.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=90977&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=942841&highlight 13009 - Smith&Wesson: Press Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 2010, Smith & Wesson announced that the original Rochester, New Hampshire plant would be closed and manufacturing was transferred to Springfield, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101210/GJNEWS_01/712109872/0/SEARCH|title=In Rochester: Thompson/Center Arms plant to close|first=Jake| last=O'Donnell|date= December 10, 2010|publisher=Fosters Daily Democrat}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the closure of Thompson/Center arms in Rochester, New Hampshire, Thompson Investment Casting opened in the same town continuing production of metal products for various companies including Smith & Wesson.\n\n==Break-action pistols==\nThompson/Center's success came with the emergence of long range [[handgun hunting]], target shooting, and, especially, [[metallic silhouette shooting]].<ref name=\"Layne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |last=Simpson |first=Layne |title=The Contender's Magnificent 7 |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2009 |issue=2 |date=January 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20160921095258/http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Their [[break-action]], [[single-shot]] design brought [[rifle]]-like accuracy and power in a handgun, which was a new concept at the time. Originally designed only for interchangeable barrels in [[.38 Special]] and [[.22 LR]], subsequent handgun developments by Thompson/Center led to a wider range of interchangeable barrels for use with many more cartridges. Opening and closing the break-open action is accomplished by squeezing the outside bottom of the trigger guard toward the grip/buttstock, at which time the action opens, and an extractor manually extracts the cartridge.\n\n===Contender===\n{{Main|Thompson/Center Contender}}\n[[File:TC-Contender.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Contender in 45 Colt/.410 with ventilated rib]]\nThe Contender, first introduced in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle with a number of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.<ref name=\"Ayoob2012\">{{cite book |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |authorlink=Massad Ayoob |title=Massad Ayoob's Greatest Handguns of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYmgHFwqT2gC&pg=PA266 |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=F+W Media |isbn=978-1-4402-2877-3 |pages=241\u2013266 |chapter=Thompson Center Single Shots}}</ref>\n\n===The Encore===\nThe Encore was released in 1983. The Encore uses a different trigger mechanism, designed to be stronger than the original Contender's and to make the break-action easier to open. The Encore uses a considerably larger and stronger frame than the Contender, and accordingly, is found in over 86 cartridges - ranging from [[.22 Hornet]] to the huge [[.416 Rigby]]. There has even been one pistol-length stainless barrel made in .600 Nitro Express. The Encore barrel list also includes shotgun barrels in 28, 20, and 12 gauge, and muzzleloading barrels in .45, .50 caliber, and 12 gauge using #209 shotgun primers. In 2007, Encore rimfire barrels became available in 22 LR and 17 HMR, featuring a unique monoblock design that required no alteration to the frame assembly.\n\nAn upgraded Encore is called the Pro Hunter which generally includes stocks with rubber \"Flex Tech\" inserts and are stainless or carbon steel with weather shielding. There are other slight differences among the rifles including the breech plug on muzzleloader versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcarms.com/firearms/interchangeable-platforms/encore-pro-hunter/platform |publisher=T/C Arms |title=Interchangeable Platforms |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131213062307/http://www.tcarms.com/firearms/interchangeable-platforms/encore-pro-hunter/platform |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The Contender G2===\nThe original Contender, now known as the generation one (G1) Contender, was replaced by the G2 Contender soon after the Encore came out. The G2 Contender is essentially dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2, though, uses essentially the same barrels and fore-ends as the original Contender{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}<!-- Dead link, no archive, no alternate source found beyond the other cited source <ref>http://tcarms.com/TC_IMAGES/TC_Catalog_2006/TC2006_Pg46-47.pdf</ref>--> and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.<ref name=\"Potts\">{{cite journal |last=Potts |first=Bruce |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Thompson Center G2 Contender Rifle Review |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2008 |issue=10 |pages= |publisher= |date=October 1, 2008 |url= | doi= |id= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the original Contender, dry-firing of the G2 Contender is possible only in the center (safe) hammer position, located on the hammer between the centerfire and rimfire positions. Also, unlike the original Contender, the break-action does not need to be opened/closed (cycled) to practice dry-firing, provided the hammer is lowered between dry firing \"shots\". The adjustability of G2 Contender triggers is also slightly different from the original G1 Contender.\n\n===General legalities===\n\nThe receiver on a Contender, whether G1 or G2, is the portion of the combined grip/buttstock assembly containing the trigger mechanism, and this is legally considered the serial-numbered gun. Hence, barrels with iron or telescopic sights, and even the hinge pin, are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.\n\nIt is possible to fit a shoulder stock on a pistol frame in place of a pistol grip, and, when combined with a 16\" or longer barrel (see \"Thompson/Center Arms and the Supreme Court\" below), a Contender may be legally converted from a pistol to a rifle or reversed. Although it is technically possible to fit a pistol grip on an original Contender rifle frame, and use a pistol barrel to convert it from being a rifle to a pistol, this is not legal in the USA, being an illegal creation of a pistol from a rifle. In order to be able to go back and forth, the receiver must have been originally sold as a pistol, per [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] rules.\n\n====California Legalities====\n\nSee [[Gun laws in California]]\n*Possession of a Thompson/Center Arms .45/.410 pistol barrel is illegal in California, for both dealers and individuals, and such a barrel may not legally be shipped into the state, or even taken into California for a hunting trip, by reason of it being classified as a short barreled shotgun (SBSG) when used with a Contender receiver.<ref>{{cite web |title=California Dangerous Weapons Control Law ARTICLE 2.

The company is best known for its line of interchangeable-barrel, single-shot pistols and rifles. Thompson/Center also manufactures [[muzzle-loading]] rifles and is credited with creating the resurgence of their use in the 1970s.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, Warren Center developed an unusual break-action, single-shot pistol in his basement workshop that later became known as the Contender. Meanwhile, the K.W. Thompson Tool Company had been searching for a product to manufacture year-round. In 1965, Warren Center joined the K.W. Thompson Tool Company, and together, they announced Warren Center's Contender pistol in 1967. Although it sold for more than comparable hunting revolvers, the flexibility of being able to shoot multiple calibers by simply changing out the barrel and sights and its higher accuracy soon made it popular with handgun hunters.<ref name=\"Zwoll\">{{cite book | last = Van Zwoll | first = Wayne| title = Hunter's Guide to Long-Range Shooting | publisher = Stackpole Books| year = 2006| location = | page = 332 | isbn = }}</ref> As K.W. Thompson Tool began marketing Center's Contender pistol, the company name was changed to Thompson/Center Arms Company. Then, in 1970, Thompson/Center created the modern black powder industry, introducing Warren Center's Hawken-styled black powder muzzle-loader rifle.<ref name=\"CS1\">{{cite book | last = Stephens | first = Charles| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Thompson/Center Contender Pistol: How To Tune, Time, Load, And Shoot For Accuracy | publisher = Paladin Press| year = 1996| location = Boulder, CO | pages = 64 | isbn = 978-0-87364-885-1 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2007, Thompson/Center was purchased by [[Smith & Wesson]].<ref>[http://ir.smith-wesson.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=90977&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=942841&highlight 13009 - Smith&Wesson: Press Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 2010, Smith & Wesson announced that the original Rochester, New Hampshire plant would be closed and manufacturing was transferred to Springfield, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101210/GJNEWS_01/712109872/0/SEARCH|title=In Rochester: Thompson/Center Arms plant to close|first=Jake| last=O'Donnell|date= December 10, 2010|publisher=Fosters Daily Democrat}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the closure of Thompson/Center arms in Rochester, New Hampshire, Thompson Investment Casting opened in the same town continuing production of metal products for various companies including Smith & Wesson.\n\n==Break-action pistols==\nThompson/Center's success came with the emergence of long range [[handgun hunting]], target shooting, and, especially, [[metallic silhouette shooting]].<ref name=\"Layne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |last=Simpson |first=Layne |title=The Contender's Magnificent 7 |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2009 |issue=2 |date=January 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20160921095258/http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Their [[break-action]], [[single-shot]] design brought [[rifle]]-like accuracy and power in a handgun, which was a new concept at the time. Originally designed only for interchangeable barrels in [[.38 Special]] and [[.22 LR]], subsequent handgun developments by Thompson/Center led to a wider range of interchangeable barrels for use with many more cartridges. Opening and closing the break-open action is accomplished by squeezing the outside bottom of the trigger guard toward the grip/buttstock, at which time the action opens, and an extractor manually extracts the cartridge.\n\n===Contender===\n{{Main|Thompson/Center Contender}}\n[[File:TC-Contender.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Contender in 45 Colt/.410 with ventilated rib]]\nThe Contender, first introduced in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle with a number of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.<ref name=\"Ayoob2012\">{{cite book |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |authorlink=Massad Ayoob |title=Massad Ayoob's Greatest Handguns of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYmgHFwqT2gC&pg=PA266 |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=F+W Media |isbn=978-1-4402-2877-3 |pages=241\u2013266 |chapter=Thompson Center Single Shots}}</ref>\n\n===The Encore===\nThe Encore was released in 1983. The Encore uses a different trigger mechanism, designed to be stronger than the original Contender's and to make the break-action easier to open. The Encore uses a considerably larger and stronger frame than the Contender, and accordingly, is found in over 86 cartridges - ranging from [[.22 Hornet]] to the huge [[.416 Rigby]]. There has even been one pistol-length stainless barrel made in .600 Nitro Express. The Encore barrel list also includes shotgun barrels in 28, 20, and 12 gauge, and muzzleloading barrels in .45, .50 caliber, and 12 gauge using #209 shotgun primers. In 2007, Encore rimfire barrels became available in 22 LR and 17 HMR, featuring a unique monoblock design that required no alteration to the frame assembly.\n\nAn upgraded Encore is called the Pro Hunter which generally includes stocks with rubber \"Flex Tech\" inserts and are stainless or carbon steel with weather shielding. There are other slight differences among the rifles including the breech plug on muzzleloader versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcarms.com/firearms/interchangeable-platforms/encore-pro-hunter/platform |publisher=T/C Arms |title=Interchangeable Platforms |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131213062307/http://www.tcarms.com/firearms/interchangeable-platforms/encore-pro-hunter/platform |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The Contender G2===\nThe original Contender, now known as the generation one (G1) Contender, was replaced by the G2 Contender soon after the Encore came out. The G2 Contender is essentially dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2, though, uses essentially the same barrels and fore-ends as the original Contender{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}<!-- Dead link, no archive, no alternate source found beyond the other cited source <ref>http://tcarms.com/TC_IMAGES/TC_Catalog_2006/TC2006_Pg46-47.pdf</ref>--> and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.<ref name=\"Potts\">{{cite journal |last=Potts |first=Bruce |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Thompson Center G2 Contender Rifle Review |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2008 |issue=10 |pages= |publisher= |date=October 1, 2008 |url= | doi= |id= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the original Contender, dry-firing of the G2 Contender is possible only in the center (safe) hammer position, located on the hammer between the centerfire and rimfire positions. Also, unlike the original Contender, the break-action does not need to be opened/closed (cycled) to practice dry-firing, provided the hammer is lowered between dry firing \"shots\". The adjustability of G2 Contender triggers is also slightly different from the original G1 Contender.\n\n===General legalities===\n\nThe receiver on a Contender, whether G1 or G2, is the portion of the combined grip/buttstock assembly containing the trigger mechanism, and this is legally considered the serial-numbered gun. Hence, barrels with iron or telescopic sights, and even the hinge pin, are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.\n\nIt is possible to fit a shoulder stock on a pistol frame in place of a pistol grip, and, when combined with a 16\" or longer barrel (see \"Thompson/Center Arms and the Supreme Court\" below), a Contender may be legally converted from a pistol to a rifle or reversed. Although it is technically possible to fit a pistol grip on an original Contender rifle frame, and use a pistol barrel to convert it from being a rifle to a pistol, this is not legal in the USA, being an illegal creation of a pistol from a rifle. In order to be able to go back and forth, the receiver must have been originally sold as a pistol, per [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] rules.\n\n====California Legalities====\n\nSee [[Gun laws in California]]\n*Possession of a Thompson/Center Arms .45/.410 pistol barrel is illegal in California, for both dealers and individuals, and such a barrel may not legally be shipped into the state, or even taken into California for a hunting trip, by reason of it being classified as a short barreled shotgun (SBSG) when used with a Contender receiver.<ref>{{cite web |title=California Dangerous Weapons Control Law ARTICLE 2.

Thompson/Center Arms Co.]]'' (1992), the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the company's favor by deciding that the rifle conversion kit that Thompson sold for their pistols did not constitute a [[short-barreled rifle]] under the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\">{{ussc|504|505|1992}}</ref>\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms contended that the mere possession of a pistol having a barrel less than sixteen inches (406&nbsp;mm) long, a shoulder stock, and a rifle-length (more than sixteen inches) barrel constituted constructive intent to \"make\" an illegal short-barreled rifle (SBR) (by combining the pistol's frame, the pistol-length barrel, and the shoulder stock) even if the shoulder stock was intended to be used only with the rifle-length barrel.\n\nThe Supreme Court disagreed and its decision clarified the meaning of the term \"make\" in the National Firearms Act by stating that the mere possession of components that theoretically could be assembled in an illegal configuration was not in itself a violation as long as the components could also be assembled into a legal configuration.<ref>{{cite web |title=Case syllabus from Cornell Law School |publisher=Cornell University |year=1992 |url=http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-0164.ZS.html |accessdate=October 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOne argument raised was the example of ammonium-nitrate fertilizer and Diesel oil, which can very often be found together in a farmer's possession (fertilizer for the crops, fuel for the tractor.) Both are lawful, and while they can easily be assembled into the blasting agent known as [[ANFO]], possession of both has never been held to imply (without other evidence) that a farmer was \"making\" explosives.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tcarms.com/ Thompson/Center Arms] corporate website\n*[http://bullberry.com Bullberry Barrel Works], specializing in Contender, G2, and Encore barrels\n*[http://guns.huntingpa.info/index.php/T/C_--_Thompson/Center Muzzleloader Museum Online], listing of some of T/C's muzzleloader guns with pictures and specifications.\n\n[[Category:Firearm manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Smith & Wesson]]\n", "name_user": "Gjs238", "label": "safe", "comment": "copy edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson/Center_Arms"}

He served as head football coach at [[Kansas State University]] (1967\u20131974), the [[University of Louisville]] (1975\u20131979), and [[Tulane University]] (1980\u20131982), compiling a career [[college football]] record of 75\u201398\u20132.  In 1992, he coached the [[New Orleans Night]] of the [[Arena Football League]], tallying a mark of 0\u201310.<ref>{{cite web | title = List of AFL Coaches | url = http://www.arenafan.com/history/?page=coaches | accessdate = March 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and playing career==\nGibson was born and raised in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  He graduated from [[Florida State University]] in 1955, where he received two letters playing as an offensive guard for the Seminoles.<ref name=reference2>{{cite web | title = Alabama Sports Hall of Fame profile | url = http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view=company&srctype=display&back=company&id=324&sor=name&search=Gibson&submenu=Inductees&pos=0,15,1 | accessdate = March 31, 2011}}</ref>  He entered the coaching profession immediately after graduation.\n\n==Coaching career==\nGibson's first football coaching position was at [[South Georgia State College|South Georgia College]] in 1956, a position he held for three years.  At South Georgia, Gibson served as the sole assistant under head coach [[Bobby Bowden]], who had grown up in the same Birmingham neighborhood as Gibson.<ref name=Bowden>{{Cite news | title = Vince Gibson, Former College Football Coach | newspaper = The Palm Beach Post | date = December 24, 2009 | url = http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/vince-gibson-former-college-football-coach-146592.html | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = Bobby and His Boys | newspaper = The Ledger | date = December 1, 2009 | url = http://www.theledger.com/article/20091201/SPORTS0701/912019939?p=2&tc=pg | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>  Following his stint at South Georgia, Gibson returned to his [[alma mater]] Florida State to work as an assistant coach from 1959 to 1963.  Before leaving Florida State, Gibson also helped to get Bowden hired as an assistant at that school, where Bowden eventually became head coach.<ref name=Bowden/><ref>{{Cite news | title = College Football Has Void Without Bobby Bowden | newspaper = NewOrleans.com | date = August 25, 2010 | url = http://www.neworleans.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=460597&Itemid=578 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120904195339/http://www.neworleans.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=460597&Itemid=578 | url-status = dead | archive-date = September 4, 2012 }}</ref>  Gibson next served as [[defensive coordinator]] at the [[University of Tennessee]] from 1964 to 1966.\n\n===Kansas State===\nPrior to the 1967 football season, Gibson was hired as head coach at [[Kansas State University]].  When he was hired, the school was mired in a 21-game winless streak and had not enjoyed a winning season since 1954, but he promised the Wildcat fans, \"We gonna win!\"<ref name=reference1>{{Cite news | title = Sanctions Still Trouble Cats' Gibson | newspaper = The Topeka Capital-Journal | date = October 14, 2000 | url = http://cjonline.com/stories/101400/spo_ksuhof.shtml | access-date = November 10, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915111216/http://cjonline.com/stories/101400/spo_ksuhof.shtml | archive-date = September 15, 2008 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nGibson's first season at Kansas State ended with a 1\u20139 record, but the next year the team showed significant improvement.  Behind sophomore quarterback [[Lynn Dickey]], the 1968 squad earned the school's first national ranking in the [[AP Poll]] and shut out [[1968 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] in Lincoln for the school's first victory over NU in a decade.  That same season, Kansas State also moved into a [[Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium|new football stadium]].\n\nGibson truly began to deliver on his promise to win during the 1969 season.  The team started 2\u20130 before second-ranked [[1969 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] arrived to play in [[Manhattan, Kansas]].  Penn State ultimately finished the 1969 season undefeated, but Kansas State provided them with one of their toughest tests in a 17\u201314 game.  Following the loss to Penn State, Kansas State reeled off three straight victories, including a win over defending conference champion [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] in the first [[Governor's Cup (Kansas)|Governor's Cup]] game, and a 59\u201321 blowout of #11 [[1969 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], which was Kansas State's first win over the Sooners since 1934 and the largest loss in Oklahoma's history.  K-State would not beat another ranked team until 1993, when [[Bill Snyder]] lead the team to victory over Oklahoma again.  After the 1969 Oklahoma game, Kansas State sported a 5\u20131 record and a #12 national ranking in the AP Poll.  This was the high-point of the season, as the team lost its last four games to finish 5\u20135.  Nevertheless, in only his third season, Gibson had dramatically improved the program.\n\nPrior to the 1970 season, Gibson was named the pre-season national coach of the year by ''[[Playboy Magazine]]''.  The season that followed was up-and-down but ultimately disappointing despite a winning record and a second-place finish in the [[Big Eight Conference]].  Kansas State won at Oklahoma and defeated eighth-ranked [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]], but the season was soured by non-conference defeats and a blow-out loss to Nebraska in the final conference game of the year with the conference title on the line.  The worst news of the season came on October 7, 1970, when the conference slapped the Wildcats with three years' probation for recruiting violations.  Most seriously, the Wildcats were banned from bowl games and live television for one year.  Gibson later said that the sanctions\u2014the result of what he called an immature quarrel with Kansas coach [[Pepper Rodgers]]\u2014destroyed his program.<ref name=reference1/>\n\nKansas State stagnated following the 1970 season, with Gibson's teams hovering below the .500 mark for the next four years.  Quarterback [[Steve Grogan]] provided some excitement during the 1973 and 1974 seasons, but it was never enough to provide a winning record.  Gibson decided to leave Kansas State following the 1974 season with a final record of 33\u201352.\n\n===Louisville and Tulane===\nFollowing his term at Kansas State, Gibson served as head football coach at the [[University of Louisville]] from 1975 to 1979.  His record at Louisville was 25\u201329\u20132, and in 1977 he took the school to the third [[bowl game]] in its history, the second [[Independence Bowl]].  While at Louisville, Gibson coined the nickname \"Red Rage\" for the football team, a related carry over from the \"Purple Pride\" at K-State.  While no longer used as a moniker for the football team, the term Red Rage has been used over the years for various organizations.  Currently, the U of L Marching Band is introduced as the [[The University of Louisville \"RED RAGE!\" Marching Band|\"RED RAGE!\" Marching Band]].  NFL notables from Louisville during Gibson's tenure include [[Otis Wilson]] of the [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Dwayne Woodruff]] of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Joe Jacoby of the [[Washington Redskins]] and Mark Clayton of the [[Miami Dolphins]].\n\nFrom 1980 to 1982 Gibson coached at [[Tulane University]], posting an overall record of 17\u201317.  Gibson defeated [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] in two out of his three seasons at Tulane and also coached the Green Wave to an appearance in the [[1980 Hall of Fame Classic]].  While at Tulane, Gibson was known as \"Vegas Vince\" for his risk taking play calling.\n\n===Awards===\nGibson was named the [[Big Eight Conference]] Coach of the Year in 1970.  He was also selected to coach the North squad in the 1971 [[North\u2013South Shrine Game]].  Gibson is enshrined in the [[Alabama Sports Hall of Fame]] and the Kansas State University Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\n==Death==\nGibson died in 2012 in [[Kenner, Louisiana]] after a battle with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].

He served as head football coach at [[Kansas State University]] (1967\u20131974), the [[University of Louisville]] (1975\u20131979), and [[Tulane University]] (1980\u20131982), compiling a career [[college football]] record of 75\u201398\u20132.  In 1992, he coached the [[New Orleans Night]] of the [[Arena Football League]], tallying a mark of 0\u201310.<ref>{{cite web | title = List of AFL Coaches | url = http://www.arenafan.com/history/?page=coaches | accessdate = March 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and playing career==\nGibson was born and raised in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  He graduated from [[Florida State University]] in 1955, where he received two letters playing as an offensive guard for the Seminoles.<ref name=reference2>{{cite web | title = Alabama Sports Hall of Fame profile | url = http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view=company&srctype=display&back=company&id=324&sor=name&search=Gibson&submenu=Inductees&pos=0,15,1 | accessdate = March 31, 2011}}</ref>  He entered the coaching profession immediately after graduation.\n\n==Coaching career==\nGibson's first football coaching position was at [[South Georgia State College|South Georgia College]] in 1956, a position he held for three years.  At South Georgia, Gibson served as the sole assistant under head coach [[Bobby Bowden]], who had grown up in the same Birmingham neighborhood as Gibson.<ref name=Bowden>{{Cite news | title = Vince Gibson, Former College Football Coach | newspaper = The Palm Beach Post | date = December 24, 2009 | url = http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/vince-gibson-former-college-football-coach-146592.html | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = Bobby and His Boys | newspaper = The Ledger | date = December 1, 2009 | url = http://www.theledger.com/article/20091201/SPORTS0701/912019939?p=2&tc=pg | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>  Following his stint at South Georgia, Gibson returned to his [[alma mater]] Florida State to work as an assistant coach from 1959 to 1963.  Before leaving Florida State, Gibson also helped to get Bowden hired as an assistant at that school, where Bowden eventually became head coach.<ref name=Bowden/><ref>{{Cite news | title = College Football Has Void Without Bobby Bowden | newspaper = NewOrleans.com | date = August 25, 2010 | url = http://www.neworleans.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=460597&Itemid=578 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120904195339/http://www.neworleans.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=460597&Itemid=578 | url-status = dead | archive-date = September 4, 2012 }}</ref>  Gibson next served as [[defensive coordinator]] at the [[University of Tennessee]] from 1964 to 1966.\n\n===Kansas State===\nPrior to the 1967 football season, Gibson was hired as head coach at [[Kansas State University]].  When he was hired, the school was mired in a 21-game winless streak and had not enjoyed a winning season since 1954, but he promised the Wildcat fans, \"We gonna win!\"<ref name=reference1>{{Cite news | title = Sanctions Still Trouble Cats' Gibson | newspaper = The Topeka Capital-Journal | date = October 14, 2000 | url = http://cjonline.com/stories/101400/spo_ksuhof.shtml | access-date = November 10, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915111216/http://cjonline.com/stories/101400/spo_ksuhof.shtml | archive-date = September 15, 2008 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nGibson's first season at Kansas State ended with a 1\u20139 record, but the next year the team showed significant improvement.  Behind sophomore quarterback [[Lynn Dickey]], the 1968 squad earned the school's first national ranking in the [[AP Poll]] and shut out [[1968 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] in Lincoln for the school's first victory over NU in a decade.  That same season, Kansas State also moved into a [[Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium|new football stadium]].\n\nGibson truly began to deliver on his promise to win during the 1969 season.  The team started 2\u20130 before second-ranked [[1969 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] arrived to play in [[Manhattan, Kansas]].  Penn State ultimately finished the 1969 season undefeated, but Kansas State provided them with one of their toughest tests in a 17\u201314 game.  Following the loss to Penn State, Kansas State reeled off three straight victories, including a win over defending conference champion [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] in the first [[Governor's Cup (Kansas)|Governor's Cup]] game, and a 59\u201321 blowout of #11 [[1969 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], which was Kansas State's first win over the Sooners since 1934 and the largest loss in Oklahoma's history.  K-State would not beat another ranked team until 1993, when [[Bill Snyder]] lead the team to victory over Oklahoma again.  After the 1969 Oklahoma game, Kansas State sported a 5\u20131 record and a #12 national ranking in the AP Poll.  This was the high-point of the season, as the team lost its last four games to finish 5\u20135.  Nevertheless, in only his third season, Gibson had dramatically improved the program.\n\nPrior to the 1970 season, Gibson was named the pre-season national coach of the year by ''[[Playboy Magazine]]''.  The season that followed was up-and-down but ultimately disappointing despite a winning record and a second-place finish in the [[Big Eight Conference]].  Kansas State won at Oklahoma and defeated eighth-ranked [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]], but the season was soured by non-conference defeats and a blow-out loss to Nebraska in the final conference game of the year with the conference title on the line.  The worst news of the season came on October 7, 1970, when the conference slapped the Wildcats with three years' probation for recruiting violations.  Most seriously, the Wildcats were banned from bowl games and live television for one year.  Gibson later said that the sanctions\u2014the result of what he called an immature quarrel with Kansas coach [[Pepper Rodgers]]\u2014destroyed his program.<ref name=reference1/>\n\nKansas State stagnated following the 1970 season, with Gibson's teams hovering below the .500 mark for the next four years.  Quarterback [[Steve Grogan]] provided some excitement during the 1973 and 1974 seasons, but it was never enough to provide a winning record.  Gibson decided to leave Kansas State following the 1974 season with a final record of 33\u201352.\n\n===Louisville and Tulane===\nFollowing his term at Kansas State, Gibson served as head football coach at the [[University of Louisville]] from 1975 to 1979.  His record at Louisville was 25\u201329\u20132, and in 1977 he took the school to the third [[bowl game]] in its history, the second [[Independence Bowl]].  While at Louisville, Gibson coined the nickname \"Red Rage\" for the football team, a related carry over from the \"Purple Pride\" at K-State.  While no longer used as a moniker for the football team, the term Red Rage has been used over the years for various organizations.  Currently, the U of L Marching Band is introduced as the [[The University of Louisville \"RED RAGE!\" Marching Band|\"RED RAGE!\" Marching Band]].  NFL notables from Louisville during Gibson's tenure include [[Otis Wilson]] of the [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Dwayne Woodruff]] of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Joe Jacoby of the [[Washington Redskins]] and Mark Clayton of the [[Miami Dolphins]].\n\nFrom 1980 to 1982 Gibson coached at [[Tulane University]], posting an overall record of 17\u201317.  Gibson defeated [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] in two out of his three seasons at Tulane and also coached the Green Wave to an appearance in the [[1980 Hall of Fame Classic]].  While at Tulane, Gibson was known as \"Vegas Vince\" for his risk taking play calling.\n\n===Awards===\nGibson was named the [[Big Eight Conference]] Coach of the Year in 1970.  He was also selected to coach the North squad in the 1971 [[North\u2013South Shrine Game]].  Gibson is enshrined in the [[Alabama Sports Hall of Fame]] and the Kansas State University Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\n==Death==\nGibson died in 2012 in [[Kenner, Louisiana]] after a battle with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]. He was 78.\n\n==Head coaching record==\n===College===\n{{CFB Yearly Record Start | type = coach | team = | conf = | bowl = | poll = no }}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subhead\n | name      = [[Kansas State

[[Korean chili pepper]]s, of the species ''[[Capsicum annuum]]'', are spicy yet sweet making them ideal for gochujang production.\n\nOther recipes use glutinous rice (''chapssal'', {{lang-ko|\ucc39\uc300}}), normal short-grain rice (''mepssal'', {{lang-ko|\uba65\uc300}}), or [[barley]], and, less frequently, whole wheat kernels, [[jujube]]s, [[pumpkin]], and [[sweet potato]]; these ingredients are used to make special variations. A small amount of sweetener, such as sugar, syrup, or [[honey]], is also sometimes added. The finished product is a dark, reddish paste with a rich, piquant flavor.\n\nThe making of gochujang at home began tapering off when commercial production came into the mass market in the early 1970s. Now, most Koreans purchase gochujang at grocery stores or markets. It is still used extensively in [[Korean cooking]] to flavor stews (''[[jjigae]]''), such as in ''gochujang jjigae;'' to marinate meat, such as in ''gochujang [[bulgogi]];'' and as a condiment for ''[[naengmyeon]]'' and ''[[bibimbap]]''.\n\nGochujang is also used as a base for making other condiments, such as ''chogochujang'' ({{lang-ko|\ucd08\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5}})<!--are there hanja for this term?--> and ''[[ssamjang]]'' ({{lang-ko|\uc308\uc7a5}}). ''Chogochujang'' is a variant of gochujang made by adding vinegar and other seasonings, such as sugar and sesame seeds. It is usually used as a sauce for ''[[Hoe (dish)|hoe]]'' and ''[[hoedeopbap]]''. Similarly, ''ssamjang'' is a mixture of mainly gochujang and ''[[doenjang]]'', with chopped onions and other spicy seasonings, and it is popular with ''sangchussam'' ({{lang-ko|\uc0c1\ucd94\uc308}}).\n\n== Gochujang hot-taste unit ==\nGochujang hot-taste unit (GHU) is a unit of measurement for the pungency (spicy heat) of gochujang, based on the [[gas chromatography]] and the [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] of [[capsaicin]] and [[dihydrocapsaicin]] concentrations.<ref name=\"NAQS\">{{Cite web|url=https://standard.go.kr/KSCI/common/filedownload.ndo?atchmnflId=TBI20170111145941&atchmnflSn=3|title=Jeontong sikpum pyojun gyugyeok|last=National Agricultural Products Quality Management Service|date=September 2016|website=Korean Standards & Certifications|publisher=[[Korean Agency for Technology and Standards]]|pages=88\u201389|language=ko|script-title=ko:\uc804\ud1b5\uc2dd\ud488 \ud45c\uc900\uaddc\uaca9|format=PDF|access-date=17 April 2017|layurl=https://standard.go.kr/KSCI/technologyIntro/getTechnologyDetailView.do?menuId=527&topMenuId=524&upperMenuId=524&trgId=0000006601&trgReformNo=0000}}</ref>\n\nGochujang products are assigned to one of the five levels of spiciness: Mild Hot, Slight Hot, Medium Hot, Very Hot, and Extreme Hot.<ref name=\"NAQS\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"color:white;

[[Korean chili pepper]]s, of the species ''[[Capsicum annuum]]'', are spicy yet sweet making them ideal for gochujang production.\n\nOther recipes use glutinous rice (''chapssal'', {{lang-ko|\ucc39\uc300}}), normal short-grain rice (''mepssal'', {{lang-ko|\uba65\uc300}}), or [[barley]], and, less frequently, whole wheat kernels, [[jujube]]s, [[pumpkin]], and [[sweet potato]]; these ingredients are used to make special variations. A small amount of sweetener, such as sugar, syrup, or [[honey]], is also sometimes added. The finished product is a dark, reddish paste with a rich, piquant flavor.\n\nThe making of gochujang at home began tapering off when commercial production came into the mass market in the early 1970s. Now, most Koreans purchase gochujang at grocery stores or markets. It is still used extensively in [[Korean cooking]] to flavor stews (''[[jjigae]]''), such as in ''gochujang jjigae;'' to marinate meat, such as in ''gochujang [[bulgogi]];'' and as a condiment for ''[[naengmyeon]]'' and ''[[bibimbap]]''.\n\nGochujang is also used as a base for making other condiments, such as ''chogochujang'' ({{lang-ko|\ucd08\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5}})<!--are there hanja for this term?--> and ''[[ssamjang]]'' ({{lang-ko|\uc308\uc7a5}}). ''Chogochujang'' is a variant of gochujang made by adding vinegar and other seasonings, such as sugar and sesame seeds. It is usually used as a sauce for ''[[Hoe (dish)|hoe]]'' and ''[[hoedeopbap]]''. Similarly, ''ssamjang'' is a mixture of mainly gochujang and ''[[doenjang]]'', with chopped onions and other spicy seasonings, and it is popular with ''sangchussam'' ({{lang-ko|\uc0c1\ucd94\uc308}}).\n\n== Gochujang hot-taste unit ==\nGochujang hot-taste unit (GHU) is a unit of measurement for the pungency (spicy heat) of gochujang, based on the [[gas chromatography]] and the [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] of [[capsaicin]] and [[dihydrocapsaicin]] concentrations.<ref name=\"KTO3\">{{Cite news|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/AKR/FU_EN_15.jsp?cid=995420|title=[Korea] Some like it Hot!

It is a subsidiary of [[20th Century Fox Animation]], a division of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]].\n\nThe studio was founded in 1987 by [[Chris Wedge]], Michael Ferraro, Carl Ludwig, Alison Brown, David Brown, and Eugene Troubetzkoy after their employer [[Mathematical Applications Group|MAGI]], one of the visual effects studios behind ''[[Tron]]'', shut down. Using its in-house rendering software, the studio had worked on visual effects for commercials and films before completely dedicating itself to animated film production. The studio's first feature, ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', was released on March 15, 2002 by [[20th Century Fox]]. In March 2019, the studio was acquired by Disney, upon their [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition]] of [[21st Century Fox]] assets.\n\nBlue Sky has produced [[List of Blue Sky Studios films|13 feature films]], with its latest release being ''[[Spies in Disguise]]'' on December 25, 2019, and their next release being ''[[Nimona#Adaptations|Nimona]]'' on January 14, 2022.

His off the cuff answer was: <blockquote>I hope to see a country where families are strong. Where we've incentivised families through the policies that we've legislated. I hope to see a strong defence force so that we can weather the challenges that will inevitably come. If you take history as a guide we will face inevitable security challenges.

He supported the postal survey because he believed that the institution of marriage, since it existed before the parliament, was an institution that belonged to people, so it was right for the people themselves to vote on it. When the \"yes vote\" was strongly returned, Hastie ensured passage of the bill, but could not vote for it himself. He explained, \"We went to the election with it, I was on television saying I would abstain, I've been in dialogue with constituents for the last 18 months and whenever I've talked to them about the issue, I've said I would abstain. My intention is to abstain because to vote yes would go against my conscience, but I want to uphold both the vote in Canning and the national result and abstention is the best way to do that.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/5058727/hastie-to-abstain-on-yes-vote/|title=Hastie to abstain on 'yes' vote|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2017-11-15|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> Most of Hastie's statements through the public debate centred not on marriage, but on how to have the debate. When right wing commentators such as Larry Pickering used homophobic language towards [[LGBT]] persons, Hastie immediately condemned the statement, expressing his \"dismay\" at the degrading language, and pleaded for \"higher personal and civic standards\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pickering-comments-despicable-hastie|title=Pickering comments despicable: Hastie|website=SBS News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of conscience - on military abuses ====\nRecent reports by Chris Masters and others of prisoner abuse, and even killings, by the Australian [[Special Air Service Regiment]] in Afghanistan have seen Hastie come forward as a strong advocate for transparency, though it may hurt the prestige of his former unit. He has \"emerged as a champion of the Brereton Inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/he-thought-i-was-going-to-shoot-him-how-david-s-little-voice-saved-him-in-war-20190913-p52qy6.html|title='He thought I was going to shoot him': How David's 'little voice' saved him in war|last=Masters|first=Nick McKenzie, Chris|date=2019-09-20|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> He strongly supports whistleblowers when it comes to abuse, telling ABC Radio the truth tellers should be respected: \"I don't want to go into any specific allegations, but they should be taken seriously and, as I said, we want a free media reporting on all issues.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/secretive-and-elite-sas-soldiers-grilled-about-alleged-war-crimes-20180608-p4zkau.html|title=Secretive and elite SAS soldiers grilled about alleged war crimes|last=Wroe|first=Nick McKenzie, David|date=2018-06-08|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of expression ====\nIn one of Hastie's first electoral campaigns, he had a large outdoor poster vandalised. Rather than condemn the culprit, he wrote a Facebook message, \"Will Mandurah's Van Gogh please come forward<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/3985723/hasties-spray-mp-responds-to-graffiti-attack/|title=Hastie's spray: MP responds to graffiti attack|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2016-06-22|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> then had a local graffiti artist add even more colour to the piece.

He has actively stood up for journalists at the ABC and [[Sydney morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]], using Parliamentary privilege to name Chau Chak Wing as a man who co-conspired to bribe a UN official, a man who took the media outlets to court for defamation as they had published the accusations. Hastie explained his actions by saying \"...democracy works only if we have a free press that can publish information that serves the public interest.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-23/turnbull-did-not-know-hastie-would-make-chau-chak-wing-claims/9790476|title=Liberal MP says he did his duty in speaking up about political donor|last=Yaxley|first=political reporters Louise|last2=Gribbin|first2=Caitlyn|date=2018-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18|last3=Conifer|first3=Dan}}</ref> However, current laws have allowed for the Australian Federal Police to raid journalists from the ABC and News Corp Australia for reasons of security. This places a tension between freedom and sovereignty.\n\n==== Freedom of religion ====\nWhile an observant Christian, Hastie holds to the view that if the law allows him to practice his faith, it must allow all to express their faith, or lack of it. That means that traditional Muslim families must be allowed to have women wear the burka in public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-02/keeping-the-faith-andrew-hastie/8477382|title=Andrew Hastie on poetry, political courage, and not banning the burka|last=Alexandra Beech|date=2017-05-02|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Sovereignty ===\n[[File:Andrew Hastie MP with Mayor Rhys Williams at March 2020 Citizenship Ceremony in Mandurah photo taken by D Birch.jpg|thumb|The Mayor of Mandurah, Rhys Williams, with Andrew Hastie MP, hosting an Australian Citizenship ceremony in March 2020]]\nHastie has argued that only Australia should make decisions that affect Australia's future or the working of our institutions. As such he strongly resists foreign influence on the working of the Australian economy, culture or political system. \"My bottom line is Australian sovereignty \u2013 I want to protect our way of life, our freedom of action and our political institutions. That's my job as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. I make no apologies for it.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-a-dead-spy-chinese-hackers-and-the-australian-commando-warning-israel-1.8223349|title=A Dead Spy, Chinese Hackers and the Australian Commando Warning Israel|date=2019-12-06|work=Haaretz|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic sovereignty ====\nInterestingly, Hastie locates the energy debates within the concern for Australian sovereignty, and it was this issue that meant he could never support the [[National Energy Guarantee]]. In August 2018, he posted his position: \"My priority is Australia's economic sovereignty and affordable power prices. Here I stand.\" The next month he made a speech in the Federation Chamber, saying, \"Australian industry and Australian workers must come first. When it comes to energy, we must put the Australian people before Paris.\"\n\n==== Sovereignty and political warfare ====\nThis has been the main legislative focus for Hastie in recent times. In an interview with the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Hastie explained that, \"Democratic countries must take domestic measures to protect against these threats. Australia has led the way in this regard. Authoritarian states use all instruments of state power to pursue their strategic objectives. Seemingly innocent activities like diplomacy, foreign-investment flows into strategic industries and infrastructure acquisitions like the purchase of ports are not so innocuous. Democracies who don't pay attention to these activities \u2013 and take measures to guard against them \u2013 risk becoming tethered to hyper-modern authoritarian states and losing their sovereignty in the process.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==== Digital sovereignty ====\nHastie frames questions to do with the provision of information networks as a matter of sovereignty, which must be defended. Given that companies such as Huawei would be legally required to pass on information carried on their networks to the Chinese government,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/huawei-would-have-to-give-data-to-china-government-if-asked-experts.html|title=Huawei says it would never hand data to China's government.

Along with other parliamentarians from the Liberal Party, including [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] and [[James Paterson (Australian politician)|James Paterson]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor's]] [[Kimberley Kitching]] and [[Anthony Byrne (politician)|Anthony Byrne]], he has been active in applying pressure to Australia's partners in the [[Five Eyes]] security alliance to do the same. In a public statement he explained how important that security arrangement is, \"In a time of growing strategic uncertainty, Australia values that membership more than ever.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/four-australian-mps-urge-britain-to-ban-huawei-20200124-p53u9x.html|title=Four Australian MPs urge Britain to ban Huawei|last=Bourke|first=Latika|date=2020-01-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> In private settings, it is known that he has supported Byrne, the Deputy Chair of the committee Hastie leads, who used forceful language with the UK leadership, asking \u201cHow would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks?

In an interview about his wartime experiences, he said:<blockquote> For me, it proved that culture and geography (are) decisive in the formation of societies and political institutions. Building lasting, trusted institutions takes time, generations of stewardship and public virtue.<ref name=\"Whinnett\"/></blockquote> Looking at Australia, Hastie believes that it is local institutions that provide civic foundations of \"accountability, freedom and democracy.\"<ref name=\"First Speech\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrewhastie.com.au/first_speech|title=First Speech|website=Andrew Hastie MP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued in his first speech that the first of these institutions is the family, which \"is central to a healthy society\"<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> but also extends to sporting clubs, service clubs, churches and local businesses.<ref name=\"First Speech\"/> In one op-ed, Hastie went even further, suggesting that community groups, or \"pre-political institutions\" are finally more important than governments:<blockquote> \"More powerful than the political levers of government are grassroots volunteer movements and pre-political institutions... Pre-political institutions are the best place for securing our freedoms and so we should take encouragement that democratic governments cannot control them, and are sent packing when they attempt to do so.\"<ref name=\"theaustralian.com.au\">{{Cite news|last=Hastie|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/opinion/political-class-ignored-the-people-and-paid-the-price/news-story/f1d35ad7c29f76daf08768182b316d55|title=Political class ignored the people and paid the price|date=November 23, 2016|work=The Australian|access-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== The power of community and PTSD ====\nHastie reflected on how his grandfather recovered from the trauma of [[World War II]] thanks, in part to the power of community, and laments that we may not have that power available to us now, \"Just thinking of my grandfather's own experience, he was shot up quite badly in the second world war where civil society was still very strong, community was still very strong, a lot of local clubs and organisations, I think he struggled with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] but I think his PTSD was mitigated by those little platoons that we talk about, he was very close to his comrades from the second war, and I'm just not sure if we have in today's society that same sort of cushioning and community support as we had 70 years ago.\"<ref name=\"Grattan\"/>\n\n==== Community and environment ====\nWhile environmental concern is often seen as a progressive cause, Hastie sets the environment between two concerns - that, as per the [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] contract - the good things inherited should be passed on to the next generation. And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

His off the cuff answer was: <blockquote>I hope to see a country where families are strong. Where we've incentivised families through the policies that we've legislated. I hope to see a strong defence force so that we can weather the challenges that will inevitably come. If you take history as a guide we will face inevitable security challenges.

He supported the postal survey because he believed that the institution of marriage, since it existed before the parliament, was an institution that belonged to people, so it was right for the people themselves to vote on it. When the \"yes vote\" was strongly returned, Hastie ensured passage of the bill, but could not vote for it himself. He explained, \"We went to the election with it, I was on television saying I would abstain, I've been in dialogue with constituents for the last 18 months and whenever I've talked to them about the issue, I've said I would abstain. My intention is to abstain because to vote yes would go against my conscience, but I want to uphold both the vote in Canning and the national result and abstention is the best way to do that.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/5058727/hastie-to-abstain-on-yes-vote/|title=Hastie to abstain on 'yes' vote|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2017-11-15|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> Most of Hastie's statements through the public debate centred not on marriage, but on how to have the debate. When right wing commentators such as Larry Pickering used homophobic language towards [[LGBT]] persons, Hastie immediately condemned the statement, expressing his \"dismay\" at the degrading language, and pleaded for \"higher personal and civic standards\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pickering-comments-despicable-hastie|title=Pickering comments despicable: Hastie|website=SBS News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of conscience - on military abuses ====\nRecent reports by Chris Masters and others of prisoner abuse, and even killings, by the Australian [[Special Air Service Regiment]] in Afghanistan have seen Hastie come forward as a strong advocate for transparency, though it may hurt the prestige of his former unit. He has \"emerged as a champion of the Brereton Inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/he-thought-i-was-going-to-shoot-him-how-david-s-little-voice-saved-him-in-war-20190913-p52qy6.html|title='He thought I was going to shoot him': How David's 'little voice' saved him in war|last=Masters|first=Nick McKenzie, Chris|date=2019-09-20|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> He strongly supports whistleblowers when it comes to abuse, telling ABC Radio the truth tellers should be respected: \"I don't want to go into any specific allegations, but they should be taken seriously and, as I said, we want a free media reporting on all issues.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/secretive-and-elite-sas-soldiers-grilled-about-alleged-war-crimes-20180608-p4zkau.html|title=Secretive and elite SAS soldiers grilled about alleged war crimes|last=Wroe|first=Nick McKenzie, David|date=2018-06-08|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of expression ====\nIn one of Hastie's first electoral campaigns, he had a large outdoor poster vandalised. Rather than condemn the culprit, he wrote a Facebook message, \"Will Mandurah's Van Gogh please come forward<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/3985723/hasties-spray-mp-responds-to-graffiti-attack/|title=Hastie's spray: MP responds to graffiti attack|last=Hondros|first=Nathan|date=2016-06-22|website=Mandurah Mail|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref> then had a local graffiti artist add even more colour to the piece.

He has actively stood up for journalists at the ABC and [[Sydney morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]], using Parliamentary privilege to name Chau Chak Wing as a man who co-conspired to bribe a UN official, a man who took the media outlets to court for defamation as they had published the accusations. Hastie explained his actions by saying \"...democracy works only if we have a free press that can publish information that serves the public interest.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-23/turnbull-did-not-know-hastie-would-make-chau-chak-wing-claims/9790476|title=Liberal MP says he did his duty in speaking up about political donor|last=Yaxley|first=political reporters Louise|last2=Gribbin|first2=Caitlyn|date=2018-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18|last3=Conifer|first3=Dan}}</ref> However, current laws have allowed for the Australian Federal Police to raid journalists from the ABC and News Corp Australia for reasons of security. This places a tension between freedom and sovereignty.\n\n==== Freedom of religion ====\nWhile an observant Christian, Hastie holds to the view that if the law allows him to practice his faith, it must allow all to express their faith, or lack of it. That means that traditional Muslim families must be allowed to have women wear the burka in public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-02/keeping-the-faith-andrew-hastie/8477382|title=Andrew Hastie on poetry, political courage, and not banning the burka|last=Alexandra Beech|date=2017-05-02|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Sovereignty ===\n[[File:Andrew Hastie MP with Mayor Rhys Williams at March 2020 Citizenship Ceremony in Mandurah photo taken by D Birch.jpg|thumb|The Mayor of Mandurah, Rhys Williams, with Andrew Hastie MP, hosting an Australian Citizenship ceremony in March 2020]]\nHastie has argued that only Australia should make decisions that affect Australia's future or the working of our institutions. As such he strongly resists foreign influence on the working of the Australian economy, culture or political system. \"My bottom line is Australian sovereignty \u2013 I want to protect our way of life, our freedom of action and our political institutions. That's my job as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. I make no apologies for it.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-a-dead-spy-chinese-hackers-and-the-australian-commando-warning-israel-1.8223349|title=A Dead Spy, Chinese Hackers and the Australian Commando Warning Israel|date=2019-12-06|work=Haaretz|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic sovereignty ====\nInterestingly, Hastie locates the energy debates within the concern for Australian sovereignty, and it was this issue that meant he could never support the [[National Energy Guarantee]]. In August 2018, he posted his position: \"My priority is Australia's economic sovereignty and affordable power prices. Here I stand.\" The next month he made a speech in the Federation Chamber, saying, \"Australian industry and Australian workers must come first. When it comes to energy, we must put the Australian people before Paris.\"\n\n==== Sovereignty and political warfare ====\nThis has been the main legislative focus for Hastie in recent times. In an interview with the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Hastie explained that, \"Democratic countries must take domestic measures to protect against these threats. Australia has led the way in this regard. Authoritarian states use all instruments of state power to pursue their strategic objectives. Seemingly innocent activities like diplomacy, foreign-investment flows into strategic industries and infrastructure acquisitions like the purchase of ports are not so innocuous. Democracies who don't pay attention to these activities \u2013 and take measures to guard against them \u2013 risk becoming tethered to hyper-modern authoritarian states and losing their sovereignty in the process.\"<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==== Digital sovereignty ====\nHastie frames questions to do with the provision of information networks as a matter of sovereignty, which must be defended. Given that companies such as Huawei would be legally required to pass on information carried on their networks to the Chinese government,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/huawei-would-have-to-give-data-to-china-government-if-asked-experts.html|title=Huawei says it would never hand data to China's government.

Along with other parliamentarians from the Liberal Party, including [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] and [[James Paterson (Australian politician)|James Paterson]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor's]] [[Kimberley Kitching]] and [[Anthony Byrne (politician)|Anthony Byrne]], he has been active in applying pressure to Australia's partners in the [[Five Eyes]] security alliance to do the same. In a public statement he explained how important that security arrangement is, \"In a time of growing strategic uncertainty, Australia values that membership more than ever.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/four-australian-mps-urge-britain-to-ban-huawei-20200124-p53u9x.html|title=Four Australian MPs urge Britain to ban Huawei|last=Bourke|first=Latika|date=2020-01-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> In private settings, it is known that he has supported Byrne, the Deputy Chair of the committee Hastie leads, who used forceful language with the UK leadership, asking \u201cHow would you feel if the Russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks?

In an interview about his wartime experiences, he said:<blockquote> For me, it proved that culture and geography (are) decisive in the formation of societies and political institutions.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

First, in the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the convention, drawing on the inspiration of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] can be seen as part of a wider response of the Allied Powers in delivering a human rights agenda through which it was believed that the most serious human rights violations which had occurred during the Second World War could be avoided in the future. Second, the Convention was a response to the growth of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and designed to protect the member states of the [[Council of Europe]] from communist subversion. This, in part, explains the constant references to values and principles that are \"necessary in a democratic society\" throughout the Convention, despite the fact that such principles are not in any way defined within the convention itself.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ovey|first=Clare|title=The European Convention on Human Rights|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-928810-6|pages=1\u20133|author2=Robin C.A.

Over 100 parliamentarians from the twelve member states of the Council of Europe gathered in Strasbourg in the summer of 1949 for the first ever meeting of the Council's Consultative Assembly to draft a \"charter of human rights\" and to establish a court to enforce it. British MP and lawyer Sir [[David Maxwell-Fyfe]], the Chair of the Assembly's Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the Convention.

The main rights and freedoms are contained in Section I, which consists of Articles 2 to 18. Section II (Articles 19 to 51) sets up the Court and its rules of operation. Section III contains various concluding provisions.\n\nBefore the entry into force of Protocol 11, Section II (Article 19) set up the Commission and the Court, Sections III (Articles 20 to 37) and IV (Articles 38 to 59) included the high-level machinery for the operation of, respectively, the Commission and the Court, and Section V contained various concluding provisions.\n\nMany of the Articles in Section I are structured in two paragraphs: the first sets out a basic right or freedom (such as Article 2(1) \u2013 the right to life) but the second contains various exclusions, exceptions or limitations on the basic right (such as Article 2(2) \u2013 which excepts certain uses of force leading to death).\n\n==={{anchor|Article 1}}Article 1 \u2013 respecting rights===\n\n{{Main article|Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 1 simply binds the signatory parties to secure the rights under the other Articles of the Convention \"within their jurisdiction\".

(For more on Protocols 6 and 13, see [[#Protocol 13 \u2013 complete abolition of death penalty|below]]).\n\nThe second paragraph of Article 2 provides that death resulting from defending oneself or others, arresting a suspect or fugitive, or suppressing riots or insurrections, will not contravene the Article when the use of force involved is \"no more than absolutely necessary\".\n\nSignatory states to the Convention can only derogate from the rights contained in Article 2 for deaths which result from lawful acts of war.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights did not rule upon the right to life until 1995, when in ''[[McCann and Others v United Kingdom]]''<ref>(1995) 21 EHRR 97</ref> it ruled that the exception contained in the second paragraph does not constitute situations when it is permitted to kill, but situations where it is permitted to use force which might result in the deprivation of life.<ref>(1995) 21 EHRR 97 at para. 148</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Article 3}}Article 3 \u2013 torture===\n\n{{Main article|Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\n\nArticle 3 prohibits [[torture]] and \"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\".

Under the \"independent tribunal\" requirement, the Court has ruled that military judges in Turkish state security courts are incompatible with Article 6. In compliance with this Article, Turkey has now adopted a law abolishing these courts.\n\nAnother significant set of violations concerns the \"confrontation clause\" of Article 6 (i.e. the right to examine witnesses or have them examined).

The Court has defended this on the grounds that the article was intended to apply only to different-sex marriage, and that a wide margin of appreciation must be granted to parties in this area.\n\nIn ''[[Goodwin v United Kingdom]]'' the Court ruled that a law which still classified post-operative [[transsexual]] persons under their pre-operative sex violated article 12 as it meant that transsexual persons were unable to marry individuals of their post-operative opposite sex. This reversed an earlier ruling in ''[[Rees v United Kingdom]]''. This did not, however, alter the Court's understanding that Article 12 protects only different-sex couples.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights ruled in ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'' that countries are not required to provide marriage licenses for same-sex couples; however, if a country allows same-sex couple marriage it must be done under the same conditions that opposite-sex couples marriage face, in order to prevent a breach of article 14 \u2013 the prohibition of discrimination. Additionally, the court ruled in the 2015 case of ''[[Oliari and Others v Italy]]'' that states have a positive obligation to ensure there is a specific legal framework for the recognition and protection of same-sex couples.\n\n==={{anchor|Article 13}}Article 13 \u2013 effective remedy===\nArticle 13 provides for the right for an effective [[legal remedy|remedy]] before national authorities for violations of rights under the Convention. The inability to obtain a remedy before a national court for an infringement of a Convention right is thus a free-standing and separately actionable infringement of the Convention.\n\n==={{anchor|Article 14}}Article 14 \u2013 discrimination===\nArticle 14 contains a prohibition of [[discrimination]]. This prohibition is broad in some ways and narrow in others. It is broad in that it prohibits discrimination under a potentially unlimited number of grounds. While the article specifically prohibits discrimination based on \"sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status\", the last of these allows the court to extend to Article 14 protection to other grounds not specifically mentioned such as has been done regarding discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation.\n\nAt the same time, the article's protection is limited in that it only prohibits discrimination with respect to rights under the Convention. Thus, an applicant must prove discrimination in the enjoyment of a specific right that is guaranteed elsewhere in the Convention (e.g. discrimination based on sex \u2013 Article 14 \u2013 in the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression \u2013 Article 10).

Permissible derogations under article 15 must meet three substantive conditions:\n\n# there must be a public emergency threatening the life of the nation;\n# any measures taken in response must be \"strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\"; and\n# the measures taken in response to it must be in compliance with a state's other obligations under international law.\n\nIn addition to these substantive requirements, the derogation must be procedurally sound.

This addresses instances where states seek to restrict a human right in the name of another human right, or where individuals rely on a human right to undermine other human rights (for example where an individual issues a death threat).\n\n*''[[Communist Party of Germany v. the Federal Republic of Germany]]'' (1957), the Commission refused to consider the appeal by the [[Communist Party of Germany]], stating that the communist doctrine advocated by them is incompatible with the convention, citing article 17's limitations on the rights to the extent necessarily to prevent their subversion by adherents of a totalitarian doctrine.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rainey |first1=Bernadette |first2=Wicks | last2=Elizabeth |first3=Overy|last3=Clare |date=2014 |title=Jacobs, White and Ovey: The European Convention on Human Rights |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TGygAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=%22250/57%22+communist|location= |publisher=Oxford University Press|page=121 |isbn=9780199655083 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Article 18}}Article 18 \u2013 permitted restrictions===\n{{main article|Article 18 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}\nArticle 18 provides that any limitations on the rights provided for in the Convention may be used only for the purpose for which they are provided. For example, Article 5, which guarantees the right to personal freedom, may be explicitly limited in order to bring a suspect before a judge. To use pre-trial detention as a means of intimidation of a person under a false pretext is, therefore, a limitation of right (to freedom) which does not serve an explicitly provided purpose (to be brought before a judge), and is therefore contrary to Article 18.\n\n==Convention protocols==\n{{As of|January 2010}}, fifteen protocols to the Convention have been opened for signature. These can be divided into two main groups: those amending the framework of the convention system, and those expanding the rights that can be protected. The former require unanimous ratification by member states before coming into force, while the latter require a certain number of states to sign before coming into force.\n\n===Protocol 1===\nThis Protocol contains three different rights which the signatories could not agree to place in the Convention itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/009 |title=Full list |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref> [[Monaco]] and [[Switzerland]] have signed but never ratified Protocol 1.<ref>[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=009&CM=8&DF=21/02/2011&CL=ENG1st protocol signatory and ratification info], Council of Europe treaties office.</ref>\n\n===={{anchor|Article 1}}Article 1 \u2013 property====\nArticle 1 (\"A1P1\") <ref>UK Supreme Court, [https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0148-press-summary.pdf R (on the application of Mott) (Respondent) v Environment Agency (Appellant) (2018) UKSC 10: Press Summary], published 14 February 2018, accessed 28 December 2018</ref>  provides that \"every natural or [[legal person]] is entitled to the [[Right to property|peaceful enjoyment of his possessions]]\".

It has been suggested that the protocol is therefore in a [[catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]], since the UK will decline to either sign or ratify the protocol until the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has addressed the meaning of the provision, while the court is hindered in doing so by the lack of applications to the court concerning the protocol caused by the decisions of Europe's most populous states\u2014including the UK\u2014not to ratify the protocol.

These amendments have, with the exception of Protocol 2, amended the text of the convention. Protocol 2 did not amend the text of the convention as such but stipulated that it was to be treated as an integral part of the text. All of these protocols have required the unanimous ratification of all the member states of the Council of Europe to enter into force.\n\n====Protocol 11====\nProtocols 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 have now been superseded by Protocol 11 which entered into force on 1 November 1998.<ref>{{cite web |title=List of the treaties coming from the subject-matter: Human Rights (Convention and Protocols only) |url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeTraites.asp?MA=3&CM=7&CL=ENG |accessdate=21 February 2009}}</ref> It established a fundamental change in the machinery of the convention. It abolished the Commission, allowing individuals to apply directly to the Court, which was given compulsory jurisdiction and altered the latter's structure. Previously states could ratify the Convention without accepting the jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights. The protocol also abolished the judicial functions of the Committee of Ministers.\n\n====Protocol 14====\nProtocol 14 follows on from Protocol 11 in proposing to further improve the efficiency of the Court. It seeks to \"filter\" out cases that have less chance of succeeding along with those that are broadly similar to cases brought previously against the same member state. Furthermore, a case will not be considered admissible where an applicant has not suffered a \"significant disadvantage\". This latter ground can only be used when an examination of the application on the merits is not considered necessary and where the subject-matter of the application had already been considered by a national court.\n\nA new mechanism was introduced by Protocol 14 to assist enforcement of judgements by the Committee of Ministers. The Committee can ask the Court for an interpretation of a judgement and can even bring a member state before the Court for non-compliance of a previous judgement against that state. Protocol 14 also allows for [[European Union]] [[Relationship between the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights#EU accession to ECHR|accession to the Convention]].<ref>See Article 17 of the [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/194.htm Protocol No. 14] amending Article 59 of the Convention.</ref> The protocol has been ratified by every Council of Europe member state, Russia being last in February 2010.

It allowed single judges to reject manifestly inadmissible applications made against the states that have ratified the protocol. It also extended the competence of three-judge chambers to declare applications made against those states admissible and to decide on their merits where there already is a well-established case law of the Court. Now that all Council of Europe member states have ratified Protocol 14, Protocol 14bis has lost its ''raison d'\u00eatre'' and according to its own terms ceased to have any effect when Protocol 14 entered into force on 1 June 2010.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Capital punishment in Europe]]\n*[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]\n*[[European Social Charter]]\n*[[Human Rights Act 1998]] for how the Convention has been incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom.\n*[[Human rights in Europe]]\n*[[Territorial scope of European Convention on Human Rights]]\n*[[European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003]] Irish Act similar to the British [[Human Rights Act 1998]].\n*[[International Institute of Human Rights]]\n*[[UK constitutional law]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |title=Jacobs & White: The European Convention on Human Rights |first1=Clare |last1=Ovey |first2=Robin C.

First, in the aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the convention, drawing on the inspiration of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] can be seen as part of a wider response of the Allied Powers in delivering a human rights agenda through which it was believed that the most serious human rights violations which had occurred during the Second World War could be avoided in the future. Second, the Convention was a response to the growth of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and designed to protect the member states of the [[Council of Europe]] from communist subversion. This, in part, explains the constant references to values and principles that are \"necessary in a democratic society\" throughout the Convention, despite the fact that such principles are not in any way defined within the convention itself.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ovey|first=Clare|title=The European Convention on Human Rights|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-928810-6|pages=1\u20133|author2=Robin C.A.

Over 100 parliamentarians from the twelve member states of the Council of Europe gathered in Strasbourg in the summer of 1949 for the first ever meeting of the Council's Consultative Assembly to draft a \"charter of human rights\" and to establish a court to enforce it. British MP and lawyer Sir [[David Maxwell-Fyfe]], the Chair of the Assembly's Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the Convention.

The Court has defended this on the grounds that the article was intended to apply only to different-sex marriage, and that a wide margin of appreciation must be granted to parties in this area.\n\nIn ''[[Goodwin v United Kingdom]]'' the Court ruled that a law which still classified post-operative [[transsexual]] persons under their pre-operative sex violated article 12 as it meant that transsexual persons were unable to marry individuals of their post-operative opposite sex. This reversed an earlier ruling in ''[[Rees v United Kingdom]]''. This did not, however, alter the Court's understanding that Article 12 protects only different-sex couples.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights ruled in ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'' that countries are not required to provide marriage licenses for same-sex couples; however, if a country allows same-sex couple marriage it must be done under the same conditions that opposite-sex couples marriage face, in order to prevent a breach of article 14 \u2013 the prohibition of discrimination. Additionally, the court ruled in the 2015 case of ''[[Oliari and Others v Italy]]'' that states have a positive obligation to ensure there is a specific legal framework for the recognition and protection of same-sex couples.\n\n==={{anchor|Article 13}}Article 13 \u2013 effective remedy===\nArticle 13 provides for the right for an effective [[legal remedy|remedy]] before national authorities for violations of rights under the Convention. The inability to obtain a remedy before a national court for an infringement of a Convention right is thus a free-standing and separately actionable infringement of the Convention.\n\n==={{anchor|Article 14}}Article 14 \u2013 discrimination===\nArticle 14 contains a prohibition of [[discrimination]]. This prohibition is broad in some ways and narrow in others. It is broad in that it prohibits discrimination under a potentially unlimited number of grounds. While the article specifically prohibits discrimination based on \"sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status\", the last of these allows the court to extend to Article 14 protection to other grounds not specifically mentioned such as has been done regarding discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation.\n\nAt the same time, the article's protection is limited in that it only prohibits discrimination with respect to rights under the Convention. Thus, an applicant must prove discrimination in the enjoyment of a specific right that is guaranteed elsewhere in the Convention (e.g. discrimination based on sex \u2013 Article 14 \u2013 in the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression \u2013 Article 10).

Permissible derogations under article 15 must meet three substantive conditions:\n\n# there must be a public emergency threatening the life of the nation;\n# any measures taken in response must be \"strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\"; and\n# the measures taken in response to it must be in compliance with a state's other obligations under international law.\n\nIn addition to these substantive requirements, the derogation must be procedurally sound.

For example, Article 5, which guarantees the right to personal freedom, may be explicitly limited in order to bring a suspect before a judge. To use pre-trial detention as a means of intimidation of a person under a false pretext is, therefore, a limitation of right (to freedom) which does not serve an explicitly provided purpose (to be brought before a judge), and is therefore contrary to Article 18.\n\n==Convention protocols==\n{{As of|January 2010}}, fifteen protocols to the Convention have been opened for signature. These can be divided into two main groups: those amending the framework of the convention system, and those expanding the rights that can be protected.

It has been suggested that the protocol is therefore in a [[catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]], since the UK will decline to either sign or ratify the protocol until the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has addressed the meaning of the provision, while the court is hindered in doing so by the lack of applications to the court concerning the protocol caused by the decisions of Europe's most populous states\u2014including the UK\u2014not to ratify the protocol.

These amendments have, with the exception of Protocol 2, amended the text of the convention. Protocol 2 did not amend the text of the convention as such but stipulated that it was to be treated as an integral part of the text. All of these protocols have required the unanimous ratification of all the member states of the Council of Europe to enter into force.\n\n====Protocol 11====\nProtocols 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 have now been superseded by Protocol 11 which entered into force on 1 November 1998.<ref>{{cite web |title=List of the treaties coming from the subject-matter: Human Rights (Convention and Protocols only) |url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeTraites.asp?MA=3&CM=7&CL=ENG |accessdate=21 February 2009}}</ref> It established a fundamental change in the machinery of the convention. It abolished the Commission, allowing individuals to apply directly to the Court, which was given compulsory jurisdiction and altered the latter's structure. Previously states could ratify the Convention without accepting the jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights. The protocol also abolished the judicial functions of the Committee of Ministers.\n\n====Protocol 14====\nProtocol 14 follows on from Protocol 11 in proposing to further improve the efficiency of the Court. It seeks to \"filter\" out cases that have less chance of succeeding along with those that are broadly similar to cases brought previously against the same member state. Furthermore, a case will not be considered admissible where an applicant has not suffered a \"significant disadvantage\". This latter ground can only be used when an examination of the application on the merits is not considered necessary and where the subject-matter of the application had already been considered by a national court.\n\nA new mechanism was introduced by Protocol 14 to assist enforcement of judgements by the Committee of Ministers. The Committee can ask the Court for an interpretation of a judgement and can even bring a member state before the Court for non-compliance of a previous judgement against that state. Protocol 14 also allows for [[European Union]] [[Relationship between the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights#EU accession to ECHR|accession to the Convention]].<ref>See Article 17 of the [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/194.htm Protocol No. 14] amending Article 59 of the Convention.</ref> The protocol has been ratified by every Council of Europe member state, Russia being last in February 2010.

It allowed single judges to reject manifestly inadmissible applications made against the states that have ratified the protocol. It also extended the competence of three-judge chambers to declare applications made against those states admissible and to decide on their merits where there already is a well-established case law of the Court. Now that all Council of Europe member states have ratified Protocol 14, Protocol 14bis has lost its ''raison d'\u00eatre'' and according to its own terms ceased to have any effect when Protocol 14 entered into force on 1 June 2010.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Capital punishment in Europe]]\n*[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]\n*[[European Social Charter]]\n*[[Human Rights Act 1998]] for how the Convention has been incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom.\n*[[Human rights in Europe]]\n*[[Territorial scope of European Convention on Human Rights]]\n*[[European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003]] Irish Act similar to the British [[Human Rights Act 1998]].\n*[[International Institute of Human Rights]]\n*[[UK constitutional law]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |title=Jacobs & White: The European Convention on Human Rights |first1=Clare |last1=Ovey |first2=Robin C.

This page lists slang words or phrases that originate with military forces, are used exclusively by military personnel or are strongly associated with military organizations.\n\n==Acronym slang==\nA number of military slang terms are [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]]. These include ''SNAFU'', ''SUSFU'', ''FUBAR'' and similar terms used by various branches of the United States military during World War II.\n\n===BOHICA===\n''BOHICA'' (''Bend Over, Here It Comes Again'') is the title of a bestselling 1987 book by Scott T. Barnes. The book is the true account of a US ISA covert paramilitary operation, dubbed Operation Grand Eagle, that took place in Laos in 1981 with a small group of Green Berets, ISA operatives, and CIA staff. Later the operation would be the subject of several US Senate hearings, congressional hearings, and a Federal Grand Jury investigation.\n\n\"BOHICA\" was to be used as the code word on covert communications with the NSA/CIA and ISA HQ. During the mission, it was uncovered that criminals of war were still being held captive in Laos. Two were ordered assassinated and to date have never been rescued, as it was determined they may have been off-the-book CIA operatives smuggling drugs.\n\nThe ''Log,'' the humor magazine written by and for Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, featured a series of comics titled \"The Bohica Brothers,\" dating back to the early 1970s.\n\n===FUBAR===\n{{distinguish-otheruses2|Foobar|FUBAR}}\n{{Wiktionary|FUBAR}}\n\n''FUBAR'' (''Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition/Any Repair/All Reason''), like SNAFU and SUSFU, dates from [[World War II]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' lists ''Yank, the Army Weekly magazine'' (1944, 7 Jan. p.&nbsp;8) as its earliest citation: \"The FUBAR squadron. \u2025 FUBAR? It means 'Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |title =fubar, ''adj''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Pres |location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nAnother version of FUBAR, said to have originated in the military, gives its meaning as Fucked Up By Assholes in the Rear. This version has at least surface validity in that it is a common belief among enlisted men and women that most problems are created by the military brass (officers, especially those bearing the rank of General, from one to four stars). This version is also most likely to have had its origin in the Army, where the senior officers command from the rear, as opposed to the Navy, where it is not uncommon for Admirals to command a fleet from one of the ships at sea, and therefore susceptible to attacks and death by the enemy (though it is freely acknowledged that the higher level Admirals usually command from a land base). Ditto as to Air Force Generals, who do not fly and/or directly command airplanes or even Squadrons or Air Wings. FUBAR had a resurgence in the American lexicon after the term was used in two popular movies: [[Tango and Cash]] (1989) and [[Saving Private Ryan]] (1998).<ref>{{cite web |title=Which movie did FUBAR come from?(forums) |url=https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/which-movie-did-fubar-come-from.1643805/ |website=ananadtech.com |publisher=Anandtech |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis particular FUBAR acronym survived WWII and for a time in the 70s, found its way into the lexicon of management consultants.

This page lists slang words or phrases that originate with military forces, are used exclusively by military personnel or are strongly associated with military organizations.\n\n==Acronym slang==\nA number of military slang terms are [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]]. These include ''SNAFU'', ''SUSFU'', ''FUBAR'' and similar terms used by various branches of the United States military during World War II.\n\n===BOHICA===\n''BOHICA'' (''Bend Over, Here It Comes Again'') is the title of a bestselling 1987 book by Scott T. Barnes. The book is the true account of a US ISA covert paramilitary operation, dubbed Operation Grand Eagle, that took place in Laos in 1981 with a small group of Green Berets, ISA operatives, and CIA staff. Later the operation would be the subject of several US Senate hearings, congressional hearings, and a Federal Grand Jury investigation.\n\n\"BOHICA\" was to be used as the code word on covert communications with the NSA/CIA and ISA HQ. During the mission, it was uncovered that criminals of war were still being held captive in Laos. Two were ordered assassinated and to date have never been rescued, as it was determined they may have been off-the-book CIA operatives smuggling drugs.\n\nThe ''Log,'' the humor magazine written by and for Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, featured a series of comics titled \"The Bohica Brothers,\" dating back to the early 1970s.\n\n===FUBAR===\n{{distinguish-otheruses2|Foobar|FUBAR}}\n{{Wiktionary|FUBAR}}\n\n''FUBAR'' (''Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition/Any Repair/All Reason''), like SNAFU and SUSFU, dates from [[World War II]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' lists ''Yank, the Army Weekly magazine'' (1944, 7 Jan. p.&nbsp;8) as its earliest citation: \"The FUBAR squadron. \u2025 FUBAR? It means 'Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |title =fubar, ''adj''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Pres |location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nAnother version of FUBAR, said to have originated in the military, gives its meaning as Fucked Up By Assholes in the Rear. This version has at least surface validity in that it is a common belief among enlisted men and women that most problems are created by the military brass (officers, especially those bearing the rank of General, from one to four stars). This version is also most likely to have had its origin in the Army, where the senior officers command from the rear, as opposed to the Navy, where it is not uncommon for Admirals to command a fleet from one of the ships at sea, and therefore susceptible to attacks and death by the enemy (though it is freely acknowledged that the higher level Admirals usually command from a land base). Ditto as to Air Force Generals, who do not fly and/or directly command airplanes or even Squadrons or Air Wings. FUBAR had a resurgence in the American lexicon after the term was used in two popular movies: [[Tango and Cash]] (1989) and [[Saving Private Ryan]] (1998).<ref>{{cite web |title=Which movie did FUBAR come from?(forums) |url=https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/which-movie-did-fubar-come-from.1643805/ |website=ananadtech.com |publisher=Anandtech |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis particular FUBAR acronym survived WWII and for a time in the 70s, found its way into the lexicon of management consultants. Their use of the term,(though the word, \u201crear,\u201d is not normally used to describe the vantage point of senior corporate executives) may have come about as the result of their frequent conclusions that the cause of corporate problems (inefficiencies and ineffectiveness causing poor profitability or a negative bottom line) rested not with rank and file workers, but with executives, particularly senior executives - the equivalent of senior military officers. Therefore, FUBAR (Fucked Up By Assholes in the Rear) still applied well, even if in reality it should have been rendered as FUBAT (Fucked Up By Assholes at the Top).\n\n===FUBU===\n{{distinguish|FUBU}}\n''FUBU'' (''Fucked/fouled Up Beyond all Understanding'') was also used during World War II.\n\n===SNAFU===\n{{main|SNAFU}}\n''SNAFU'' is widely used to stand for the sarcastic expression ''Situation Normal: All Fucked Up'', as a well-known example of military acronym slang.

The character's likeness in the series is based on that in ''The Phantom Menace'' and ''Attack of the Clones''. In the first chapters, he defends the grasslands planet [[Dantooine]] against a large hovering \"fortress\", and over the course, he loses his lightsaber, forcing him to instead use a lethal form of unarmed combat powered by the Force. In final chapters, he and fellow Jedi Master Yoda help defend the planet [[Coruscant]] from an attack by General Grievous. In the midst of the [[Battle of Coruscant|battle]], he realizes that the attack is a ruse to distract the Jedi from Grievous's true objective: to \"kidnap\" Palpatine.

Stover based the novel on both [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', and its loose adaptation ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. George Lucas wrote the prologue to the novel, and Jonathan Davis reads the [[audiobook]] version.\n\nWindu's former [[Padawan (Star Wars)|Padawan]] and fellow Jedi Master [[Depa Billaba]] has been sent to Windu's homeworld, Haruun Kal, to start a revolution against the Separatist-allied government. Evidence is discovered that Billaba has fallen to the dark side of the Force. Since Windu taught her a special lightsaber combat form, he alone is sent by the Jedi Council to find her.\nAfter a fight, he puts Billaba under arrest, and calls a Republic cruiser. It is attacked by [[Vulture droid]]s and deploys gunships, which battle the droid starfighters with the assistance of clone troopers. Some of the landing craft make it to the surface, and the cruiser defeats the Separatists. Windu uses the gunships to destroy the droid fighters that followed them, then orders the clones to take out a nearby droid control station. The Separatists are forced to surrender to the Republic, and Billaba falls into a [[vegetative state|vegetative]] [[coma]]. A Republic force stays on the planet to police the unrestful local tribes.\n\nThe novel establishes that Windu has the unique talent of seeing \"shatterpoints\", or [[Fault (geology)|faultlines]] in the Force that could affect the destinies of certain individuals. Mace's shatterpoint ability also enables him to see people's weaknesses, allowing him to exploit their flaws and defeat them. It also explains that Windu is the creator and sole master of a style of lightsaber combat called Vaapad, in which the user skirts dangerously close to the dark side by enjoying the thrill of the fight. All others who attempted to master the form either gave in to the dark side or were unable to properly master the technique. Stover later referenced Windu's unique lightsaber-fighting abilities in his [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (novel)|novelization of ''Revenge of the Sith'']].\n\n====Comics====\nThe \"[[Star Wars: Republic#Emissaries to Malastare|Emissaries to Malastare]]\" arc of the [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] comic ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' depicts a Jedi exercise in which the knights swap their weapons, explaining why Windu carried a blue-bladed lightsaber during the era of ''The Phantom Menace''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gerard |first=Michael |title=Why Mace Windu's Lightsaber Changed From Blue To Purple In Star Wars |url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/truth-mace-windus-original-lightsaber-color/ |website=We Got This Covered |accessdate=October 13, 2019 |date=July 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Merchandising==\nA Mace Windu action figure was added to the [[Star Wars Transformers|''Star Wars'' Transformers]] toy line in 2006.

Despite being too late to save the Supreme Chancellor, the Jedi Master uses the Force to crush Grievous's chest, inflicting upon the [[cyborg]] general the wheezing, [[asthma]]tic cough heard in ''Revenge of the Sith''.\n\n====Novels====\nWindu has appeared as a supporting character in Legends/Expanded Universe novels, such as ''[[Cloak of Deception]], [[Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter]], [[Rogue Planet (novel)|Rogue Planet]], [[Outbound Flight]], [[The Cestus Deception]], [[Jedi Trial]], [[Yoda: Dark Rendezvous]]'' and ''[[Labyrinth of Evil]]''.\n\n=====''Shatterpoint''=====\n{{Infobox book\n|name = Shatterpoint\n|italic title = no\n|image = \n|author = [[Matthew Stover]]\n|cover_artist = \n|country = United States\n|language = English\n|series = Canon [[Star Wars canon|C]]\n|subject =[[Star Wars]]\n|genre = [[Science fiction]]\n|publisher = [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] & [[Random House Audio]]\n|release_date = [[Hardcover]]: June 3, 2003<br>\n[[Paperback]]: April 23, 2004\n|pages = Hardcover: 464<br>\nPaperback: 432<br>\nAudiobook: 3h 45m 17s\n|isbn = 0-345-45573-8\n|preceded_by = Boba Fett: Hunted\n|followed_by = [[The Cestus Deception]]\n}}\n\nWindu is the central character of [[Matthew Stover]]'s 2004 novel '''''Shatterpoint''''', taking place six months after ''Attack of the Clones''. Stover based the novel on both [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', and its loose adaptation ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. George Lucas wrote the prologue to the novel, and Jonathan Davis reads the [[audiobook]] version.\n\nWindu's former [[Padawan (Star Wars)|Padawan]] and fellow Jedi Master [[Depa Billaba]] has been sent to Windu's homeworld, Haruun Kal, to start a revolution against the Separatist-allied government. Evidence is discovered that Billaba has fallen to the dark side of the Force. Since Windu taught her a special lightsaber combat form, he alone is sent by the Jedi Council to find her.\nAfter a fight, he puts Billaba under arrest, and calls a Republic cruiser. It is attacked by [[Vulture droid]]s and deploys gunships, which battle the droid starfighters with the assistance of clone troopers. Some of the landing craft make it to the surface, and the cruiser defeats the Separatists. Windu uses the gunships to destroy the droid fighters that followed them, then orders the clones to take out a nearby droid control station. The Separatists are forced to surrender to the Republic, and Billaba falls into a [[vegetative state|vegetative]] [[coma]]. A Republic force stays on the planet to police the unrestful local tribes.\n\nThe novel establishes that Windu has the unique talent of seeing \"shatterpoints\", or [[Fault (geology)|faultlines]] in the Force that could affect the destinies of certain individuals. Mace's shatterpoint ability also enables him to see people's weaknesses, allowing him to exploit their flaws and defeat them. It also explains that Windu is the creator and sole master of a style of lightsaber combat called Vaapad, in which the user skirts dangerously close to the dark side by enjoying the thrill of the fight. All others who attempted to master the form either gave in to the dark side or were unable to properly master the technique. Stover later referenced Windu's unique lightsaber-fighting abilities in his [[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (novel)|novelization of ''Revenge of the Sith'']].\n\n====Comics====\nThe \"[[Star Wars: Republic#Emissaries to Malastare|Emissaries to Malastare]]\" arc of the [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] comic ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' depicts a Jedi exercise in which the knights swap their weapons, explaining why Windu carried a blue-bladed lightsaber during the era of ''The Phantom Menace''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gerard |first=Michael |title=Why Mace Windu's Lightsaber Changed From Blue To Purple In Star Wars |url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/truth-mace-windus-original-lightsaber-color/ |website=We Got This Covered |accessdate=October 13, 2019 |date=July 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Merchandising==\nA Mace Windu action figure was added to the [[Star Wars Transformers|''Star Wars'' Transformers]] toy line in 2006.
