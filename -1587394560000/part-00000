Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] (CVE) database. An ''exploitable'' vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or \"[[Exploit (computer security)|exploit\"]] exists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Computer Security and Mobile Security Challenges |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979 |website=researchgate.net |accessdate=2016-08-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012010519/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979_Computer_Security_and_Mobile_Security_Challenges |archivedate=12 October 2016 |df=dmy-all |date=2015-12-03 }}</ref> Vulnerabilities are often hunted or exploited with the aid of [[Automated threat|automated tools]] or manually using customized scripts. To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these [[threat (computer)|threats]] can typically be classified into one of these categories below:\n\n===Backdoor===\nA [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] in a computer system, a [[cryptosystem]] or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal [[authentication]] or security controls. They may exist for a number of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.  Backdoors can be very hard to detect, and detection of backdoors are usually discovered by someone who has access to application source code or intimate knowledge of the computer's Operating System.\n\n===Denial-of-service attack===\n[[Denial of service attacks]] (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.<ref>{{cite web |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attack |url=https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |website=csa.gov.sg |accessdate=12 November 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806080013/https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |archivedate=6 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single [[IP address]] can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of [[Distributed denial of service#Distributed attack|Distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points \u2013 and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the [[zombie computer]]s of a [[botnet]], or from a range of other possible techniques, including [[Distributed Reflection Denial of Service|reflection and amplification attacks]], where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.\n\n===Direct-access attacks===\nAn unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making [[operating system]] modifications, installing software [[computer worm|worms]], [[keystroke logging|keyloggers]], [[covert listening device]]s or using wireless mice. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a [[CD-ROM]] or other bootable media. [[Disk encryption]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] are designed to prevent these attacks.\n\n===Eavesdropping===\n[[Eavesdropping]] is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer \"conversation\" (communication), typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]] and [[Narus (company)|NarusInSight]] have been used by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to eavesdrop on the systems of [[internet service provider]]s. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] transmissions generated by the hardware; [[TEMPEST]] is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.\n\n=== Multi-vector, polymorphic attacks ===\nSurfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector,<ref>{{cite news |title=Multi-Vector Attacks Demand Multi-Vector Protection |work=MSSP Alert |date=July 24, 2018 |url=https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-guests/multi-vector-attacks-demand-multi-vector-protection/ }}</ref> polymorphic<ref>{{cite news |first=Renee |last=Millman |title=New polymorphic malware evades three quarters of AV scanners |work=SC Magazine UK |date=December 15, 2017 |url=https://www.scmagazineuk.com/new-polymorphic-malware-evades-three-quarters-of-av-scanners/article/718757/ }}</ref> cyber threats surfaced that combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread.

The fake website often asks for personal information, such as log-in details and passwords. This information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of [[Social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]].  Attackers are using creative ways to gain access to real accounts.  A very common scam is when attackers send fake invoices<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/02/phishers-send-fake-invoices|title=Phishers send fake invoices|date=2018-02-23|website=Consumer Information|language=en|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref> to recently purchased music or apps by the individual. \n\n===Privilege escalation===\n[[Privilege escalation]] describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level.

An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time, and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster. The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Authority within the city, with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility, [[Pepco]], the chance to better estimate energy demand. The D.C. proposal, however, would \"allow third-party vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution, which could potentially create more opportunities for cyber attackers to threaten the electric grid.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/13110-d-c-distributed-energy-proposal-draws-concerns-of-increased-cybersecurity-risks/|title=D.C. distributed energy proposal draws concerns of increased cybersecurity risks|last=Brandt|first=Jaclyn|date=2018-06-18|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Impact of security breaches==\nSerious financial damage has been caused by [[security breaches]], but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident, the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved. \"Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to [[computer virus|virus]] and [[computer worm|worm]] attacks and to hostile digital acts in general. The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $13 billion (worms and viruses only) to $226 billion (for all forms of covert attacks). The reliability of these estimates is often challenged; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal.\"<ref>Cashell, B., Jackson, W. D., Jickling, M., & Webel, B. (2004).

According to the classic [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in information security, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the [[expected value]] of the loss resulting from a cyber/information [[security breach]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Lawrence |last2=Loeb |first2=Martin |title=The Economics of Information Security Investment |journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security |date=November 2002 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=438\u2013457 |doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}</ref>\n\n==Attacker motivation==\nAs with [[physical security]], the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers. Some are thrill-seekers or [[Vandalism|vandals]], some are activists, others are criminals looking for financial gain. State-sponsored attackers are now common and well resourced but started with amateurs such as [[Markus Hess]] who hacked for the [[KGB]], as recounted by [[Clifford Stoll]] in ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]''.\n\nAdditionally, recent attacker motivations can be traced back to extremist organizations seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agendas.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} The growth of the internet, mobile technologies and inexpensive computing devices that has led to a rise in capabilities but also risk to environments that are deemed as vital to operations.

In this case, security is considered as a main feature.\n\nSome of the techniques in this approach include:\n* The [[principle of least privilege]], where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. That way even if an [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] gains access to that part, they have only limited access to the whole system.\n* [[Automated theorem proving]] to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.\n* [[Code review]]s and [[unit testing]], approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.\n* [[Defense in depth (computing)|Defense in depth]], where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.\n* Default secure settings, and design to \"fail secure\" rather than \"fail insecure\" (see [[fail-safe]] for the equivalent in [[safety engineering]]). Ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.\n* [[Audit trail]]s tracking system activity, so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. Storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.\n* [[Full disclosure (computer security)|Full disclosure]] of all vulnerabilities, to ensure that the \"[[vulnerability (computing)|window of vulnerability]]\" is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered.\n\n===Security architecture===\nThe Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture as \"the design [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned, and how they relate to the overall [[information technology architecture]]. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system's quality attributes: confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and [[assurance services]]\".<ref>[http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture Definitions: IT Security Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315012754/http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture |date=15 March 2014 }}. SecurityArchitecture.org, Jan, 2006</ref>\n\nTechopedia defines security architecture as \"a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible.\" The key attributes of security architecture are:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jannsen |first1=Cory |title=Security Architecture |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |website=Techopedia |publisher=Janalta Interactive Inc |accessdate=9 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003064643/http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |archivedate=3 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other.\n* the determination of controls based on risk assessment, good practice, finances, and legal matters.\n* the standardization of controls.\n\nPracticing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business, IT and security concerns in an organization.\n\n===Security measures===\nA state of computer \"security\" is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of the three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response. These processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:\n* [[User account]] [[access control]]s and [[cryptography]] can protect systems files and data, respectively.\n* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services, and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering. Firewalls can be both hardware- or software-based.\n* [[Intrusion Detection System]] (IDS) products are designed to detect network attacks in-progress and assist in post-attack [[forensics]], while [[audit trail]]s and [[data logging|logs]] serve a similar function for individual systems.\n* \"Response\" is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of [[legal]] authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. In some special cases, complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.\n\nToday, computer security comprises mainly \"preventive\" measures, like [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] or an [[exit procedure]]. A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the [[Internet]], and can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the [[network stack]] (or, in the case of most [[UNIX]]-based operating systems such as [[Linux]], built into the operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]) to provide real-time filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so-called \"physical firewall\", which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the [[Internet]].\n\nSome organizations are turning to [[big data]] platforms, such as [[Apache Hadoop]], to extend data accessibility and [[machine learning]] to detect [[advanced persistent threat]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|title=Why ONI May Be Our Best Hope for Cyber Security Now|last=Woodie|first=Alex|date=9 May 2016|access-date=13 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820015812/https://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHowever, relatively few organizations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems, and fewer still have organized response mechanisms in place.

It requires \"something you know\"; a password or PIN, and \"something you have\"; a card, dongle, cellphone, or other piece of hardware. This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.\n\nSocial engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information. Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk, but even in highly disciplined environments (e.g. military organizations), social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.\n\nInoculation, derived from [[inoculation theory]], seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.<ref>Treglia, J., & Delia, M.

The dongle, or key, essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key. The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle, such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) provides a stronger measure of security, since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it.

If they successfully breach security, they are often able to delete [[Data logging|logs]] to cover their tracks.\n* The sheer number of attempted attacks is so large that organizations cannot spend time pursuing each attacker (a typical home user with a permanent (e.g., [[cable modem]]) connection will be attacked at least several times per day, so more attractive targets could be presumed to see many more). Note, however, that most of the sheer bulk of these attacks are made by automated [[vulnerability scanner]]s and [[computer worm]]s.\n* [[Law enforcement officer]]s are often unfamiliar with [[information technology]], and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as [[DNA]] testing and improved [[forensics]], mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a [[network administrator]] or a [[system administrator]]) requires a [[search warrant]] and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.\n* The United States government spends the largest amount of money every year on cybersecurity. The United States has a yearly budget of 28 billion dollars. Canada has the 2nd highest annual budget at 1 billion dollars. Australia has the third-highest budget with only 70 million dollars.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n\n===Types of security and privacy===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Access control]]\n* [[Anti-keylogger]]s\n* [[Anti-malware]]\n* [[Anti-spyware]]\n* [[Anti-subversion software]]\n* [[Anti-tamper software]]\n* Anti-theft\n* [[Antivirus software]]\n* [[Cryptographic software]]\n* [[Computer-aided dispatch]] (CAD)\n* [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]]\n* [[Intrusion detection system]] (IDS)\n* [[Intrusion prevention system]] (IPS)\n* [[Log management software]]\n* Parental control\n* [[Records management]]\n* [[Sandbox (computer security)|Sandbox]]\n* [[Security information management]]\n* [[SIEM]]\n* Software and operating system updating\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Incident response planning==\nIncident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack. An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such as a data breach or system failure. The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to limit damage and reduce recovery time and costs. Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities, restore services and processes and minimize losses.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\nIncident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage. Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organization's response to a cyberattack. Without a documented plan in place, an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles, processes and procedures during an escalation, slowing the organization's response and resolution.\n\nThere are four key components of a computer security incident response plan:\n\n# '''Preparation''': Preparing stakeholders on the procedures for handling computer security incidents or compromises\n# '''Detection & Analysis''': Identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident, prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident\n# '''Containment, Eradication & Recovery''': Isolating affected systems to prevent escalation and limit impact, pinpointing the genesis of the incident, removing malware, affected systems and bad actors from the environment and restoring systems and data when a threat no longer remains\n# '''Post Incident Activity''': Post mortem analysis of the incident, its root cause and the organization's response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response efforts{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Notable attacks and breaches==\n{{Further|List of cyber-attacks|List of data breaches}}\nSome illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below.\n<!-- We don't want to list every breach ever \u2013 and please keep the descriptions short -->\n\n===Robert Morris and the first computer worm===\n{{Main|Morris worm}}\nIn 1988, only 60,000 computers were connected to the Internet, and most were mainframes, minicomputers and professional workstations.

These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive [[login]] screen, or individual services, such as a [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as [[passwords]], [[identification card]]s, [[smart card]]s, and [[biometric]] systems.\n* [[Anti-virus software]] consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate [[computer viruses]] and other malicious software ([[malware]]).\n* [[Application software|Applications]] are [[executable|executable code]], so general practice is to [[Superuser|disallow users the power]] to install them; to install only those which are known to be reputable \u2013 and to reduce the [[attack surface]] by installing as few as possible. They are typically run with [[least privilege]], with a robust process in place to identify, test and install any released [[security patch]]es or updates for them.\n* [[Authentication]] techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.\n* [[Automated theorem proving]] and other verification tools can enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.\n* [[Backup]]s are one or more copies kept of important computer files. Typically, multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged, other copies will still exist.\n* [[Capability-based security|Capability]] and [[access control list]] techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. [[Computer security#Capabilities vs. ACLs|Capabilities vs. ACLs]] discusses their use.\n* [[Chain of trust]] techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.\n* [[Confidentiality]] is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person.<ref>{{cite web |title=Confidentiality |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/confidentiality |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>\n* [[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems, reducing the probability that data exchanged between systems can be intercepted or modified.\n* [[Cyberwarfare]] is an Internet-based conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. Such attacks can, for example, disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and cripple financial systems.\n* [[Data integrity]] is the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record.<ref>{{cite web |title=Data Integrity |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |accessdate=2011-10-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106055944/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Encryption - decryption.svg|thumb|300px|[[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques involve transforming information, scrambling it, so it becomes unreadable during transmission. The intended recipient can unscramble the message; ideally, eavesdroppers cannot.]]\n* [[Encryption]] is used to protect the confidentiality of a message. [[Cryptography|Cryptographically]] secure [[cipher]]s are designed to make any practical attempt of [[cryptanalysis|breaking]] them infeasible. [[symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric-key]] ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using [[shared key]]s, and [[public-key encryption]] using [[digital certificate]]s can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.\n* [[Endpoint security]] software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and USB drives.<ref>{{cite web |title=Endpoint Security |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |accessdate=2014-03-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316021605/http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] serve as a gatekeeper system between networks, allowing only traffic that matches defined rules. They often include detailed [[Logfile|logging]], and may include [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection]] and [[Intrusion detection system#Intrusion prevention|intrusion prevention]] features. They are near-universal between company [[local area networks]] and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if [[network segmentation]] is configured.\n* A [[Security hacker|hacker]] is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network. \n* [[Honeypot (computing)|Honey pots]] are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques.\n* [[Intrusion-detection system]]s are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.\n* A [[microkernel]] is an approach to operating system design which has only the near-minimum amount of code running at the most privileged level \u2013 and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers, protocol stacks and file systems, in the safer, less privileged [[user space]].\n* [[Ping (networking utility)|Pinging]]. The standard \"ping\" application can be used to test if an IP address is in use. If it is, attackers may then try a [[port scan]] to detect which services are exposed.\n* A [[port scan]] is used to probe an IP address for [[Port (computer networking)|open ports]] to identify accessible network services and applications.\n* A [[Key logger]] is spyware silently captures and stores each keystroke that a user types on the computer's keyboard.\n* [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security.\n* [[Logic bomb]]s is a type of malware added to a legitimate program that lies dormant until it is triggered by a specific event.\n\n==Scholars==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Ross J.

Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] (CVE) database. An ''exploitable'' vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or \"[[Exploit (computer security)|exploit\"]] exists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Computer Security and Mobile Security Challenges |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979 |website=researchgate.net |accessdate=2016-08-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012010519/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979_Computer_Security_and_Mobile_Security_Challenges |archivedate=12 October 2016 |df=dmy-all |date=2015-12-03 }}</ref> Vulnerabilities are often hunted or exploited with the aid of [[Automated threat|automated tools]] or manually using customized scripts. To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these [[threat (computer)|threats]] can typically be classified into one of these categories below:\n\n===Backdoor===\nA [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] in a computer system, a [[cryptosystem]] or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal [[authentication]] or security controls. They may exist for a number of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.  Backdoors can be very hard to detect, and detection of backdoors are usually discovered by someone who has access to application source code or intimate knowledge of the computer's Operating System.\n\n===Denial-of-service attack===\n[[Denial of service attacks]] (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.<ref>{{cite web |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attack |url=https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |website=csa.gov.sg |accessdate=12 November 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806080013/https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |archivedate=6 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single [[IP address]] can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of [[Distributed denial of service#Distributed attack|Distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points \u2013 and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the [[zombie computer]]s of a [[botnet]], or from a range of other possible techniques, including [[Distributed Reflection Denial of Service|reflection and amplification attacks]], where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.\n\n===Direct-access attacks===\nAn unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making [[operating system]] modifications, installing software [[computer worm|worms]], [[keystroke logging|keyloggers]], [[covert listening device]]s or using wireless mice. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a [[CD-ROM]] or other bootable media. [[Disk encryption]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] are designed to prevent these attacks.\n\n===Eavesdropping===\n[[Eavesdropping]] is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer \"conversation\" (communication), typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]] and [[Narus (company)|NarusInSight]] have been used by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to eavesdrop on the systems of [[internet service provider]]s. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] transmissions generated by the hardware; [[TEMPEST]] is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.\n\n=== Multi-vector, polymorphic attacks ===\nSurfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector,<ref>{{cite news |title=Multi-Vector Attacks Demand Multi-Vector Protection |work=MSSP Alert |date=July 24, 2018 |url=https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-guests/multi-vector-attacks-demand-multi-vector-protection/ }}</ref> polymorphic<ref>{{cite news |first=Renee |last=Millman |title=New polymorphic malware evades three quarters of AV scanners |work=SC Magazine UK |date=December 15, 2017 |url=https://www.scmagazineuk.com/new-polymorphic-malware-evades-three-quarters-of-av-scanners/article/718757/ }}</ref> cyber threats surfaced that combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread. These threats have been classified as fifth-generation cyberattacks.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n===Phishing===\n[[File:PhishingTrustedBank.png|thumb|An example of a phishing email, disguised as an official [[email]] from a (fictional) bank. The sender is attempting to trick the recipient into revealing confidential information by \"confirming\" it at the phisher's website.

Although the [[URL]] of the bank's [[webpage]] appears to be legitimate, the hyperlink points at the phisher's webpage.]]\n[[Phishing]] is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.case.edu/its/kba/its-kba-27196-phishing-attempt/ |title=Identifying Phishing Attempts |publisher=Case |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913200707/http://www.case.edu/its/kba/its-kba-27196-phishing-attempt/ |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=dmy-all |access-date=4 July 2016 }}</ref> Phishing is typically carried out by [[email spoofing]] or [[instant messaging]], and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose \"look\" and \"feel\" are almost identical to the legitimate one. The fake website often asks for personal information, such as log-in details and passwords. This information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of [[Social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]].  Attackers are using creative ways to gain access to real accounts.  A very common scam is when attackers send fake invoices<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/02/phishers-send-fake-invoices|title=Phishers send fake invoices|date=2018-02-23|website=Consumer Information|language=en|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref> to recently purchased music or apps by the individual. \n\n===Privilege escalation===\n[[Privilege escalation]] describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. For example, a standard computer user may be able to [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] in the system to gain access to restricted data; or even become \"[[superuser|root]]\" and have full unrestricted access to a system.\n\n===Social engineering===\n{{Main|Social engineering (security)}}\n\n[[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. by, for example, impersonating a bank, a contractor, or a customer.<ref>{{cite web |last=Arcos Sergio |title=Social Engineering |url=http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043630/http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA common scam involves fake CEO emails sent to accounting and finance departments.

An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time, and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster. The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Authority within the city, with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility, [[Pepco]], the chance to better estimate energy demand. The D.C. proposal, however, would \"allow third-party vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution, which could potentially create more opportunities for cyber attackers to threaten the electric grid.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/13110-d-c-distributed-energy-proposal-draws-concerns-of-increased-cybersecurity-risks/|title=D.C. distributed energy proposal draws concerns of increased cybersecurity risks|last=Brandt|first=Jaclyn|date=2018-06-18|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Impact of security breaches==\nSerious financial damage has been caused by [[security breaches]], but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident, the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved. \"Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to [[computer virus|virus]] and [[computer worm|worm]] attacks and to hostile digital acts in general. The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $13 billion (worms and viruses only) to $226 billion (for all forms of covert attacks). The reliability of these estimates is often challenged; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal.\"<ref>Cashell, B., Jackson, W. D., Jickling, M., & Webel, B. (2004).

According to the classic [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in information security, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the [[expected value]] of the loss resulting from a cyber/information [[security breach]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Lawrence |last2=Loeb |first2=Martin |title=The Economics of Information Security Investment |journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security |date=November 2002 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=438\u2013457 |doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}</ref>\n\n==Attacker motivation==\nAs with [[physical security]], the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers. Some are thrill-seekers or [[Vandalism|vandals]], some are activists, others are criminals looking for financial gain. State-sponsored attackers are now common and well resourced but started with amateurs such as [[Markus Hess]] who hacked for the [[KGB]], as recounted by [[Clifford Stoll]] in ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]''.\n\nAdditionally, recent attacker motivations can be traced back to extremist organizations seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agendas.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} The growth of the internet, mobile technologies and inexpensive computing devices that has led to a rise in capabilities but also risk to environments that are deemed as vital to operations.

In this case, security is considered as a main feature.\n\nSome of the techniques in this approach include:\n* The [[principle of least privilege]], where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. That way even if an [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] gains access to that part, they have only limited access to the whole system.\n* [[Automated theorem proving]] to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.\n* [[Code review]]s and [[unit testing]], approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.\n* [[Defense in depth (computing)|Defense in depth]], where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.\n* Default secure settings, and design to \"fail secure\" rather than \"fail insecure\" (see [[fail-safe]] for the equivalent in [[safety engineering]]). Ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.\n* [[Audit trail]]s tracking system activity, so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. Storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.\n* [[Full disclosure (computer security)|Full disclosure]] of all vulnerabilities, to ensure that the \"[[vulnerability (computing)|window of vulnerability]]\" is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered.\n\n===Security architecture===\nThe Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture as \"the design [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned, and how they relate to the overall [[information technology architecture]]. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system's quality attributes: confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and [[assurance services]]\".<ref>[http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture Definitions: IT Security Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315012754/http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture |date=15 March 2014 }}. SecurityArchitecture.org, Jan, 2006</ref>\n\nTechopedia defines security architecture as \"a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible.\" The key attributes of security architecture are:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jannsen |first1=Cory |title=Security Architecture |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |website=Techopedia |publisher=Janalta Interactive Inc |accessdate=9 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003064643/http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |archivedate=3 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other.\n* the determination of controls based on risk assessment, good practice, finances, and legal matters.\n* the standardization of controls.\n\nPracticing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business, IT and security concerns in an organization.\n\n===Security measures===\nA state of computer \"security\" is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of the three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response. These processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:\n* [[User account]] [[access control]]s and [[cryptography]] can protect systems files and data, respectively.\n* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services, and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering. Firewalls can be both hardware- or software-based.\n* [[Intrusion Detection System]] (IDS) products are designed to detect network attacks in-progress and assist in post-attack [[forensics]], while [[audit trail]]s and [[data logging|logs]] serve a similar function for individual systems.\n* \"Response\" is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of [[legal]] authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. In some special cases, complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.\n\nToday, computer security comprises mainly \"preventive\" measures, like [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] or an [[exit procedure]]. A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the [[Internet]], and can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the [[network stack]] (or, in the case of most [[UNIX]]-based operating systems such as [[Linux]], built into the operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]) to provide real-time filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so-called \"physical firewall\", which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic.

It requires \"something you know\"; a password or PIN, and \"something you have\"; a card, dongle, cellphone, or other piece of hardware. This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.\n\nSocial engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information. Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk, but even in highly disciplined environments (e.g. military organizations), social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.\n\nInoculation, derived from [[inoculation theory]], seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.<ref>Treglia, J., & Delia, M.

The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle, such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) provides a stronger measure of security, since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it.

If they successfully breach security, they are often able to delete [[Data logging|logs]] to cover their tracks.\n* The sheer number of attempted attacks is so large that organizations cannot spend time pursuing each attacker (a typical home user with a permanent (e.g., [[cable modem]]) connection will be attacked at least several times per day, so more attractive targets could be presumed to see many more). Note, however, that most of the sheer bulk of these attacks are made by automated [[vulnerability scanner]]s and [[computer worm]]s.\n* [[Law enforcement officer]]s are often unfamiliar with [[information technology]], and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as [[DNA]] testing and improved [[forensics]], mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a [[network administrator]] or a [[system administrator]]) requires a [[search warrant]] and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.\n* The United States government spends the largest amount of money every year on cybersecurity. The United States has a yearly budget of 28 billion dollars. Canada has the 2nd highest annual budget at 1 billion dollars. Australia has the third-highest budget with only 70 million dollars.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n\n===Types of security and privacy===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Access control]]\n* [[Anti-keylogger]]s\n* [[Anti-malware]]\n* [[Anti-spyware]]\n* [[Anti-subversion software]]\n* [[Anti-tamper software]]\n* Anti-theft\n* [[Antivirus software]]\n* [[Cryptographic software]]\n* [[Computer-aided dispatch]] (CAD)\n* [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]]\n* [[Intrusion detection system]] (IDS)\n* [[Intrusion prevention system]] (IPS)\n* [[Log management software]]\n* Parental control\n* [[Records management]]\n* [[Sandbox (computer security)|Sandbox]]\n* [[Security information management]]\n* [[SIEM]]\n* Software and operating system updating\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Incident response planning==\nIncident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack. An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such as a data breach or system failure. The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to limit damage and reduce recovery time and costs. Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities, restore services and processes and minimize losses.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\nIncident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage. Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organization's response to a cyberattack. Without a documented plan in place, an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles, processes and procedures during an escalation, slowing the organization's response and resolution.\n\nThere are four key components of a computer security incident response plan:\n\n# '''Preparation''': Preparing stakeholders on the procedures for handling computer security incidents or compromises\n# '''Detection & Analysis''': Identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident, prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident\n# '''Containment, Eradication & Recovery''': Isolating affected systems to prevent escalation and limit impact, pinpointing the genesis of the incident, removing malware, affected systems and bad actors from the environment and restoring systems and data when a threat no longer remains\n# '''Post Incident Activity''': Post mortem analysis of the incident, its root cause and the organization's response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response efforts{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Notable attacks and breaches==\n{{Further|List of cyber-attacks|List of data breaches}}\nSome illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below.\n<!-- We don't want to list every breach ever \u2013 and please keep the descriptions short -->\n\n===Robert Morris and the first computer worm===\n{{Main|Morris worm}}\nIn 1988, only 60,000 computers were connected to the Internet, and most were mainframes, minicomputers and professional workstations.

These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive [[login]] screen, or individual services, such as a [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as [[passwords]], [[identification card]]s, [[smart card]]s, and [[biometric]] systems.\n* [[Anti-virus software]] consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate [[computer viruses]] and other malicious software ([[malware]]).\n* [[Application software|Applications]] are [[executable|executable code]], so general practice is to [[Superuser|disallow users the power]] to install them; to install only those which are known to be reputable \u2013 and to reduce the [[attack surface]] by installing as few as possible. They are typically run with [[least privilege]], with a robust process in place to identify, test and install any released [[security patch]]es or updates for them.\n* [[Authentication]] techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.\n* [[Automated theorem proving]] and other verification tools can enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.\n* [[Backup]]s are one or more copies kept of important computer files. Typically, multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged, other copies will still exist.\n* [[Capability-based security|Capability]] and [[access control list]] techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. [[Computer security#Capabilities vs. ACLs|Capabilities vs. ACLs]] discusses their use.\n* [[Chain of trust]] techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.\n* [[Confidentiality]] is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person.<ref>{{cite web |title=Confidentiality |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/confidentiality |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>\n* [[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems, reducing the probability that data exchanged between systems can be intercepted or modified.\n* [[Cyberwarfare]] is an Internet-based conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. Such attacks can, for example, disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and cripple financial systems.\n* [[Data integrity]] is the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record.<ref>{{cite web |title=Data Integrity |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |accessdate=2011-10-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106055944/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Encryption - decryption.svg|thumb|300px|[[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques involve transforming information, scrambling it, so it becomes unreadable during transmission. The intended recipient can unscramble the message; ideally, eavesdroppers cannot.]]\n* [[Encryption]] is used to protect the confidentiality of a message. [[Cryptography|Cryptographically]] secure [[cipher]]s are designed to make any practical attempt of [[cryptanalysis|breaking]] them infeasible. [[symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric-key]] ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using [[shared key]]s, and [[public-key encryption]] using [[digital certificate]]s can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.\n* [[Endpoint security]] software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and USB drives.<ref>{{cite web |title=Endpoint Security |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |accessdate=2014-03-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316021605/http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] serve as a gatekeeper system between networks, allowing only traffic that matches defined rules. They often include detailed [[Logfile|logging]], and may include [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection]] and [[Intrusion detection system#Intrusion prevention|intrusion prevention]] features. They are near-universal between company [[local area networks]] and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if [[network segmentation]] is configured.\n* A [[Security hacker|hacker]] is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network. \n* [[Honeypot (computing)|Honey pots]] are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques.\n* [[Intrusion-detection system]]s are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.\n* A [[microkernel]] is an approach to operating system design which has only the near-minimum amount of code running at the most privileged level \u2013 and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers, protocol stacks and file systems, in the safer, less privileged [[user space]].\n* [[Ping (networking utility)|Pinging]]. The standard \"ping\" application can be used to test if an IP address is in use. If it is, attackers may then try a [[port scan]] to detect which services are exposed.\n* A [[port scan]] is used to probe an IP address for [[Port (computer networking)|open ports]] to identify accessible network services and applications.\n* A [[Key logger]] is spyware silently captures and stores each keystroke that a user types on the computer's keyboard.\n* [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security.\n* [[Logic bomb]]s is a type of malware added to a legitimate program that lies dormant until it is triggered by a specific event.\n\n==Scholars==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Ross J.
