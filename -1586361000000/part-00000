{"title_page": "History of WFAN", "text_new": "[[File:WFAN logo.svg|250px|thumb|right|Logo of WFAN]]\nThe New York Sports radio '''[[WFAN]]''', first broadcast on July 1, 1987 at 1050AM replacing [[WEPN (AM)#WHN|WHN]]. WFAN was the first all sports station in the United States. The station's current frequency, 660AM. was formerly known as [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] and first transmitted on March 2, 1922. WFAN moved to 660AM at 5:30PM Eastern Time on October 7, 1988 when WNBC signed off for the last time.\n\n==Early history==\n{{Main|WNBC (AM)}}\nThe 660 AM frequency in New York originated as '''WEAF''' on March 2, 1922, owned by [[AT&T]]. In 1926, WEAF became the [[flagship]] station of the [[NBC Red Network]], one of two radio chains operated by the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]]. By 1928, WEAF was purchased by NBC's parent company, the [[Radio Corporation of America]].\n\nAs a result of the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] of 1941, WEAF became a [[clear-channel station]] and could be heard across most of the eastern half of [[North America]] at night. In 1943, the [[United States Supreme Court]], citing [[antitrust]] concerns, ordered RCA to sell off one of its radio networks. The company decided to keep the Red Network, and it was rebranded as the NBC Radio Network after the [[Blue Network]] was divested to [[Edward J. Noble]].\n\nWEAF's call letters were changed to '''WNBC''' in 1946, then to '''WRCA''' in 1954, and back to '''WNBC''' in 1960. During the 1960s, WNBC relied less on network programming and adopted a [[talk radio|talk format]], followed by a switch to a [[middle-of-the-road]] music sound. The station spent much of the 1970s and early 1980s flipping between the [[Top 40]] and [[adult contemporary]] formats, with varying success.   By the middle of the 1980s, WNBC played less music and relied more on personality-driven talk programs with hosts such as Don Imus, [[Howard Stern]], [[Joey Reynolds]], [[Alan Colmes]], and [[Soupy Sales]].\n\n==The beginning of WFAN==\n\nMeanwhile, at 3:00 p.m. on July 1, 1987, [[Emmis Communications]]-owned country music station [[WEPN (AM)#WHN|WHN]] changed its call letters to WFAN and branded itself as the world's first 24-hour-per-day sports talk station. The first voice heard on WFAN was that of [[Suzyn Waldman]], with a sports update,<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.radioink.com/HeadlineEntry.asp?hid=138448&pt=todaysnews | title=NYC\u2019s \u2018FAN: in business 20 years & a day | magazine=Radio Ink | accessdate=July 5, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201129/http://www.radioink.com/HeadlineEntry.asp?hid=138448&pt=todaysnews | archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> followed by the first show, which was hosted by [[Jim Lampley]]. Waldman reported for the station, covering the [[New York Yankees]] and [[New York Knicks]], for 14 years. [[Ann Liguori]] was the first woman to host a call-in sports show on WFAN when her \u2018Hey Liguori, What\u2019s the Story\u2019 show debuted on Saturday morning, July 4, 1987. Her first show featured an exclusive interview with Doc Gooden, the Mets star pitcher from their 1986 World Series win, who had recently gotten out of Smithers Rehab. Ann continued to host a weekly show on WFAN for 26 years and continues as the station's golf and tennis correspondent, covering The Majors. Other hosts besides Lampley in the 1050&nbsp;kHz years included [[Bill Mazer]], [[Pete Franklin]], [[Greg Gumbel]], Art Shamsky, and [[Ed Coleman (radio personality)|Ed Coleman]]. WFAN also inherited broadcast rights to the defending World Series champion [[New York Mets]] from WHN, who had held the rights for several years.\n\nIn early 1988, [[General Electric]], which now owned NBC through its purchase of RCA two years earlier, announced that it would sell the NBC Radio division. In February of that year, GE completed a multi-station deal with Emmis and, in New York City, the WNBC license for 660 was included in the sale. On October 7, 1988 at 5:30 p.m., WFAN moved down the radio dial to replace WNBC at 660&nbsp;kHz. The last voice heard on WNBC was that of [[Alan Colmes]], who counted down the seconds to WNBC's demise with the legendary [[NBC chimes]] (the notes G-E-C) playing in the background. After 66 years, the long history of NBC radio in New York had come to an end.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rockradioscrapbook.ca/wnbc-farewell.ram|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203022/http://rockradioscrapbook.ca/wnbc-farewell.ram|url-status=dead|title=audio file Last moments of WNBC/first moments of WFAN|archivedate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> \n\nIn the complicated switch that saw WFAN move to the 660 frequency, the 1050 frequency that was formerly the home of WFAN became that of Spanish-language WUKQ, owned by [[Spanish Broadcasting System]]. However, SBS already owned an AM station in the market, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]-based WSKQ at 620&nbsp;kHz, and in those days [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules stipulated that companies could own only one AM station per market. As a result, SBS received a temporary waiver to run 1050 while exploring the sale of either AM frequency. SBS chose to keep 620 (it is now [[WSNR]]), and 1050 was traded to Forward Communications, which owned WEVD, then at 97.9 FM. After that deal was approved, WEVD's call letters and programming moved to 1050 AM (it is now [[WEPN (AM)|WEPN]] and ironically a sports station), and SBS took over 97.9 as [[WSKQ-FM]]. The October NBC-Emmis switch also saw Emmis's [[WQHT]] (then at 103.5&nbsp;MHz.) move to 97.1&nbsp;MHz., which had been the home of NBC's [[WKTU|WYNY]]. Emmis sold the 103.5 frequency to [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]], who also acquired the WYNY call letters and its country music format.\n\nIn all this, WFAN retired two of the oldest radio call letters from the dawn of commercial radio: WHN and WNBC.\n\n==After the switch==\nOne of the keys to WFAN's early success on 660 was acquiring Don Imus to do the morning show. WFAN's original morning show on 1050 was hosted by [[Greg Gumbel]]. The show was a straightforward sports show, but was not doing well in the ratings. At the time of the switch, sports talk radio was still an untested format with questionable prospects, and the idea of bringing on board a host that appealed to a broader audience would get more people to try the station out. WFAN also benefitted from the inertia from Imus's fans who were used to tuning into 660AM on weekday mornings to listen to Imus on WNBC. WFAN instantly took advantage of its Imus inheritance, for example, it featured a special live monologue by Imus character Billy Sol Hargus from [[Shea Stadium]] moments after taking over the 660 frequency. \n\nIt quickly became apparent that WFAN's gambit of bringing Imus on board worked. Ratings for the morning show were strong, and it was successful to a point in driving ratings for the rest of WFAN's programming day. This model of using a general-interest morning host for a sports talk radio station (especially at launch) has been used at other sports radio stations across the country and proved that sports radio could indeed be a profitable format. \n\nWFAN was also the first station in the country to roll out sports updates every 20 minutes. These updates, called ''20-20 Sports Flashes'', are now considered an industry standard. When WFAN first started updates were done every 15 minutes.   Additionally, in a nod to the former WNBC, update anchors often end their top-of-the-hour updates with the [[catchphrase]] \"And ''that's'' what's happening...\", which is how WNBC on-air news readers had ended their updates.\n\nOther programming that WFAN had at its launch included a mid-morning show with Ed Coleman and [[Mike Francesa]], and an afternoon drive time show with [[Pete Franklin]], who in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] had become one of the first polarizing, outrageous talk show hosts. During his stay in New York, Franklin was probably best known for an incident where he used a four-letter expletive on air, in error, when trying to say \"All you folks\" (he was not disciplined for the incident.) \n\nRunning a close second was a 30-second Franklin diatribe on whether he had been offensive &ndash; \"Do I offend anyone? I'm not here to offend you, dammit!\" <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jAZv2cyTVI YouTube: Pete Franklin Goes Out on Top</ref> &ndash; that has been replayed ever since, especially on the July 1 WFAN anniversaries.\n\nIn a further drive to boost ratings, Imus instigated a feud with Franklin, much as he had with [[Howard Stern]] at WNBC in the mid-1980s. Both Imus and Franklin took shots at each other during their shows, Franklin calling Imus \"Minus\" and Imus recording parodies of radio commercials where he bashed Franklin as a \"dinosaur\", among other things. Franklin left WFAN in August 1989.\n\nOn September 5, 1989, a jointly hosted afternoon drive show with Francesa and [[Chris Russo|Christopher \"Mad Dog\" Russo]] - who had been a weekend/fill-in host to that time - would premiere. The ''[[Mike and the Mad Dog]]'' show became the defining show of WFAN, one of the most consistently popular radio shows in New York, and one of the most influential sports talk radio shows in the country.\n\n==Recent history==\nOver the years WFAN has continued to have a broad-based sports talk and play-by-play format. WFAN ratings gradually rose and at some points it was the top-billing station in New York and the country{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. In 1992 Emmis sold WFAN to [[Infinity Broadcasting]], which would be purchased by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] &ndash; [[CBS]]' then-parent company\u2014in 1997, ironically, making WNBC's old frequency a sister station to its former rival [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS 880AM]]\n\nWFAN's broadcast day begins at 6:00 a.m. ([[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]]) with ''[[Boomer and Carton]]'', hosted by former [[National Football League|NFL]] quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]] and radio veteran [[Craig Carton]]. As of September 13, 2017, Craig Carton officially resigned from the Boomer & Carton show following alleged fraudulent activities in running a ticket reseller business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/13/craig-carton-resigns-from-wfan/|title=Craig Carton resigns from WFAN|first=Greg|last=Joyce|date=September 14, 2017}}</ref> The new morning co-host is Gregg Giannotti. The midday timeslot is now called \u201cMoose and Maggie, co-hosted by Marc Malusis who has been with WFAN for 15 years and [[Evan Roberts (radio personality)|Maggie Gray.]]  \n\nThe afternoon drive slot is now hosted by Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts, formerly in the midday slot.  Mike Francesa now hosts a half hour show M-F 6-6:30PM. The [[YES Network]] had previously been airing a video simulcast of WFAN's afternoon drive program, previously known as ''Mike and the Mad Dog'' and subsequently titled ''[[Mike'd Up]]'', from March 19, 2002 until 2014.\n\nOn Monday nights during the NFL season, Kimberly Jones hosts a football show leading into the ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast, working during the 2009 season with former NFL players [[Roman Oben]]. Jones, who was a member of the Yankees' broadcast team on YES, also hosts other shows during the baseball off-season or when regular hosts are on vacation. \n\n[[Steve Somers]] hosts during most other evenings, often leading into and following live game broadcasts.  [[Tony Paige (boxing)|Tony Paige]] shares the overnight shifts with John Jastremski who was the winner of the 2011 Fantasy Phenom contest.  Other overnight hosts include Marc Malusis (no longer) and Lori Rubinson. Adam \"the Bull\" Gerstenhaber hosted the weekend evening shows. Another WFAN host is longtime New York rock radio fixture [[Richard Neer]]. [[Ed Randall]] hosts a radio version of the ''Talking Baseball'' show that aired on TV for many years. \n\nWFAN stands out in that all of its sports-talk shows are currently local in origin, not syndicated as is the practice of most sports-talk radio stations (usually except during the morning and/or drive-time periods).\n\nOver the years WFAN has established a tight bond with its listeners, to the point where one of them eventually landed a regular on-air spot. Joe Benigno had been a frequent caller to \"The Fan\" (especially the ''Mike and the Mad Dog'' show) as \"Joe from Saddle River\", and his calls were typically interesting and insightful. In 1994 he was chosen to host a one-hour show during a promotion where listeners were invited to host a show. The test went well, and he later parlayed it into a regular overnight shift, which started in 1995.\n\nWFAN also features the \"20-20 Flash\", a one- to two-minute update on sports scores and news, which occurs every 20 minutes (on the hour, twenty after and forty after). The update team consists of Rich Ackerman (no longer) Harris Allen, Mike McCann, Erica Herskowitz, [[Bob Heussler]], Marc Malusis (no longer) [[John Minko]], Jerry Recco and Greg Tartaglia (no longer). The station also employs beat reporters to cover the Mets (Ed Coleman), Yankees (Sweeny Murti), Jets (Peter Schwartz) and Giants (Paul Dottino).\n\nIn 2010, the station was honored by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] with the Marconi award for Sports Station of the Year.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=2010 Marconi Awards|url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=1971394&spid=1314|magazine=FMQB|date=|access-date=2010-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307013402/http://fmqb.com/article.asp?id=1971394&spid=1314|archive-date=2016-03-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Team coverage===\nCurrently, WFAN airs the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'s [[New York Yankees]], the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[New York Giants]], the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[New Jersey Devils]], and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Brooklyn Nets]]. During baseball season, the Yankees have first priority of airtime over all other teams, and WFAN shifts some early-season Giants games over to one of its sister FM stations (currently [[WXRK or WCBSFM]]). This is done in part because of the Mets' legacy on the station, and also because the Giants, Devils, and Nets all produce their own games and purchase their airtime from WFAN. During the fall and early winter (when NFL, NHL, and NBA seasons overlap), the Giants have first priority, followed by the Devils and lastly the Nets.\n\n[[Bloomberg L.P.]]-owned [[WBBR]] (1130 AM) is utilized as WFAN's main \"conflict\" station for Devils games due to scheduling conflicts with the Mets and Giants (some preseason Devils contests have been streamed on WFAN's website due to such conflicts). Either WBBR or [[Inner City Broadcasting]]-owned [[WLIB]] (1190 AM) will broadcast any Nets games when they and any of the other teams play simultaneously.\n\nWFAN is also a promotional partner of the Yankees, as sister station [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] has been the team's flagship station since 2002. WFAN has exclusive game-day rights to broadcast at the ballpark. The exclusive access seems to give WFAN an information edge over WEPN, which features Yankees television voice [[Michael Kay (announcer)|Michael Kay]] in drive-time. Kay is often forced to do his show from outside the stadium, and then leave an hour before the game to prepare for the TV broadcast. Yankees announcers from YES and WCBS occasionally host shows on WFAN throughout the year, including [[John Sterling (sportscaster)|John Sterling]], [[Suzyn Waldman]] and [[Kimberly Jones (reporter)|Kimberly Jones]].\n\nThe station is the flagship outlet for [[Westwood One]]'s [[NFL on Westwood One|NFL]] and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] radio broadcasts, though all local teams have priority, with the exception of NFL playoff games.\n\nWFAN has marketed itself in recent years as the \"Flagship Station for New York Sports\", but its close partnerships with the Mets and Yankees could easily render it \"New York's Baseball Station.\"  [[Terry Collins]] and [[Joe Girardi]], once managers of the Mets and Yankees, made exclusive appearances on WFAN during the season; now Yankee manager Bret Boone appears weekly.  WFAN usually also contracts at least one Giants and one Jets player to make exclusive appearances on the station during the NFL season, as well as longtime Giants head coach [[Tom Coughlin|Tom]] Coughlin, ex-head coach Ben Mcadoo and current head coach Pat Shurmur.  \n\nThe station was also the longtime radio home for the [[New York Jets]], [[New York Rangers]], and [[New York Knicks]] (the latter two were inherited from WNBC). Currently, WFAN's primary competition is WEPN, the New York [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate, located at WFAN's old 1050&nbsp;kHz frequency. WEPN carries the three aforementioned teams plus national ESPN Radio programming, all of which WFAN previously broadcast.\n\nOn April 11, 2006, WFAN started streaming live on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/radio/wfan_to_stream_live_talk_shows_online_34972.asp | title=WFAN to stream live talk shows online | website=mediabistro.com | date=April 6, 2006}}</ref>  Web streaming of live games, however, is limited due to broadcast rights (Mets and Nets games are offered separately through the MLB and NBA websites as annual subscriptions).  As of April 2010, WFAN, along with other CBS Radio stations, stopped streaming live on the Internet to listeners outside of the United States.\n\n===Radiothon===\nEach spring from 1990 until 2007, WFAN conducted the \"WFAN Radiothon\" to benefit children's charities that seek to ensure the continuity of life in its earliest stages and the treatment and eventual elimination of childhood cancer. The three most recent beneficiaries of the radiothon were Tomorrow's Children's Fund,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcfkid.org/|title=Home Page - Tomorrows Children's Fund|website=www.tcfkid.org}}</ref> the CJ Foundation for SIDS,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cjsids.com/ |title=The CJ Foundation for SIDS |access-date=2009-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515185933/http://www.cjsids.com/ |archive-date=2006-05-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the [[Imus Ranch]]. WFAN has also done other radiothons and special broadcasts to raise money for assorted charities. \n\nOn August 15, 2008, Mike Francesa announced during the final broadcast of ''Mike and the Mad Dog'' that WFAN would broadcast a new fundraising radiothon. The new fundraiser would benefit both the Boomer Esiason Foundation for [[cystic fibrosis]] research, and the Mike Francesa Champions of the Heart Foundation, a new charity created by Francesa. The first radiothon took place in September 2008. (<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.myteamboomer.com/events/event/show?id=2051017:Event:8683 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714144431/http://www.myteamboomer.com/events/event/show?id=2051017:Event:8683 |archive-date=2011-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>)\n\n=== Midday show controversy ===\nThe midday slot has been one of the better slots from a ratings perspective for WFAN. However, this slot's hosts have often found controversy.\n\nIn the early 1990s, popular hosts [[Ed Coleman (radio personality)|Ed Coleman]] and [[Dave Sims]] had their show cancelled. WFAN then announced that New York ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' columnist [[Mike Lupica]] and [[WNBC-TV]] sports anchor [[Len Berman]] would co-host the new midday program. The show seemed all set to go when, at the last minute, Berman decided to back out of the show. He cited that he would have to work a near 14-hour day, combining his 10 a.m. start on radio with his 11:20 p.m. report on television. WFAN would not let Berman out of his contract, and as a result, the slot was split into two shows: Lupica hosted from 10 a.m. to noon, while Berman hosted from noon to 2 p.m.. The split format did not work, and eventually Berman's show would be cancelled and Lupica's show soon followed.\n\n[[WWOR-TV]] sports anchor Russ Salzberg, who also worked an evening sportscast, was more than willing to assume the midday show duties. In 1995, he was joined by longtime overnight host Steve Somers. This show, billed as ''The Sweater and the Schmoozer'', featured one of the most famous incidents in WFAN history. It occurred when Salzberg \"banned\" Eli from Westchester from calling his show due to his comments that Salzberg considered to be inappropriate. Salzberg  notoriously said to Somers, during another [[Atlanta Braves]] World Series appearance talking about Braves' manager [[Bobby Cox]]: \"What about Cox, Steve? You like Cox... don't you, Steve?\"\n\nIn 1999, with the ratings not being what WFAN management expected, the Salzberg/Somers show was cancelled. Initially Somers had been fired with Salzberg, but a large outcry from listeners\u2014including comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]], a native of [[Long Island]] &ndash; led to WFAN management giving Somers the evening shift, which (despite frequent pre-emptions for live games) he continues to hold to the present day. In middays, Salzberg and Somers were replaced by Suzyn Waldman and [[Jody McDonald]]. Waldman was best known for her work covering the Yankees and Knicks for the station. McDonald, son of a former Mets general manager, was the weekend overnight host before leaving for sister station [[WTEL (AM)|WIP]] in [[Philadelphia]], nearer to his southern New Jersey home. Both Waldman and McDonald had their fans and detractors at WFAN. \n\nWaldman would leave WFAN in late 2001, joining the Yankees television broadcast team the following year. She would be replaced by Sid Rosenberg who, despite his [[shock jock]] reputation, had an enormous knowledge of sports. Many felt there was great chemistry between McDonald and Rosenberg. However, the ratings still weren't what WFAN expected and in 2004 McDonald was let go, later to join WEPN, Sirius Satellite Radio, and [[WKDN (AM)|WPEN radio]] in Philadelphia. Overnight host Joe Benigno would replace McDonald.\n\nRosenberg was forced to resign from WFAN on September 12, 2005 after being given an ultimatum by station management for not showing up to host the New York Giants' pregame show the day before. Benigno hosted the show solo for over a year, and on January 2, 2007, part-time overnight host Evan Roberts became Benigno's new midday co-host.<ref>{{cite news |work=Newsday |title=WFAN to pair Roberts with Benigno |first=Neil |last=Best |date=December 8, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dialing up youth movement |first=Neil |last=Best |work=Newsday |date=December 12, 2006}}</ref>  The pairing continues to consistently out-rate rival station WEPN.\n\n===Twentieth anniversary===\nOn July 1, 2007, WFAN celebrated its twentieth anniversary. On the weekend of July 4, past WFAN hosts such as Suzyn Waldman and Jim Lampley did guest-hosting stints, and the station's current hosts provided career and station retrospectives throughout the weekend. The station also invited listeners to vote on the \"Greatest New York sports moments\", and the \"Top 20 New York sports celebrities\", during WFAN's 20-year history.\n\n===Twenty-fifth anniversary===\nOn 11 June 2012, 'Top 10 Moments in WFAN History' were announced.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bobsblitz.com/2012/06/top-10-moments-in-wfan-history.html | title=The 'Top 10 Moments in WFAN History' Announced | accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 June 2012, notable current and former staff members announced their favorite moments, interviews, and teams.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bobsblitz.com/2012/06/francesa-wfan-personalities-share.html | title=WFAN Top Talent Quotes and Memories | accessdate=June 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Move to Manhattan===\nOn 10 October 2009, WFAN moved from the landmark [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|Kaufman-Astoria Studios]] in [[Astoria, Queens]], its first studio, after 22 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/columnists/neil-best/mixed-emotions-as-wfan-moves-from-basement-to-big-time-1.1511844 |title=Mixed emotions as WFAN moves from basement to big time |newspaper=Newsday |accessdate=October 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011230745/http://www.newsday.com/columnists/neil-best/mixed-emotions-as-wfan-moves-from-basement-to-big-time-1.1511844 |archivedate=October 11, 2009 }}</ref> The station began broadcasting from CBS Radio's new New York studios at 345 Hudson Street in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Hudson Square, Manhattan|Hudson Square]] neighborhood.

WFAN was the first all sports station in the United States. The station's current frequency, 660AM. was formerly known as [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] and first transmitted on March 2, 1922. WFAN moved to 660AM at 5:30PM Eastern Time on October 7, 1988 when WNBC signed off for the last time.\n\n==Early history==\n{{Main|WNBC (AM)}}\nThe 660 AM frequency in New York originated as '''WEAF''' on March 2, 1922, owned by [[AT&T]]. In 1926, WEAF became the [[flagship]] station of the [[NBC Red Network]], one of two radio chains operated by the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]]. By 1928, WEAF was purchased by NBC's parent company, the [[Radio Corporation of America]].\n\nAs a result of the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] of 1941, WEAF became a [[clear-channel station]] and could be heard across most of the eastern half of [[North America]] at night. In 1943, the [[United States Supreme Court]], citing [[antitrust]] concerns, ordered RCA to sell off one of its radio networks. The company decided to keep the Red Network, and it was rebranded as the NBC Radio Network after the [[Blue Network]] was divested to [[Edward J. Noble]].\n\nWEAF's call letters were changed to '''WNBC''' in 1946, then to '''WRCA''' in 1954, and back to '''WNBC''' in 1960. During the 1960s, WNBC relied less on network programming and adopted a [[talk radio|talk format]], followed by a switch to a [[middle-of-the-road]] music sound. The station spent much of the 1970s and early 1980s flipping between the [[Top 40]] and [[adult contemporary]] formats, with varying success.   By the middle of the 1980s, WNBC played less music and relied more on personality-driven talk programs with hosts such as Don Imus, [[Howard Stern]], [[Joey Reynolds]], [[Alan Colmes]], and [[Soupy Sales]].\n\n==The beginning of WFAN==\n\nMeanwhile, at 3:00 p.m. on July 1, 1987, [[Emmis Communications]]-owned country music station [[WEPN (AM)#WHN|WHN]] changed its call letters to WFAN and branded itself as the world's first 24-hour-per-day sports talk station. The first voice heard on WFAN was that of [[Suzyn Waldman]], with a sports update,<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.radioink.com/HeadlineEntry.asp?hid=138448&pt=todaysnews | title=NYC\u2019s \u2018FAN: in business 20 years & a day | magazine=Radio Ink | accessdate=July 5, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201129/http://www.radioink.com/HeadlineEntry.asp?hid=138448&pt=todaysnews | archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> followed by the first show, which was hosted by [[Jim Lampley]]. Waldman reported for the station, covering the [[New York Yankees]] and [[New York Knicks]], for 14 years. [[Ann Liguori]] was the first woman to host a call-in sports show on WFAN when her \u2018Hey Liguori, What\u2019s the Story\u2019 show debuted on Saturday morning, July 4, 1987. Her first show featured an exclusive interview with Doc Gooden, the Mets star pitcher from their 1986 World Series win, who had recently gotten out of Smithers Rehab. Ann continued to host a weekly show on WFAN for 26 years and continues as the station's golf and tennis correspondent, covering The Majors. Other hosts besides Lampley in the 1050&nbsp;kHz years included [[Bill Mazer]], [[Pete Franklin]], [[Greg Gumbel]], Art Shamsky, and [[Ed Coleman (radio personality)|Ed Coleman]]. WFAN also inherited broadcast rights to the defending World Series champion [[New York Mets]] from WHN, who had held the rights for several years.\n\nIn early 1988, [[General Electric]], which now owned NBC through its purchase of RCA two years earlier, announced that it would sell the NBC Radio division. In February of that year, GE completed a multi-station deal with Emmis and, in New York City, the WNBC license for 660 was included in the sale. On October 7, 1988 at 5:30 p.m., WFAN moved down the radio dial to replace WNBC at 660&nbsp;kHz. The last voice heard on WNBC was that of [[Alan Colmes]], who counted down the seconds to WNBC's demise with the legendary [[NBC chimes]] (the notes G-E-C) playing in the background. After 66 years, the long history of NBC radio in New York had come to an end.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rockradioscrapbook.ca/wnbc-farewell.ram|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706203022/http://rockradioscrapbook.ca/wnbc-farewell.ram|url-status=dead|title=audio file Last moments of WNBC/first moments of WFAN|archivedate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> \n\nIn the complicated switch that saw WFAN move to the 660 frequency, the 1050 frequency that was formerly the home of WFAN became that of Spanish-language WUKQ, owned by [[Spanish Broadcasting System]]. However, SBS already owned an AM station in the market, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]-based WSKQ at 620&nbsp;kHz, and in those days [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules stipulated that companies could own only one AM station per market. As a result, SBS received a temporary waiver to run 1050 while exploring the sale of either AM frequency. SBS chose to keep 620 (it is now [[WSNR]]), and 1050 was traded to Forward Communications, which owned WEVD, then at 97.9 FM. After that deal was approved, WEVD's call letters and programming moved to 1050 AM (it is now [[WEPN (AM)|WEPN]] and ironically a sports station), and SBS took over 97.9 as [[WSKQ-FM]]. The October NBC-Emmis switch also saw Emmis's [[WQHT]] (then at 103.5&nbsp;MHz.) move to 97.1&nbsp;MHz., which had been the home of NBC's [[WKTU|WYNY]]. Emmis sold the 103.5 frequency to [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]], who also acquired the WYNY call letters and its country music format.\n\nIn all this, WFAN retired two of the oldest radio call letters from the dawn of commercial radio: WHN and WNBC.\n\n==After the switch==\nOne of the keys to WFAN's early success on 660 was acquiring Don Imus to do the morning show. WFAN's original morning show on 1050 was hosted by [[Greg Gumbel]]. The show was a straightforward sports show, but was not doing well in the ratings. At the time of the switch, sports talk radio was still an untested format with questionable prospects, and the idea of bringing on board a host that appealed to a broader audience would get more people to try the station out. WFAN also benefitted from the inertia from Imus's fans who were used to tuning into 660AM on weekday mornings to listen to Imus on WNBC. WFAN instantly took advantage of its Imus inheritance, for example, it featured a special live monologue by Imus character Billy Sol Hargus from [[Shea Stadium]] moments after taking over the 660 frequency. \n\nIt quickly became apparent that WFAN's gambit of bringing Imus on board worked. Ratings for the morning show were strong, and it was successful to a point in driving ratings for the rest of WFAN's programming day. This model of using a general-interest morning host for a sports talk radio station (especially at launch) has been used at other sports radio stations across the country and proved that sports radio could indeed be a profitable format. \n\nWFAN was also the first station in the country to roll out sports updates every 20 minutes. These updates, called ''20-20 Sports Flashes'', are now considered an industry standard. When WFAN first started updates were done every 15 minutes.   Additionally, in a nod to the former WNBC, update anchors often end their top-of-the-hour updates with the [[catchphrase]] \"And ''that's'' what's happening...\", which is how WNBC on-air news readers had ended their updates.\n\nOther programming that WFAN had at its launch included a mid-morning show with Ed Coleman and [[Mike Francesa]], and an afternoon drive time show with [[Pete Franklin]], who in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] had become one of the first polarizing, outrageous talk show hosts. During his stay in New York, Franklin was probably best known for an incident where he used a four-letter expletive on air, in error, when trying to say \"All you folks\" (he was not disciplined for the incident.) \n\nRunning a close second was a 30-second Franklin diatribe on whether he had been offensive &ndash; \"Do I offend anyone? I'm not here to offend you, dammit!\" <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jAZv2cyTVI YouTube: Pete Franklin Goes Out on Top</ref> &ndash; that has been replayed ever since, especially on the July 1 WFAN anniversaries.\n\nIn a further drive to boost ratings, Imus instigated a feud with Franklin, much as he had with [[Howard Stern]] at WNBC in the mid-1980s. Both Imus and Franklin took shots at each other during their shows, Franklin calling Imus \"Minus\" and Imus recording parodies of radio commercials where he bashed Franklin as a \"dinosaur\", among other things. Franklin left WFAN in August 1989.\n\nOn September 5, 1989, a jointly hosted afternoon drive show with Francesa and [[Chris Russo|Christopher \"Mad Dog\" Russo]] - who had been a weekend/fill-in host to that time - would premiere. The ''[[Mike and the Mad Dog]]'' show became the defining show of WFAN, one of the most consistently popular radio shows in New York, and one of the most influential sports talk radio shows in the country.\n\n==Recent history==\nOver the years WFAN has continued to have a broad-based sports talk and play-by-play format. WFAN ratings gradually rose and at some points it was the top-billing station in New York and the country{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. In 1992 Emmis sold WFAN to [[Infinity Broadcasting]], which would be purchased by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] &ndash; [[CBS]]' then-parent company\u2014in 1997, ironically, making WNBC's old frequency a sister station to its former rival [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS 880AM]]\n\nWFAN's broadcast day begins at 6:00 a.m. ([[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]]) with ''[[Boomer and Carton]]'', hosted by former [[National Football League|NFL]] quarterback [[Boomer Esiason]] and radio veteran [[Craig Carton]]. As of September 13, 2017, Craig Carton officially resigned from the Boomer & Carton show following alleged fraudulent activities in running a ticket reseller business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/13/craig-carton-resigns-from-wfan/|title=Craig Carton resigns from WFAN|first=Greg|last=Joyce|date=September 14, 2017}}</ref> The new morning co-host is Gregg Giannotti. The midday timeslot is now called \u201cMoose and Maggie, co-hosted by Marc Malusis who has been with WFAN for 15 years and [[Evan Roberts (radio personality)|Maggie Gray.]]  \n\nThe afternoon drive slot is now hosted by Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts, formerly in the midday slot.  Mike Francesa now hosts a half hour show M-F 6-6:30PM. The [[YES Network]] had previously been airing a video simulcast of WFAN's afternoon drive program, previously known as ''Mike and the Mad Dog'' and subsequently titled ''[[Mike'd Up]]'', from March 19, 2002 until 2014.\n\nOn Monday nights during the NFL season, Kimberly Jones hosts a football show leading into the ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast, working during the 2009 season with former NFL players [[Roman Oben]]. Jones, who was a member of the Yankees' broadcast team on YES, also hosts other shows during the baseball off-season or when regular hosts are on vacation. \n\n[[Steve Somers]] hosts during most other evenings, often leading into and following live game broadcasts.  [[Tony Paige (boxing)|Tony Paige]] shares the overnight shifts with John Jastremski who was the winner of the 2011 Fantasy Phenom contest.  Other overnight hosts include Marc Malusis (no longer) and Lori Rubinson. Adam \"the Bull\" Gerstenhaber hosted the weekend evening shows. Another WFAN host is longtime New York rock radio fixture [[Richard Neer]]. [[Ed Randall]] hosts a radio version of the ''Talking Baseball'' show that aired on TV for many years. \n\nWFAN stands out in that all of its sports-talk shows are currently local in origin, not syndicated as is the practice of most sports-talk radio stations (usually except during the morning and/or drive-time periods).\n\nOver the years WFAN has established a tight bond with its listeners, to the point where one of them eventually landed a regular on-air spot. Joe Benigno had been a frequent caller to \"The Fan\" (especially the ''Mike and the Mad Dog'' show) as \"Joe from Saddle River\", and his calls were typically interesting and insightful. In 1994 he was chosen to host a one-hour show during a promotion where listeners were invited to host a show. The test went well, and he later parlayed it into a regular overnight shift, which started in 1995.\n\nWFAN also features the \"20-20 Flash\", a one- to two-minute update on sports scores and news, which occurs every 20 minutes (on the hour, twenty after and forty after). The update team consists of Rich Ackerman (no longer) Harris Allen, Mike McCann, Erica Herskowitz, [[Bob Heussler]], Marc Malusis (no longer) [[John Minko]], Jerry Recco and Greg Tartaglia (no longer). The station also employs beat reporters to cover the Mets (Ed Coleman), Yankees (Sweeny Murti), Jets (Peter Schwartz) and Giants (Paul Dottino).\n\nIn 2010, the station was honored by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] with the Marconi award for Sports Station of the Year.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=2010 Marconi Awards|url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=1971394&spid=1314|magazine=FMQB|date=|access-date=2010-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307013402/http://fmqb.com/article.asp?id=1971394&spid=1314|archive-date=2016-03-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Team coverage===\nCurrently, WFAN airs the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'s [[New York Yankees]], the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[New York Giants]], the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[New Jersey Devils]], and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Brooklyn Nets]]. During baseball season, the Yankees have first priority of airtime over all other teams, and WFAN shifts some early-season Giants games over to one of its sister FM stations (currently [[WXRK or WCBSFM]]). This is done in part because of the Mets' legacy on the station, and also because the Giants, Devils, and Nets all produce their own games and purchase their airtime from WFAN. During the fall and early winter (when NFL, NHL, and NBA seasons overlap), the Giants have first priority, followed by the Devils and lastly the Nets.\n\n[[Bloomberg L.P.]]-owned [[WBBR]] (1130 AM) is utilized as WFAN's main \"conflict\" station for Devils games due to scheduling conflicts with the Mets and Giants (some preseason Devils contests have been streamed on WFAN's website due to such conflicts). Either WBBR or [[Inner City Broadcasting]]-owned [[WLIB]] (1190 AM) will broadcast any Nets games when they and any of the other teams play simultaneously.\n\nWFAN is also a promotional partner of the Yankees, as sister station [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] has been the team's flagship station since 2002. WFAN has exclusive game-day rights to broadcast at the ballpark. The exclusive access seems to give WFAN an information edge over WEPN, which features Yankees television voice [[Michael Kay (announcer)|Michael Kay]] in drive-time. Kay is often forced to do his show from outside the stadium, and then leave an hour before the game to prepare for the TV broadcast. Yankees announcers from YES and WCBS occasionally host shows on WFAN throughout the year, including [[John Sterling (sportscaster)|John Sterling]], [[Suzyn Waldman]] and [[Kimberly Jones (reporter)|Kimberly Jones]].\n\nThe station is the flagship outlet for [[Westwood One]]'s [[NFL on Westwood One|NFL]] and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] radio broadcasts, though all local teams have priority, with the exception of NFL playoff games.\n\nWFAN has marketed itself in recent years as the \"Flagship Station for New York Sports\", but its close partnerships with the Mets and Yankees could easily render it \"New York's Baseball Station.\"  [[Terry Collins]] and [[Joe Girardi]], once managers of the Mets and Yankees, made exclusive appearances on WFAN during the season; now Yankee manager Bret Boone appears weekly.  WFAN usually also contracts at least one Giants and one Jets player to make exclusive appearances on the station during the NFL season, as well as longtime Giants head coach [[Tom Coughlin|Tom]] Coughlin, ex-head coach Ben Mcadoo and current head coach Pat Shurmur.  \n\nThe station was also the longtime radio home for the [[New York Jets]], [[New York Rangers]], and [[New York Knicks]] (the latter two were inherited from WNBC). Currently, WFAN's primary competition is WEPN, the New York [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate, located at WFAN's old 1050&nbsp;kHz frequency. WEPN carries the three aforementioned teams plus national ESPN Radio programming, all of which WFAN previously broadcast.\n\nOn April 11, 2006, WFAN started streaming live on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/radio/wfan_to_stream_live_talk_shows_online_34972.asp | title=WFAN to stream live talk shows online | website=mediabistro.com | date=April 6, 2006}}</ref>  Web streaming of live games, however, is limited due to broadcast rights (Mets and Nets games are offered separately through the MLB and NBA websites as annual subscriptions).  As of April 2010, WFAN, along with other CBS Radio stations, stopped streaming live on the Internet to listeners outside of the United States.\n\n===Radiothon===\nEach spring from 1990 until 2007, WFAN conducted the \"WFAN Radiothon\" to benefit children's charities that seek to ensure the continuity of life in its earliest stages and the treatment and eventual elimination of childhood cancer. The three most recent beneficiaries of the radiothon were Tomorrow's Children's Fund,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcfkid.org/|title=Home Page - Tomorrows Children's Fund|website=www.tcfkid.org}}</ref> the CJ Foundation for SIDS,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cjsids.com/ |title=The CJ Foundation for SIDS |access-date=2009-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515185933/http://www.cjsids.com/ |archive-date=2006-05-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the [[Imus Ranch]]. WFAN has also done other radiothons and special broadcasts to raise money for assorted charities. \n\nOn August 15, 2008, Mike Francesa announced during the final broadcast of ''Mike and the Mad Dog'' that WFAN would broadcast a new fundraising radiothon. The new fundraiser would benefit both the Boomer Esiason Foundation for [[cystic fibrosis]] research, and the Mike Francesa Champions of the Heart Foundation, a new charity created by Francesa. The first radiothon took place in September 2008. (<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.myteamboomer.com/events/event/show?id=2051017:Event:8683 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714144431/http://www.myteamboomer.com/events/event/show?id=2051017:Event:8683 |archive-date=2011-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>)\n\n=== Midday show controversy ===\nThe midday slot has been one of the better slots from a ratings perspective for WFAN. However, this slot's hosts have often found controversy.\n\nIn the early 1990s, popular hosts [[Ed Coleman (radio personality)|Ed Coleman]] and [[Dave Sims]] had their show cancelled. WFAN then announced that New York ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' columnist [[Mike Lupica]] and [[WNBC-TV]] sports anchor [[Len Berman]] would co-host the new midday program. The show seemed all set to go when, at the last minute, Berman decided to back out of the show. He cited that he would have to work a near 14-hour day, combining his 10 a.m. start on radio with his 11:20 p.m. report on television. WFAN would not let Berman out of his contract, and as a result, the slot was split into two shows: Lupica hosted from 10 a.m. to noon, while Berman hosted from noon to 2 p.m.. The split format did not work, and eventually Berman's show would be cancelled and Lupica's show soon followed.\n\n[[WWOR-TV]] sports anchor Russ Salzberg, who also worked an evening sportscast, was more than willing to assume the midday show duties. In 1995, he was joined by longtime overnight host Steve Somers. This show, billed as ''The Sweater and the Schmoozer'', featured one of the most famous incidents in WFAN history. It occurred when Salzberg \"banned\" Eli from Westchester from calling his show due to his comments that Salzberg considered to be inappropriate. Salzberg  notoriously said to Somers, during another [[Atlanta Braves]] World Series appearance talking about Braves' manager [[Bobby Cox]]: \"What about Cox, Steve? You like Cox... don't you, Steve?\"\n\nIn 1999, with the ratings not being what WFAN management expected, the Salzberg/Somers show was cancelled. Initially Somers had been fired with Salzberg, but a large outcry from listeners\u2014including comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]], a native of [[Long Island]] &ndash; led to WFAN management giving Somers the evening shift, which (despite frequent pre-emptions for live games) he continues to hold to the present day. In middays, Salzberg and Somers were replaced by Suzyn Waldman and [[Jody McDonald]]. Waldman was best known for her work covering the Yankees and Knicks for the station. McDonald, son of a former Mets general manager, was the weekend overnight host before leaving for sister station [[WTEL (AM)|WIP]] in [[Philadelphia]], nearer to his southern New Jersey home. Both Waldman and McDonald had their fans and detractors at WFAN. \n\nWaldman would leave WFAN in late 2001, joining the Yankees television broadcast team the following year. She would be replaced by Sid Rosenberg who, despite his [[shock jock]] reputation, had an enormous knowledge of sports. Many felt there was great chemistry between McDonald and Rosenberg. However, the ratings still weren't what WFAN expected and in 2004 McDonald was let go, later to join WEPN, Sirius Satellite Radio, and [[WKDN (AM)|WPEN radio]] in Philadelphia. Overnight host Joe Benigno would replace McDonald.\n\nRosenberg was forced to resign from WFAN on September 12, 2005 after being given an ultimatum by station management for not showing up to host the New York Giants' pregame show the day before. Benigno hosted the show solo for over a year, and on January 2, 2007, part-time overnight host Evan Roberts became Benigno's new midday co-host.<ref>{{cite news |work=Newsday |title=WFAN to pair Roberts with Benigno |first=Neil |last=Best |date=December 8, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dialing up youth movement |first=Neil |last=Best |work=Newsday |date=December 12, 2006}}</ref>  The pairing continues to consistently out-rate rival station WEPN.\n\n===Twentieth anniversary===\nOn July 1, 2007, WFAN celebrated its twentieth anniversary. On the weekend of July 4, past WFAN hosts such as Suzyn Waldman and Jim Lampley did guest-hosting stints, and the station's current hosts provided career and station retrospectives throughout the weekend. The station also invited listeners to vote on the \"Greatest New York sports moments\", and the \"Top 20 New York sports celebrities\", during WFAN's 20-year history.\n\n===Twenty-fifth anniversary===\nOn 11 June 2012, 'Top 10 Moments in WFAN History' were announced.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bobsblitz.com/2012/06/top-10-moments-in-wfan-history.html | title=The 'Top 10 Moments in WFAN History' Announced | accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 June 2012, notable current and former staff members announced their favorite moments, interviews, and teams.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bobsblitz.com/2012/06/francesa-wfan-personalities-share.html | title=WFAN Top Talent Quotes and Memories | accessdate=June 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Move to Manhattan===\nOn 10 October 2009, WFAN moved from the landmark [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|Kaufman-Astoria Studios]] in [[Astoria, Queens]], its first studio, after 22 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/columnists/neil-best/mixed-emotions-as-wfan-moves-from-basement-to-big-time-1.1511844 |title=Mixed emotions as WFAN moves from basement to big time |newspaper=Newsday |accessdate=October 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011230745/http://www.newsday.com/columnists/neil-best/mixed-emotions-as-wfan-moves-from-basement-to-big-time-1.1511844 |archivedate=October 11, 2009 }}</ref> The station began broadcasting from CBS Radio's new New York studios at 345 Hudson Street in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Hudson Square, Manhattan|Hudson Square]] neighborhood.

{"title_page": "Volatility (finance)", "text_new": "[[File:VIX.png|thumb|The VIX]]\nIn [[finance]], '''volatility''' (symbol ''\u03c3'') is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, usually measured by the [[standard deviation]] of [[logarithmic return]]s.\n\nHistoric volatility measures a time series of past market prices.  [[Implied volatility]] looks forward in time, being derived from the market price of a market-traded derivative (in particular, an option).\n\n== Volatility terminology  ==\nVolatility as described here refers to the '''actual volatility''', more specifically:\n* '''actual current volatility''' of a financial instrument for a specified period (for example 30 days or 90 days), based on historical prices over the specified period with the last observation the most recent price. \n* '''actual historical volatility''' which refers to the volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period but with the last observation on a date in the past\n**near synonymous is '''realized volatility''', the [[square root]] of the [[realized variance]], in turn calculated using the sum of squared returns divided by the number of observations.\n* '''actual future volatility''' which refers to the volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period starting at the current time and ending at a future date (normally the expiry date of an [[Option (finance)|option]])\nNow turning to [[implied volatility]], we have:\n* '''historical implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from historical prices of the financial instrument (normally options)\n* '''current implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from current prices of the financial instrument\n* '''future implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from future prices of the financial instrument\n\nFor a financial instrument whose price follows a [[Gaussian]] [[random walk]], or [[Wiener process]], the width of the distribution increases as time increases.  This is because there is an increasing [[probability]] that the instrument's price will be farther away from the initial price as time increases. However, rather than increase linearly, the volatility increases with the square-root of time as time increases, because some fluctuations are expected to cancel each other out, so the most likely deviation after twice the time will not be twice the distance from zero.\n\nSince observed price changes do not follow Gaussian distributions, others such as the [[L\u00e9vy distribution]] are often used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmottwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Levy_distribution|title=Levy distribution|work=wilmottwiki.com}}</ref> These can capture attributes such as \"[[fat tail]]s\".\nVolatility is a statistical measure of dispersion  around the average of any random variable such as market parameters etc.\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\nFor any fund that evolves randomly with time,  volatility is defined as the [[standard deviation]] of a sequence of random variables, each of which is the return of the fund over some corresponding sequence of (equally sized) times.\n\nThus, \"annualized\" volatility ''\u03c3''<sub>annually</sub> is the standard deviation of an instrument's yearly [[Rate of return#Logarithmic or continuously compounded return|logarithmic returns]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lfrankcabrera.com/calc-hist-vol.pdf|title= Calculating Historical Volatility: Step-by-Step Example |date= 14 July 2011 |accessdate= 15 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe generalized volatility ''\u03c3''<sub>''T''</sub> for [[time horizon]] ''T'' in years is expressed as:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{T} = \\sigma_\\text{annually} \\sqrt{T}.</math>\n\nTherefore, if the daily logarithmic returns of a stock have a standard deviation of ''\u03c3''<sub>daily</sub> and the time period of returns is ''P'' in trading days, the annualized volatility is\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{P} = \\sigma_\\text{daily} \\sqrt{P}.</math>\n\nA common assumption is that ''P'' = 252 trading days in any given year. Then, if ''\u03c3''<sub>daily</sub> = 0.01, the annualized volatility is\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{annually} = 0.01 \\sqrt{252} = 0.1587.</math>\n\nThe monthly volatility (i.e., ''T'' = 1/12 of a year or ''P'' = 252/12 = 21 trading days) would be\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{monthly} = 0.1587 \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{12}} = 0.0458.</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{monthly} = 0.01 \\sqrt{\\tfrac{252}{12}} = 0.0458.</math>\n\nThe formulas used above to convert returns or volatility measures from one time period to another assume a particular underlying model or process. These formulas are accurate extrapolations of a [[random walk]], or Wiener process, whose steps have finite variance. However, more generally, for natural stochastic processes, the precise relationship between volatility measures for different time periods is more complicated. Some use the L\u00e9vy stability exponent ''\u03b1'' to extrapolate natural processes:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_T = T^{1/\\alpha} \\sigma.\\,</math>\n\nIf ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 you get the [[Wiener process]] scaling relation, but some people believe ''\u03b1''&nbsp;<&nbsp;2 for financial activities such as stocks, indexes and so on. This was discovered by [[Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot]], who looked at cotton prices and found that they followed a [[Stable distribution|L\u00e9vy alpha-stable distribution]] with ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.7. (See New Scientist, 19 April 1997.)\n\n== Volatility origin ==\nMuch research has been devoted to modeling and forecasting the volatility of financial returns, and yet few theoretical models explain how volatility comes to exist in the first place.\n\nRoll (1984) shows that volatility is affected by [[market microstructure]].<ref>Roll, R. (1984): \"A Simple Implicit Measure of the Effective Bid-Ask Spread in an Efficient Market\", ''Journal of Finance'' '''39''' (4), 1127\u20131139</ref>  Glosten and Milgrom (1985) shows that at least one source of volatility can be explained by the liquidity provision process. When market makers infer the possibility of [[adverse selection]], they adjust their trading ranges, which in turn increases the band of price oscillation.<ref>Glosten, L. R. and P. R. Milgrom (1985): \"Bid, Ask and Transaction Prices in a Specialist Market with Heterogeneously Informed Traders\", ''[[Journal of Financial Economics]]'' '''14''' (1), 71\u2013100</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, [[JPMorgan Chase]] determined the effect of [[US President]] [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Twitter#Tweets|tweet]]s, and called it the [[Volfefe index]] combining volatility and the [[covfefe]] [[meme]].\n\n== Volatility for investors ==\nInvestors care about volatility for at least eight reasons:\n\n# The wider the swings in an investment's price, the harder emotionally it is to not worry;\n# Price volatility of a trading instrument can define position sizing in a portfolio;\n# When certain cash flows from selling a security are needed at a specific future date, higher volatility means a greater chance of a shortfall;\n# Higher volatility of returns while saving for retirement results in a wider distribution of possible final portfolio values;\n# Higher volatility of return when retired gives withdrawals a larger permanent impact on the portfolio's value;\n# Price volatility presents opportunities to buy assets cheaply and sell when overpriced;\n# Portfolio volatility has a negative impact on the [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of that portfolio\n# Volatility affects pricing of [[option (finance)|options]], being a parameter of the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]].\n\nIn today's markets, it is also possible to trade volatility directly, through the use of derivative securities such as options and [[variance swap]]s. See [[Volatility arbitrage]].\n\n== Volatility versus direction ==\n\nVolatility does not measure the direction of price changes, merely their dispersion. This is because when calculating [[standard deviation]] (or [[variance]]), all differences are squared, so that negative and positive differences are combined into one quantity.  Two instruments with different volatilities may have the same expected return, but the instrument with higher volatility will have larger swings in values over a given period of time.\n\nFor example, a lower volatility stock may have an expected (average) return of 7%, with annual volatility of 5%.  This would indicate returns from approximately negative 3% to positive 17% most of the time (19 times out of 20, or 95% via a two standard deviation rule).

Suppose you notice that a market price index, which has a current value near 10,000, has moved about 100 points a day, on average, for many days.  This would constitute a 1% daily movement, up or down.\n\nTo annualize this, you can use the \"rule of 16\", that is, multiply by 16 to get 16% as the annual volatility.  The rationale for this is that 16 is the square root of 256, which is approximately the number of trading days in a year (252). This also uses the fact that the standard deviation of the sum of ''n'' independent variables (with equal standard deviations) is \u221an times the standard deviation of the individual variables.\n\nThe average magnitude of the observations is merely an approximation of the standard deviation of the market index. Assuming that the market index daily changes are normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation&nbsp;''\u03c3'', the expected value of the [[Absolute deviation|magnitude of the observations]] is \u221a(2/{{pi}})''\u03c3'' =&nbsp;0.798''\u03c3''. The net effect is that this crude approach underestimates the true volatility by about 20%.\n\n== Estimate of compound annual growth rate (CAGR) ==\n\nConsider the [[Taylor series]]:\n\n:<math>\\log(1+y) = y - \\tfrac{1}{2}y^2 + \\tfrac{1}{3}y^3 - \\tfrac{1}{4}y^4 + \\cdots </math>\n\nTaking only the first two terms one has:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{CAGR} \\approx \\mathrm{AR} - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma^2</math>\n\nVolatility thus mathematically represents a drag on the CAGR (formalized as the \"[[volatility tax]]\"). Realistically, most financial assets have negative skewness and leptokurtosis, so this formula tends to be over-optimistic. Some people use the formula:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{CAGR} \\approx \\mathrm{AR} - \\tfrac{1}{2}k\\sigma^2</math>\n\nfor a rough estimate, where ''k'' is an empirical factor (typically five to ten).\n\n== Criticisms of volatility forecasting models ==\n[[File:Vix.png|450px|thumb|right|Performance of [[VIX]] (left) compared to past volatility (right) as 30-day volatility predictors, for the period of Jan 1990-Sep 2009.

[[Implied volatility]] looks forward in time, being derived from the market price of a market-traded derivative (in particular, an option).\n\n== Volatility terminology  ==\nVolatility as described here refers to the '''actual volatility''', more specifically:\n* '''actual current volatility''' of a financial instrument for a specified period (for example 30 days or 90 days), based on historical prices over the specified period with the last observation the most recent price. \n* '''actual historical volatility''' which refers to the volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period but with the last observation on a date in the past\n**near synonymous is '''realized volatility''', the [[square root]] of the [[realized variance]], in turn calculated using the sum of squared returns divided by the number of observations.\n* '''actual future volatility''' which refers to the volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period starting at the current time and ending at a future date (normally the expiry date of an [[Option (finance)|option]])\nNow turning to [[implied volatility]], we have:\n* '''historical implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from historical prices of the financial instrument (normally options)\n* '''current implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from current prices of the financial instrument\n* '''future implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from future prices of the financial instrument\n\nFor a financial instrument whose price follows a [[Gaussian]] [[random walk]], or [[Wiener process]], the width of the distribution increases as time increases.  This is because there is an increasing [[probability]] that the instrument's price will be farther away from the initial price as time increases. However, rather than increase linearly, the volatility increases with the square-root of time as time increases, because some fluctuations are expected to cancel each other out, so the most likely deviation after twice the time will not be twice the distance from zero.\n\nSince observed price changes do not follow Gaussian distributions, others such as the [[L\u00e9vy distribution]] are often used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmottwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Levy_distribution|title=Levy distribution|work=wilmottwiki.com}}</ref> These can capture attributes such as \"[[fat tail]]s\".\nVolatility is a statistical measure of dispersion  around the average of any random variable such as market parameters etc.\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\nFor any fund that evolves randomly with time,  volatility is defined as the [[standard deviation]] of a sequence of random variables, each of which is the return of the fund over some corresponding sequence of (equally sized) times.\n\nThus, \"annualized\" volatility ''\u03c3''<sub>annually</sub> is the standard deviation of an instrument's yearly [[Rate of return#Logarithmic or continuously compounded return|logarithmic returns]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lfrankcabrera.com/calc-hist-vol.pdf|title= Calculating Historical Volatility: Step-by-Step Example |date= 14 July 2011 |accessdate= 15 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe generalized volatility ''\u03c3''<sub>''T''</sub> for [[time horizon]] ''T'' in years is expressed as:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{T} = \\sigma_\\text{annually} \\sqrt{T}.</math>\n\nTherefore, if the daily logarithmic returns of a stock have a standard deviation of ''\u03c3''<sub>daily</sub> and the time period of returns is ''P'' in trading days, the annualized volatility is\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{P} = \\sigma_\\text{daily} \\sqrt{P}.</math>\n\nA common assumption is that ''P'' = 252 trading days in any given year. Then, if ''\u03c3''<sub>daily</sub> = 0.01, the annualized volatility is\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{annually} = 0.01 \\sqrt{252} = 0.1587.</math>\n\nThe monthly volatility (i.e., ''T'' = 1/12 of a year or ''P'' = 252/12 = 21 trading days) would be\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{monthly} = 0.1587 \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{12}} = 0.0458.</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{monthly} = 0.01 \\sqrt{\\tfrac{252}{12}} = 0.0458.</math>\n\nThe formulas used above to convert returns or volatility measures from one time period to another assume a particular underlying model or process. These formulas are accurate extrapolations of a [[random walk]], or Wiener process, whose steps have finite variance. However, more generally, for natural stochastic processes, the precise relationship between volatility measures for different time periods is more complicated. Some use the L\u00e9vy stability exponent ''\u03b1'' to extrapolate natural processes:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_T = T^{1/\\alpha} \\sigma.\\,</math>\n\nIf ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 you get the [[Wiener process]] scaling relation, but some people believe ''\u03b1''&nbsp;<&nbsp;2 for financial activities such as stocks, indexes and so on. This was discovered by [[Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot]], who looked at cotton prices and found that they followed a [[Stable distribution|L\u00e9vy alpha-stable distribution]] with ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.7. (See New Scientist, 19 April 1997.)\n\n== Volatility origin ==\nMuch research has been devoted to modeling and forecasting the volatility of financial returns, and yet few theoretical models explain how volatility comes to exist in the first place.\n\nRoll (1984) shows that volatility is affected by [[market microstructure]].<ref>Roll, R. (1984): \"A Simple Implicit Measure of the Effective Bid-Ask Spread in an Efficient Market\", ''Journal of Finance'' '''39''' (4), 1127\u20131139</ref>  Glosten and Milgrom (1985) shows that at least one source of volatility can be explained by the liquidity provision process. When market makers infer the possibility of [[adverse selection]], they adjust their trading ranges, which in turn increases the band of price oscillation.<ref>Glosten, L. R. and P. R. Milgrom (1985): \"Bid, Ask and Transaction Prices in a Specialist Market with Heterogeneously Informed Traders\", ''[[Journal of Financial Economics]]'' '''14''' (1), 71\u2013100</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, [[JPMorgan Chase]] determined the effect of [[US President]] [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Twitter#Tweets|tweet]]s, and called it the [[Volfefe index]] combining volatility and the [[covfefe]] [[meme]].\n\n== Volatility for investors ==\nInvestors care about volatility for at least eight reasons:\n\n# The wider the swings in an investment's price, the harder emotionally it is to not worry;\n# Price volatility of a trading instrument can define position sizing in a portfolio;\n# When certain cash flows from selling a security are needed at a specific future date, higher volatility means a greater chance of a shortfall;\n# Higher volatility of returns while saving for retirement results in a wider distribution of possible final portfolio values;\n# Higher volatility of return when retired gives withdrawals a larger permanent impact on the portfolio's value;\n# Price volatility presents opportunities to buy assets cheaply and sell when overpriced;\n# Portfolio volatility has a negative impact on the [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of that portfolio\n# Volatility affects pricing of [[option (finance)|options]], being a parameter of the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]].\n\nIn today's markets, it is also possible to trade volatility directly, through the use of derivative securities such as options and [[variance swap]]s. See [[Volatility arbitrage]].\n\n== Volatility versus direction ==\n\nVolatility does not measure the direction of price changes, merely their dispersion. This is because when calculating [[standard deviation]] (or [[variance]]), all differences are squared, so that negative and positive differences are combined into one quantity.  Two instruments with different volatilities may have the same expected return, but the instrument with higher volatility will have larger swings in values over a given period of time.\n\nFor example, a lower volatility stock may have an expected (average) return of 7%, with annual volatility of 5%.  This would indicate returns from approximately negative 3% to positive 17% most of the time (19 times out of 20, or 95% via a two standard deviation rule).  A higher volatility stock, with the same expected return of 7% but with annual volatility of 20%, would indicate returns from approximately negative 33% to positive 47% most of the time (19 times out of 20, or 95%). These estimates assume a [[normal distribution]]; in reality stocks are found to be [[Kurtosis|leptokurtotic]].\n\n== Volatility over time ==\n\nAlthough the [[Black-Scholes]] equation assumes predictable constant volatility, this is not observed in real markets, and amongst the models are [[Emanuel Derman]] and [[Iraj Kani]]'s<ref name=derman>{{cite journal | author=Derman, E., Iraj Kani | title=\"Riding on a Smile.\" RISK, 7(2) Feb.1994, pp. 139\u2013145, pp. 32\u201339. | publisher=Risk | year= 1994 | url=http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/gs-volatility_smile.pdf | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> and  [[Bruno Dupire]]'s [[local volatility]], [[Poisson process]] where volatility jumps to new levels with a predictable frequency, and the increasingly popular Heston model of [[stochastic volatility]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmottwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Volatility|title=Volatility|work=wilmottwiki.com}}</ref>\n\nIt is common knowledge that types of assets experience periods of high and low volatility.

Suppose you notice that a market price index, which has a current value near 10,000, has moved about 100 points a day, on average, for many days.  This would constitute a 1% daily movement, up or down.\n\nTo annualize this, you can use the \"rule of 16\", that is, multiply by 16 to get 16% as the annual volatility.  The rationale for this is that 16 is the square root of 256, which is approximately the number of trading days in a year (252). This also uses the fact that the standard deviation of the sum of ''n'' independent variables (with equal standard deviations) is \u221an times the standard deviation of the individual variables.\n\nThe average magnitude of the observations is merely an approximation of the standard deviation of the market index. Assuming that the market index daily changes are normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation&nbsp;''\u03c3'', the expected value of the [[Absolute deviation|magnitude of the observations]] is \u221a(2/{{pi}})''\u03c3'' =&nbsp;0.798''\u03c3''. The net effect is that this crude approach underestimates the true volatility by about 20%.\n\n== Estimate of compound annual growth rate (CAGR) ==\n\nConsider the [[Taylor series]]:\n\n:<math>\\log(1+y) = y - \\tfrac{1}{2}y^2 + \\tfrac{1}{3}y^3 - \\tfrac{1}{4}y^4 + \\cdots </math>\n\nTaking only the first two terms one has:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{CAGR} \\approx \\mathrm{AR} - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma^2</math>\n\nVolatility thus mathematically represents a drag on the CAGR (formalized as the \"[[volatility tax]]\"). Realistically, most financial assets have negative skewness and leptokurtosis, so this formula tends to be over-optimistic. Some people use the formula:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{CAGR} \\approx \\mathrm{AR} - \\tfrac{1}{2}k\\sigma^2</math>\n\nfor a rough estimate, where ''k'' is an empirical factor (typically five to ten).\n\n== Criticisms of volatility forecasting models ==\n[[File:Vix.png|450px|thumb|right|Performance of [[VIX]] (left) compared to past volatility (right) as 30-day volatility predictors, for the period of Jan 1990-Sep 2009.

It remained atop the chart in its second week with a 49% decline to 358,959, pushing the albums sales past the one million mark after only 2 weeks in stores and remains the longest run atop the chart for Destiny's Child.<ref name=\"DCSurvivor\" /> In its third week ''Survivor'' slipped to number 3 scanning 221,884 and held the same position in its fourth frame with 175,237 copies sold. In its fifth week the album climbed one spot to No.2 with 169,487 scans.<ref name=\"DCSurvivor\" /> ''Survivor'' spent its first thirteen weeks in the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' 200 (2 more than ''The Writing's on the Wall'') and by the end of 2001 had sold 3,718,446 copies in the US and ranked as the seventh best-selling album of the year, the second year in a row that the group had made the top ten best-sellers list.<ref name=\"DCSurvivor\" />\n\n''Survivor'' debuted at number one in over nine countries, including the United Kingdom where it was certified 3\u00d7 Platinum by [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] for sales of over 900,000 and went on to sell over a million copies. It also reached number one in Canada, selling over 31,000 copies in its first week (and was eventually certified 4\u00d7 Platinum, for sales of 400,000 copies), as well as debuting or peaking in the top ten in Australia, Sweden, Japan, France, Italy, Finland and Poland. With ''Survivor'', Destiny's Child became the first US female group to have a number one album on the UK charts since Diana Ross and the Supremes hit the position 24 years ago with a greatest hits package. ''Survivor'' is the first album of original studio material (i.e., not a greatest hits collection) by a female American group to hit number one in the 43-year history of the UK chart.\n\n\"Survivor\", the album's title track, spent six weeks at the number-two position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, being barred from the number one position by [[Janet Jackson]]'s \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]].\" \"Independent Women Part I\" (also featured in the remake film ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' and on its soundtrack) occupied the number one slot on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 (for 11 weeks), R&B and dance charts. \"Bootylicious\" served as the album's third single and topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for 2 weeks. \"Emotion\" was issued as the album's fourth single and continued the group's streak of top-ten hits in the United States, peaking at number ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"Nasty Girl\" served as the album's fifth and final single and only charted internationally, reaching the top ten in Australia, as well as the top 30 in Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\nIn Europe the album was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum in recognition of two million albums sold across the continent; its sales have since surpassed the three million mark.

She also modeled and trained at the [[Margaret O'Brien]] Modeling Studio. She won Best Model of the Year at the [[International Modeling and Talent Association]] Convention in New York City under O'Brien's studio in 2000.\n\n==Career==\nIn 2001, Stoner became the co-host of the [[Disney Channel]] ''[[Mike's Super Short Show]]'' along with Michael Alan Johnson, an infomercial segment regarding forthcoming [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] releases. In 2003 and 2005, she appeared as Sarah, one of the twelve Baker children, in the successful comedies ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' and ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen 2]]''.

In 2008, she starred in the Disney Channel Original movie ''[[Camp Rock]]'' as Caitlyn Gellar, an aspiring music producer.   Her reception in ''Camp Rock'' was particularly strong, with various media outlets suggesting it was about time she played a main character role having backed up for other big names such as Will Smith and Eminem. Stoner starred as Alice McKinley in the movie ''[[Alice Upside Down]]'', based loosely on the Alice series, particularly ''The Agony of Alice'' by [[Phyllis Reynolds Naylor]]. This was her second starring role and, according to an interview that appears on the direct-to-DVD release, she states that this was the first time she has had to appear in every scene in a movie.\n\nIn 2008, she sang two songs, \"Lost and Found\" and \"Free Spirit\", from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Alice Upside Down]],'' in which she plays the lead role.

Her television roles include serving as the host of [[Disney Channel]]'s ''[[Mike's Super Short Show]]'' (2001\u20132007) for voicing [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Isabella Garcia-Shapiro|Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]] in ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' (2007\u20132015). She has further lent her voice to the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' franchise (2008\u20132019) and the ''Holly Hobbie and Friends'' film series (2006\u20132008).\n\nOutside of acting, Stoner has also embarked on a music career, releasing 12 singles and 2 extended plays.\n\n==Early life==\nStoner was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]], the daughter of LuAnne Hodges (n\u00e9e Adams), a former executive secretary at [[Owens-Illinois]], and Charlie Stoner.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rhonda B.|last=Sewell |url=http://v1.toledoblade.com/Music-Theater-Dance/2003/04/06/The-wonder-of-the-way-she-dances.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120718005623/http://v1.toledoblade.com/Music-Theater-Dance/2003/04/06/The-wonder-of-the-way-she-dances.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 18, 2012 |title=The wonder of the way she dances |publisher=Toledoblade.com |date=April 6, 2003 |accessdate=November 27, 2010 }}</ref> While growing up in Toledo, Stoner attended [[Maumee Valley Country Day School]] and studied [[ballet]], [[tap dance]], and [[jazz dance]] at the O'Connell's Dance Studio. She also modeled and trained at the [[Margaret O'Brien]] Modeling Studio. She won Best Model of the Year at the [[International Modeling and Talent Association]] Convention in New York City under O'Brien's studio in 2000.\n\n==Career==\nIn 2001, Stoner became the co-host of the [[Disney Channel]] ''[[Mike's Super Short Show]]'' along with Michael Alan Johnson, an infomercial segment regarding forthcoming [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] releases. In 2003 and 2005, she appeared as Sarah, one of the twelve Baker children, in the successful comedies ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' and ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen 2]]''. She has also appeared in several television shows aimed at the preteen audience, including ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'', ''[[That's So Raven]]'' and ''[[Drake & Josh]]''.\n\nIn 2006, she had a small film role in ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]'' as Camille, [[Channing Tatum]]'s character's younger foster sister. She provided the voice of Isabella Garcia-Shapiro and Jenny (until Season 4) in the Disney Channel animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' from 2007-2015, and personally came up with Isabella's catchphrase \"Whatcha doin'?\". In 2008, she starred in the Disney Channel Original movie ''[[Camp Rock]]'' as Caitlyn Gellar, an aspiring music producer.   Her reception in ''Camp Rock'' was particularly strong, with various media outlets suggesting it was about time she played a main character role having backed up for other big names such as Will Smith and Eminem. Stoner starred as Alice McKinley in the movie ''[[Alice Upside Down]]'', based loosely on the Alice series, particularly ''The Agony of Alice'' by [[Phyllis Reynolds Naylor]]. This was her second starring role and, according to an interview that appears on the direct-to-DVD release, she states that this was the first time she has had to appear in every scene in a movie.\n\nIn 2008, she sang two songs, \"Lost and Found\" and \"Free Spirit\", from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Alice Upside Down]],'' in which she plays the lead role. She has also recorded a cover version of the song ''[[Dancing in the Moonlight]]'' for the 2009 Disney DVD/Blu-ray movie, ''[[Space Buddies]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disneydvd.disney.go.com/space-buddies.html |title=Space Buddies |work=Disney Buddies |accessdate=March 18, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407061059/http://disneydvd.disney.go.com/space-buddies.html |archivedate=April 7, 2013 |df= }}</ref> In 2010, Stoner appeared in the third ''Step Up'' film ''[[Step Up 3D]]'' opposite [[Adam Sevani]] where she reprised the role.

At our trading houses, too, we mean to sell so low as merely to repay us cost and charges, so as neither to lessen or enlarge our capital. This is what private traders cannot do, for they must gain; they will consequently retire from the competition, and we shall thus get clear of this pest without giving offence or umbrage to the Indians.
