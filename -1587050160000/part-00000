Proteins perform a variety of critical functions as [[enzyme]]s, structural proteins or [[hormone]]s and therefore, are crucial biological components. Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s but there are some distinct differences <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=  Sixth}}</ref>.\n\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases - [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. During transcription, a section of [[DNA]] encoding a protein, known as a [[gene]], is converted into a template molecule called [[messenger RNA]]. This conversion is carried out by enzymes, known as [[RNA polymerases]], in the nucleus of the cell <ref name=\"O'Connor 2010\">{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Clare |title=Essentials of Cell Biology |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge, MA |location=NPG Education |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/ |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>. In eukaryotes, this messenger RNA (mRNA) is initially produced in a premature form (pre-mRNA) which undergoes post-transcriptional modifications to produce mature mRNA. The mature mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore]]s to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the mRNA is read by [[ribosome]]s which use the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s. The ribosomes catalyse the formation of [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[peptide bond]]s between the encoded amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.\n\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein, for example, to function as an enzyme the polypeptide chain must fold correctly to produce a functional [[active site]]. In order to adopt a functional three-dimensional (3D) shape, the polypeptide chain must first form a series of smaller underlying structures called [[protein secondary structure|secondary structures]]. The polypeptide chain in these secondary structures then folds to produce the overall 3D [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]]. Once correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications can alter the protein's ability to function, where it is located within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and the protein's ability to [[protein-protein interaction|interact with other proteins]] <ref name =\"Wang 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|pmid=24217768 |pmc=3915910 }}</ref>.\n\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease as changes and errors in this process, through underlying [[mutation|DNA mutations]] or protein misfolding, are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence. [[Nonsense mutation|Mutations can cause the polypeptide chain to be shorter]] by generating a [[stop codon|stop sequence]] which causes early termination of translation. Alternatively, a mutation in the mRNA sequence [[missense mutation|changes the specific amino acid encoded at that position]] in the polypeptide chain.

In eukaryotes, this mRNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional modifications in the nucleus to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional modifications are not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced by transcription  <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=  Sixth}}</ref>.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | width = 200\n | image1 = Nucleotide structure within a polynucleotide chain.png\n | alt1 = Shows the structure of \n | caption1 = Illustrate the structure of a nucleotide with the 5 carbons labelled demonstrating the 5' nature of the phosphate group and 3' nature of hydroxyl group needed to form the connective phosphodiester bonds\n | image2 = Directionality of DNA molecule.png\n | alt2 = Shows the two polynucleotide strands within the DNA molecule joined by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs.

DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, complementary [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

This property of directionality is due to the asymmetrical underlying nucleotide subunits, with a phosphate group on one side of the pentose sugar and a base on the other. The five carbons in the pentose sugar are numbered from 1' (where ' means prime) to 5'. Therefore, the phosphodiester bonds connecting the nucleotides are formed by joining the [[hydroxy|hydroxyl]] group of on the 3' carbon of one nucleotide to the phosphate group on the 5' carbon of another nucleotide. Hence, the coding strand of DNA runs in a 5' to 3' direction and the complementary, template DNA strand runs in the opposite direction from 3' to 5' <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>. \n\n[[File:Process of DNA transcription.png|300px|thumb|Illustrates the conversion of the template strand of DNA to the pre-mRNA molecule by RNA polymerase.]]\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the gene in the 3' to 5' direction. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA in the 5'-to-3' direction by catalysing the formation of [[phosphodiester bonds]] between activated nucleotides (free in the nucleus) that are capable of complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the template strand. Behind the moving RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin, so only 12 base pairs of DNA are exposed at one time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

RNA polymerase builds the pre-mRNA molecule at a rate of 20 nucleotides per second enabling the production of thousands of pre-mRNA molecules from the same gene in an hour. Despite the fast rate of synthesis, the RNA polymerase enzyme contains its own proofreading mechanism. The proofreading mechanisms allows the RNA polymerase to remove incorrect nucleotides (which are not complementary to the template strand of DNA) from the growing pre-mRNA molecule through an excision reaction <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>. When RNA polymerases reaches a specific DNA sequence which [[stop codon|terminates]] transcription, RNA polymerase detaches and pre-mRNA synthesis is complete <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

However, there is one crucial difference in the nucleotide composition of DNA and mRNA molecules. DNA is composed of the bases - [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] (G, C, A and T) - RNA is also composed of four bases - guanine, cytosine, adenine and [[uracil]]. In RNA molecules, the DNA base thymine is replaced by uracil which is able to base pair with adenine. Therefore, in the pre-mRNA molecule, all complementary bases which would be thymine in the coding DNA strand are replaced by uracil <ref name=\"Berk2000\">{{cite book |last1=Berk |first1=Arnold |last2=Lodish |first2=Harvey |last3=Darnell |first3=James E |title=Molecular cell biology |date=2000 |publisher=W.H.

These distinct mRNA modifications enable the cell to detect that the full mRNA message is intact if both the 5' cap and 3' tail are present <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThis modified pre-mRNA molecule then undergoes the process of RNA splicing. Genes are composed of a series of introns and [[exon]]s, introns are nucleotide sequences which do not encode a protein while, exons are nucleotide sequences that directly encode a protein. Introns and exons are present in both the underlying DNA sequence and the pre-mRNA molecule, therefore, in order to produce a mature mRNA molecule encoding a protein,  splicing must occur <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

This mature mRNA molecule is then exported into the cytoplasm through nuclear pores in the envelope of the nucleus.\n\n==Translation==\n{{main|Translation (biology)}}\n[[File:Translation - cycle.png|450px|thumb|Illustrates the translation process showing the cycle of tRNA codon-anti-codon pairing and amino acid incorporation into the growing polypeptide chain by the ribosome.]]\n[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px|right| Demonstrates the action of the ribosome as a [[biological machine]] which functions on a [[nanoscale]] to perform translation. The ribosome moves along the mature mRNA molecule incorporating tRNA and producing a polypeptide chain.]] \n\nDuring translation, ribosomes synthesise polypeptide chains from mRNA template molecules. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of both transcription and translation occur in the cytoplasm <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n[[Ribosome]]s are complex [[molecular machine]]s, made of a mixture of protein and [[ribosomal RNA]], arranged into two subunits (a large and a small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule.

In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules, known as [[transfer RNA]]s (tRNA), to deliver the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides within the molecule. There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, each tRNA binds to a specific sequence of three nucleotides (known as a [[codon]]) within the mRNA molecule and delivers a specific amino acid <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=  2nd}}</ref>.\n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the molecule. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to a specific codon that may be present in mRNA. For example, the first codon encountered is the start codon composed of the nucleotides AUG. The correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, this is the amino acid methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its [[peptidyl transferase]] enzymatic activity to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids <ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>.\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon. The ribosome then releases the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule forming a [[polysome]], this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this occurs, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the complete polypeptide chain from the ribosome <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of a polypeptide chain folding from its initial primary structure through to the quaternary structure.]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is complete, the polypeptide chain folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure, ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein. The tertiary structure is the proteins overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, some proteins may adopt a complex [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the quaternary structure. Hence, the overall protein is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits e.g. [[haemoglobin]] <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nWhen protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is complete, it is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing through post-translational modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translational modification, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm <ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049|doi-access=free }}</ref>.

Examples of processes which add chemical groups to the target protein include methylation, [[Protein acetylation|acetylation]] and [[Protein phosphorylation|phosphorylation]].\n\nMethylation is the reversible addition of a [[methyl group]] onto an amino acid catalysed by [[methyltransferase]] enzymes. Methylation occurs on at least 9 of the 20 common amino acids, however, it mainly occurs on the amino acids [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]. One example of a protein which is commonly methylated is a [[histone]]. Histones are proteins found in the nucleus of the cell. DNA is tightly wrapped round histones and held in place by other proteins and interactions between negative charges in the DNA and positive charges on the histone. A highly specific pattern of [[histone methylation|amino acid methylation]] on the histone proteins is used to determine which regions of DNA are tightly wound and unable to be transcribed and which regions are loosely wound and able to be transcribed <ref name=\"Murn 2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Murn |first1=Jernej |last2=Shi |first2=Yang |title=The winding path of protein methylation research: milestones and new frontiers |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |date=2017 |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=517\u2013527 |doi=10.1038/nrm.2017.35}}</ref>.\n\nHistone-based regulation of DNA transcription is also modified by acetylation. Acetylation is the reversible covalent addition of an [[acetyl group]] onto a lysine amino acid by the enzyme [[acetyltransferase]]. The acetyl group is removed from a donor molecule known as [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl coenzyme A]] and transferred onto the target protein <ref name=\"Drazic 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Drazic |first1=Adrian |last2=Myklebust |first2=Line M. |last3=Ree |first3=Rasmus |last4=Arnesen |first4=Thomas |title=The world of protein acetylation |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Proteins and Proteomics |date=2016 |volume=1864 |issue=10 |pages=1372\u20131401 |doi=10.1016/j.bbapap.2016.06.007|doi-access=free }}</ref>.

Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a [[phosphate]] group to specific amino acids ([[serine]], [[threonine]] and [[tyrosine]]) within the protein. The phosphate group is removed from the donor molecule [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by a protein [[kinase]] and transferred onto the [[hydroxy|hydroxyl]] group of the target amino acid, this produces [[adenosine diphosphate]] as a biproduct. This process can be reversed and the phosphate group removed by the enzyme protein [[phosphatase]]. Phosphorylation can create a binding site on the phosphorylated protein which enables it to interact with other proteins and generate large, multi-protein complexes. Alternatively, phosphorylation can change the level of protein activity by altering the ability of the protein to bind its substrate <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modifications can incorporate more complex, large molecules into the folded protein structure. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], the addition of a polysaccharide molecule, which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>.\n\nIn glycosylation, a [[polysaccharide]] molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to the target protein by [[glycosyltransferases]] enzymes and modified by [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of the target protein. In some cases glycosylation is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|protein chaperones]]. Chaperones are proteins responsible for folding and maintaining the structure of other proteins <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently to the nitrogen in an [[asparagine]] amino acid. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the sequential covalent addition of [[Monosaccharide|individual sugars]] onto the oxygen in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right).]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a wide variety of conditions. In order to stabilise the 3D protein structure, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in the quaternary structure. The most prevalent type is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulfide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, these chemical groups are known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing structure]] of the protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the DNA nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding or malfunctioning. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n===Sickle Cell Disease===\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia illustrating the different red blood cell shapes and differing blood flow within blood vessels.]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of haemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen. The most dangerous of the sickle cell diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the sufferer must carry a mutation in both copies of the affected gene (one inherited from each parent) to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin has a complex quaternary structure and is composed of four polypeptide subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense or substitution mutation in the gene encoding the haemoglobin B subunit polypeptide chain. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anaemia, the most common missense mutation is a single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the haemoglobin B subunit gene <ref name=\"StatPearls 2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Mangla |first1=Ankit |last2=Ehsan |first2=Moavia |last3=Maruvada |first3=Smita |title=Sickle Cell Anemia |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482164/ |website=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |accessdate=12 March 2020 |date=2020|pmid=29489205 }}</ref>. This changes codon 6 from encoding the amino acid glutamic acid to encoding valine <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\"/>.\n\nThis change in the primary structure of the haemoglobin B subunit polypeptide chain alters the functionality of the haemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin protein starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" shape, and reduces cell flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can accumulate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to tissues and can lead to [[necrosis|tissue death]] which causes great pain to the individual <ref name=\"Ilesanmi 2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Ilesanmi |first1=Oluwatoyin Olatundun |title=Pathological basis of symptoms and crises in sickle cell disorder: implications for counseling and psychotherapy |journal=Hematology Reports |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.4081/hr.2010.e2|doi-access=free }}</ref>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Central dogma of molecular biology]]\n*[[Genetic code]]\n*[[Gene expression]]\n*[[Post-translational modification]]\n*[[Protein folding]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA A useful video visualising the process of converting DNA to protein via transcription and translation]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hok2hyED9go Video visualising the process of protein folding from the non-functional primary structure to a mature, folded 3D protein structure with reference to the role of mutations and protein mis-folding in disease]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2bGjTaNsnM A more advanced video detailing the different types of post-translational modifications and their chemical structures]\n\n{{Protein primary structure}}\n{{protein biosynthesis}}{{Protein topics}}\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n\n[[Category:Gene expression]]\n[[Category:Proteins]]\n[[Category:Biosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Protein biosynthesis| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Summary of the protein biosynthesis process.png|thumb|300px|Protein biosynthesis starting with transcription and post-transcriptional modifications in the nucleus.

Proteins perform a variety of critical functions as [[enzyme]]s, structural proteins or [[hormone]]s and therefore, are crucial biological components.

During transcription, a section of [[DNA]] encoding a protein, known as a [[gene]], is converted into a template molecule called [[messenger RNA]]. This conversion is carried out by enzymes, known as [[RNA polymerases]], in the nucleus of the cell <ref name=\"O'Connor 2010\">{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Clare |title=Essentials of Cell Biology |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge, MA |location=NPG Education |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/ |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>. In eukaryotes, this messenger RNA (mRNA) is initially produced in a premature form (pre-mRNA) which undergoes post-transcriptional modifications to produce mature mRNA. The mature mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore]]s to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the mRNA is read by [[ribosome]]s which use the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s. The ribosomes catalyse the formation of [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[peptide bond]]s between the encoded amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.\n\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein, for example, to function as an enzyme the polypeptide chain must fold correctly to produce a functional [[active site]]. In order to adopt a functional three-dimensional (3D) shape, the polypeptide chain must first form a series of smaller underlying structures called [[protein secondary structure|secondary structures]]. The polypeptide chain in these secondary structures then folds to produce the overall 3D [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]]. Once correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications can alter the protein's ability to function, where it is located within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and the protein's ability to [[protein-protein interaction|interact with other proteins]] <ref name =\"Wang 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|pmid=24217768 |pmc=3915910 }}</ref>.\n\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease as changes and errors in this process, through underlying [[mutation|DNA mutations]] or protein misfolding, are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence.

DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, complementary [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

This property of directionality is due to the asymmetrical underlying nucleotide subunits, with a phosphate group on one side of the pentose sugar and a base on the other. The five carbons in the pentose sugar are numbered from 1' (where ' means prime) to 5'. Therefore, the phosphodiester bonds connecting the nucleotides are formed by joining the [[hydroxy|hydroxyl]] group of on the 3' carbon of one nucleotide to the phosphate group on the 5' carbon of another nucleotide.

Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA in the 5'-to-3' direction by catalysing the formation of [[phosphodiester bonds]] between activated nucleotides (free in the nucleus) that are capable of complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the template strand.

In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of both transcription and translation occur in the cytoplasm <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n[[Ribosome]]s are complex [[molecular machine]]s, made of a mixture of protein and [[ribosomal RNA]], arranged into two subunits (a large and a small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule.

In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules, known as [[transfer RNA]]s (tRNA), to deliver the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides within the molecule. There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, each tRNA binds to a specific sequence of three nucleotides (known as a [[codon]]) within the mRNA molecule and delivers a specific amino acid <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=  2nd}}</ref>.\n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the molecule. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to a specific codon that may be present in mRNA. For example, the first codon encountered is the start codon composed of the nucleotides AUG. The correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, this is the amino acid methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its [[peptidyl transferase]] enzymatic activity to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids <ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>.\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon. The ribosome then releases the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule forming a [[polysome]], this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this occurs, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the complete polypeptide chain from the ribosome <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of a polypeptide chain folding from its initial primary structure through to the quaternary structure.]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is complete, the polypeptide chain folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure, ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein. The tertiary structure is the proteins overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, some proteins may adopt a complex [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the quaternary structure. Hence, the overall protein is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits e.g. [[haemoglobin]] <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nWhen protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is complete, it is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing through post-translational modifications.

The acetyl group is removed from a donor molecule known as [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl coenzyme A]] and transferred onto the target protein <ref name=\"Drazic 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Drazic |first1=Adrian |last2=Myklebust |first2=Line M. |last3=Ree |first3=Rasmus |last4=Arnesen |first4=Thomas |title=The world of protein acetylation |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Proteins and Proteomics |date=2016 |volume=1864 |issue=10 |pages=1372\u20131401 |doi=10.1016/j.bbapap.2016.06.007|doi-access=free }}</ref>. [[Histone acetylation and deacetylation|Histones undergo acetylation]] on their lysine residues by enzymes known as [[histone acetyltransferase]]. The effect of acetylation is to weaken the charge interactions between the histone and DNA, thereby making more genes in the DNA accessible for transcription <ref name=\"Bannister 2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Bannister |first1=Andrew J |last2=Kouzarides |first2=Tony |title=Regulation of chromatin by histone modifications |journal=Cell Research |date=2011 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=381\u2013395 |doi=10.1038/cr.2011.22|doi-access=free }}</ref>.\n\nThe final, prevalent post-translational chemical group modification is phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a [[phosphate]] group to specific amino acids ([[serine]], [[threonine]] and [[tyrosine]]) within the protein. The phosphate group is removed from the donor molecule [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by a protein [[kinase]] and transferred onto the [[hydroxy|hydroxyl]] group of the target amino acid, this produces [[adenosine diphosphate]] as a biproduct. This process can be reversed and the phosphate group removed by the enzyme protein [[phosphatase]]. Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex or can alter the level of protein activity <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modifications can incorporate more complex, large molecules into the folded protein structure. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], the addition of a polysaccharide molecule, which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>.\n\nIn glycosylation, a [[polysaccharide]] molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to the target protein by [[glycosyltransferases]] enzymes and modified by [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of the target protein. In some cases glycosylation is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|protein chaperones]]. Chaperones are proteins responsible for folding and maintaining the structure of other proteins <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently to the nitrogen in an [[asparagine]] amino acid. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the sequential covalent addition of [[Monosaccharide|individual sugars]] onto the oxygen in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right).]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a wide variety of conditions. In order to stabilise the 3D protein structure, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in the quaternary structure. The most prevalent type is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulfide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, these chemical groups are known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing structure]] of the protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the DNA nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding or malfunctioning. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n===Sickle Cell Disease===\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia illustrating the different red blood cell shapes and differing blood flow within blood vessels.]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of haemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen. The most dangerous of the sickle cell diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the sufferer must carry a mutation in both copies of the affected gene (one inherited from each parent) to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin has a complex quaternary structure and is composed of four polypeptide subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense or substitution mutation in the gene encoding the haemoglobin B subunit polypeptide chain. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anaemia, the most common missense mutation is a single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the haemoglobin B subunit gene <ref name=\"StatPearls 2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Mangla |first1=Ankit |last2=Ehsan |first2=Moavia |last3=Maruvada |first3=Smita |title=Sickle Cell Anemia |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482164/ |website=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |accessdate=12 March 2020 |date=2020|pmid=29489205 }}</ref>. This changes codon 6 from encoding the amino acid glutamic acid to encoding valine <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\"/>.\n\nThis change in the primary structure of the haemoglobin B subunit polypeptide chain alters the functionality of the haemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin protein starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" shape, and reduces cell flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can accumulate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to tissues and can lead to [[necrosis|tissue death]] which causes great pain to the individual <ref name=\"Ilesanmi 2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Ilesanmi |first1=Oluwatoyin Olatundun |title=Pathological basis of symptoms and crises in sickle cell disorder: implications for counseling and psychotherapy |journal=Hematology Reports |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.4081/hr.2010.e2|doi-access=free }}</ref>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Central dogma of molecular biology]]\n*[[Genetic code]]\n*[[Gene expression]]\n*[[Post-translational modification]]\n*[[Protein folding]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA A useful video visualising the process of converting DNA to protein via transcription and translation]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hok2hyED9go Video visualising the process of protein folding from the non-functional primary structure to a mature, folded 3D protein structure with reference to the role of mutations and protein mis-folding in disease]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2bGjTaNsnM A more advanced video detailing the different types of post-translational modifications and their chemical structures]\n\n{{Protein primary structure}}\n{{protein biosynthesis}}{{Protein topics}}\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n\n[[Category:Gene expression]]\n[[Category:Proteins]]\n[[Category:Biosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Protein biosynthesis| ]]\n", "name_user": "Kep17", "label": "safe", "comment": "Addition to phosphorylation post-translational modification section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"}

He was one of the first group of 60 people to receive the [[Victoria Medal (horticulture)|Victoria Medal]] of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in 1897. Author of ''Monograph of the Genus Lilium'' (1880), and ''The Trees of Great Britain & Ireland'' (1906&ndash;1913) with [[Augustine Henry]], as well as numerous articles, he left a collection of 30,000 [[butterfly]] specimens to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], including 11,370 specimens of [[Palearctic ecozone|Palaearctic]] butterflies.<ref name=Salmon>Salmon, M.

After the age of 17 he spent at least part of every year abroad, and was sent to tutors in Paris, [[Brussels]] and [[Dresden]] before spending five years in the [[Scots Guards]] from 1865. He apparently did not take soldiering very seriously, being more interested in [[ornithology]] which in those days consisted of collecting specimens and [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. He resigned his commission in 1869 and lived the life of a travelling naturalist and country gentleman. He visited various parts of the world studying aspects of natural history including ornithology, botany, entomology and big game.<ref name=obit>Anon (1923) Obituary: Henry John Elwes, F.R.S.

He would later  ascribe his interest in plants to his wife, Margaret Lowndes, whom he married in 1871. His first garden was at Miserden, near [[Cirencester]]; he later moved to Preston House, Cirencester, before inheriting the Colesbourne estate on the death of his father in 1891.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1870, after achieving a diploma in biology with a thesis in natural history, Elwes was made a member of a mission organised by the Geographical Section of the British Association which would take the party through to the [[Sikkim]] Himalaya, crossing the border into then-forbidden [[Tibet]]. The journey was inspired by reading [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]]'s ''Himalayan Journals''; it was the first of Elwes' many visits to Asia, and resulted in the major paper \"On the geographical distribution of Asiatic birds\" read to the Zoological Society in 1873. This was his last major ornithological contribution, as his interest moved on to insects and, increasingly, to plants. It was this visit to the [[Himalaya]] that sparked his interest in Lepidoptera; his Sikkim expedition alone yielded nearly 530 records of [[Butterfly|butterflies]]. Elwes' visit to [[Turkey]] in 1874 was somewhat fortuitous as it replaced a trip to [[Cyprus]] at short notice. It is evident that on this journey Elwes' interest was focused on plants, and he collected numerous species of bulbs. In early April, whilst in the mountains near [[Smyrna]] (modern [[Izmir]]), he came across \"the fine large snowdrop which now bears my name\" (''[[Galanthus elwesii]]''). Before leaving Turkey he arranged for bulbs to be collected later; the first of the many millions exported ever since.\n\nIn 1880 he visited India, accompanied by [[Frederick Du Cane Godman]] and the two visited [[Allan Octavian Hume]] before proceeding to Sikkim.<ref name=ibis>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/ibis1111919brit#page/326/mode/2up|journal=Ibis|pages=326\u2013343 | title=Obituary: Frederick DuCane Godman|author=Anonymous|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1919.tb02888.x|volume=61|issue=2}}</ref> He also made collection trips to the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], the [[Central Provinces and Berar|Central Provinces]], [[Bengal]], [[South Canara]] and [[Travancore]]. Along with T. Edwards, Elwes wrote a monograph on the Oriental ''[[Hesperiidae]]''.<ref>Rao, B R Subba (1998) ''History of Entomology in India''. Institution of Agricultural Technologists. Bangalore.</ref> He also made a trip to the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] region in 1898. His posthumously published ''Memoirs'' (1930) includes a chapter describing his visit to [[Nepal]] in 1914, at a time when Europeans were seldom admitted. He also mentions an unnamed companion, now known to be the English naturalist [[Aubyn Trevor-Battye]], who took some of the photographs used to illustrate this chapter.<ref>This visit is described in an unpublished manuscript: ''Indian Journal 1914'' by Aubyn Trevor-Battye, now in the possession of A.T-B's descendants, along with the original photographs</ref> Elwes was famous for his breeding of ''[[Nerine]]'' and ''[[Eremurus]]''. [[Horticulturalist]] and garden writer [[Edward Augustus Bowles]] noted that he was specially interested in ''[[Arisaema]]'', ''[[Crinum]]'', ''[[Crocus]]'', ''[[Fritillaria]]'' and ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'', as well as ''[[Kniphofia]]'', ''[[Peony|Paeonia]]'' and ''[[Yucca]]''. Bowles' memoir in Elwes' posthumous biography offers most information about the Colesbourne garden, but even this is scanty.{{sfn|Colesbourne Park |2011}}\n\nHis Lepidoptera collection was purchased by [[James John Joicey]] in 1920.[verification needed] Information on this is contradictory: it is also reported that his Lepidoptera collection was donated to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] <ref name=Salmon>Salmon, M.

In 1880, he published the magnificent folio ''Monograph of the Genus Lilium'', instigated by Elwes and written with assistance from J. G. Baker at [[Kew Gardens]], but he wrote disappointingly little about his gardening experiences. To ensure that the text was as accurate as possible, and that the range of lilies was as complete as possible, he consulted the greatest botanical experts in the field for help in writing the text. This level of excellence was perpetuated in the illustrations, and Elwes was able to execute his plan to illustrate the monograph with hand-coloured plates by the best available botanical artist, with each member of the genus shown full size. Between March 1877 and May 1880 subscribers received seven parts (at a total cost of seven guineas), illustrated with 48 plates by [[Walter Hood Fitch]] (1817\u20131892). In his garden he was able to grow many of the members of the genus ''Lilium'', becoming a recognised expert in the field. However, Elwes played down his level of knowledge.[[File:Henry & Elwes, 1913.jpg|thumb|left|[[Augustine Henry]] (left) and Elwes, c. 1906]]Shortly before his death in 1922, Elwes asked Arthur Grove, a friend and fellow lily expert, to undertake the task of producing a supplement. Dame Alice Godman, widow of [[Frederick DuCane Godman]] (whose first wife was Elwes' sister), agreed to underwrite the cost of the work (co-written by Grove and the botanist [[Arthur Disbrowe Cotton|A.D. Cotton]]) and the first seven parts of the supplement were published between July 1933 and February 1940, with 30 hand-coloured lithographed plates, all but two by [[Lilian Snelling]] (1879\u20131972).<ref>[http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/catalogues.php?membernr=1700&catnr=5&pg=2&br= Monogram background from Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America (ABAA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203073049/http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/catalogues.php?membernr=1700&catnr=5&pg=2&br= |date=3 February 2007 }}</ref> Two final supplements were published in 1960 and 1962 by [[William Bertram Turrill]].\n\n===''Trees of Great Britain & Ireland''===\nFrom 1900 to 1913 Elwes undertook his greatest work, ''The Trees of Great Britain & Ireland'', in conjunction with the botanist [[Augustine Henry]]. Between them, in seven large volumes, they described every species of tree then grown outdoors in the [[British Isles]], and recorded the finest specimens to be seen. Henry's contribution to the book was unique insofar as he devised a system of identification based on leaves and twigs and on the position of buds to aid identification even in the absence of fruit and flowers. Most of these were visited and recorded personally, a process which caused Elwes to wear out two cars. In addition, Elwes undertook numerous journeys abroad to study the trees in the wild, even visiting [[Chile]] to see monkey puzzle trees (''[[Araucaria araucana]]''). The work remains a source of information on trees and [[arboriculture]].\n\n==Works==\n* ''Monograph of the Genus Lilium'', London: Taylor and Francis, 1877\u201380.\n* ''On the Butterflies of Amurlan, North China, and Japan'', 1881, LV-LIX: 856\u2013916\n* ''The Trees of Great Britain & Ireland'' Private publication with [[Augustine Henry]], 1906.

It was this visit to the [[Himalaya]] that sparked his interest in Lepidoptera; his Sikkim expedition alone yielded nearly 530 records of [[Butterfly|butterflies]]. Elwes' visit to [[Turkey]] in 1874 was somewhat fortuitous as it replaced a trip to [[Cyprus]] at short notice. It is evident that on this journey Elwes' interest was focused on plants, and he collected numerous species of bulbs. In early April, whilst in the mountains near [[Smyrna]] (modern [[Izmir]]), he came across \"the fine large snowdrop which now bears my name\" (''[[Galanthus elwesii]]''). Before leaving Turkey he arranged for bulbs to be collected later; the first of the many millions exported ever since.\n\nIn 1880 he visited India, accompanied by [[Frederick Du Cane Godman]] and the two visited [[Allan Octavian Hume]] before proceeding to Sikkim.<ref name=ibis>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/ibis1111919brit#page/326/mode/2up|journal=Ibis|pages=326\u2013343 | title=Obituary: Frederick DuCane Godman|author=Anonymous|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1919.tb02888.x|volume=61|issue=2}}</ref> He also made collection trips to the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], the [[Central Provinces and Berar|Central Provinces]], [[Bengal]], [[South Canara]] and [[Travancore]]. Along with T. Edwards, Elwes wrote a monograph on the Oriental ''[[Hesperiidae]]''.<ref>Rao, B R Subba (1998) ''History of Entomology in India''. Institution of Agricultural Technologists. Bangalore.</ref> He also made a trip to the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] region in 1898. His posthumously published ''Memoirs'' (1930) includes a chapter describing his visit to [[Nepal]] in 1914, at a time when Europeans were seldom admitted. He also mentions an unnamed companion, now known to be the English naturalist [[Aubyn Trevor-Battye]], who took some of the photographs used to illustrate this chapter.<ref>This visit is described in an unpublished manuscript: ''Indian Journal 1914'' by Aubyn Trevor-Battye, now in the possession of A.T-B's descendants, along with the original photographs</ref> Elwes was famous for his breeding of ''[[Nerine]]'' and ''[[Eremurus]]''. [[Horticulturalist]] and garden writer [[Edward Augustus Bowles]] noted that he was specially interested in ''[[Arisaema]]'', ''[[Crinum]]'', ''[[Crocus]]'', ''[[Fritillaria]]'' and ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'', as well as ''[[Kniphofia]]'', ''[[Peony|Paeonia]]'' and ''[[Yucca]]''. Bowles' memoir in Elwes' posthumous biography offers most information about the Colesbourne garden, but even this is scanty.{{sfn|Colesbourne Park |2011}}\n\nHis Lepidoptera collection was purchased by [[James John Joicey]] in 1920.[verification needed] Information on this is contradictory: it is also reported that his Lepidoptera collection was donated the the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] <ref name=Salmon>Salmon, M.

In 1880, he published the magnificent folio ''Monograph of the Genus Lilium'', instigated by Elwes and written with assistance from J. G. Baker at [[Kew Gardens]], but he wrote disappointingly little about his gardening experiences. To ensure that the text was as accurate as possible, and that the range of lilies was as complete as possible, he consulted the greatest botanical experts in the field for help in writing the text. This level of excellence was perpetuated in the illustrations, and Elwes was able to execute his plan to illustrate the monograph with hand-coloured plates by the best available botanical artist, with each member of the genus shown full size. Between March 1877 and May 1880 subscribers received seven parts (at a total cost of seven guineas), illustrated with 48 plates by [[Walter Hood Fitch]] (1817\u20131892). In his garden he was able to grow many of the members of the genus ''Lilium'', becoming a recognised expert in the field. However, Elwes played down his level of knowledge.[[File:Henry & Elwes, 1913.jpg|thumb|left|[[Augustine Henry]] (left) and Elwes, c. 1906]]Shortly before his death in 1922, Elwes asked Arthur Grove, a friend and fellow lily expert, to undertake the task of producing a supplement. Dame Alice Godman, widow of [[Frederick DuCane Godman]] (whose first wife was Elwes' sister), agreed to underwrite the cost of the work (co-written by Grove and the botanist [[Arthur Disbrowe Cotton|A.D. Cotton]]) and the first seven parts of the supplement were published between July 1933 and February 1940, with 30 hand-coloured lithographed plates, all but two by [[Lilian Snelling]] (1879\u20131972).<ref>[http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/catalogues.php?membernr=1700&catnr=5&pg=2&br= Monogram background from Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America (ABAA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203073049/http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/catalogues.php?membernr=1700&catnr=5&pg=2&br= |date=3 February 2007 }}</ref> Two final supplements were published in 1960 and 1962 by [[William Bertram Turrill]].\n\n===''Trees of Great Britain & Ireland''===\nFrom 1900 to 1913 Elwes undertook his greatest work, ''The Trees of Great Britain & Ireland'', in conjunction with the botanist [[Augustine Henry]]. Between them, in seven large volumes, they described every species of tree then grown outdoors in the [[British Isles]], and recorded the finest specimens to be seen. Henry's contribution to the book was unique insofar as he devised a system of identification based on leaves and twigs and on the position of buds to aid identification even in the absence of fruit and flowers. Most of these were visited and recorded personally, a process which caused Elwes to wear out two cars. In addition, Elwes undertook numerous journeys abroad to study the trees in the wild, even visiting [[Chile]] to see monkey puzzle trees (''[[Araucaria araucana]]''). The work remains a source of information on trees and [[arboriculture]].\n\n==Works==\n* ''Monograph of the Genus Lilium'', London: Taylor and Francis, 1877\u201380.\n* ''On the Butterflies of Amurlan, North China, and Japan'', 1881, LV-LIX: 856\u2013916\n* ''The Trees of Great Britain & Ireland'' Private publication with [[Augustine Henry]], 1906.
