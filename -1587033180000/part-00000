Four teams played 18 games each. The [[Quebec Bulldogs]] would win the league championship and take over the [[Stanley Cup]].\n\n==League business==\n\nTwo NHA franchises would be dormant this season. Because the O'Briens had decided to give up hockey, the [[Renfrew Millionaires|Renfrew Creamery Kings]] were disbanded prior to the season, with the players distributed to the other teams by a draw of names. Two new teams based in Toronto intended to operate this season, the 'Torontos' and the 'Tecumsehs', but the new [[Arena Gardens]] would not be ready for play this season, so neither team played. This left four teams to play 18 games each.\n\n===Renfrew dispersal===\n* [[Cyclone Taylor]], [[Don Smith (ice hockey b. 1887)|Don Smith]]\u2014Wanderers\n* [[Odie Cleghorn]]\u2014Quebec\n* [[Sprague Cleghorn]]\u2014Toronto\n* [[Bert Lindsay]]\u2014Tecumsehs\n* [[Skene Ronan]]\u2014Ottawa\n* [[Larry Gilmour]] \u2014Canadiens\n\n;Source<nowiki>:</nowiki>\n{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1911-11-13 |page=13|title=Tecumsehs admitted}}\n\nTaylor would refuse to report to the Wanderers, while Don Smith and Bert Lindsay would join the PCHA. Odie Cleghorn refused to report to Quebec and joined the Wanderers as did his brother Sprague.\n\n===Executive===\n* Emmett Quinn (president)\n\nBoard of Directors:\n* E. McCafferty, Quebec\n* Sam Lichtenhein, Wanderers,\n* George Kennedy, Canadiens\n* Charles Sparks, Ottawa\n* J. Jane, Toronto\n* Fred Robertson, Toronto\n\n===Rule changes===\nThe rule changes implemented for this season introduced the format of play seen today.\n\nFor this season, the number of players per side was reduced to six by the elimination of the [[rover (ice hockey)|rover]] position. This was opposed by several teams, including the champion Ottawa team whose 'puck possession' style of play was dependent on the rover. The team would attempt during this season and next to get the league to return to seven-man hockey.<ref>Chi-Kit Wong, p. 63</ref>\n\nThis season saw the introduction of ''major'' and ''minor'' fouls.\n\nMajor Fouls:\n* throwing a stick to prevent a goal\n* cross-checking\n* charging\n* deliberate tripping and hooking\n* foul language\n\nfor which the player would be banished for the match and fined $5. Teams could substitute the player.\n\nMinor Fouls:\n* kicking, throwing, holding or batting puck with the hand\n* raising stick above shoulder except for 'lifting'\n* loafing offside\n\nfor which the player drew a ''caution''. Three cautions and you were out. If your fines reached $25, special discipline might be warranted by the president.\n\nOther Rules:\n* number armbands to identify players<ref name=impressions>{{cite web|last=DeLaere|first=Matt|title=What's in a Number?|publisher=Impressions|date=17 August 2017|accessdate=2 March 2018|url=https://www.impressionsmagazine.com/digital-decorating/heat-transfer/whats-in-a-number/}}</ref>\n* home club to choose end\n* overtime in case of tie\n* unlimited substitution, however unless in case of injury, the player could not return\n\nThe [[O'Brien Trophy (ice hockey)|O'Brien Cup]] was introduced for the NHA league championship winners.\n\nThe Canadiens team was to sign only francophone players and the other teams would refrain from doing so.\n\n;Source<nowiki>:</nowiki>\nColeman, \"Trail of the Stanley Cup\"\n\n===Equipment changes===\nThe league would adopt the LeSueur goal and the Spalding puck as official equipment. This was the first season that numbers were attached to player jerseys. At first, they were attached by armbands, then eventually stitched onto the front of the jerseys. To identify the players to the fans, a large 'key' sign was hung at the side of the rink.<ref>Coleman, p. 223</ref>\n\n===NHA \u2013 PCHA relations===\n\nIn a foreshadowing of when the NHL in 1926 would declare the [[American Hockey League]] an \"outlaw league\", the NHA declared the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA) an \"outlaw league\" after it signed several NHA players. The league expelled [[Newsy Lalonde]], [[Ernest Johnson (ice hockey)|Ernie Johnson]] and other players who signed with the PCHA 'for life' and barred NHA teams from playing PCHA teams.<ref name=\"No NHA in 1913\">{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |title=No NHA in 1913? |page=12 |date=1912-03-15}}</ref> After the season, [[Art Ross]] arranged an 'all-star' tour of NHA players in [[British Columbia]] against the PCHA in defiance of the league.<ref name=\"No NHA in 1913\"/> The NHA granted immunity for the players to play against the PCHA.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1912-03-22 |title=The Unstable NHA? |page=12}}</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\n{{Emergence of the NHL}}\nPrior to the season, on November 2, [[Bruce Ridpath]] of the Stanley Cup champion [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Hockey Club]] would be seriously injured with a fractured skull after being hit by an automobile on Yonge Street in Toronto. He lived in Toronto and was rumoured to be a possible manager of the future Toronto NHA franchise.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1911-11-03 |title=Bruce Ridpath Badly Hurt |page=12}}</ref>\n\nFred Taylor went on public record stating that he would not play for Wanderers as he had a good position with the Interior Department in Ottawa, and would not play at all instead of playing for the Wanderers. Ottawa would attempt to secure his rights from Montreal. Ottawa would offer to trade Ronan (who would go on to win the scoring championship) for Taylor but was turned down.\n\nOn November 18, the NHA developed a schedule with a provisional opening date of the [[Mutual Street Arena|Arena Gardens]] late in January, and allowed the two new Toronto teams to play only away games at the start of the season. The architects of the Gardens assured them that the arena would be ready in time.\n\nThe PCHA raids, while taking players from the NHA, also meant the demise of the OPHL and players from the OPHL signed with NHA clubs, including [[Louis Berlinguette]], [[Ernie Dubeau]], [[Jack Marks (ice hockey)|Jack Marks]] and [[George Prodger]].\n\nIn this season, the Ottawa Hockey Club became more commonly known as the 'Ottawa Senators'. The organization remained known as the Ottawa Hockey Association.\n\n===Highlights===\nRonan of Ottawa would score 5 goals against the Wanderers on February 9, and follow up with 8 against the Wanderers on February 14. [[Gordon Roberts (ice hockey)|Gordon Roberts]] of the Wanderers would score 6 against the Canadiens on February 21.\n\nOn January 24, [[Cyclone Taylor|Fred 'Cyclone' Taylor]] played for Ottawa against the Wanderers, despite his rights being held by the Wanderers, for which he refused to play for. Ottawa would win the game, but it was protested and ordered replayed if necessary. This was Taylor's final game in the NHA, as he would join Vancouver the next year.\n\nOn March 2, Quebec defeated Ottawa 6\u20135 in a game decided after 23 minutes of overtime. With seven seconds to play, [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]] scored to tie the game.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1912-02-04 |page=12 |title=Quebec Won at Ottawa}}</ref> [[Joe Hall]] scored the winning goal. Ottawa would now have to play the replay game against the Wanderers in Montreal. On March 6, Ottawa lost the replay, and the loss would cost them a tie of the league championship, as Quebec finished 10\u20138 and Ottawa would finish 9\u20139.\n\n===Final standings===\n{{1911\u201312 NHA standings|team=NHA}}\n\n==Post-season==\n\n===Stanley Cup challenges===\nAfter the season, Quebec played one challenge against Moncton Victorias. The Moncton team was essentially the same Galt team that had challenged Ottawa in 1911. This was the first series playing six to a side.\n\n====Moncton vs. Quebec====\n\n{| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0\n|+ March 11, 1912\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n!width=120|Moncton\n! 3\n!width=30| at\n!width==120| Quebec\n! 9\n|-\n|[[Billy Hague]]        ||   ||align=center| G  ||[[Paddy Moran (ice hockey)|Paddy Moran]]     || ||\n|-\n|Rastus Murphy       ||   ||align=center| P  ||[[George Prodger|Goldie Prodgers]]   ||   ||\n|-\n|Fred Povey        ||   ||align=center| CP ||[[Joe Hall]]       || 2 ||\n|-\n|[[Tommy Smith (ice hockey)|Tommy Smith]]  Capt.      || 2 ||align=center| F  ||[[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]] Capt.     || 3 ||\n|-\n|Rollie Norman       || 1 ||align=center| F  ||[[Eddie Oatman]]     ||   ||\n|-\n|[[Louis Berlinguette]] ||   ||align=center| F  ||[[Jack Patrick McDonald|Jack McDonald]]   || 4 ||\n|-\n|[[Fred Doherty]]      ||   ||align=center| sub  ||[[Jack Marks (ice hockey)|Jack Marks]]      ||   ||\n|-\n|colspan=5|Referees \u2013 J.

They were ordered by the Stanley Cup trustees to play off against Saskatoon in a two-game total-goals series to qualify. Port Arthur defeated Saskatoon 12\u20136.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe |title=Saskatoon Won the Game|page=12 |date=March 5, 1912}}</ref> The club chose not to play a series against Quebec.\n\nIn February 1912, prior to the end of the PCHA season, the PCHA issued a challenge to play against the NHA champions. However, their season ended in March and it was considered too late for the PCHA champions (in this case the New Westminster Royals) to travel to the east to face Quebec. The challenge was postponed until December 1912.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe |title=Coast Champions Not Coming |page=12 |date=March 5, 1912}}</ref> The challenge was never played.\n\n===Exhibitions===\n\nOn March 10, the Wanderers and Canadiens played for the Montreal city hockey championship.

After changing dates several times, the All-Star benefit game was set for March 16. The All-Star team would have [[Art Ross]], [[Ernie Russell]] and [[Gordon Roberts (ice hockey)|Gordon Roberts]] of the Wanderers; [[Paddy Moran (ice hockey)|Paddy Moran]], [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]] and [[Joe Hall]] of Quebec; [[Didier Pitre]] [[Jack Laviolette]] and Ernie Dubeau of the Canadiens.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1912-03-12 |page=12|title=Ridpath's Benefit Saturday}}</ref> Additionally, Cyclone Tayler had permission to play. However, two days before the event was to occur, the NHA president Emmett Quinn, while in New York city, booked the Wanderers and Canadiens for an exhibition game in Boston, and Ottawa was unable to make alternate arrangements, cancelling the NHA benefit.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1912-03-13 |page=12|title=Ridpath Benefit is Off}}</ref> The Ottawa New Edinburghs, champions of the amateur Inter-Provincial Amateur Hockey Union (IPAHU) held their own benefit for Ridpath on March 23 against other IPAHU players.

Four teams played 18 games each. The [[Quebec Bulldogs]] would win the league championship and take over the [[Stanley Cup]].\n\n==League business==\n\nTwo NHA franchises would be dormant this season. Because the O'Briens had decided to give up hockey, the [[Renfrew Millionaires|Renfrew Creamery Kings]] were disbanded prior to the season, with the players distributed to the other teams by a draw of names. Two new teams based in Toronto intended to operate this season, the 'Torontos' and the 'Tecumsehs', but the new [[Arena Gardens]] would not be ready for play this season, so neither team played. This left four teams to play 18 games each.\n\n===Renfrew dispersal===\n* [[Cyclone Taylor]], [[Don Smith (ice hockey b. 1887)|Don Smith]]\u2014Wanderers\n* [[Odie Cleghorn]]\u2014Quebec\n* [[Sprague Cleghorn]]\u2014Toronto\n* [[Bert Lindsay]]\u2014Tecumsehs\n* [[Skene Ronan]]\u2014Ottawa\n* [[Larry Gilmour]] \u2014Canadiens\n\n;Source<nowiki>:</nowiki>\n{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1911-11-13 |page=13|title=Tecumsehs admitted}}\n\nTaylor would refuse to report to the Wanderers, while Don Smith and Bert Lindsay would join the PCHA. Odie Cleghorn refused to report to Quebec and joined the Wanderers as did his brother Sprague.\n\n===Executive===\n* Emmett Quinn (president)\n\nBoard of Directors:\n* E. McCafferty, Quebec\n* Sam Lichtenhein, Wanderers,\n* George Kennedy, Canadiens\n* Charles Sparks, Ottawa\n* J. Jane, Toronto\n* Fred Robertson, Toronto\n\n===Rule changes===\nThe rule changes implemented for this season introduced the format of play seen today.\n\nFor this season, the number of players per side was reduced to six by the elimination of the [[rover (ice hockey)|rover]] position. This was opposed by several teams, including the champion Ottawa team whose 'puck possession' style of play was dependent on the rover. The team would attempt during this season and next to get the league to return to seven-man hockey.<ref>Chi-Kit Wong, p. 63</ref>\n\nThis season saw the introduction of ''major'' and ''minor'' fouls.\n\nMajor Fouls:\n* throwing a stick to prevent a goal\n* cross-checking\n* charging\n* deliberate tripping and hooking\n* foul language\n\nfor which the player would be banished for the match and fined $5. Teams could substitute the player.\n\nMinor Fouls:\n* kicking, throwing, holding or batting puck with the hand\n* raising stick above shoulder except for 'lifting'\n* loafing offside\n\nfor which the player drew a ''caution''. Three cautions and you were out. If your fines reached $25, special discipline might be warranted by the president.\n\nOther Rules:\n* number armbands to identify players<ref name=impressions>{{cite web|last=DeLaere|first=Matt|title=What's in a Number?|publisher=Impressions|date=17 August 2017|accessdate=2 March 2018|url=https://www.impressionsmagazine.com/digital-decorating/heat-transfer/whats-in-a-number/}}</ref>\n* home club to choose end\n* overtime in case of tie\n* unlimited substitution, however unless in case of injury, the player could not return\n\nThe [[O'Brien Trophy (ice hockey)|O'Brien Cup]] was introduced for the NHA league championship winners.\n\nThe Canadiens team was to sign only francophone players and the other teams would refrain from doing so.\n\n;Source<nowiki>:</nowiki>\nColeman, \"Trail of the Stanley Cup\"\n\n===Equipment changes===\nThe league would adopt the LeSueur goal and the Spalding puck as official equipment. This was the first season that numbers were attached to player jerseys. At first, they were attached by armbands, then eventually stitched onto the front of the jerseys. To identify the players to the fans, a large 'key' sign was hung at the side of the rink.<ref>Coleman, p. 223</ref>\n\n===NHA \u2013 PCHA relations===\n\nIn a foreshadowing of when the NHL in 1926 would declare the [[American Hockey League]] an \"outlaw league\", the NHA declared the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA) an \"outlaw league\" after it signed several NHA players. The league expelled [[Newsy Lalonde]], [[Ernest Johnson (ice hockey)|Ernie Johnson]] and other players who signed with the PCHA 'for life' and barred NHA teams from playing PCHA teams.<ref name=\"No NHA in 1913\">{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |title=No NHA in 1913? |page=12 |date=1912-03-15}}</ref> After the season, [[Art Ross]] arranged an 'all-star' tour of NHA players in [[British Columbia]] against the PCHA in defiance of the league.<ref name=\"No NHA in 1913\"/> The NHA granted immunity for the players to play against the PCHA.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1912-03-22 |title=The Unstable NHA? |page=12}}</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\n{{Emergence of the NHL}}\nPrior to the season, on November 2, [[Bruce Ridpath]] of the Stanley Cup champion [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Hockey Club]] would be seriously injured with a fractured skull after being hit by an automobile on Yonge Street in Toronto. He lived in Toronto and was rumoured to be a possible manager of the future Toronto NHA franchise.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1911-11-03 |title=Bruce Ridpath Badly Hurt |page=12}}</ref>\n\nFred Taylor went on public record stating that he would not play for Wanderers as he had a good position with the Interior Department in Ottawa, and would not play at all instead of playing for the Wanderers. Ottawa would attempt to secure his rights from Montreal. Ottawa would offer to trade Ronan (who would go on to win the scoring championship) for Taylor but was turned down.\n\nOn November 18, the NHA developed a schedule with a provisional opening date of the [[Mutual Street Arena|Arena Gardens]] late in January, and allowed the two new Toronto teams to play only away games at the start of the season. The architects of the Gardens assured them that the arena would be ready in time.\n\nThe PCHA raids, while taking players from the NHA, also meant the demise of the OPHL and players from the OPHL signed with NHA clubs, including [[Louis Berlinguette]], [[Ernie Dubeau]], [[Jack Marks (ice hockey)|Jack Marks]] and [[George Prodger]].\n\nIn this season, the Ottawa Hockey Club became more commonly known as the 'Ottawa Senators'. The organization remained known as the Ottawa Hockey Association.\n\n===Highlights===\nRonan of Ottawa would score 5 goals against the Wanderers on February 9, and follow up with 8 against the Wanderers on February 14. [[Gordon Roberts (ice hockey)|Gordon Roberts]] of the Wanderers would score 6 against the Canadiens on February 21.\n\nOn January 24, [[Cyclone Taylor|Fred 'Cyclone' Taylor]] played for Ottawa against the Wanderers, despite his rights being held by the Wanderers, for which he refused to play for. Ottawa would win the game, but it was protested and ordered replayed if necessary. This was Taylor's final game in the NHA, as he would join Vancouver the next year.\n\nOn March 2, Quebec defeated Ottawa 6\u20135 in a game decided after 23 minutes of overtime. With seven seconds to play, [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]] scored to tie the game.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1912-02-04 |page=12 |title=Quebec Won at Ottawa}}</ref> [[Joe Hall]] scored the winning goal. Ottawa would now have to play the replay game against the Wanderers in Montreal. On March 6, Ottawa lost the replay, and the loss would cost them a tie of the league championship, as Quebec finished 10\u20138 and Ottawa would finish 9\u20139.\n\n===Final standings===\n{{1911\u201312 NHA standings|team=NHA}}\n\n==Post-season==\n\n===Stanley Cup challenges===\nAfter the season, Quebec played one challenge against Moncton Victorias. The Moncton team was essentially the same Galt team that had challenged Ottawa in 1911.

They were ordered by the Stanley Cup trustees to play off against Saskatoon in a two-game total-goals series to qualify. Port Arthur defeated Saskatoon 12\u20136.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe |title=Saskatoon Won the Game|page=12 |date=March 5, 1912}}</ref> The club chose not to play a series against Quebec.\n\nIn February 1912, prior to the end of the PCHA season, the PCHA issued a challenge to play against the NHA champions. However, their season ended in March and it was considered too late for the PCHA champions (in this case the New Westminster Royals) to travel to the east to face Quebec. The challenge was postponed until December 1912.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe |title=Coast Champions Not Coming |page=12 |date=March 5, 1912}}</ref> The challenge was never played.\n\n===Exhibitions===\n\nOn March 10, the Wanderers and Canadiens played for the Montreal city hockey championship.

After changing dates several times, the All-Star benefit game was set for March 16. The All-Star team would have [[Art Ross]], [[Ernie Russell]] and [[Gordon Roberts (ice hockey)|Gordon Roberts]] of the Wanderers; [[Paddy Moran (ice hockey)|Paddy Moran]], [[Joe Malone (ice hockey)|Joe Malone]] and [[Joe Hall]] of Quebec; [[Didier Pitre]] [[Jack Laviolette]] and Ernie Dubeau of the Canadiens.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1912-03-12 |page=12|title=Ridpath's Benefit Saturday}}</ref> Additionally, Cyclone Tayler had permission to play. However, two days before the event was to occur, the NHA president Emmett Quinn, while in New York city, booked the Wanderers and Canadiens for an exhibition game in Boston, and Ottawa was unable to make alternate arrangements, cancelling the NHA benefit.<ref>{{Citation |newspaper=The Globe |date=1912-03-13 |page=12|title=Ridpath Benefit is Off}}</ref> The Ottawa New Edinburghs, champions of the amateur Inter-Provincial Amateur Hockey Union (IPAHU) held their own benefit for Ridpath on March 23 against other IPAHU players.
