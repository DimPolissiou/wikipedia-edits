It was their first appearance in English football's top division in 39 years. They have not been promoted automatically since finishing as [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] runners-up to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in [[1984\u201385 Blackpool F.C. season|1984\u201385]]. They have won a league title once, in [[1929\u201330 Blackpool F.C. season|1929\u201330]], which took them from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] to the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] for the first time.\n\nBetween 1987 and 2019, the club was owned by the Oyston family.

This team disbanded a few years later but some of its members are understood to have [[mergers and acquisitions|merged]] with old boys from St John's School to form a new club called Blackpool St John's. The two factions remained disunited, however, and on 26 July 1887, at a meeting in the Stanley Arms public house, the members resolved to wind up St John's and form a new club to represent the whole town. It was named Blackpool Football Club.\n\nThe new club managed to win two pieces of silverware in its first season in existence, [[1887\u201388 in English football|1887\u201388]]: the [[The Fylde|Fylde]] Cup and the [[Lancashire Junior Cup]].\n\nAt the conclusion of the following [[1888\u201389 in English football|1888\u201389]] season, Blackpool became founder members of the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]]. In their first season in the competition, the club finished fifth out of the 13 member clubs. They finished as runners-up over the following three seasons (to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] twice and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] once), before winning the championship themselves on their fourth attempt.\n\nBlackpool's home at that point in time was [[Raikes Hall]] (also known as the Royal Palace Gardens), which was part of a large entertainment complex that included a theatre and a boating lake, amongst other attractions. This meant that the club's average attendances were around the 2,000 mark, making the club's formative years a financial success.<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/>\n\nAfter struggling to repeat the success of the 1893\u201394 season, the Blackpool board decided it was time to leave local football behind, so on 13 May 1896 the club became a [[limited company]] and applied for entry to the [[The Football League|Football League]].\n\nTheir application was successful, and for the club's debut season, [[Blackpool F.C. season 1896-97|1896\u201397]], they joined the 16-team [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Blackpool's first-ever Football League game took place on 5 September 1896, at [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], which they lost 3\u20131 in front of around 1,500 spectators.<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/><ref name=\"gazette1240499\">{{cite news|url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/history?articleid=1240499|title=Early Days in the Football League|date=2 November 2005|work=[[Blackpool Gazette]]|accessdate=27 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111060513/http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/history?articleid=1240499|archivedate=11 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1897-98|1897\u201398]] campaign, the club played their home games at the [[Athletic Grounds (Blackpool)|Athletic Grounds]] (at the present-day [[Stanley Park, Blackpool|Stanley Park]]). They remained there for the first seven home games of [[Blackpool F.C. season 1898-99|1898\u201399]], before returning to Raikes Hall for the remaining 10.\n\nAfter finishing third-bottom, the club were not re-elected at the end of the 1898\u201399 season, and spent the [[1899-1900 in English football|1899\u20131900]] term back in the Lancashire League. They finished third, and after the Football League's annual meeting, on 25 May 1900, were permitted back into Division Two. It was during this season out of the League that Blackpool amalgamated with local rivals South Shore and moved to [[Bloomfield Road]].\n\n===Early 20th century (1900\u20131946)===\nDuring the 10 seasons that followed, Blackpool could finish no higher than 12th place. The club's top goalscorers in the league included [[Bob Birket]] (ten goals in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1900-01|1900\u201301]]), [[Geordie Anderson]] (12 goals in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1901-02|1901\u201302]]) and [[Bob Whittingham]] (13 in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1908-09|1908\u201309]]).\n\nAt the end of [[Blackpool F.C. season 1910-11|1910\u201311]], the club found themselves in seventh place, thanks largely to [[Joe Clennell]]'s haul of 18 goals.\n\nIt was a case of as-you-were, however, for the four seasons leading up to the [[First World War]], with finishing positions of 14th, 20th, 16th and 10th. For the last of those seasons, [[Joe Lane (footballer)|Joe Lane]] netted 28 goals.\n\nThe outbreak of war forced the cancellation of League football for four years, during which time regional competitions were introduced. When normality resumed, in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1919-20|1919\u201320]], Blackpool had appointed their first full-time manager in the form of [[Bill Norman (football manager)|Bill Norman]]. Norman guided the club to fourth-placed finishes in his first two league seasons in charge (he was installed as manager during the final inter-war season), with Lane again netting close to 30 goals in the former.\n\nThe club's form nosedived in the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1921-22|1921\u201322]] season, with a finishing position of 19th, before bouncing back to a fifth-placed finish the following campaign. [[Harry Bedford (footballer)|Harry Bedford]], who had joined the club from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], was the country's top league scorer, with 32 goals to his name.\n\nBedford repeated the feat the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1923-24|following season]], this time under the watchful eye of new manager [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Frank Buckley]], who replaced Bill Norman after his four years of service. Blackpool finished fourth in Buckley's first season in charge.\n\nThe [[Blackpool F.C. season 1924-25|1924\u201325]] season was not as successful; a 17th-placed finish tempered only slightly by the club's reaching the fourth round of the [[FA Cup]] for the first time. A single-goal defeat at fellow Lancastrians [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] ended ''the Seasiders''<nowiki>'</nowiki> run.\n\nBuckley guided Blackpool to top-10 finishes in his final two seasons as manager \u2013 with [[Billy Tremelling]]'s thirty goals in the latter helping considerably \u2013 before he left to take the helm at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].\n\nBuckley's replacement was [[Sydney Beaumont]], who took charge for the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1927-28|1927\u201328]] season, but he lasted only until the spring after the club finished in 19th position.\n\n[[Harry Evans (football manager)|Harry Evans]] was installed as the new Blackpool manager, in an honorary capacity, for the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1928-29|1928\u201329]] campaign. Due in no small part to [[Jimmy Hampson]]'s 40 goals, the club finished eighth. In his [[Blackpool F.C. season 1929-30|second season]], Evans guided Blackpool to the Division Two championship (their only championship to date), finishing ahead of promotion rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] by three and four points respectively.  Hampson had bagged 45 of the club's 98 league goals.\n\nBlackpool lasted only three seasons in the First Division. Two third-bottom finishes were followed by a last-placed finish, and the club returned to the Second Division.\n\nThe club's relegation prompted the Blackpool board to install a recognised manager, and they opted for [[Alex 'Sandy' MacFarlane|Sandy MacFarlane]]. MacFarlane occupied the [[Bloomfield Road]] hot seat for just two seasons, in which the club finished 11th and 4th. MacFarlane's final season, [[Blackpool F.C. season 1934-35|1934\u201335]], marked Jimmy Hampson's eighth successive (and final) season as Blackpool's top League goalscorer.\n\n[[Joe Smith (footballer, 1889\u20131971)|Joe Smith]] was appointed Blackpool's sixth manager in August 1935, a role in which he remained for the next 23 years.\n\nThe club finished tenth in Smith's first season, with [[Bobby Finan]] taking over from Hampson as top scorer, with 34 goals. It was Smith's second season in charge, however, that marked the starting point of the success to come. Blackpool finished the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1936-37|1936\u201337]] season as runners-up in the Second Division to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and were promoted back to the First Division.\n\nTwo seasons of Division One football were played before the [[Second World War]] intervened. Blackpool sat atop the table at the time the abandonment occurred.<ref name=\"rsssf1939\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1939-40.html |title=Season 1939\u201340 (Abandoned) |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] |accessdate=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328131102/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1939-40.html |archivedate=28 March 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> Regional competitions were implemented again between 1939 and 1945. For the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1945-46|1945\u201346]] season, after the war's conclusion, Blackpool spent one season in the [[Football League North and South|Football League North]].\n\n===Post-Second World War (1946\u20131967)===\n[[File:Voetbal Sparta tegen Blackpool met Stanley Matthews, Bestanddeelnr 908-8707.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Sparta Rotterdam]] vs. Blackpool, August 1957]]\nScottish defender [[Hughie Kelly|Hugh Kelly]] had arrived at Blackpool in 1943, as had fellow defender [[Tommy Garrett (footballer)|Tommy Garrett]] in 1942. [[Striker (association football)|Forward]] [[Stan Mortensen]] joined the club after the war in 1946. Mortensen went on to become Blackpool's top League goalscorer for the next nine seasons, sharing the honour with [[Allan Brown (footballer)|Allan Brown]] in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1952-53|1952\u201353]]. [[Stanley Matthews]], who became a regular source of goals for Mortensen, joined Blackpool in 1947, as did centre-forward [[Jackie Mudie]]. Goalkeeper [[George Farm]] signed in 1948, followed by outside-left [[Bill Perry (footballer)|Bill Perry]] in 1949. Kelly, Garrett, Matthews, Mudie, Farm and Perry would play with the club throughout the 1950s, the most successful decade in the club's history.\n\nPost-war Blackpool reached the [[FA Cup Final]] on three occasions, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in [[FA Cup Final 1948|1948]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] [[FA Cup Final 1951|three years later]], and winning it in [[FA Cup Final 1953|1953]], captained by [[Harry Johnston (footballer, born 1919)|Harry Johnston]].\n\nFor the first and only time in the club's history, four Blackpool players (Johnston, Matthews, Mortensen and debutant [[Ernie Taylor (footballer born 1925)|Ernie Taylor]]) represented [[England National Football Team|England]] in the infamous [[1953 England vs Hungary football match|6\u20133 defeat]] by [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] on 25 November 1953. Of the four, only Matthews would ever represent his country again.\n\nIn [[Blackpool F.C. season 1955-56|1955\u201356]], and now captained by Kelly, Blackpool attained their highest-ever finish in the Football League: runners-up to Manchester United, despite losing their final four league games. It was a feat that could not be matched or bettered over the following two seasons, with fourth and seventh-placed finishes, and Smith left Blackpool as the club's most successful and longest-serving manager.\n\nSmith was succeeded, in May 1958, by [[Ron Suart]], the first former ''Tangerine'' to return to the club as manager. In his first season, he led the club to eighth in the First Division and the sixth round of the [[FA Cup]]. A 23-year-old [[Ray Charnley]] topped the club's goalscoring chart with 20, in his first season as a professional, and went on to repeat the feat for seven of the eight seasons that followed.\n\nThe [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] came into existence in [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]]. Blackpool were knocked out in the second round, the round in which they entered. The club's First Division status came under threat, but they managed to avoid relegation by one point, at the expense of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Local arch-rivals [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] were the other club to make the drop.\n\nIn October 1961, Matthews, now aged 46, was sold back to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. Mid-table finishes in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1961-62|1961\u201362]] and [[Blackpool F.C. season 1962-63|1962\u201363]] (and an appearance in the League Cup semi-finals during the former) were offset by another lowly finish of 18th in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1963-64|1963\u201364]], with [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] top-scoring with thirteen goals. Much of the same ensued over the following two seasons, before relegation finally occurred in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1966-67|1966\u201367]]. Blackpool finished bottom of the table, eight points adrift of fellow demotion victims [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Suart had resigned four months before the end of the season. His replacement was another former Blackpool player, [[Stan Mortensen]].\n\n===Late 20th century (1967\u20132000)===\nMortensen picked up the pieces for the club's first season back in the Second Division in 30 years, guiding them to a [[Blackpool F.C. season 1967-68|third-placed finish]]. They had gone into the final game of the season at [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] knowing that a win would likely secure a return to the First Division. They won 3\u20131, but once the premature celebrations had ended, they discovered that their nearest rivals, [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], had scored a last-minute winner at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Q.P.R. were promoted by virtue of a better goal-average: 1.86, to Blackpool's 1.65.\n\nAt the end of the following [[Blackpool F.C. season 1968-69|1968\u201369]] campaign, the Blackpool board made the decision to sack Mortensen after just over two years in the job. Their decision was met by fans with shock and anger, as Mortensen was as popular a manager as he was a player.<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/>\n\n[[Les Shannon]], who spent the majority of his playing career with Blackpool's Lancashire rivals [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], was installed as manager for the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1969-70|1969\u201370]] season. In his first season, he succeeded where Mortensen had failed, by guiding the club back to the top flight as runners-up behind [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. Their promotion had been sealed after the penultimate game of the season, a 3\u20130 victory at rivals Preston North End, courtesy of a [[Fred Pickering]] [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]]. The result effectively relegated the hosts to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].\n\nAs quickly as Shannon had taken Blackpool up, he saw them return whence they came. The club finished at the foot of the table and were relegated back to Division Two, along with Burnley. Before the season's conclusion, Shannon was briefly replaced in a [[caretaker-manager]] capacity by [[Jimmy Meadows]], who in turn was permanently replaced by [[Bob Stokoe]]. On 12 June 1971, well over a month after the conclusion of the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1970-71|League season]], Blackpool won the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] with a 2\u20131 victory over [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] in the final. This was achieved without the services of [[Jimmy Armfield]], who retired in May after 17 years and 627 appearances for the club.\n\nBlackpool finished amongst the top 10 teams in the Second Division for six consecutive seasons, under three different managers: Stokoe, [[Harry Potts]] and [[Allan Brown (footballer)|Allan Brown]]. Twice Blackpool narrowly missed promotion to Division One, by two points in 1974 and one point in 1977.\n\nIn February 1978, midway through [[Blackpool F.C. season 1977-78|1977\u201378]], Brown's second season at the helm, Blackpool were seventh in the division. Having just beaten local rivals Blackburn Rovers 5\u20132, Brown was sacked by chairman Billy Cartmell for personal reasons. The team won only one more game that season, which ended with their relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] for the first time in their history.\n\nOn 1 April 1978, with six games to go, Blackpool were in eighth place, nine points off the third relegation slot. On 25 April, with one game to go, Blackpool were 14th, three points above Cardiff City in the third relegation slot. Four days later, Blackpool completed their programme and were 16th with 37 points \u2013 two points clear of Leyton Orient in the third relegation slot, with a vastly superior goal difference (\u22121, which was four better than fifth-placed Blackburn Rovers). At that point, all the teams below Blackpool still had games to play, apart from bottom placed Hull City. The bottom of the Division Two table read:\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n!bgcolor=silver| Position\n!bgcolor=silver| Team\n!bgcolor=silver| Played\n!bgcolor=silver| Points\n|-\n| 16 || Blackpool || 42 || 37\n|-\n| 17 || Charlton Athletic || 41 || 37\n|-\n| 18 || Millwall || 41 || 36\n|-\n| 19 || Cardiff City || 40 || 36\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n| 20 || Leyton Orient || 40 || 36\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n| 21 || Mansfield Town || 41 || 31\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n| 22 || Hull City || 42 || 28\n|}\n\nThe only other team in the division with games to play was Notts County, in fourteenth place with 38 points.\n\nAfter Millwall achieved safety by beating already-relegated Mansfield Town, the three remaining fixtures were Cardiff City v. Notts County, Leyton Orient v. Charlton Athletic, and Cardiff City v. Leyton Orient. Only one combination from the 27 possible outcomes of those three games would have resulted in all three teams getting more than 37 points and Blackpool being relegated. Inevitably, Cardiff City beat Notts County, Leyton Orient drew with Charlton and, in the final match, Leyton Orient, who up to that point had only won one away game all season, and had lost six out of their previous eight away games, with no wins, beat now-safe Cardiff City, who had lost only two home games all season and had won six out of their previous seven homes games, with no defeats.

Stokoe resigned during the summer.\n\n[[Stan Ternent]] became Blackpool's seventh manager in nine years, only to be replaced in February 1980 by [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]], the popular former Blackpool midfielder who left the club for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 14 years earlier. Ball himself only lasted a year in the job, and departed when the club were relegated to the League's [[Football League Fourth Division|basement division]].\n\nAllan Brown had taken over from Ball in February 1981, and he remained in charge for the following [[Blackpool F.C. season 1981-82|1981\u201382]] term. Blackpool finished twelfth in their first season in Division Four; however, unable to handle the pressure of the job,<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/> Brown resigned during the close season.\n\n[[Sam Ellis (footballer)|Sam Ellis]] took over from Brown in June 1982, three years after he finished his playing career with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. His first season saw Blackpool finish 21st, with [[Dave Bamber]] topping the club's goalscoring chart for the second consecutive season with ten strikes.\n\nIt was [[Blackpool F.C. season 1984-85|Ellis's third season]], however, that brought the success the club had been looking for. Blackpool finished second behind [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] and were back in Division Three.\n\nThe club managed to finish in the top half of the table for their first three seasons in the Third Division, but slipped to 19th in Ellis's seventh and final season in charge.\n\nOn 17 April 1986, the board of directors put the club on the market after councillors rejected plans to sell Bloomfield Road for a supermarket site in a \u00a335&nbsp;million redevelopment scheme.  The club was then sold to [[Owen Oyston]] for \u00a31.\n\nFor the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1989-90|1989\u201390]] season, Blackpool appointed [[Jimmy Mullen (footballer born 1952)|Jimmy Mullen]] as manager. Mullen's reign last only 11 months, however, and he left the club after their relegation back to Division Four.\n\n[[Graham Carr]] replaced Mullen, but his spell in the manager's seat was even shorter \u2013 just four months. He was sacked in November 1990 with Blackpool in 18th place.\n\nCarr's replacement was his assistant, [[Billy Ayre]]. Ayre guided the team to a fifth-placed finish and qualification for the [[Football League Play-Offs|play-offs]]. They lost only five of their 30 league games that remained at the time of Ayre's appointment. The run included 13 consecutive home league wins in an eventual 24\u2013game unbeaten run at [[Bloomfield Road]].<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/> The run was extended to 15 consecutive home wins at the start of the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991\u201392|1991\u201392]] campaign, which remains the club record.\n\nAfter beating [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in the two-legged semi-finals of the play-offs, Blackpool [[Blackpool F.C. season 1990-91#Final|lost]] to [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] final, on penalties after the score was tied 2\u20132 after regular and extra time.\n\nThe following [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991-92|1991\u201392]] season finished with Blackpool in fourth place, missing out on automatic promotion by one point, which meant another play-offs experience. This time they met [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991-92#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] and won 2\u20131 on aggregate. They returned to Wembley, where they faced Scunthorpe United [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991-92#Final|in the final]], the team they knocked out of the play-offs 12 months earlier. Again the score was tied at the end of regular and extra time, but Blackpool were victorious in the penalty shootout and booked their place in the new Division Two.\n\nBlackpool struggled in their first term back in the third tier of English football but pulled to safety in 18th place by the end. In late 1993 they were as high as fourth but tumbled down the table in the second half of that season to miss the drop by a whisker in 20th, avoiding relegation by virtue of a 4\u20131 victory over [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] on the final day of the season.<ref name=\"soccerbase219715\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=219715|title=Blackpool 4\u20131 Leyton Orient|publisher=[[Racing Post|Soccerbase]]|accessdate=27 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602053129/http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=219715|archive-date=2 June 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Ayre was sacked in the summer of 1994 and was replaced by [[Sam Allardyce]].\n\nAllardyce led Blackpool to a mid-table finish in his [[Blackpool F.C. season 1994-95|first season]] and saw the club knocked out of both cup competitions at the first hurdle.

In his [[Blackpool F.C. season 2000-01|first full season]] in charge, Blackpool were promoted to [[Football League Division Two|Division Two]] by winning the play-offs.

The latter was adopted to include the colours of the flag of [[Belgium]], a show of support for the large number of Belgian refugees that had arrived in the town. After the war, they wore white shirts and navy-blue shorts. The board introduced another change in 1934 when the team appeared in alternating dark- and light-blue stripes (which have been reintroduced several times in the mid-1990s and 2002, for Blackpool's return to the top flight in 2010 as the club's third kit, and as their away kit in [[2019\u201320 Blackpool F.C. season|2019\u201320]]), but they bowed to public pressure in 1939 and settled on tangerine.<ref name=\"Calley p.18\"/> Between 1938 and 1958 Blackpool's kit consisted of tangerine shirts, white shorts and navy blue socks.

This team disbanded a few years later but some of its members are understood to have [[mergers and acquisitions|merged]] with old boys from St John's School to form a new club called Blackpool St John's. The two factions remained disunited, however, and on 26 July 1887, at a meeting in the Stanley Arms public house, the members resolved to wind up St John's and form a new club to represent the whole town. It was named Blackpool Football Club.\n\nThe new club managed to win two pieces of silverware in its first season in existence, [[1887\u201388 in English football|1887\u201388]]: the [[The Fylde|Fylde]] Cup and the [[Lancashire Junior Cup]].\n\nAt the conclusion of the following [[1888\u201389 in English football|1888\u201389]] season, Blackpool became founder members of the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]]. In their first season in the competition, the club finished fifth out of the 13 member clubs. They finished as runners-up over the following three seasons (to [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] twice and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] once), before winning the championship themselves on their fourth attempt.\n\nBlackpool's home at that point in time was [[Raikes Hall]] (also known as the Royal Palace Gardens), which was part of a large entertainment complex that included a theatre and a boating lake, amongst other attractions. This meant that the club's average attendances were around the 2,000 mark, making the club's formative years a financial success.<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/>\n\nAfter struggling to repeat the success of the 1893\u201394 season, the Blackpool board decided it was time to leave local football behind, so on 13 May 1896 the club became a [[limited company]] and applied for entry to the [[The Football League|Football League]].\n\nTheir application was successful, and for the club's debut season, [[Blackpool F.C. season 1896-97|1896\u201397]], they joined the 16-team [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Blackpool's first-ever Football League game took place on 5 September 1896, at [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], which they lost 3\u20131 in front of around 1,500 spectators.<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/><ref name=\"gazette1240499\">{{cite news|url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/history?articleid=1240499|title=Early Days in the Football League|date=2 November 2005|work=[[Blackpool Gazette]]|accessdate=27 January 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111060513/http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/history?articleid=1240499|archivedate=11 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1897-98|1897\u201398]] campaign, the club played their home games at the [[Athletic Grounds (Blackpool)|Athletic Grounds]] (at the present-day [[Stanley Park, Blackpool|Stanley Park]]). They remained there for the first seven home games of [[Blackpool F.C. season 1898-99|1898\u201399]], before returning to Raikes Hall for the remaining 10.\n\nAfter finishing third-bottom, the club were not re-elected at the end of the 1898\u201399 season, and spent the [[1899-1900 in English football|1899\u20131900]] term back in the Lancashire League. They finished third, and after the Football League's annual meeting, on 25 May 1900, were permitted back into Division Two. It was during this season out of the League that Blackpool amalgamated with local rivals South Shore and moved to [[Bloomfield Road]].\n\n===Early 20th century (1900\u20131946)===\nDuring the 10 seasons that followed, Blackpool could finish no higher than 12th place. The club's top goalscorers in the league included [[Bob Birket]] (ten goals in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1900-01|1900\u201301]]), [[Geordie Anderson]] (12 goals in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1901-02|1901\u201302]]) and [[Bob Whittingham]] (13 in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1908-09|1908\u201309]]).\n\nAt the end of [[Blackpool F.C. season 1910-11|1910\u201311]], the club found themselves in seventh place, thanks largely to [[Joe Clennell]]'s haul of 18 goals.\n\nIt was a case of as-you-were, however, for the four seasons leading up to the [[First World War]], with finishing positions of 14th, 20th, 16th and 10th. For the last of those seasons, [[Joe Lane (footballer)|Joe Lane]] netted 28 goals.\n\nThe outbreak of war forced the cancellation of League football for four years, during which time regional competitions were introduced. When normality resumed, in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1919-20|1919\u201320]], Blackpool had appointed their first full-time manager in the form of [[Bill Norman (football manager)|Bill Norman]]. Norman guided the club to fourth-placed finishes in his first two league seasons in charge (he was installed as manager during the final inter-war season), with Lane again netting close to 30 goals in the former.\n\nThe club's form nosedived in the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1921-22|1921\u201322]] season, with a finishing position of 19th, before bouncing back to a fifth-placed finish the following campaign. [[Harry Bedford (footballer)|Harry Bedford]], who had joined the club from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], was the country's top league scorer, with 32 goals to his name.\n\nBedford repeated the feat the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1923-24|following season]], this time under the watchful eye of new manager [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Frank Buckley]], who replaced Bill Norman after his four years of service. Blackpool finished fourth in Buckley's first season in charge.\n\nThe [[Blackpool F.C. season 1924-25|1924\u201325]] season was not as successful; a 17th-placed finish tempered only slightly by the club's reaching the fourth round of the [[FA Cup]] for the first time. A single-goal defeat at fellow Lancastrians [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] ended ''the Seasiders''<nowiki>'</nowiki> run.\n\nBuckley guided Blackpool to top-10 finishes in his final two seasons as manager \u2013 with [[Billy Tremelling]]'s thirty goals in the latter helping considerably \u2013 before he left to take the helm at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].\n\nBuckley's replacement was [[Sydney Beaumont]], who took charge for the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1927-28|1927\u201328]] season, but he lasted only until the spring after the club finished in 19th position.\n\n[[Harry Evans (football manager)|Harry Evans]] was installed as the new Blackpool manager, in an honorary capacity, for the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1928-29|1928\u201329]] campaign. Due in no small part to [[Jimmy Hampson]]'s 40 goals, the club finished eighth. In his [[Blackpool F.C. season 1929-30|second season]], Evans guided Blackpool to the Division Two championship (their only championship to date), finishing ahead of promotion rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] by three and four points respectively.  Hampson had bagged 45 of the club's 98 league goals.\n\nBlackpool lasted only three seasons in the First Division. Two third-bottom finishes were followed by a last-placed finish, and the club returned to the Second Division.\n\nThe club's relegation prompted the Blackpool board to install a recognised manager, and they opted for [[Alex 'Sandy' MacFarlane|Sandy MacFarlane]]. MacFarlane occupied the [[Bloomfield Road]] hot seat for just two seasons, in which the club finished 11th and 4th. MacFarlane's final season, [[Blackpool F.C. season 1934-35|1934\u201335]], marked Jimmy Hampson's eighth successive (and final) season as Blackpool's top League goalscorer.\n\n[[Joe Smith (footballer, 1889\u20131971)|Joe Smith]] was appointed Blackpool's sixth manager in August 1935, a role in which he remained for the next 23 years.\n\nThe club finished tenth in Smith's first season, with [[Bobby Finan]] taking over from Hampson as top scorer, with 34 goals. It was Smith's second season in charge, however, that marked the starting point of the success to come. Blackpool finished the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1936-37|1936\u201337]] season as runners-up in the Second Division to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and were promoted back to the First Division.\n\nTwo seasons of Division One football were played before the [[Second World War]] intervened. Blackpool sat atop the table at the time the abandonment occurred.<ref name=\"rsssf1939\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1939-40.html |title=Season 1939\u201340 (Abandoned) |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] |accessdate=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328131102/http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1939-40.html |archivedate=28 March 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> Regional competitions were implemented again between 1939 and 1945. For the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1945-46|1945\u201346]] season, after the war's conclusion, Blackpool spent one season in the [[Football League North and South|Football League North]].\n\n===Post-Second World War (1946\u20131967)===\n[[File:Voetbal Sparta tegen Blackpool met Stanley Matthews, Bestanddeelnr 908-8707.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Sparta Rotterdam]] vs. Blackpool, August 1957]]\nScottish defender [[Hughie Kelly|Hugh Kelly]] had arrived at Blackpool in 1943, as had fellow defender [[Tommy Garrett (footballer)|Tommy Garrett]] in 1942. [[Striker (association football)|Forward]] [[Stan Mortensen]] joined the club after the war in 1946. Mortensen went on to become Blackpool's top League goalscorer for the next nine seasons, sharing the honour with [[Allan Brown (footballer)|Allan Brown]] in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1952-53|1952\u201353]]. [[Stanley Matthews]], who became a regular source of goals for Mortensen, joined Blackpool in 1947, as did centre-forward [[Jackie Mudie]]. Goalkeeper [[George Farm]] signed in 1948, followed by outside-left [[Bill Perry (footballer)|Bill Perry]] in 1949. Kelly, Garrett, Matthews, Mudie, Farm and Perry would play with the club throughout the 1950s, the most successful decade in the club's history.\n\nPost-war Blackpool reached the [[FA Cup Final]] on three occasions, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in [[FA Cup Final 1948|1948]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] [[FA Cup Final 1951|three years later]], and winning it in [[FA Cup Final 1953|1953]], captained by [[Harry Johnston (footballer, born 1919)|Harry Johnston]].\n\nFor the first and only time in the club's history, four Blackpool players (Johnston, Matthews, Mortensen and debutant [[Ernie Taylor (footballer born 1925)|Ernie Taylor]]) represented [[England National Football Team|England]] in the infamous [[1953 England vs Hungary football match|6\u20133 defeat]] by [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] on 25 November 1953. Of the four, only Matthews would ever represent his country again.\n\nIn [[Blackpool F.C. season 1955-56|1955\u201356]], and now captained by Kelly, Blackpool attained their highest-ever finish in the Football League: runners-up to Manchester United, despite losing their final four league games. It was a feat that could not be matched or bettered over the following two seasons, with fourth and seventh-placed finishes, and Smith left Blackpool as the club's most successful and longest-serving manager.\n\nSmith was succeeded, in May 1958, by [[Ron Suart]], the first former ''Tangerine'' to return to the club as manager. In his first season, he led the club to eighth in the First Division and the sixth round of the [[FA Cup]]. A 23-year-old [[Ray Charnley]] topped the club's goalscoring chart with 20, in his first season as a professional, and went on to repeat the feat for seven of the eight seasons that followed.\n\nThe [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] came into existence in [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]]. Blackpool were knocked out in the second round, the round in which they entered. The club's First Division status came under threat, but they managed to avoid relegation by one point, at the expense of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Local arch-rivals [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] were the other club to make the drop.\n\nIn October 1961, Matthews, now aged 46, was sold back to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. Mid-table finishes in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1961-62|1961\u201362]] and [[Blackpool F.C. season 1962-63|1962\u201363]] (and an appearance in the League Cup semi-finals during the former) were offset by another lowly finish of 18th in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1963-64|1963\u201364]], with [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] top-scoring with thirteen goals. Much of the same ensued over the following two seasons, before relegation finally occurred in [[Blackpool F.C. season 1966-67|1966\u201367]]. Blackpool finished bottom of the table, eight points adrift of fellow demotion victims [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Suart had resigned four months before the end of the season. His replacement was another former Blackpool player, [[Stan Mortensen]].\n\n===Late 20th century (1967\u20132000)===\nMortensen picked up the pieces for the club's first season back in the Second Division in 30 years, guiding them to a [[Blackpool F.C. season 1967-68|third-placed finish]]. They had gone into the final game of the season at [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] knowing that a win would likely secure a return to the First Division. They won 3\u20131, but once the premature celebrations had ended, they discovered that their nearest rivals, [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], had scored a last-minute winner at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Q.P.R. were promoted by virtue of a better goal-average: 1.86, to Blackpool's 1.65.\n\nAt the end of the following [[Blackpool F.C. season 1968-69|1968\u201369]] campaign, the Blackpool board made the decision to sack Mortensen after just over two years in the job. Their decision was met by fans with shock and anger, as Mortensen was as popular a manager as he was a player.<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/>\n\n[[Les Shannon]], who spent the majority of his playing career with Blackpool's Lancashire rivals [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], was installed as manager for the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1969-70|1969\u201370]] season. In his first season, he succeeded where Mortensen had failed, by guiding the club back to the top flight as runners-up behind [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. Their promotion had been sealed after the penultimate game of the season, a 3\u20130 victory at rivals Preston North End, courtesy of a [[Fred Pickering]] [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]]. The result effectively relegated the hosts to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].\n\nAs quickly as Shannon had taken Blackpool up, he saw them return whence they came. The club finished at the foot of the table and were relegated back to Division Two, along with Burnley. Before the season's conclusion, Shannon was briefly replaced in a [[caretaker-manager]] capacity by [[Jimmy Meadows]], who in turn was permanently replaced by [[Bob Stokoe]]. On 12 June 1971, well over a month after the conclusion of the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1970-71|League season]], Blackpool won the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]] with a 2\u20131 victory over [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] in the final. This was achieved without the services of [[Jimmy Armfield]], who retired in May after 17 years and 627 appearances for the club.\n\nBlackpool finished amongst the top 10 teams in the Second Division for six consecutive seasons, under three different managers: Stokoe, [[Harry Potts]] and [[Allan Brown (footballer)|Allan Brown]]. Twice Blackpool narrowly missed promotion to Division One, by two points in 1974 and one point in 1977.\n\nIn February 1978, midway through [[Blackpool F.C. season 1977-78|1977\u201378]], Brown's second season at the helm, Blackpool were seventh in the division. Having just beaten local rivals Blackburn Rovers 5\u20132, Brown was sacked by chairman Billy Cartmell for personal reasons. The team won only one more game that season, which ended with their relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] for the first time in their history.\n\nOn 1 April 1978, with six games to go, Blackpool were in eighth place, nine points off the third relegation slot. On 25 April, with one game to go, Blackpool were 14th, three points above Cardiff City in the third relegation slot. Four days later, Blackpool completed their programme and were 16th with 37 points \u2013 two points clear of Leyton Orient in the third relegation slot, with a vastly superior goal difference (\u22121, which was four better than fifth-placed Blackburn Rovers). At that point, all the teams below Blackpool still had games to play, apart from bottom placed Hull City. The bottom of the Division Two table read:\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n!bgcolor=silver| Position\n!bgcolor=silver| Team\n!bgcolor=silver| Played\n!bgcolor=silver| Points\n|-\n| 16 || Blackpool || 42 || 37\n|-\n| 17 || Charlton Athletic || 41 || 37\n|-\n| 18 || Millwall || 41 || 36\n|-\n| 19 || Cardiff City || 40 || 36\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n| 20 || Leyton Orient || 40 || 36\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n| 21 || Mansfield Town || 41 || 31\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n| 22 || Hull City || 42 || 28\n|}\n\nThe only other team in the division with games to play was Notts County, in fourteenth place with 38 points.\n\nAfter Millwall achieved safety by beating already-relegated Mansfield Town, the three remaining fixtures were Cardiff City v. Notts County, Leyton Orient v. Charlton Athletic, and Cardiff City v. Leyton Orient. Only one combination from the 27 possible outcomes of those three games would have resulted in all three teams getting more than 37 points and Blackpool being relegated. Inevitably, Cardiff City beat Notts County, Leyton Orient drew with Charlton and, in the final match, Leyton Orient, who up to that point had only won one away game all season, and had lost six out of their previous eight away games, with no wins, beat now-safe Cardiff City, who had lost only two home games all season and had won six out of their previous seven homes games, with no defeats. Blackpool were relegated with 37 points (the seven teams above them all having 38 ), and were not to return to the second tier for 29 years:\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n!bgcolor=silver| Position\n!bgcolor=silver| Team\n!bgcolor=silver| Played\n!bgcolor=silver| Points\n|-\n| 16 || Millwall || 42 || 38\n|-\n| 17 || Charlton Athletic || 42 || 38\n|-\n| 18 || Bristol Rovers || 42 || 38\n|-\n| 19 || Cardiff City || 42 || 38\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n| 20 || Blackpool || 42 || 37\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n| 21 || Mansfield Town || 42 || 31\n|-bgcolor=#eeeeee\n| 22 || Hull City || 42 || 28\n|}\n\nBob Stokoe returned for a second stint as manager for the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1978-79|1978\u201379]] campaign, at the end of which Blackpool finished mid-table. Stokoe resigned during the summer.\n\n[[Stan Ternent]] became Blackpool's seventh manager in nine years, only to be replaced in February 1980 by [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]], the popular former Blackpool midfielder who left the club for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 14 years earlier. Ball himself only lasted a year in the job, and departed when the club were relegated to the League's [[Football League Fourth Division|basement division]].\n\nAllan Brown had taken over from Ball in February 1981, and he remained in charge for the following [[Blackpool F.C. season 1981-82|1981\u201382]] term. Blackpool finished twelfth in their first season in Division Four; however, unable to handle the pressure of the job,<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/> Brown resigned during the close season.\n\n[[Sam Ellis (footballer)|Sam Ellis]] took over from Brown in June 1982, three years after he finished his playing career with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. His first season saw Blackpool finish 21st, with [[Dave Bamber]] topping the club's goalscoring chart for the second consecutive season with ten strikes.\n\nIt was [[Blackpool F.C. season 1984-85|Ellis's third season]], however, that brought the success the club had been looking for. Blackpool finished second behind [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] and were back in Division Three.\n\nThe club managed to finish in the top half of the table for their first three seasons in the Third Division, but slipped to 19th in Ellis's seventh and final season in charge.\n\nOn 17 April 1986, the board of directors put the club on the market after councillors rejected plans to sell Bloomfield Road for a supermarket site in a \u00a335&nbsp;million redevelopment scheme.  The club was then sold to [[Owen Oyston]] for \u00a31.\n\nFor the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1989-90|1989\u201390]] season, Blackpool appointed [[Jimmy Mullen (footballer born 1952)|Jimmy Mullen]] as manager. Mullen's reign last only 11 months, however, and he left the club after their relegation back to Division Four.\n\n[[Graham Carr]] replaced Mullen, but his spell in the manager's seat was even shorter \u2013 just four months. He was sacked in November 1990 with Blackpool in 18th place.\n\nCarr's replacement was his assistant, [[Billy Ayre]]. Ayre guided the team to a fifth-placed finish and qualification for the [[Football League Play-Offs|play-offs]]. They lost only five of their 30 league games that remained at the time of Ayre's appointment. The run included 13 consecutive home league wins in an eventual 24\u2013game unbeaten run at [[Bloomfield Road]].<ref name=\"Brown resigns\"/> The run was extended to 15 consecutive home wins at the start of the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991\u201392|1991\u201392]] campaign, which remains the club record.\n\nAfter beating [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in the two-legged semi-finals of the play-offs, Blackpool [[Blackpool F.C. season 1990-91#Final|lost]] to [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] final, on penalties after the score was tied 2\u20132 after regular and extra time.\n\nThe following [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991-92|1991\u201392]] season finished with Blackpool in fourth place, missing out on automatic promotion by one point, which meant another play-offs experience. This time they met [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991-92#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] and won 2\u20131 on aggregate. They returned to Wembley, where they faced Scunthorpe United [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991-92#Final|in the final]], the team they knocked out of the play-offs 12 months earlier. Again the score was tied at the end of regular and extra time, but Blackpool were victorious in the penalty shootout and booked their place in the new Division Two.\n\nBlackpool struggled in their first term back in the third tier of English football but pulled to safety in 18th place by the end. In late 1993 they were as high as fourth but tumbled down the table in the second half of that season to miss the drop by a whisker in 20th, avoiding relegation by virtue of a 4\u20131 victory over [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] on the final day of the season.<ref name=\"soccerbase219715\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=219715|title=Blackpool 4\u20131 Leyton Orient|publisher=[[Racing Post|Soccerbase]]|accessdate=27 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602053129/http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=219715|archive-date=2 June 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Ayre was sacked in the summer of 1994 and was replaced by [[Sam Allardyce]].\n\nAllardyce led Blackpool to a mid-table finish in his [[Blackpool F.C. season 1994-95|first season]] and saw the club knocked out of both cup competitions at the first hurdle. [[Tony Ellis]] was the club's top scorer with 17 league goals.\n\nThe [[Blackpool F.C. season 1995-96|1995\u201396]] season saw Blackpool finish third and claim a place in the play-offs for the third time in six seasons. In the semi-finals, Blackpool travelled to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and won 2\u20130. Three days later, they hosted the Yorkshiremen at Bloomfield Road and lost 3\u20130.

In his [[Blackpool F.C. season 2000-01|first full season]] in charge, Blackpool were promoted to [[Football League Division Two|Division Two]] by winning the play-offs. The [[Blackpool F.C. season 2001-02|following season]] the club received its then record outgoing transfer fee; \u00a31.75million from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for [[Brett Ormerod]], eclipsing the \u00a3600,000 [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] paid for [[Trevor Sinclair]] eight years earlier. They also gained the first of two [[Football League Trophy]] wins in 2002 as Blackpool beat [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] 4\u20131 at the [[Millennium Stadium]]. Their second win was in 2004, this time beating [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] 2\u20130 again in [[Cardiff]]. In the summer following the Trophy win, McMahon resigned, believing he could not take the club any further with the budget he was being offered.

response===\n''MacGyver'' has received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many comparing it poorly to the original and some praising and criticizing CBS for making it an updated show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky. The writing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the pilot script is full of silly plot short-cuts and painfully cheesy lines \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the new version of the character has very little appeal.... George Eads does what he can to bring a bit of energy to the MacGyver spy crew, but it\u2019s a futile effort. MacGyver may know a lot about chemistry, but this unmemorable team has none.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Maureen|title=TV Review: 'Lethal Weapon' and 'MacGyver'|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/lethal-weapon-macgyver-tv-review-damon-wayans-clayne-crawford-1201860866/|accessdate=September 24, 2016|website=[[Variety.com]]|date=September 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[USA Today]]'' wrote: \"If... you\u2019re looking for something approaching the original\u2019s simple DIY charms \u2014 or, for that matter, something even marginally original \u2014 look elsewhere.

Trained as an [[Bomb disposal|EOD technician]] for the Army, Mac prefers to use non-lethal means to stop his enemies; he is never without his trusty [[Swiss Army knife]] and uses anything in his environment to his advantage. At the end of Season 2, Mac leaves the Phoenix due to his lack of trust in its leadership, but eventually returns when he realises how much his skillset is needed.\n* [[George Eads]] as [[List of MacGyver characters#Jack Dalton|Jack Dalton]] (seasons 1\u20133): Mac's partner in the field and a former [[Delta Force]] operator. Jack's history with Mac goes back to his days in the Army and unlike Mac, he is not afraid to use guns in the field. He also has history with Riley, because he was once in a relationship with her mother and had an altercation with her deadbeat father. While mostly easy-going and laid-back, Jack can get serious when the situation calls for it and often calls upon his special operations training to help the team get out of a tight spot.

response===\n''MacGyver'' has received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many comparing it poorly to the original and some praising and criticizing CBS for making it an updated show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky. The writing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the pilot script is full of silly plot short-cuts and painfully cheesy lines \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the new version of the character has very little appeal.... George Eads does what he can to bring a bit of energy to the MacGyver spy crew, but it\u2019s a futile effort.

The new rakes are much cooler and airy than the old EMUs. The motors of the new rakes also make less noise than the older ones.

After acquiring the rake, CR conducted tests, safety, and mobility checks, and trial runs under the supervision of the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the rake in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the rake due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the rake to WR. The rake was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that rake would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could be rectified.\n\nThe First AC EMU was Flagged off on 25 December 2017. The first and only AC local train in Mumbai so far began operation in December 2017 and crossed the 10 lakh passenger mark within the first five months. The summer months of March and April saw over 3 lakh passengers take the AC local each month. The train, operated by Western Railway (WR), currently plies between Churchgate and Virar. It has a seating capacity of 1,028 seats and can carry 5,964 passengers. The monthly pass on the AC local train will cost between Rs570 to Rs820 (till Bandra) to Rs1,240 (till Andheri) to Rs1,640 (till Borivali), capping at Rs2,040 till Virar.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/65036621.cms| title=Nine more AC locals in Mumbai by next summer| first=Kamal| last=Mishra| date=18 July 2018| via=The Economic Times}}</ref> Seven new halts were introduced after commuters demand at Marine Lines, Charni Road, Grant Road, Dahisar, Mira Road.

Away from the [[South Mumbai]], one can see densities decreasing to yellow-orange \u2013 the neighbourhoods within the city limits and those beyond it are serviced by only one railway line. Frequency reduces drastically in remote suburbs beyond [[Kalyan Junction railway station|Kalyan]] (light yellow zone).]]\n\n{{Main|List of Mumbai Suburban Railway stations}}\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railway system is operated by [[Indian Railways]]' two zonal divisions [[Western Railways]] (WR) and [[Central Railways]] (CR). The fast [[commuter rail]] corridors on Central Railway as well as Western Railway are shared with long-distance and freight trains, while inner suburban services operate on exclusive parallel tracks. WR operates the Western Line and CR operates the Central Line, Harbour Line, Trans-Harbour Line as well as the Vasai Road-Bhiwandi-Diva-Panvel line.\n\n===Central Line===\n{{Main|Central Line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 78 Dadar station.jpg|right|thumb|A train at {{rws|Dadar Central}}]]\nThe Central Line in Mumbai consists of 3 major corridors, which bifurcate as they run into suburban satellite towns.\nTwo corridors (one local and other through) follow the Central Railway run from [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus]] (CSMT) to [[Kalyan, India|Kalyan]] (54&nbsp;km), from where it bifurcates into two lines \u2013 one to [[Kasara]] (65&nbsp;km) in the north-east and the other to [[Khopoli]] (61&nbsp;km) in the south-east. These two corridors constitute the 'main' Central Line. There is also an 18-km corridor between Kurla and Thane stations for use of outstation and cargo trains. The outstation corridor is being extended further from Thane to Kalyan now as a part of the main line, but is halted because of the costs of tunnelling the parsik hills.\n\nThe Central Line has two interchange stations with the Western Line at [[Parel]] and [[Dadar]] and the Harbour line at [[Masjid]], [[Sandhurst Road]] and [[Kurla]]. Rolling stock consists of a fleet of AC and Alternate Current new Bombardier and Siemens EMUs. The major car sheds on this line are at [[Kurla]] and [[Kalwa, Thane|Kalwa]]. There are fast and slow locals here for suburban service. Slow locals halt at every station, while fast locals halts vary between Byculla, Dadar, Kurla, Ghatkopar, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Mulund, Thane, Diva, Dombivali and Kalyan. All services plying beyond Kalyan run as slow service (halting at every station).\n\n===Western Line===\n{{Main|Western Line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 86 Grant Road station.jpg|right|thumb|A train at {{rws|Grant Road}}]]\nThe Western Line follows the Western Railway northwards from [[Churchgate railway station|Churchgate]] parallel to the west coast. Local services by [[electric multiple unit]]s (EMUs) ply between Churchgate and [[Dahanu Road|Dahanu]] (124&nbsp;km) on exclusive parallel tracks up to [[Virar]] (60&nbsp;km) while [[MEMU|Mainline Electrical Multiple Units]] (MEMUs) service the section beyond Virar to Dahanu Road (64&nbsp;km). On 16 April 2013 EMU has extended up to Dahanu Road. MEMUs also operate between Dahanu Road and [[Panvel railway station|Panvel]] via a branch line from [[Bhiwandi railway station|Bhiwandi road]]-[[Vasai Road]]. There are EMU carsheds at [[Mumbai Central]], [[Kandivali railway station|Kandivali]] and [[Virar railway station|Virar]]. The largest EMU car shed in Asia is located at Virar. A repair shop for EMUs is situated at [[Mahalaxmi railway station|Mahalaxmi]].\n\nWestern Railway's EMU fleet consists of EMUs completely powered by [[alternating current]] (25 kV) power. EMUs are 12 car or 15 car formations and are differentiated as slow and fast locals. Slow trains halt at all stations, while fast ones halt at important stations only and are preferable over longer distances.\n\n===Harbour Line===\n{{Main|Harbour Line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 59 Dockyard Road station.jpg|right|thumb|A train at {{rws|Dockyard Road}}]]\nThe Harbour Line is part of the Central Railway, and runs from [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus]] (CSTM) to [[Goregaon]] and [[Panvel]]. All Harbour Line services operate as slow services. The line operates from two separate platforms at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus]] (CSTM), and the tracks cross over the main line at Sandhurst Road, to head towards stations along Mumbai's eastern dock area. A branch line from [[Wadala Road]] joins the Western Line at Mahim and continues towards Goregaon.\n\nThe Harbour Line has an interchange station with the main line at Kurla, where it turns east towards Navi Mumbai. The Harbour Line further bifurcates at [[Vashi]] into two lines \u2013 one rejoins the main lines at Thane, while the other continues to Panvel. The shed for these trains is in Sanpada. A partial section of the Harbour Line is [[elevated railway|elevated]].\n\n===Trans-Harbour Line===\n{{Main|Trans-Harbour Line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\nThe Trans-Harbour Line connects Navi Mumbai to Thane. It runs from Thane to Vashi, Nerul and Panvel.\n\n===Nerul\u2013Uran Line===\n{{Main|Nerul\u2013Uran line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\nThe Nerul-Uran Line connects Navi Mumbai to Uran. It runs from Nerul and [[Seawoods\u2013Darave railway station|Seawoods Darave]] to [[Uran]].\n\n==Services==\n\nMumbai Suburban Railway services have trains with three main designations:\n* '''Slow''' trains: (denoted by an '''S''') stop at every station. These are intended for daily commuters.\n* '''Fast''' trains: (denoted by an '''F''') run express (skipping stops and going mainly to [[railway junction]]s) until a certain station, and from that station onward run like a slow train. These are intended for daily commuters as well as express connectivity to the rest of [[Indian Railways]] outbound trains.\n*'''Air Conditioned''' trains: (denoted by an '''AC''')\n\n===Travel classes===\n[[File:Mumbai India Train.JPG|thumb|The interior of MRVC Siemens Rakes]]\nThe suburban fleet consists of 12 and 15-coach rakes.\nThere are two main classes of travel; the First and Second classes. The first class fare is approximately 8 times more expensive than second class, and therefore tends to be less crowded during the non rush hours, though at times it is equally or more crowded than the general compartments during rush hour, due to most office employees having a first class transport pass provided by their employer. First class and Senior Citizen compartments also have cushioned seating, while the rest are typically plastic. There are following classes of travel:\n\n* '''Class I''' (''first class compartment''): Commonly known as ''gent's first class'' or simply ''first class'', since most commuters are men. Women and children can also board this compartment. The coach is designated by red and yellow slant stripes. The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes. The price is generally hiked up by eight times to prevent the compartment overcrowding. The seats in this class are leather made.\n* '''Class II''' (''general compartment''): Also called ''gent's second class'' or simply ''second class'' as the majority of passengers in these compartments are men. The compartment is open to women and children as well. The seats in this class are plastic-made.\n*'''Class I-L''' (''ladies first class''): similar to normal First Class, reserved solely for females, however male children up to the age of 13 can travel in this compartment. Men are not allowed to travel, and may face a penalty. Some of the coaches of ladies compartments are open to general public between 23:15 and 06:30. These are indicated by a note near the doors of the compartments. The coach is designated by red and yellow slant stripes. The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes. This compartment is often adjacent to the ladies general compartment.\n*'''Class II-L''' (''ladies' second class''): This compartment is reserved solely for females, however male children up to the age of 13 can travel in this compartment. Men are not allowed to travel and can face a penalty. Some of the coaches of ladies compartments are open to the general public between 23:15 and 06:30. These are indicated by a note near the doors of the compartments. The coach is designated by green and yellow slant stripes. The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes.\n*'''Divyangjan''' (''Handicap and Cancer patients' compartment''): for [[people with disabilities]] or [[cancer]]. On a platform, one can locate these by signs or by following a beeping sound indicator for the [[visually impaired]], or also by following a yellow tactile path with a walking stick. These coaches are open to all the genders. One needs a valid certificate of disability to board the compartment. Failure to do so may result in a penalty.\n*'''Senior citizens''': is reserved for passengers above the age of 60. These coaches are open to all the genders. One needs a valid age proof to board the compartment. Failure to do so may result in a penalty.\n*'''Luggage''': heavy goods and luggage can be transported using this compartment. These compartments are spacious and only have seats along the walls and are made to haul goods.\n\nThere are also [[women-only passenger car|women-only cars]] (termed ''ladies''),<ref name=\"lonely\">{{cite book| title=Lonely Planet: Goa & Mumbai| edition=6th| date=2012| publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]| page=68}}</ref> and since 1992, ''Ladies Special'' trains with the entire trainset reserved for women passengers. A semi ladies special is a train with a few (e.g., 3) coaches reserved for women. These designations can be combined with ''fast'', ''slow'', etc., with terms such as ''Slow Ladies Special''.\n\n===Air-Conditioning===\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railways are known for their open doors and windows. This is because there is no ventilation system on the trains, and the train relies on natural air ventilation. This was introduced as a cost-saving measure, as an Air-Conditioning system would be rendered useless during rush hour. Leaving the doors open also allows for a fast boarding process, as the trains stop for only 10 seconds, to combat overcrowding. In 2016, the Indian Railways manufactured first local train for journey (particularly for hot and humid summer season). This rake is manufactured at Integral Coach factory, Chennai. It has several new facilities, such as connected vestibules, cushioned seats and sliding doors. It runs from [[Virar]] to [[Churchgate railway station|Churchgate]], AC trains are fast locals and started their run at 1 January 2018.\n\n===Ticketing===\n[[File:AutomaticTicketVendingMachine.jpg|thumb|An Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM)]]\n\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railway uses a [[proof-of-payment]] fare collection system. Tickets can be purchased at every train station. Travelling without a valid ticket is an offence and if caught can result in a penalty. The penalty is steeper for passengers travelling in [[first class commuter travel|first class]] without a valid ticket.\n\nTickets can be bought for a single journey (one way) or a return journey. A return ticket is valid till the next day on weekdays and till Monday if purchased on a Friday. The ticket counters usually have long queues.\n\nTourist tickets are valid for one, three, or five days that can be purchased up to three days in advance.\n\nPlatform Tickets are required to be purchased by those members of the public not boarding trains, but who wish to access the platforms at all stations, perhaps for the purpose of receiving or seeing off a passenger and also to use footbridges. These cost {{INRConvert|10}}. A person can be penalised for non-possession of this ticket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/codesmanual/CommManual-I/ComercialManualCh3_data.htm |title=ADMISSION TO PLATFORMS AND CARRIAGE OF PASSENGERS |publisher=Indian Railways |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314075004/http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/codesmanual/CommManual-I/ComercialManualCh3_data.htm |archivedate=14 March 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Local-Train-Ticket.jpg|thumb|A 2017 Mumbai Suburban Railway ATVM ticket, from [[Virar railway station|Virar]] to [[Churchgate railway station|Churchgate]].]]\n[[File:Bombay Suburban Rail Ticket.jpg|thumb|A 1981 Bombay Suburban Railway ticket from [[Malad railway station|Malad]] to [[Vile Parle railway station|Vile Parle]].]]\n\n;CVMs and ATVMs\nTo save time, a Coupon Booklet can be purchased and the coupons can be punched for the designated fare at Coupon Validating Machines (CVMs) at every station. The ticket fares matrix is pasted above the CVM. As of October 2012, there are approximately 575 CVMs on Mumbai Suburban Railway stations. The Central Railway network has 350 and the Western Line has 225.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Coupons-with-bar-codes-for-train-travel/Article1-939047.aspx |title=Coupons with bar codes for train travel |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003151108/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Coupons-with-bar-codes-for-train-travel/Article1-939047.aspx |archivedate=3 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn early 2015, the authorities decided to discontinue CVMs w.e.f 1 April 2015. This decision was taken due to extensive duplication of the coupons, and the lack of transparency. The coupons were also lacking a way to trace them.\n\nThere are also '''Smart Cards''' available that can be topped up (recharged with some amount) and one can use it to print tickets for themselves from an '''[[Ticket machine|Automatic Ticket Vending Machine]]''' (ATVMs). A '''Season Ticket''' can be purchased if one is commuting regularly. One can choose the validity of these tickets from 1-month, 3 months to a year. Season Tickets are the most cost-effective and time-efficient option for regular commuters.\n\n;Mobile app\nThe ticket counters usually have long queues. In order to bring a solution to this problem, the UTSOnMobile app was launched by railways minister [[Suresh Prabhu]] at [[Dadar railway station|Dadar]] railway station in December 2014. This app was launched initially for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Windows Phone]], with the [[iOS]] version developed later.\n\nTo use this app, the user has to sign up with his/her mobile number. After signing up, the user has the option to load the prepaid RWallet built in the app, using credit/debit cards, net banking, [[Immediate Payment Service|IMPS]] or private mobile based apps. After the RWallet is loaded, the app can be used to book tickets on the entire network. Alternatively, the user may book tickets directly using credit/debit cards, net banking, IMPS, UPI, or various digital wallets such as PayTM, MobiKwik etc. for payments within the app without having to load the prepaid RWallet.\n\nInitially, the ticket booked on the app had to be printed from the ATVMs. This step was found tedious by the commuters and was criticised. Later, in July 2015, an update for the app was launched, which made e-tickets acceptable. The update also brought technical changes, like,  the tickets could be booked only within a radius of 30m to 5&nbsp;km of the origin station, and not from the platform. This move was well-received by commuters, which resulted in over 50,000 downloads on the launch day.\n\n===Security===\nThe [[Railway Protection Force]] (RPF) and the [[Government Railway Police]] (GRP) are responsible for the Security of the Mumbai Suburban Railway.\n\nThe RPF is a security force under the authority of the Indian [[Ministry of Railways (India)|Ministry of Railways]] established by the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nwr.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/1331705691014-RPF_Act1957.pdf| title=Cyclopedia of Railway Protection Force| author=Security Commissariat| publisher=Western Railway| website=Indian Railways}}</ref> has the power to search, arrest, investigate and prosecute, though the ultimate power rests in the hands of the GRP.<ref>{{cite news| author=Press Trust of India |title=MoS Railways dubs Railway Protection Force as 'toothless', demands more power for it |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/mos-railways-dubs-railway-protection-force-as-toothless-demands-more-power-for-it/articleshow/67560323.cms |accessdate=12 June 2019 |agency=economictimes.indiatimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe GRP is the main police force established by the ''[[Railways Act, 1989]]''.

This is because there is no ventilation system on the trains and the train relies on natural air ventilation. This was introduced as a cost-saving measure, as an Air-Conditioning system would be rendered useless during rush hour. Leaving the doors open also allows for a fast boarding process and turnaround time, as the trains stop for only 10 seconds, and are at most 5 minutes apart, to combat overcrowding. Passengers often end up hanging off the edge of the footboard, off door ledges and during rush hour can lose balance and fall to their death. Teenagers and adults also attempt to perform [[stunt]]s off the doorway and door ladders, thus risking their life. Windows also have a wired grill on them, to prevent theft and chain snatching. However, passengers frequently spit ''[[paan]]'' mava or Gutka while hanging off doors, and it ends up entering through the open window. There are also numerous records of tripping and falling down everyday while getting on and off the train, when the train is in motion, thus resulting in injury.\n\n===Overcrowding===\nDue to its extensive reach across the [[Mumbai metropolitan area|Mumbai Metropolitan Region]], and its intensive use by the local urban population, the Mumbai Suburban Railway suffers from the most severe overcrowding in the world.<ref name=\"rg\">{{cite web| title=Loan to relieve world's most overcrowded trains| url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/loan-to-relieve-worlds-most-overcrowded-trains.html| website=Railway Gazette| accessdate=2010-07-07| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909024802/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/loan-to-relieve-worlds-most-overcrowded-trains.html| archivedate=9 September 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Over 4,500 passengers are packed into a 12-car or 15-car rake during peak hours, as against the rated carrying capacity of around 2,000.<ref name=rg/> This has resulted in what is known as ''Super-Dense [[Crush load|Crush Load]]'' of 14 to 16 standing passengers per square metre of floor space.\n\n===Fatalities===\nOn average, about 2,000 people die annually on the Mumbai Suburban Rail network; between 2002 and 2012, more than 36,152 people died and 36,688 people were injured.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-20/mumbai/31373302_1_lifeline-poles-accidents | work=The Times of India | title=Mumbai's lifeline has claimed 36,000 lives in 10 years | date=20 April 2012}}</ref> A record 17 people died every weekday on the city's suburban railway network in 2008.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7031099.ece| title=India's rail authorities crack down on rooftop travel to stop deaths| first=Rhys| last=Blakely| date=18 February 2010| website=The Times| accessdate=20 May 2010| location=London}}</ref>  One of the reason for accidents and deaths is overcrowding (see above).

The old system of pulling a chain to halt the train was replaced by four intercoms per coach that enable commuters to communicate with the driver.<ref name=\"MM1\">{{cite web| title=WR local passengers, get ready for a cool commute| url=http://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/other/wr-local-passengers-get-ready-for-a-cool-commute/articleshow/58649890.cms| website=Mumbai Mirror| accessdate=13 May 2017| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512204925/http://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/other/wr-local-passengers-get-ready-for-a-cool-commute/articleshow/58649890.cms| archivedate=12 May 2017| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBoth CR and WR competed to acquire the rake, with WR even announcing a time table for operating the air-conditioned rake. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that the rake would be transferred to CR on 16 March 2016.<ref name=\"MM1\"/> However, at a height of 4.335 metres the rake exceeds the maximum clearance height of 4.270 metres for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, the rake cannot clear some of the low height British-era bridges between CST and Kurla.<ref>{{cite web| title=Western Railway handed over first AC local for trials, Diwali launch likely| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/wr-handed-over-first-ac-local-for-trials-diwali-launch-likely/articleshow/58651048.cms| website=The Times of India| accessdate=13 May 2017| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513082113/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/wr-handed-over-first-ac-local-for-trials-diwali-launch-likely/articleshow/58651048.cms| archivedate=13 May 2017| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate the rake on the Harbour Line. After acquiring the rake, CR conducted tests, safety, and mobility checks, and trial runs under the supervision of the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the rake in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the rake due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the rake to WR. The rake was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that rake would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could be rectified.\n\nThe First AC EMU was Flagged off on 25 December 2017. The first and only AC local train in Mumbai so far began operation in December 2017 and crossed the 10 lakh passenger mark within the first five months. The summer months of March and April saw over 3 lakh passengers take the AC local each month. The train, operated by Western Railway (WR), currently plies between Churchgate and Virar. It has a seating capacity of 1,028 seats and can carry 5,964 passengers. The monthly pass on the AC local train will cost between Rs570 to Rs820 (till Bandra) to Rs1,240 (till Andheri) to Rs1,640 (till Borivali), capping at Rs2,040 till Virar.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/65036621.cms| title=Nine more AC locals in Mumbai by next summer| first=Kamal| last=Mishra| date=18 July 2018| via=The Economic Times}}</ref> Seven new halts were introduced after commuters demand at Marine Lines, Charni Road, Grant Road, Dahisar, Mira Road.

Away from the [[South Mumbai]], one can see densities decreasing to yellow-orange \u2013 the neighbourhoods within the city limits and those beyond it are serviced by only one railway line. Frequency reduces drastically in remote suburbs beyond [[Kalyan Junction railway station|Kalyan]] (light yellow zone).]]\n\n{{Main|List of Mumbai Suburban Railway stations}}\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railway system is operated by [[Indian Railways]]' two zonal divisions [[Western Railways]] (WR) and [[Central Railways]] (CR). The fast [[commuter rail]] corridors on Central Railway as well as Western Railway are shared with long-distance and freight trains, while inner suburban services operate on exclusive parallel tracks. WR operates the Western Line and CR operates the Central Line, Harbour Line, Trans-Harbour Line as well as the Vasai Road-Bhiwandi-Diva-Panvel line.\n\n===Central Line===\n{{Main|Central Line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 78 Dadar station.jpg|right|thumb|A train at {{rws|Dadar Central}}]]\nThe Central Line in Mumbai consists of 3 major corridors, which bifurcate as they run into suburban satellite towns.\nTwo corridors (one local and other through) follow the Central Railway run from [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus]] (CSMT) to [[Kalyan, India|Kalyan]] (54&nbsp;km), from where it bifurcates into two lines \u2013 one to [[Kasara]] (65&nbsp;km) in the north-east and the other to [[Khopoli]] (61&nbsp;km) in the south-east. These two corridors constitute the 'main' Central Line. There is also an 18-km corridor between Kurla and Thane stations for use of outstation and cargo trains. The outstation corridor is being extended further from Thane to Kalyan now as a part of the main line, but is halted because of the costs of tunnelling the parsik hills.\n\nThe Central Line has two interchange stations with the Western Line at [[Parel]] and [[Dadar]] and the Harbour line at [[Masjid]], [[Sandhurst Road]] and [[Kurla]]. Rolling stock consists of a fleet of AC and Alternate Current new Bombardier and Siemens EMUs. The major car sheds on this line are at [[Kurla]] and [[Kalwa, Thane|Kalwa]]. There are fast and slow locals here for suburban service. Slow locals halt at every station, while fast locals halts vary between Byculla, Dadar, Kurla, Ghatkopar, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Mulund, Thane, Diva, Dombivali and Kalyan. All services plying beyond Kalyan run as slow service (halting at every station).\n\n===Western Line===\n{{Main|Western Line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 86 Grant Road station.jpg|right|thumb|A train at {{rws|Grant Road}}]]\nThe Western Line follows the Western Railway northwards from [[Churchgate railway station|Churchgate]] parallel to the west coast. Local services by [[electric multiple unit]]s (EMUs) ply between Churchgate and [[Dahanu Road|Dahanu]] (124&nbsp;km) on exclusive parallel tracks up to [[Virar]] (60&nbsp;km) while [[MEMU|Mainline Electrical Multiple Units]] (MEMUs) service the section beyond Virar to Dahanu Road (64&nbsp;km). On 16 April 2013 EMU has extended up to Dahanu Road. MEMUs also operate between Dahanu Road and [[Panvel railway station|Panvel]] via a branch line from [[Bhiwandi railway station|Bhiwandi road]]-[[Vasai Road]]. There are EMU carsheds at [[Mumbai Central]], [[Kandivali railway station|Kandivali]] and [[Virar railway station|Virar]]. The largest EMU car shed in Asia is located at Virar. A repair shop for EMUs is situated at [[Mahalaxmi railway station|Mahalaxmi]].\n\nWestern Railway's EMU fleet consists of EMUs completely powered by [[alternating current]] (25 kV) power. EMUs are 12 car or 15 car formations and are differentiated as slow and fast locals. Slow trains halt at all stations, while fast ones halt at important stations only and are preferable over longer distances.\n\n===Harbour Line===\n{{Main|Harbour Line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\n[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 59 Dockyard Road station.jpg|right|thumb|A train at {{rws|Dockyard Road}}]]\nThe Harbour Line is part of the Central Railway, and runs from [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus]] (CSTM) to [[Goregaon]] and [[Panvel]]. All Harbour Line services operate as slow services. The line operates from two separate platforms at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus]] (CSTM), and the tracks cross over the main line at Sandhurst Road, to head towards stations along Mumbai's eastern dock area. A branch line from [[Wadala Road]] joins the Western Line at Mahim and continues towards Goregaon.\n\nThe Harbour Line has an interchange station with the main line at Kurla, where it turns east towards Navi Mumbai. The Harbour Line further bifurcates at [[Vashi]] into two lines \u2013 one rejoins the main lines at Thane, while the other continues to Panvel. The shed for these trains is in Sanpada. A partial section of the Harbour Line is [[elevated railway|elevated]].\n\n===Trans-Harbour Line===\n{{Main|Trans-Harbour Line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\nThe Trans-Harbour Line connects Navi Mumbai to Thane. It runs from Thane to Vashi, Nerul and Panvel.\n\n===Nerul\u2013Uran Line===\n{{Main|Nerul\u2013Uran line (Mumbai Suburban Railway)}}\nThe Nerul-Uran Line connects Navi Mumbai to Uran. It runs from Nerul and [[Seawoods\u2013Darave railway station|Seawoods Darave]] to [[Uran]].\n\n==Services==\n\nMumbai Suburban Railway services have trains with three main designations:\n* '''Slow''' trains: (denoted by an '''S''') stop at every station. These are intended for daily commuters.\n* '''Fast''' trains: (denoted by an '''F''') run express (skipping stops and going mainly to [[railway junction]]s) until a certain station, and from that station onward run like a slow train. These are intended for daily commuters as well as express connectivity to the rest of [[Indian Railways]] outbound trains.\n*'''Air Conditioned''' trains: (denoted by an '''AC''')\n\n===Travel classes===\n[[File:Mumbai India Train.JPG|thumb|The interior of MRVC Siemens Rakes]]\nThe suburban fleet consists of 12 and 15-coach rakes.\nThere are two main classes of travel; the First and Second classes. The first class fare is approximately 8 times more expensive than second class, and therefore tends to be less crowded during the non rush hours, though at times it is equally or more crowded than the general compartments during rush hour, due to most office employees having a first class transport pass provided by their employer. First class and Senior Citizen compartments also have cushioned seating, while the rest are typically plastic. There are following classes of travel:\n\n* '''Class I''' (''first class compartment''): Commonly known as ''gent's first class'' or simply ''first class'', since most commuters are men. Women and children can also board this compartment. The coach is designated by red and yellow slant stripes. The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes. The price is generally hiked up by eight times to prevent the compartment overcrowding. The seats in this class are leather made.\n* '''Class II''' (''general compartment''): Also called ''gent's second class'' or simply ''second class'' as the majority of passengers in these compartments are men. The compartment is open to women and children as well. The seats in this class are plastic-made.\n*'''Class I-L''' (''ladies first class''): similar to normal First Class, reserved solely for females, however male children up to the age of 13 can travel in this compartment. Men are not allowed to travel, and may face a penalty. Some of the coaches of ladies compartments are open to general public between 23:15 and 06:30. These are indicated by a note near the doors of the compartments. The coach is designated by red and yellow slant stripes. The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes. This compartment is often adjacent to the ladies general compartment.\n*'''Class II-L''' (''ladies' second class''): This compartment is reserved solely for females, however male children up to the age of 13 can travel in this compartment. Men are not allowed to travel and can face a penalty. Some of the coaches of ladies compartments are open to the general public between 23:15 and 06:30. These are indicated by a note near the doors of the compartments. The coach is designated by green and yellow slant stripes. The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes.\n*'''Divyangjan''' (''Handicap and Cancer patients' compartment''): for [[people with disabilities]] or [[cancer]]. On a platform, one can locate these by signs or by following a beeping sound indicator for the [[visually impaired]], or also by following a yellow tactile path with a walking stick. These coaches are open to all the genders. One needs a valid certificate of disability to board the compartment. Failure to do so may result in a penalty.\n*'''Senior citizens''': is reserved for passengers above the age of 60. These coaches are open to all the genders. One needs a valid age proof to board the compartment. Failure to do so may result in a penalty.\n*'''Luggage''': heavy goods and luggage can be transported using this compartment. These compartments are spacious and only have seats along the walls and are made to haul goods.\n\nThere are also [[women-only passenger car|women-only cars]] (termed ''ladies''),<ref name=\"lonely\">{{cite book| title=Lonely Planet: Goa & Mumbai| edition=6th| date=2012| publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]| page=68}}</ref> and since 1992, ''Ladies Special'' trains with the entire trainset reserved for women passengers. A semi ladies special is a train with a few (e.g., 3) coaches reserved for women. These designations can be combined with ''fast'', ''slow'', etc., with terms such as ''Slow Ladies Special''.\n\n===Air-Conditioning===\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railways are known for their open doors and windows. This is because there is no ventilation system on the trains, and the train relies on natural air ventilation. This was introduced as a cost-saving measure, as an Air-Conditioning system would be rendered useless during rush hour. Leaving the doors open also allows for a fast boarding process, as the trains stop for only 10 seconds, to combat overcrowding. In 2016, the Indian Railways manufactured first local train for journey (particularly for hot and humid summer season). This rake is manufactured at Integral Coach factory, Chennai. It has several new facilities, such as connected vestibules, cushioned seats and sliding doors. It runs from [[Virar]] to [[Churchgate railway station|Churchgate]], AC trains are fast locals and started their run at 1 January 2018.\n\n===Ticketing===\n[[File:AutomaticTicketVendingMachine.jpg|thumb|An Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM)]]\n\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railway uses a [[proof-of-payment]] fare collection system. Tickets can be purchased at every train station. Travelling without a valid ticket is an offence and if caught can result in a penalty. The penalty is steeper for passengers travelling in [[first class commuter travel|first class]] without a valid ticket.\n\nTickets can be bought for a single journey (one way) or a return journey. A return ticket is valid till the next day on weekdays and till Monday if purchased on a Friday. The ticket counters usually have long queues.\n\nTourist tickets are valid for one, three, or five days that can be purchased up to three days in advance.\n\nPlatform Tickets are required to be purchased by those members of the public not boarding trains, but who wish to access the platforms at all stations, perhaps for the purpose of receiving or seeing off a passenger and also to use footbridges. These cost {{INRConvert|10}}. A person can be penalised for non-possession of this ticket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/codesmanual/CommManual-I/ComercialManualCh3_data.htm |title=ADMISSION TO PLATFORMS AND CARRIAGE OF PASSENGERS |publisher=Indian Railways |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314075004/http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/codesmanual/CommManual-I/ComercialManualCh3_data.htm |archivedate=14 March 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Local-Train-Ticket.jpg|thumb|A 2017 Mumbai Suburban Railway ATVM ticket, from [[Virar railway station|Virar]] to [[Churchgate railway station|Churchgate]].]]\n[[File:Bombay Suburban Rail Ticket.jpg|thumb|A 1981 Bombay Suburban Railway ticket from [[Malad railway station|Malad]] to [[Vile Parle railway station|Vile Parle]].]]\n\n;CVMs and ATVMs\nTo save time, a Coupon Booklet can be purchased and the coupons can be punched for the designated fare at Coupon Validating Machines (CVMs) at every station. The ticket fares matrix is pasted above the CVM. As of October 2012, there are approximately 575 CVMs on Mumbai Suburban Railway stations. The Central Railway network has 350 and the Western Line has 225.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Coupons-with-bar-codes-for-train-travel/Article1-939047.aspx |title=Coupons with bar codes for train travel |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003151108/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Coupons-with-bar-codes-for-train-travel/Article1-939047.aspx |archivedate=3 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn early 2015, the authorities decided to discontinue CVMs w.e.f 1 April 2015. This decision was taken due to extensive duplication of the coupons, and the lack of transparency. The coupons were also lacking a way to trace them.\n\nThere are also '''Smart Cards''' available that can be topped up (recharged with some amount) and one can use it to print tickets for themselves from an '''[[Ticket machine|Automatic Ticket Vending Machine]]''' (ATVMs). A '''Season Ticket''' can be purchased if one is commuting regularly. One can choose the validity of these tickets from 1-month, 3 months to a year. Season Tickets are the most cost-effective and time-efficient option for regular commuters.\n\n;Mobile app\nThe ticket counters usually have long queues. In order to bring a solution to this problem, the UTSOnMobile app was launched by railways minister [[Suresh Prabhu]] at [[Dadar railway station|Dadar]] railway station in December 2014. This app was launched initially for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Windows Phone]], with the [[iOS]] version developed later.\n\nTo use this app, the user has to sign up with his/her mobile number. After signing up, the user has the option to load the prepaid RWallet built in the app, using credit/debit cards, net banking, [[Immediate Payment Service|IMPS]] or private mobile based apps. After the RWallet is loaded, the app can be used to book tickets on the entire network. Alternatively, the user may book tickets directly using credit/debit cards, net banking, IMPS, UPI, or various digital wallets such as PayTM, MobiKwik etc. for payments within the app without having to load the prepaid RWallet.\n\nInitially, the ticket booked on the app had to be printed from the ATVMs. This step was found tedious by the commuters and was criticised. Later, in July 2015, an update for the app was launched, which made e-tickets acceptable. The update also brought technical changes, like,  the tickets could be booked only within a radius of 30m to 5&nbsp;km of the origin station, and not from the platform. This move was well-received by commuters, which resulted in over 50,000 downloads on the launch day.\n\n===Security===\nThe [[Railway Protection Force]] (RPF) and the [[Government Railway Police]] (GRP) are responsible for the Security of the Mumbai Suburban Railway.\n\nThe RPF is a security force under the authority of the Indian [[Ministry of Railways (India)|Ministry of Railways]] established by the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nwr.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/1331705691014-RPF_Act1957.pdf| title=Cyclopedia of Railway Protection Force| author=Security Commissariat| publisher=Western Railway| website=Indian Railways}}</ref> has the power to search, arrest, investigate and prosecute, though the ultimate power rests in the hands of the GRP.<ref>{{cite news| author=Press Trust of India |title=MoS Railways dubs Railway Protection Force as 'toothless', demands more power for it |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/mos-railways-dubs-railway-protection-force-as-toothless-demands-more-power-for-it/articleshow/67560323.cms |accessdate=12 June 2019 |agency=economictimes.indiatimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe GRP is the main police force established by the ''[[Railways Act, 1989]]''.

This is because there is no ventilation system on the trains and the train relies on natural air ventilation. This was introduced as a cost-saving measure, as an Air-Conditioning system would be rendered useless during rush hour. Leaving the doors open also allows for a fast boarding process and turnaround time, as the trains stop for only 10 seconds, and are at most 5 minutes apart, to combat overcrowding. Passengers often end up hanging off the edge of the footboard, off door ledges and during rush hour can lose balance and fall to their death. Teenagers and adults also attempt to perform [[stunt]]s off the doorway and door ladders, thus risking their life. Windows also have a wired grill on them, to prevent theft and chain snatching. However, passengers frequently spit ''[[paan]]'' mava or Gutka while hanging off doors, and it ends up entering through the open window. There are also numerous records of tripping and falling down everyday while getting on and off the train, when the train is in motion, thus resulting in injury.\n\n===Overcrowding===\nDue to its extensive reach across the [[Mumbai metropolitan area|Mumbai Metropolitan Region]], and its intensive use by the local urban population, the Mumbai Suburban Railway suffers from the most severe overcrowding in the world.<ref name=\"rg\">{{cite web| title=Loan to relieve world's most overcrowded trains| url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/loan-to-relieve-worlds-most-overcrowded-trains.html| website=Railway Gazette| accessdate=2010-07-07| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909024802/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/urban/single-view/view/loan-to-relieve-worlds-most-overcrowded-trains.html| archivedate=9 September 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Over 4,500 passengers are packed into a 12-car or 15-car rake during peak hours, as against the rated carrying capacity of around 2,000.<ref name=rg/> This has resulted in what is known as ''Super-Dense [[Crush load|Crush Load]]'' of 14 to 16 standing passengers per square metre of floor space.\n\n===Fatalities===\nOn average, about 2,000 people die annually on the Mumbai Suburban Rail network; between 2002 and 2012, more than 36,152 people died and 36,688 people were injured.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-20/mumbai/31373302_1_lifeline-poles-accidents | work=The Times of India | title=Mumbai's lifeline has claimed 36,000 lives in 10 years | date=20 April 2012}}</ref> A record 17 people died every weekday on the city's suburban railway network in 2008.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7031099.ece| title=India's rail authorities crack down on rooftop travel to stop deaths| first=Rhys| last=Blakely| date=18 February 2010| website=The Times| accessdate=20 May 2010| location=London}}</ref>  One of the reason for accidents and deaths is overcrowding (see above).

He went to the [[Gulf of Urab\u00e1]], and accompanied [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] in his crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], where they became the first Europeans to reach the [[Pacific Ocean]]. He served as mayor of the newly founded [[Panama City]] for a few years, and undertook two failed expeditions to Peru. In 1528, Pizarro obtained permission from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles V]] and went on his third expedition to Peru.\n\nWhen local people who lived along the coast resisted this invasion, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, [[San Miguel de Piura]]. After a series of maneuvres, Pizarro captured the Incan emperor [[Atahualpa]] at the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] in November 1532. A ransom for the emperor's release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed him in July 1533. The same year, Pizarro entered the Inca capital of [[Cuzco]] and completed his conquest of Peru. In January 1535, Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima, Peru|Lima]], a project he considered his greatest achievement.\n\nQuarrels between Pizarro and his longtime comrade-in-arms [[Diego Almagro]] culminated in the [[Battle of Las Salinas]], after which Almagro was executed. In June 1541, a party led by Almagro's son assassinated Pizarro in Lima. He was laid to rest in the [[Lima Cathedral]]. \n\n== Early life ==\nFrancisco Pizarro was born in [[Trujillo, C\u00e1ceres]], [[Spain]] (then in the [[Crown of Castile]]) in modern-day [[Extremadura]], Spain. He was the illegitimate son of infantry colonel Gonzalo Pizarro (1446\u20131522) and Francisca Gonz\u00e1lez, a woman of poor means. His date of birth is uncertain, but it is believed to be sometime in the 1470s, probably 1475. Little attention was paid to his education and he grew up illiterate.<ref name=\"CE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12140a.htm |title=Francisco Pizarro |work=The Catholic Encyclopedia |accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis father was a [[colonel]] of [[infantry]] who served in [[Navarre]] and in the [[Italian Wars|Italian campaigns]] under [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba|C\u00f3rdoba]].

The native South Americans he encountered told him about a gold-rich territory called Vir\u00fa, which was on a river called Pir\u00fa (later corrupted to Per\u00fa).<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|24}} These reports were relayed by the Spanish-Inca ''[[mestizo]]'' writer [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso de la Vega]] in ''Comentarios Reales de los Incas'' (1609).\n\nAndagoya eventually established contact with several Native American ''curacas'' (chiefs), some of whom he later claimed were sorcerers and witches. Having reached as far as the San Juan River (part of the present boundary between [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]]) Andagoya fell ill and returned to Panama. He spread the news and stories about \"Pir\u00fa\" \u2013 a great land to the south rich with gold (the legendary [[El Dorado]]). These revelations, along with the accounts for Cort\u00e9s' success in [[Mexico]], caught the attention of Pizarro, prompting a series of expeditions to the south.\n\nIn 1524, while still in Panama, Pizarro formed a partnership with a priest, [[Hernando de Luque]] and a soldier, [[Diego de Almagro]], to explore and conquer the South. Pizarro, Almagro and Luque later explicitly renewed their compact,<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|24}} agreeing to conquer and divide equally among themselves the empire they hoped to vanquish. While their accord was strictly oral, they dubbed their enterprise the ''Empresa del Levante'' and determined that Pizarro would command the expedition, Almagro would provide military and food supplies and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|95}}\n\n===First expedition (1524)===\nIn November 1524, the first of three expeditions left Panama for the conquest of Peru with about 80 men and 40 horses.<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|24}} Juan de Salcedo was the standard bearer, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ribera]] was the treasurer and Juan Carvallo was the inspector.<ref name=Leon>Leon, P.

The Governor of Panama, [[Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila]], at first approved in principle of exploring South America. Pizarro's first expedition, however, turned out to be a failure as his ''conquistadores'', sailing down the Pacific coast, reached no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, lack of food and skirmishes with hostile natives, one of which caused Almagro to lose an eye by arrow-shot. The place names the Spanish bestowed along their route, including ''Puerto Deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del Hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Punta Quemado'' or ''Puebla Quemado'' (burned port), confirmed their difficulties. Fearing subsequent hostile encounters like the one the expedition endured at the [[Battle of Punta Quemada]], Pizarro ended his first expedition and returned to Panama.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|94\u2013102}}\n\n===Second expedition (1526)===\nTwo years later Pizarro, Almagro and Luque started the arrangements for a second expedition with permission from Pedrarias D\u00e1vila. The governor, who himself was preparing an expedition north to [[Nicaragua]], was reluctant to permit another expedition, having lost confidence in Pizarro. The three associates eventually won his trust and he acquiesced. By this time, a new governor was to arrive and succeed D\u00e1vila. [[Pedro de los R\u00edos y Guti\u00e9rrez de Aguayo|Pedro de los R\u00edos]] took charge in July 1526 and initially approved Pizarro's expeditions (he would join him several years later in Peru).<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|103\u201304}}\n\nOn 10 March 1526 Pizarro left Panama with two ships with 160 men and several horses, reaching as far as the Colombian San Juan River. Soon after arriving the party separated, with Pizarro staying to explore the new and often perilous territory off the swampy Colombian coasts, while the expedition's co-commander, Almagro, returned to Panama for reinforcements. Pizarro's ''Piloto Mayor'' (main pilot), Bartolom\u00e9 Ruiz, continued sailing south and, after crossing the [[equator]], found and captured a ''balsa'' (raft) under sail, with natives from [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]]. To everyone's surprise, these carried textiles, ceramic objects and some pieces of gold, [[silver]] and [[emeralds]], making Ruiz's findings the central focus of this second expedition. Some natives were taken aboard Ruiz's ship to serve as interpreters.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|105\u201309}}<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nHe then set sail north for the San Juan River, arriving to find Pizarro and his men exhausted from the difficulties they had faced exploring the new territory. Soon Almagro sailed into the port laden with supplies and a reinforcement of at least eighty recruits who had arrived at Panama from Spain with an expeditionary spirit. The findings and excellent news from Ruiz along with Almagro's new reinforcements cheered Pizarro and his tired followers. They decided to sail back to the territory already explored by Ruiz and, after a difficult voyage due to strong winds and currents, reached [[Atacames]] on the Ecuadorian coast. Here, they found a large native population recently brought under Inca rule. Unfortunately for the ''conquistadores'', the warlike spirit of the people they encountered seemed so defiant and dangerous in numbers that the Spanish decided not to enter the land.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|110\u201312}}\n\n====The Famous Thirteen====\n[[File:Conquest peru 1531.jpg|thumb|Francisco Pizarro's route of exploration during the conquest of Peru (1531\u20131533)]]\n\nAfter much wrangling between Pizarro and Almagro, it was decided that Pizarro would stay at a safer place, the Isla de Gallo,<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|25\u201326}} near the coast, while Almagro would return to Panama with Luque for more reinforcements \u2013 this time with proof of the gold they had found and the news of the discovery of the obviously wealthy land they had explored. The new governor of Panama, Pedro de los R\u00edos, had learned of the mishaps of Pizarro's expeditions and the deaths of various settlers who had gone with him. Fearing an unsuccessful outcome, he rejected Almagro's application for continued resources. In addition, he ordered two ships commanded by Juan Tafur to be sent immediately with the intention of bringing Pizarro and his crew back to Panama.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|112\u201315}}\n\nPizarro had no intention of returning and when Tafur arrived at Isla de Gallo, Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: \"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian. For my part, I go to the south.\"<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|116}}\n\nOnly 13 men stayed with Pizarro. They later became known as \"The [[Famous Thirteen]]\" (''Los trece de la fama''),<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|26}} while the rest of the expeditioners stayed with Tafur. Ruiz left in one of the ships with the intention of joining Almagro and Luque in their efforts to gather reinforcements. Soon after the ships left, Pizarro and his men constructed a crude boat and journeyed 25 [[league (unit)|leagues]] north to La Isla Gorgona, where they would remain for seven months before the arrival of new provisions.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|117\u201318}}\n\nBack in Panama, Pedro de los R\u00edos (after much convincing by Luque) had finally acquiesced to the requests for another ship, but only to bring Pizarro back within six months and completely abandon the expedition. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity and left Panama (this time without new recruits) for La Isla Gorgona to once again join Pizarro. On meeting with Pizarro, the associates decided to continue sailing south on the recommendations of Ruiz's Indian interpreters.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|118}}\n\nBy April 1528, they finally reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]]. Tumbes became the first success the Spanish had so long desired. They were received with a warm welcome of hospitality and provisions from the Tumpis, the local inhabitants. On subsequent days two of Pizarro's men, Alonso de Molina and [[Pedro de Candia]], reconnoitered the territory and both, on separate accounts, reported back the riches of the land, including the decorations of silver and gold around the chief's residence and the hospitable attentions with which they were received by everyone. The Spanish also saw for the first time the Peruvian [[llama]],<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|26}} which Pizarro called \"little camels\". The natives began calling the Spanish the \"Children of the Sun\" due to their fair complexions and brilliant armor.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Pizarro, meanwhile, continued receiving the same accounts of a powerful monarch who ruled over the land they were exploring. These events served as evidence to convince the expedition that the wealth and power displayed at Tumbes were an example of the riches of the Peruvian territory. The conquistadors decided to return to Panama to prepare the final expedition of conquest with more recruits and provisions. Before leaving, however, Pizarro and his followers sailed south along the coast to see if anything of interest could be found. Historian [[William H. Prescott]] recounts that after passing through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] (founded by Almagro years later), they finally reached for the first time the ninth degree of the southern latitude in South America.\n\nOn their return towards Panama, Pizarro briefly stopped at Tumbes, where two of his men had decided to stay to learn the customs and language of the natives. Pizarro was also given two Peruvian boys to learn Spanish, one of whom was later baptized as [[Felipillo]] and served as an important interpreter, the equivalent of Cort\u00e9s' [[La Malinche]] of Mexico, and another called Martinillo.<ref name=\"Leon\" />{{rp|126, 128}} Their final stop was at La Isla Gorgona, where two of his ill men (one had died) had stayed.

Pizarro sailed from Panama for Spain in the spring of 1528, accompanied by Pedro de Candia, some natives and llamas, plus samples of fabric, gold and silver.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|127\u201328}}\n\nPizarro reached [[Seville]] in early summer. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]], who was at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], had an interview with Pizarro and heard of his expeditions in South America. The conquistador described the territory as rich in gold and silver that he and his followers had bravely explored \"to extend the empire of Castile\". The king, who was soon to leave for Italy, was impressed at his accounts and promised his support for the conquest of Peru. [[Isabella of Portugal|Queen Isabel]], though, in the absence of the king, signed the ''Capitulaci\u00f3n de Toledo'' on 6 July 1529,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/west/mosaic/chapter9/source249.html|title=college.hmco.com}}</ref> a license document that authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]].

He sent Hernando Pizarro and de Soto to meet with Atahualpa in his camp. Atahualpa agreed to meet Pizarro in his Cajamarca plaza fortress the next day. Fray [[Vincente de Valverde]] and native interpreter Felipillo approached Atahualpa in Cajamarca's central plaza. After the Dominican friar expounded the \"true faith\" and the need to pay tribute to the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Atahualpa replied, \"I will be no man's tributary.\" His complacency, because fewer than 200 Spanish remained, as opposed to his 50,000-man army, of which 6,000 accompanied him to Cajamarca, sealed his fate and that of the Inca empire.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|157, 161, 166\u201377}}\n\n[[File:Atawallpa Pizarro tinkuy.jpg|thumb|Pizarro meets with the Inca Emperor [[Atahualpa]], 1532]]\n\nAtahualpa's refusal led Pizarro and his force to attack the Inca army in what became the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] on 16 November 1532. The Spanish were successful. Pizarro executed Atahualpa's 12-man honor guard and took the Inca captive at the so-called [[Ransom Room]].

He was executed by [[garrote]] on 29 August 1533. Francisco Pizarro and de Soto were opposed to Atahualpa's execution, but Francisco consented to the trial due to the \"great agitation among the soldiers\", particularly by Almagro.

''[http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/southamerican/HistoryoftheConquestofPeru/chap28.html History of the Conquest of Peru]'', chapter 28.</ref>\n\nHistorians have often compared the conquests of Pizarro and Cort\u00e9s in North and South America as very similar in style and career. Pizarro, however, faced the Incas with a smaller army and fewer resources than Cort\u00e9s, at a much greater distance from the Spanish Caribbean outposts that could easily support him, which has led some to rank Pizarro slightly ahead of Cort\u00e9s in their battles for conquest. Based on sheer numbers alone, Pizarro's military victory was one of the most improbable in recorded history.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nPizarro is well known in Peru as the leader of the Spanish conquest. After his invasion, Pizarro destroyed{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} the Inca state and while ruling the area for almost a decade, initiated the decline of local cultures. The Incas' [[Religion in the Inca Empire|polytheistic religion]] was replaced by Christianity and much of the local population was reduced to [[serfdom]]{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} under the Spanish elite. The cities of the Inca Empire were transformed into Spanish Catholic cities. Pizarro is also reviled for ordering Atahualpa's death despite the ransom payment (which Pizarro kept, after paying the Spanish king his due). Many Peruvians, including many of mainly indigenous descent, regard him negatively, although until relatively recently Pizarro had been portrayed positively, for instance in textbooks, for imposing Catholicism and creating a privileged class of mainly Spanish descent.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Sculptures===\nIn the early 1930s, sculptor Ramsay MacDonald created three copies of an anonymous European foot soldier resembling a conquistador with a helmet, wielding a sword and riding a horse. The first copy was offered to Mexico to represent Cort\u00e9s, though it was rejected. The statue was taken to Lima in 1934 and re-purposed to represent Pizarro. One other copy of the statue resides in Wisconsin. (The mounted statue of Pizarro in the Plaza Mayor in Trujillo, Spain, was created by American sculptor [[Charles Cary Rumsey|Charles Rumsey]]. It was presented to the city by his widow in 1926.)\n\nThe statue long stood an adjacent square to Peru's [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace]]. In 2003, after years of requests for the statue to be removed, the mayor of Lima, [[Luis Casta\u00f1eda Lossio]], approved the transfer of the statue to another location. Since 2004, however, Pizarro's statue has been in a park surrounded by the recently restored 17th-century walls in the [[R\u00edmac District]]. The statue faces the [[R\u00edmac River]] and the Government Palace.\n\n===Palace of the Conquest===\n[[File:Palacio de la Conquista.jpg|thumb|Palace of the Conquest, [[Trujillo, Spain]]]]\n\nAfter returning from Peru extremely wealthy, the Pizarro family erected a [[plateresque]]-style palace on the corner of the Plaza Mayor in Trujillo.

He went to the [[Gulf of Urab\u00e1]], and accompanied [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] in his crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], where they became the first Europeans to reach the [[Pacific Ocean]]. He served as mayor of the newly founded [[Panama City]] for a few years, and undertook two failed expeditions to Peru. In 1528, Pizarro obtained permission from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles V]] and went on his third expedition to Peru.\n\nWhen local people who lived along the coast resisted this invasion, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, [[San Miguel de Piura]]. After a series of maneuvres, Pizarro captured the Incan emperor [[Atahualpa]] at the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] in November 1532. A ransom for the emperor's release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed him in July 1533. The same year, Pizarro entered the Inca capital of [[Cuzco]] and completed his conquest of Peru. In January 1535, Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima, Peru|Lima]], a project he considered his greatest achievement.\n\nQuarrels between Pizarro and his longtime comrade-in-arms [[Diego Almagro]] culminated in the [[Battle of Las Salinas]], after which Almagro was executed. In June 1541, a party led by Almagro's son assassinated Pizarro in Lima. He was laid to rest in the [[Lima Cathedral]]. \n\n== Early life ==\nFrancisco Pizarro was born in [[Trujillo, C\u00e1ceres]], [[Spain]] (then in the [[Crown of Castile]]) in modern-day [[Extremadura]], Spain. He was the illegitimate son of infantry colonel Gonzalo Pizarro (1446\u20131522) and Francisca Gonz\u00e1lez, a woman of poor means. His date of birth is uncertain, but it is believed to be sometime in the 1470s, probably 1475. Little attention was paid to his education and he grew up illiterate.<ref name=\"CE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12140a.htm |title=Francisco Pizarro |work=The Catholic Encyclopedia |accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis father was a [[colonel]] of [[infantry]] who served in [[Navarre]] and in the [[Italian Wars|Italian campaigns]] under [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba|C\u00f3rdoba]].

During the next five years, Pizarro became a close associate of D\u00e1vila and the governor assigned him a ''[[repartimiento]]'' of natives and cattle.<ref name=\"Prescott\" />{{rp|93}} When D\u00e1vila decided to get rid of Balboa out of distrust, he instructed Pizarro to personally arrest him and bring him to stand trial. Balboa was beheaded in January 1519. For his loyalty to D\u00e1vila, Pizarro was rewarded with the positions of mayor ([[Alcalde]]) and magistrate of the then recently founded [[Panama City]] from 1519 to 1523.<ref name=\"Pascual de Andagoya (1865)\">{{cite web | last=Andagoya | first=Pascual de| title=Narrative of the Proceedings of Pedrarias Davila (1865) | website=Wikisource | date=12 August 1865 | url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Narrative_of_the_Proceedings_of_Pedrarias_Davila}}</ref>\n\n==Expeditions to South America==\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\nThe first attempt to explore western [[South America]] was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. The native South Americans he encountered told him about a gold-rich territory called Vir\u00fa, which was on a river called Pir\u00fa (later corrupted to Per\u00fa).<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|24}} These reports were relayed by the Spanish-Inca ''[[mestizo]]'' writer [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso de la Vega]] in ''Comentarios Reales de los Incas'' (1609).\n\nAndagoya eventually established contact with several Native American ''curacas'' (chiefs), some of whom he later claimed were sorcerers and witches. Having reached as far as the San Juan River (part of the present boundary between [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]]) Andagoya fell ill and returned to Panama. He spread the news and stories about \"Pir\u00fa\" \u2013 a great land to the south rich with gold (the legendary [[El Dorado]]). These revelations, along with the accounts for Cort\u00e9s' success in [[Mexico]], caught the attention of Pizarro, prompting a series of expeditions to the south.\n\nIn 1524, while still in Panama, Pizarro formed a partnership with a priest, [[Hernando de Luque]] and a soldier, [[Diego de Almagro]], to explore and conquer the South. Pizarro, Almagro and Luque later explicitly renewed their compact,<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|24}} agreeing to conquer and divide equally among themselves the empire they hoped to vanquish. While their accord was strictly oral, they dubbed their enterprise the ''Empresa del Levante'' and determined that Pizarro would command the expedition, Almagro would provide military and food supplies and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|95}}\n\n===First expedition (1524)===\nIn November 1524, the first of three expeditions left Panama for the conquest of Peru with about 80 men and 40 horses.<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|24}} Juan de Salcedo was the standard bearer, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ribera]] was the treasurer and Juan Carvallo was the inspector.<ref name=Leon>Leon, P.

The Governor of Panama, [[Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila]], at first approved in principle of exploring South America. Pizarro's first expedition, however, turned out to be a failure as his ''conquistadores'', sailing down the Pacific coast, reached no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, lack of food and skirmishes with hostile natives, one of which caused Almagro to lose an eye by arrow-shot. The place names the Spanish bestowed along their route, including ''Puerto Deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del Hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Punta Quemado'' or ''Puebla Quemado'' (burned port), confirmed their difficulties. Fearing subsequent hostile encounters like the one the expedition endured at the [[Battle of Punta Quemada]], Pizarro ended his first expedition and returned to Panama.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|94\u2013102}}\n\n===Second expedition (1526)===\nTwo years later Pizarro, Almagro and Luque started the arrangements for a second expedition with permission from Pedrarias D\u00e1vila. The governor, who himself was preparing an expedition north to [[Nicaragua]], was reluctant to permit another expedition, having lost confidence in Pizarro. The three associates eventually won his trust and he acquiesced. By this time, a new governor was to arrive and succeed D\u00e1vila. [[Pedro de los R\u00edos y Guti\u00e9rrez de Aguayo|Pedro de los R\u00edos]] took charge in July 1526 and initially approved Pizarro's expeditions (he would join him several years later in Peru).<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|103\u201304}}\n\nOn 10 March 1526 Pizarro left Panama with two ships with 160 men and several horses, reaching as far as the Colombian San Juan River. Soon after arriving the party separated, with Pizarro staying to explore the new and often perilous territory off the swampy Colombian coasts, while the expedition's co-commander, Almagro, returned to Panama for reinforcements. Pizarro's ''Piloto Mayor'' (main pilot), Bartolom\u00e9 Ruiz, continued sailing south and, after crossing the [[equator]], found and captured a ''balsa'' (raft) under sail, with natives from [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]]. To everyone's surprise, these carried textiles, ceramic objects and some pieces of gold, [[silver]] and [[emeralds]], making Ruiz's findings the central focus of this second expedition. Some natives were taken aboard Ruiz's ship to serve as interpreters.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|105\u201309}}<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nHe then set sail north for the San Juan River, arriving to find Pizarro and his men exhausted from the difficulties they had faced exploring the new territory. Soon Almagro sailed into the port laden with supplies and a reinforcement of at least eighty recruits who had arrived at Panama from Spain with an expeditionary spirit. The findings and excellent news from Ruiz along with Almagro's new reinforcements cheered Pizarro and his tired followers. They decided to sail back to the territory already explored by Ruiz and, after a difficult voyage due to strong winds and currents, reached [[Atacames]] on the Ecuadorian coast. Here, they found a large native population recently brought under Inca rule. Unfortunately for the ''conquistadores'', the warlike spirit of the people they encountered seemed so defiant and dangerous in numbers that the Spanish decided not to enter the land.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|110\u201312}}\n\n====The Famous Thirteen====\n[[File:Conquest peru 1531.jpg|thumb|Francisco Pizarro's route of exploration during the conquest of Peru (1531\u20131533)]]\n\nAfter much wrangling between Pizarro and Almagro, it was decided that Pizarro would stay at a safer place, the Isla de Gallo,<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|25\u201326}} near the coast, while Almagro would return to Panama with Luque for more reinforcements \u2013 this time with proof of the gold they had found and the news of the discovery of the obviously wealthy land they had explored. The new governor of Panama, Pedro de los R\u00edos, had learned of the mishaps of Pizarro's expeditions and the deaths of various settlers who had gone with him. Fearing an unsuccessful outcome, he rejected Almagro's application for continued resources. In addition, he ordered two ships commanded by Juan Tafur to be sent immediately with the intention of bringing Pizarro and his crew back to Panama.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|112\u201315}}\n\nPizarro had no intention of returning and when Tafur arrived at Isla de Gallo, Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: \"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian. For my part, I go to the south.\"<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|116}}\n\nOnly 13 men stayed with Pizarro. They later became known as \"The [[Famous Thirteen]]\" (''Los trece de la fama''),<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|26}} while the rest of the expeditioners stayed with Tafur. Ruiz left in one of the ships with the intention of joining Almagro and Luque in their efforts to gather reinforcements. Soon after the ships left, Pizarro and his men constructed a crude boat and journeyed 25 [[league (unit)|leagues]] north to La Isla Gorgona, where they would remain for seven months before the arrival of new provisions.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|117\u201318}}\n\nBack in Panama, Pedro de los R\u00edos (after much convincing by Luque) had finally acquiesced to the requests for another ship, but only to bring Pizarro back within six months and completely abandon the expedition. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity and left Panama (this time without new recruits) for La Isla Gorgona to once again join Pizarro. On meeting with Pizarro, the associates decided to continue sailing south on the recommendations of Ruiz's Indian interpreters.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|118}}\n\nBy April 1528, they finally reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]]. Tumbes became the first success the Spanish had so long desired. They were received with a warm welcome of hospitality and provisions from the Tumpis, the local inhabitants. On subsequent days two of Pizarro's men, Alonso de Molina and [[Pedro de Candia]], reconnoitered the territory and both, on separate accounts, reported back the riches of the land, including the decorations of silver and gold around the chief's residence and the hospitable attentions with which they were received by everyone. The Spanish also saw for the first time the Peruvian [[llama]],<ref name=Hemming/>{{rp|26}} which Pizarro called \"little camels\". The natives began calling the Spanish the \"Children of the Sun\" due to their fair complexions and brilliant armor.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Pizarro, meanwhile, continued receiving the same accounts of a powerful monarch who ruled over the land they were exploring. These events served as evidence to convince the expedition that the wealth and power displayed at Tumbes were an example of the riches of the Peruvian territory. The conquistadors decided to return to Panama to prepare the final expedition of conquest with more recruits and provisions. Before leaving, however, Pizarro and his followers sailed south along the coast to see if anything of interest could be found. Historian [[William H. Prescott]] recounts that after passing through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] (founded by Almagro years later), they finally reached for the first time the ninth degree of the southern latitude in South America.\n\nOn their return towards Panama, Pizarro briefly stopped at Tumbes, where two of his men had decided to stay to learn the customs and language of the natives. Pizarro was also given two Peruvian boys to learn Spanish, one of whom was later baptized as [[Felipillo]] and served as an important interpreter, the equivalent of Cort\u00e9s' [[La Malinche]] of Mexico, and another called Martinillo.<ref name=\"Leon\" />{{rp|126, 128}} Their final stop was at La Isla Gorgona, where two of his ill men (one had died) had stayed. After at least 18 months away, Pizarro and his followers anchored off the coasts of Panama to prepare for the final expedition.<ref name=\"Prescott\" />{{rp|119\u201326}}\n\n===Capitulaci\u00f3n de Toledo===\nWhen the new governor of Panama, Pedro de los R\u00edos, refused to allow for a third expedition to the south, the associates resolved for Pizarro to leave for Spain and appeal to the sovereign in person. Pizarro sailed from Panama for Spain in the spring of 1528, accompanied by Pedro de Candia, some natives and llamas, plus samples of fabric, gold and silver.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|127\u201328}}\n\nPizarro reached [[Seville]] in early summer. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]], who was at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], had an interview with Pizarro and heard of his expeditions in South America. The conquistador described the territory as rich in gold and silver that he and his followers had bravely explored \"to extend the empire of Castile\". The king, who was soon to leave for Italy, was impressed at his accounts and promised his support for the conquest of Peru. [[Isabella of Portugal|Queen Isabel]], though, in the absence of the king, signed the ''Capitulaci\u00f3n de Toledo'' on 6 July 1529,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://college.hmco.com/history/west/mosaic/chapter9/source249.html|title=college.hmco.com}}</ref> a license document that authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was officially named the Governor, [[Captain general]], ''[[Adelantado]]'' and ''[[Alguacil]] Mayor'', of New Castile for the distance of 200 leagues along the newly discovered coast and invested with all authority and prerogatives, leaving his associates in secondary positions (a fact that later incensed Almagro and would lead to eventual discord). One of the grant conditions was that within six months, Pizarro should raise a sufficiently equipped force of 250 men, of whom 100 might be drawn from the colonies.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|132\u201334, 137}}\n\nThis gave Pizarro time to leave for his native Trujillo and convince his brother [[Hernando Pizarro]] and other close friends to join him on his third expedition.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|136}} [[Francisco de Orellana]] joined the group and would later discover and explore the length of the [[Amazon River]].

Soon after, [[Hernando de Soto]], another conquistador who had joined the expedition, arrived with 100 volunteers and horses to aid Pizarro and with him sailed towards Tumbes,<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|143}} only to find the place deserted and destroyed.

Arriving at Cajamarca on 15 November 1532, Pizarro had a force of just 110-foot soldiers, 67 cavalry, three [[arquebus]]es and two [[falconet (cannon)|falconets]]. He sent Hernando Pizarro and de Soto to meet with Atahualpa in his camp. Atahualpa agreed to meet Pizarro in his Cajamarca plaza fortress the next day. Fray [[Vincente de Valverde]] and native interpreter Felipillo approached Atahualpa in Cajamarca's central plaza. After the Dominican friar expounded the \"true faith\" and the need to pay tribute to the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Atahualpa replied, \"I will be no man's tributary.\" His complacency, because fewer than 200 Spanish remained, as opposed to his 50,000-man army, of which 6,000 accompanied him to Cajamarca, sealed his fate and that of the Inca empire.<ref name=Prescott/>{{rp|157, 161, 166\u201377}}\n\n[[File:Atawallpa Pizarro tinkuy.jpg|thumb|Pizarro meets with the Inca Emperor [[Atahualpa]], 1532]]\n\nAtahualpa's refusal led Pizarro and his force to attack the Inca army in what became the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] on 16 November 1532. The Spanish were successful. Pizarro executed Atahualpa's 12-man honor guard and took the Inca captive at the so-called [[Ransom Room]].

''[http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/southamerican/HistoryoftheConquestofPeru/chap28.html History of the Conquest of Peru]'', chapter 28.</ref>\n\nHistorians have often compared the conquests of Pizarro and Cort\u00e9s in North and South America as very similar in style and career. Pizarro, however, faced the Incas with a smaller army and fewer resources than Cort\u00e9s, at a much greater distance from the Spanish Caribbean outposts that could easily support him, which has led some to rank Pizarro slightly ahead of Cort\u00e9s in their battles for conquest. Based on sheer numbers alone, Pizarro's military victory was one of the most improbable in recorded history.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nPizarro is well known in Peru as the leader of the Spanish conquest. After his invasion, Pizarro destroyed{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} the Inca state and while ruling the area for almost a decade, initiated the decline of local cultures. The Incas' [[Religion in the Inca Empire|polytheistic religion]] was replaced by Christianity and much of the local population was reduced to [[serfdom]]{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} under the Spanish elite. The cities of the Inca Empire were transformed into Spanish Catholic cities. Pizarro is also reviled for ordering Atahualpa's death despite the ransom payment (which Pizarro kept, after paying the Spanish king his due). Many Peruvians, including many of mainly indigenous descent, regard him negatively, although until relatively recently Pizarro had been portrayed positively, for instance in textbooks, for imposing Catholicism and creating a privileged class of mainly Spanish descent.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Sculptures===\nIn the early 1930s, sculptor Ramsay MacDonald created three copies of an anonymous European foot soldier resembling a conquistador with a helmet, wielding a sword and riding a horse. The first copy was offered to Mexico to represent Cort\u00e9s, though it was rejected. The statue was taken to Lima in 1934 and re-purposed to represent Pizarro. One other copy of the statue resides in Wisconsin. (The mounted statue of Pizarro in the Plaza Mayor in Trujillo, Spain, was created by American sculptor [[Charles Cary Rumsey|Charles Rumsey]]. It was presented to the city by his widow in 1926.)\n\nThe statue long stood an adjacent square to Peru's [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace]]. In 2003, after years of requests for the statue to be removed, the mayor of Lima, [[Luis Casta\u00f1eda Lossio]], approved the transfer of the statue to another location. Since 2004, however, Pizarro's statue has been in a park surrounded by the recently restored 17th-century walls in the [[R\u00edmac District]]. The statue faces the [[R\u00edmac River]] and the Government Palace.\n\n===Palace of the Conquest===\n[[File:Palacio de la Conquista.jpg|thumb|Palace of the Conquest, [[Trujillo, Spain]]]]\n\nAfter returning from Peru extremely wealthy, the Pizarro family erected a [[plateresque]]-style palace on the corner of the Plaza Mayor in Trujillo.

They are generally between {{convert|16|to(-)|21|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, although the smallest species, the [[short-tailed pipit]], is only {{convert|11.5|to(-)|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. In weight they range from {{convert|15|to(-)|38|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Like all members of the family they are slender, short necked birds with long tails, long slender legs with elongated (in some cases very elongated) hind [[claws]]. The length of the hindclaw varies with the habits of the species, more arboreal species have shorter, more curved hindclaws than the more terrestrial species. The [[beak|bills]] are generally long, slender and pointed. In both size and [[plumage]] there is little [[sexual dimorphism|differences between the sexes]]. One unusual feature of the pipits, which they share in common with the rest of their family but not the rest of the passerines, is that the [[Flight feather|tertials]] on the wing entirely cover the primary flight feathers. This is thought to be a feature to protect the primaries, which are important to [[bird flight|flight]], from the sun, which causes the feathers to fade and become brittle if not protected.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nThe plumage of the pipits is generally drab and brown, buff or faded white. The undersides are usually darker than the top, and there is a variable amount of barring and streaking on the back, wings and breast. The drab mottled brown colours provide some [[camouflage]] against the soil and stones they are generally found on. A few species have slightly more colourful breeding plumages, for example the [[rosy pipit]] has greenish edges on the wing feathers. The yellow-breasted pipit, if it is retained in this genus, is quite atypical in having bright yellow plumage on the throat breast and belly.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nPipits are morphologically similar to some [[lark]]s. However the two groups are quite distantly related: the lark family Alaudidae is part of the superfamily [[Sylvioidea]], rather than the [[Passeroidea]], where the pipits are placed. Morphological differences between the two groups of birds are in fact plentiful. Anatomical differences include a differently-structured [[syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], differences in the structure of the [[tarsometatarsus|tarsus]], and in many lark genera, the presence of a distinct tenth [[primary feather|primary]], a fourth [[tertial feather|tertial]], and feathers at least partially covering the nostrils.<ref name=\"Helm\">Alstr\u00f6m, Per, Krister Mild and Bill Zetterstr\u00f6m (2003) ''Pipits and Wagtails of Europe, Asia and North America'' [[Helm Identification Guides]] {{ISBN|0-7136-5834-7}}</ref> Bill shape differs between larks and pipits: larks have an evenly sloping [[culmen (bird)|culmen]], whereas most pipits have a small hump over the nostrils, and lark bills are generally heavier, reflecting differences in diet.<ref name=\"Helm\"/> There are differences in the feather tracts of the two groups: while many larks have [[crest (feathers)|crest]]s, no pipit does; pipits have only one prominent row of {{birdgloss|scapulars}}, whereas larks have two.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Anthus berthelotii Teide-2.jpg|thumb|[[Berthelot's pipit]] is restricted to the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]]]]\nThe pipits have a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], occurring across most of the world's land surface. They are the only genus in their family to occur widely in the Americas (two species of [[wagtail]] marginally occur in [[Alaska]] as well). Three species of pipit occur in North America (one only here), and seven species occur in South America. The remaining species are spread throughout Eurasia, Africa and Australia, along with two species restricted to islands in the [[Atlantic]]. Some six species occur on more than one continent.<ref name =\"HBW\"/>\n\n[[File:Anthus triviallis (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|left|The [[tree pipit]] breeds in Europe and Northern Asia and winters in India and Africa]]\nAs might be expected from a genus with such a wide distribution, the pipits are found in an equally wide range of habitats. They occur in most types of open habitat, although they are absent from the very driest deserts. They are mostly associated with some kind of grassland, from sea-level to alpine tundra. The [[Eurasian rock pipit|rock pipit]] and [[South Georgia pipit]] is found in the rocks and cliffs of the seashore,<ref name =\"Durham\"/><ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22718588/0 |title=''Anthus antarcticus'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |access-date=1 July 2017|ref=harv}}</ref> whereas a number of species are restricted (for part of the year in some cases) to alpine areas. The family also ranges from the northern tundra and the subantarctic islands of New Zealand and the South Georgia group to the tropics.<ref name =\"HBW\"/> They are absent from tropical rainforest,<ref name =\"evolution\"/> but a few species are associated with open woodland, for example the [[wood pipit]] of southern Africa which is found in open woodland savanna and [[miombo]] woodland.<ref name =\"HBW\"/>\n\nThe pipits range from entirely sedentary to entirely [[bird migration|migratory]]. Insular species like the [[Berthelot's pipit]], which is endemic to [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]], are entirely sedentary, as are some species in warmer areas like the [[Nilgiri pipit]]. Other species are partly nomadic during the non-breeding season, like the [[long-legged pipit]] of central Africa or the [[ochre-breasted pipit]] of South America. These seasonal movements are in response to conditions in the environment, and are poorly understood and unpredictable. Longer, more regular migrations between discrete breeding and wintering grounds are undertaken by several species. The [[tree pipit]] which breeds in Europe and northern Asia, winters in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, a pattern of long-distance migration shared with other northerly species. Species may also be partly migratory, with northern populations being migratory but more temperate populations being resident (like the [[meadow pipit]] in Europe).  The distances involved do not have to be that long; the [[mountain pipit]] of southern Africa breeds in the [[Drakensberg]] of [[South Africa]] and migrates north only as far as Angola and Zambia. Migration is usually undertaken in groups, and may happen both during the day and at night. There is some variation in this, for example the [[Sprague's pipit]] of North America apparently only migrates by day.<ref name =\"HBW\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Anthus-rubescens-001.jpg|thumb|[[Buff-bellied pipit]]s will wag their tail from side to side as well as up and down]]\nThe pipits are active terrestrial birds that usually spend most of their time on the ground. They will [[bird flight|fly]] in order to display during breeding, while migrating and dispersing, and also when flushed by danger. A few species make use of trees, perching in them and flying to them when disturbed. Low shrubs, rocks and termite nests may also be used as vantage points. Like their relatives the wagtails, pipits engage in tail-wagging. The way in which a pipit does this can provide clues to its identity in otherwise similar looking species. Upland pipits, for example,  flick their tails quite quickly, as opposed to olive-backed pipits which wag their tails more gently. In general pipits move their tails quite slowly. The buff-bellied pipit wags its tail both up and down and from side to side. The exact function of tail-wagging is unclear;<ref name =\"HBW\"/> in the related wagtails it is thought to be a signal to predators of vigilance.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.07.026 | last1 = Randler | first1 = C | year = 2006 | title = Is tail wagging in white wagtails, ''Motacilla alba'', an honest signal of vigilance? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 71 | issue = 5| pages = 1089\u20131093 }}</ref>\n\n===Feeding===\nThe diet of the pipits is dominated by small invertebrates. Insects are the most important prey items; among the types taken include flies and their larvae, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets, true bugs, mantids, ants, aphids and particularly the larvae and adults of moths and butterflies. Outside of insects other invertebrates taken include spiders and, rarely, worms and scorpions. They are generally catholic in their diet, the composition of their diet apparently reflecting the abundance of their prey in the location (and varying with the season). The diet consumed by adults may vary to that of the young birds; for example adult tree pipits take large numbers of beetles but do not feed many to their chicks.

Along with the [[wagtail]]s and [[longclaw]]s, the pipits make up the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Motacillidae]]. The genus is widespread, occurring across most of the world, except the driest deserts, rainforests and the mainland of Antarctica.\n\nThey are slender, often drab, ground-feeding insectivores of open country. Like their relatives in the family, the pipits are [[monogamy|monogamous]] and [[territory (animal)|territorial]]. Pipits are ground nesters, laying up to six speckled eggs.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\n[[File:New Zealand Pipit Kapiti.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Australasian pipit]]s of New Zealand may represent a separate species from those found elsewhere]]\nThe genus name ''Anthus'' is the [[Latin]] name for a small bird of grasslands.<ref name =job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A. | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher=Christopher Helm | location = London, United Kingdom | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | page = 49 }}</ref>\n\nMolecular studies of the pipits suggested that the genus arose in East Asia around seven million years ago ([[Mya (unit)#Symbols y and yr|mya]]), during the [[Miocene]], and that the genus had spread to the Americas, Africa and Europe between 5 and 6 mya. Speciation rates were high during the [[Pliocene]] (5.3 to 2.6 mya ) but have slowed down so during the [[Pleistocene]].<ref name=\"evolution\"/> Repeated dispersal between continents seems to have been important in generating new species in Eurasia, Africa and North America, rather than species arising by radiation once a continent was reached.

This species is apparently intermediate in appearance between the pipits and the longclaws, and is probably more closely related to the longclaws. One species of pipit, the [[yellow-breasted pipit]], is sometimes split out into a genus ''[[Hemimacronyx]]'', which is considered to be intermediate between the longclaws and pipits. The split was originally proposed based on morphological features but it has also found support based upon genetic analysis.<ref name=\"Voelker\">{{cite journal|last=Voelker|first=Gary|author2=Scott V.

They are generally between {{convert|16|to(-)|21|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, although the smallest species, the [[short-tailed pipit]], is only {{convert|11.5|to(-)|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. In weight they range from {{convert|15|to(-)|38|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Like all members of the family they are slender, short necked birds with long tails, long slender legs with elongated (in some cases very elongated) hind [[claws]]. The length of the hindclaw varies with the habits of the species, more arboreal species have shorter, more curved hindclaws than the more terrestrial species. The [[beak|bills]] are generally long, slender and pointed. In both size and [[plumage]] there is little [[sexual dimorphism|differences between the sexes]]. One unusual feature of the pipits, which they share in common with the rest of their family but not the rest of the passerines, is that the [[Flight feather|tertials]] on the wing entirely cover the primary flight feathers. This is thought to be a feature to protect the primaries, which are important to [[bird flight|flight]], from the sun, which causes the feathers to fade and become brittle if not protected.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nThe plumage of the pipits is generally drab and brown, buff or faded white. The undersides are usually darker than the top, and there is a variable amount of barring and streaking on the back, wings and breast. The drab mottled brown colours provide some [[camouflage]] against the soil and stones they are generally found on. A few species have slightly more colourful breeding plumages, for example the [[rosy pipit]] has greenish edges on the wing feathers. The yellow-breasted pipit, if it is retained in this genus, is quite atypical in having bright yellow plumage on the throat breast and belly.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nPipits are morphologically similar to some [[lark]]s. However the two groups are quite distantly related: the lark family Alaudidae is part of the [[Sylvioidea]] superfamily, rather than the [[Passeroidea]], where the pipits are placed. Morphological differences between the two groups of birds are in fact plentiful. Anatomical differences include a differently-structured [[syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], differences in the structure of the [[tarsometatarsus|tarsus]], and in many lark genera, the presence of a distinct tenth [[primary feather|primary]], a fourth [[tertial feather|tertial]], and feathers at least partially covering the nostrils.<ref name=\"Helm\">Alstr\u00f6m, Per, Krister Mild and Bill Zetterstr\u00f6m (2003) ''Pipits and Wagtails of Europe, Asia and North America'' [[Helm Identification Guides]] {{ISBN|0-7136-5834-7}}</ref> Bill shape differs between larks and pipits: larks have an evenly sloping [[culmen (bird)|culmen]], whereas most pipits have a small hump over the nostrils, and lark bills are generally heavier, reflecting differences in diet.<ref name=\"Helm\"/> There are differences in the feather tracts of the two groups: while many larks have [[crest (feathers)|crest]]s, no pipit does; pipits have only one prominent row of {{birdgloss|scapulars}}, whereas larks have two.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Anthus berthelotii Teide-2.jpg|thumb|[[Berthelot's pipit]] is restricted to the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]]]]\nThe pipits have a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], occurring across most of the world's land surface. They are the only genus in their family to occur widely in the Americas (two species of [[wagtail]] marginally occur in [[Alaska]] as well). Three species of pipit occur in North America (one only here), and seven species occur in South America. The remaining species are spread throughout Eurasia, Africa and Australia, along with two species restricted to islands in the [[Atlantic]]. Some six species occur on more than one continent.<ref name =\"HBW\"/>\n\n[[File:Anthus triviallis (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|left|The [[tree pipit]] breeds in Europe and Northern Asia and winters in India and Africa]]\nAs might be expected from a genus with such a wide distribution, the pipits are found in an equally wide range of habitats. They occur in most types of open habitat, although they are absent from the very driest deserts. They are mostly associated with some kind of grassland, from sea-level to alpine tundra. The [[Eurasian rock pipit|rock pipit]] and [[South Georgia pipit]] can be found in the rocks and cliffs of the seashore,<ref name =\"Durham\"/><ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22718588/0 |title=''Anthus antarcticus'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |access-date=1 July 2017|ref=harv}}</ref> whereas a number of species are restricted (for part of the year in some cases) to alpine areas. The family also ranges from the northern tundra and the subantarctic islands of New Zealand and the South Georgia group to the tropics.<ref name =\"HBW\"/> They are absent from tropical rainforests,<ref name =\"evolution\"/> but a few species are associated with open woodland, for example the [[wood pipit]] of southern Africa which is found in open woodland savanna and [[miombo]] woodland.<ref name =\"HBW\"/>\n\nThe pipits range from entirely sedentary to entirely [[bird migration|migratory]]. Insular species like the [[Berthelot's pipit]], which is endemic to [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]], are entirely sedentary, as are some species in warmer areas like the [[Nilgiri pipit]]. Other species are partly nomadic during the non-breeding season, like the [[long-legged pipit]] of central Africa or the [[ochre-breasted pipit]] of South America. These seasonal movements are in response to conditions in the environment, and are poorly understood and unpredictable. Longer, more regular migrations between discrete breeding and wintering grounds are undertaken by several species. The [[tree pipit]] which breeds in Europe and northern Asia, winters in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, a pattern of long-distance migration shared with other northerly species. Species may also be partly migratory, with northern populations being migratory but more temperate populations being resident (like the [[meadow pipit]] in Europe).  The distances involved do not have to be that long; the [[mountain pipit]] of southern Africa breeds in the [[Drakensberg]] of [[South Africa]] and migrates north only as far as Angola and Zambia. Migration is usually undertaken in groups, and may happen both during the day and at night. There is some variation in this, for example the [[Sprague's pipit]] of North America apparently only migrates by day.<ref name =\"HBW\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Anthus-rubescens-001.jpg|thumb|[[Buff-bellied pipit]]s will wag their tail from side to side as well as up and down]]\nThe pipits are active terrestrial birds that usually spend most of their time on the ground. They will [[bird flight|fly]] in order to display during breeding, while migrating and dispersing, and also when flushed by danger. A few species make use of trees, perching in them and flying to them when disturbed. Low shrubs, rocks and termite nests may also be used as vantage points. Like their relatives the wagtails, pipits engage in tail-wagging. The way in which a pipit does this can provide clues to its identity in otherwise similar looking species. Upland pipits, for example,  flick their tails quite quickly, as opposed to olive-backed pipits which wag their tails more gently. In general pipits move their tails quite slowly. The buff-bellied pipit wags its tail both up and down and from side to side. The exact function of tail-wagging is unclear;<ref name =\"HBW\"/> in the related wagtails it is thought to be a signal to predators of vigilance.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.07.026 | last1 = Randler | first1 = C | year = 2006 | title = Is tail wagging in white wagtails, ''Motacilla alba'', an honest signal of vigilance? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 71 | issue = 5| pages = 1089\u20131093 }}</ref>\n\n===Feeding===\nThe diet of the pipits is dominated by small invertebrates. Insects are the most important prey items; among the types taken include flies and their larvae, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets, true bugs, mantids, ants, aphids and particularly the larvae and adults of moths and butterflies. Outside of insects other invertebrates taken include spiders and, rarely, worms and scorpions. They are generally catholic in their diet, the composition of their diet apparently reflecting the abundance of their prey in the location (and varying with the season). The diet consumed by adults may vary to that of the young birds; for example adult tree pipits take large numbers of beetles but do not feed many to their chicks. Species feeding on the seashore are reported to feed on marine crustaceans and molluscs. A few species have been reported to feed on small fish, beating them in the manner of a [[kingfisher]] having caught them.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Eurasian rock pipit|Rock pipit]]s have also been observed feeding on fish dropped by puffins.

They prefer warm temperatures and can be more easily found from May to October in lower altitudes, and June to September in higher altitudes where the temperature is typically cooler.<ref name= ref1 /> In higher altitudes, female flies have shorter lifespans, are smaller, and lay fewer clutches of eggs.<ref name= ref1 /> They require fresh dung, primarily from cows and sheep, for reproduction.<ref name=ref15 /> They also eat [[nectarivory|nectar]] which is a source of sugar.<ref name=ref15 />\n\n===Altitude effects===\n''Sepsis cynipsea'' dung flies are often found in regions with varying altitudes, such as the [[Swiss Alps]].<ref name=ref10 /> Out of the many different [[Sepsidae]] species that are found in these regions, ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies prefer intermediate altitudes but are found at all altitudes where other species of dung flies are found.<ref name=ref10 /> In the areas where these fly species are prevalent, there is more species diversity at higher altitudes.<ref name=ref10 /> Higher altitude environments tend to be more variable, so species found at higher altitudes have to be better at adapting to environmental changes.<ref name=ref10 /> However, ''S. cynpisea'' flies at different altitudes enter [[Diapause]] at the same time and stop producing eggs at the same time in the season.<ref name=ref14>Blanckenhorn, W.

Back then there was a lot less to go around in the world of skateboarding. Less pros, fewer places to skate\u2026 Every little thing that we accomplished, if it was finding a new skate spot, or getting to the skate park, or getting a new board, was such a big deal. Let alone getting sponsored and maybe one day getting paid for skateboarding. Back then a top pro, potentially made $100,000 a year and that was like the one top dude. Maybe Tony was making a hundred grand a year in his hey-day in the mid to late eighties. And that was like, I thought he was like a rock star, you know? Skateboarding seemed so much more special in some ways back then. How the community was so passionate about skateboarding because if you weren\u2019t, there really wasn\u2019t much within it for you.<ref name=\"Ian\" /></blockquote>\n\nAs the first and only person to [[Ollie (skateboarding)|ollie]] over the [[Great Wall of China]] (in 2005),<ref>{{cite web|title=Danny Jumping the Great Wall of China|url=http://www.blabacphoto.com/index.php#mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&s=21&p=3&a=0&at=0|work=BlabacPhoto|publisher=Mike Blabac|accessdate=18 January 2013|author=Mike Blabac|format=Photo upload|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Skateboarder Danny Way to leap Great Wall|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/GG09Ad02.html|accessdate=18 January 2013|newspaper=Asia Times Online|date=9 July 2005|author=Asia Pulse}}</ref><ref>Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bliYHexV4Ek Danny Way Jumps The Great Wall Of China], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEiAj4jt7fs highlight]</ref> Way provided insight into his mental preparation on the day in a 2013 interview:\n\n<blockquote>\nThere were a lot of things that made it a lot more eerie to do something in China versus somewhere else. There was some uncertainty, being in a foreign place with not a lot of resources that I would say I would be comfortable with on a medical level. Aside from that, the structure was not very sound. It was literally moving side to side at least six inches from one side to the other from the wind. So I was definitely humbled by a lot more than what I was going to do on a skateboard that day. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ritual for me, but I tried to have a moment to think about all the good things in my life. That definitely made me check in with myself for a second.

Less pros, fewer places to skate\u2026 Every little thing that we accomplished, if it was finding a new skate spot, or getting to the skate park, or getting a new board, was such a big deal. Let alone getting sponsored and maybe one day getting paid for skateboarding. Back then a top pro, potentially made $100,000 a year and that was like the one top dude. Maybe Tony was making a hundred grand a year in his hey-day in the mid to late eighties. And that was like, I thought he was like a rock star, you know? Skateboarding seemed so much more special in some ways back then.

There was some uncertainty, being in a foreign place with not a lot of resources that I would say I would be comfortable with on a medical level. Aside from that, the structure was not very sound. It was literally moving side to side at least six inches from one side to the other from the wind. So I was definitely humbled by a lot more than what I was going to do on a skateboard that day. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ritual for me, but I tried to have a moment to think about all the good things in my life. That definitely made me check in with myself for a second.
