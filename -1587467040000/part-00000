The [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Division]] champion [[Boston Celtics]] faced the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Division]] champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in a best-of-seven series that the Celtics won 4 games to 3. For the Celtics this was their tenth straight finals appearance, which tied a North American professional sports record set by the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Montreal Canadiens]] from 1951 to 1960.\n\nThus Boston won its 8th consecutive league title, which no other team has achieved in North American professional sports competition. Before Game 2, after the Los Angeles Lakers' comeback overtime win in Game 1, Red Auerbach, who had challenged the entire league to topple the Celtics from their reign by announcing he would retire after 1965\u20131966 before the season had started (thus giving his detractors \"one last shot\" at him), announced Bill Russell as the Celtics coach for 1966\u20131967 and beyond. He would be the first African-American to coach in the NBA. Laker coach Fred Schaus privately fumed that Red's hiring had taken away all of the accolades his Lakers should have received following their tremendous Game 1 win. The Celtics won the next three games and looked ready to close out L.A. in Game 5. However, the Lakers won the next two games, setting the stage for another classic Game 7 in the Boston Garden.

The [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Division]] champion [[Boston Celtics]] faced the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Division]] champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in a best-of-seven series that the Celtics won 4 games to 3. For the Celtics this was their tenth straight finals appearance, which tied a North American professional sports record set by the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Montreal Canadiens]] from 1951 to 1960.\n\nThus Boston won its 8th consecutive league title, which no other team has achieved in North American professional sports competition. Before Game 2, after the Los Angeles Lakers' comeback overtime win in Game 1, Red Auerbach, who had challenged the entire league to topple the Celtics from their reign by announcing he would retire after 1965\u20131966 before the season had started (thus giving his detractors \"one last shot\" at him), announced Bill Russell as the Celtics coach for 1966\u20131967 and beyond. He would be the first African-American to coach in the NBA. Laker coach Fred Schaus privately fumed that Red's hiring had taken away all of the accolades his Lakers should have received following their tremendous Game 1 win. The Celtics won the next three games and looked ready to close out L.A. in Game 5. However, the Lakers won the next two games, setting the stage for another classic Game 7 in the Boston Garden. The Celtics raced out to a huge lead, and held off a late Los Angeles\nrally to capture the NBA title and send Red Auerbach out a champion.\n\nThis was the last NBA championship series until [[2016 NBA Finals|2016]] in which a team trailing 3 games to 1 rallied to force a Game 7. \n\n==Series summary==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Sundiata was the son of [[Nar\u00e9 Maghann Konat\u00e9]] (variation: ''Maghan Konfara'') and [[Sogolon Cond\u00e9]] (variations: \"Sogolon Kolonkan\" or \"Sogolon K\u00e9djou\", the daughter of the ''\"buffalo woman\"'', so called because of her ugliness and hunchback).<ref>Conrad, David C., ''Sunjata: a West African epic of the Mande peoples'' (eds David C.

She was constantly teased and ridiculed openly for her son's disability. This significantly affected Sundiata and he was determined to do everything he possibly could in order to walk like his peers. Through this determination, he one day miraculously got up and walked. Among his peers, he became a leader. His paternal half-brother, [[Dankaran Touman]], and Dankaran's mother, [[Sassouma Beret\u00e9]], were cruel and resentful of Sundiata and his mother. Their cruelty escalated after the death of Nar\u00e9 Maghann (the king and father of Sundiata). To escape persecution and threats on her son's life, Sogolon took her children, Sundiata and his sisters, into exile. This exile lasted for many years and took them to different countries within the [[Ghana Empire]] and eventually to [[Mema]] where the king of Mema granted them asylum. Sundiata was admired by the King of Mema for his courage and tenacity. As such, he was given a senior position within the kingdom. When King [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]] of [[Sosso Empire|Sosso]] conquered the Mandinka people, messengers were sent to go and look for Sogolon and her children, as Sundiata was destined to be a great leader according to prophecy. Upon finding him in Mema, they persuaded him to come back in order to liberate the Mandinkas and their homeland. On his return, he was accompanied by an army given to him by the King of Mema. The [[warlord]]s of Mali at the time who were his age group included: Tabon Wana, Kamadia Kamara (or Kamadia Camara), Faony Cond\u00e9, Siara Kuman Konat\u00e9 and [[Tiramakhan Traore]] (many variations: \"Trimaghan\" or \"Tiramaghan\", future conqueror of [[Kaabu]]). It was on the plain of [[Siby, Mali|Siby]] (var: Sibi) where they formed a pact brotherhood in order to liberate their country and people from the powerful Sosso king. At [[Battle of Kirina|The Battle of Kirina]], Sundiata and his allies defeated the Sosso king, and he became the first [[Emperor]] of the [[Mali Empire]]. He was the first of the Mandinka line of kings to adopt the royal title ''[[Mansa (title)|Mansa]]'' (''king'' or ''emperor'' in the [[Mandinka language]]).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=o5L-T9e4KY8C&pg=PA154&dq=Mansa,+meaning+Sultan+or+king&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEif22jr7JAhUDXhoKHRHQDZ8Q6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=Mansa%2C%20meaning%20Sultan%20or%20king&f=false An Interview with Ibn Battuta], Kathleen Knoblock, ''Primary Source Fluency Activities: World Cultures'' (In Sub-Saharan Africa), pub.

The name ''Sogolon'' derives from his mother and ''Jata'' means ''lion''. It is the traditional way of praising someone in some [[West Africa]]n societies ([[Gambia]], [[Senegal]], [[Mali]] and [[Guinea]] in particular). The name ''Sundiata'' praises him through his mother which means ''\"the lion of Sogolon\"'' or ''\"Sogolon's lion\"''. The name ''Jata'' derives from ''Jara'' (lion). Jara and many of its variations such as ''jata'', ''jala'' or ''jada'' are merely regional variations, from Gambia, Guinea or Mali, for instance. Sundiata's name is thus a derivation of his mother's name Songolon (''Son'' or its variation ''Sun'') and Jata (lion).<ref name=\"Conrad Sunjata xxxv\">Conrad, David C., ''Sunjata: a West African epic of the Mande peoples'' (eds David C.

He, Soumaoro, was known as the sorcerer king, for he was adept in the magical arts, though he used them to propel his tyrannical schemes. With great magical ability, a mighty army of blacksmiths, and a dictator's character, any place under his rule despised him. He was especially known as a notoriously cruel leader, stealing wives and queens from their (royal) families, pillaging conquered territories, and killing anyone who opposed his rule. He would soon conquer nine kingdoms in the Ghana Empire before conquering the Mandinka people of Mali, Sundiata\u2019s home, and Balla Fasseke, Sundiata\u2019s lost griot. His crudeness was not spared in Mali either, and he ruled with an iron fist. Upon knowledge of Sundiata returning to Mali from his asylum in Mema, Soumaoro, too busy fighting off Fakoli, sent his son, Sosso Balla. Moreover, Sosso, who was around the same age as Sundiata, was to intercept and relinquish Sundiata\u2019s army before they reached Tabon, a pivotal location on Sundiata\u2019s journey to Mali. This was a grave mistake by Soumaoro, however, for Sundiata\u2019s force was much too overwhelming for Sosso Balla and his leadership, leading to their eventual destruction at the hands of Sundiata at this battle, almost killing Sosso Balla in the process. Sosso Balla, in shame for dishonoring his father with failure, came back in defeat to his father\u2019s dismay. Fakoli Koroma, who Soumaoro was busy fighting instead of Sundiata, was the insurgent nephew of Soumaoro, who rebelled against his uncle when Soumaoro took his wife. Moreover, this happened soon after Sundiata and Soumaoro\u2019s first encounter in which Fakoli, Soumaoro\u2019s general at the time, defeated Sundiata. After all Fakoli did for Soumaoro, this angered him deeply and Fakoli soon fought against Soumaoro, eventually fighting side by side with Sundiata\u2019s forces against the common enemy, the sorcerer king. At the battle of Krina, Soumaoro was finally defeated by an enchanted arrow thrown from Sundiata, that is said to have weakened his magical shield, and an overwhelming military front by Sundiata\u2019s generals. Soumaoro did not die instantly from this arrow, but he would soon die hobbling to the insides of a cave.\n\n==Surname (Keita or Konat\u00e9?)==\n{{see also|Keita Dynasty}}\nSome Bambaras and Mandinkas have proposed that the name ''Keita'' actually means ''inheritor'' ([[heir-apparent]]) in the [[Mandinka language]], and that Sundiata's real surname is ''Konat\u00e9'' (French spelling in [[Mali]]) or ''Konateh'', variations: Konate, Conateh (English spelling in the [[Gambia]] where the Mandinkas make up the largest ethnic group). It is proposed that Sundiata Keita's father, [[Nar\u00e9 Maghann Konat\u00e9]], took the real family name ''Konat\u00e9'' while his successors were \"Keitas in waiting\" (heirs to the throne).<ref name=\"Conrad Sunjata xxxv\" /> The name ''Keita'' is a [[clan]] name rather than a [[surname]].<ref>[[BBC World Service]], see: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter3.shtml See: BBC World Service, The Story of Africa, ''West African Kingdoms'' (under Origins).]</ref> Although in some West African societies a clan can be similar to the family name (see [[Joof family]]), such similarities do not exist between the names ''Keita'' and ''Konat\u00e9''. Both points of contention agree that Keita is not a real surname, but rather a royal name, in spite of the fact that Sundiata is referred to as Sundiata Keita in many scholarly works. At present, there is no consensus among the scholars regarding the name ''Sundiata Konat\u00e9.''\n\n==Battle of Kirina==\n{{further|Battle of Kirina|Military history of the Mali Empire}}\n[[File:Djenne Terracotta Archer (13th-15th cent).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Terracotta archer figure from [[Mali]] (13th-15th century), with a [[quiver]] on his back.

Sundiata was the son of [[Nar\u00e9 Maghann Konat\u00e9]] (variation: ''Maghan Konfara'') and [[Sogolon Cond\u00e9]] (variations: \"Sogolon Kolonkan\" or \"Sogolon K\u00e9djou\", the daughter of the ''\"buffalo woman\"'', so called because of her ugliness and hunchback).<ref>Conrad, David C., ''Sunjata: a West African epic of the Mande peoples'' (eds David C.

She was constantly teased and ridiculed openly for her son's disability. This significantly affected Sundiata and he was determined to do everything he possibly could in order to walk like his peers. Through this determination, he one day miraculously got up and walked. Among his peers, he became a leader. His paternal half-brother, [[Dankaran Touman]], and Dankaran's mother, [[Sassouma Beret\u00e9]], were cruel and resentful of Sundiata and his mother. Their cruelty escalated after the death of Nar\u00e9 Maghann (the king and father of Sundiata). To escape persecution and threats on her son's life, Sogolon took her children, Sundiata and his sisters, into exile. This exile lasted for many years and took them to different countries within the [[Ghana Empire]] and eventually to [[Mema]] where the king of Mema granted them asylum. Sundiata was admired by the King of Mema for his courage and tenacity. As such, he was given a senior position within the kingdom. When King [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]] of [[Sosso Empire|Sosso]] conquered the Mandinka people, messengers were sent to go and look for Sogolon and her children, as Sundiata was destined to be a great leader according to prophecy. Upon finding him in Mema, they persuaded him to come back in order to liberate the Mandinkas and their homeland. On his return, he was accompanied by an army given to him by the King of Mema. The [[warlord]]s of Mali at the time who were his age group included: Tabon Wana, Kamadia Kamara (or Kamadia Camara), Faony Cond\u00e9, Siara Kuman Konat\u00e9 and [[Tiramakhan Traore]] (many variations: \"Trimaghan\" or \"Tiramaghan\", future conqueror of [[Kaabu]]). It was on the plain of [[Siby, Mali|Siby]] (var: Sibi) where they formed a pact brotherhood in order to liberate their country and people from the powerful Sosso king. At [[Battle of Kirina|The Battle of Kirina]], Sundiata and his allies defeated the Sosso king, and he became the first [[Emperor]] of the [[Mali Empire]]. He was the first of the Mandinka line of kings to adopt the royal title ''[[Mansa (title)|Mansa]]'' (''king'' or ''emperor'' in the [[Mandinka language]]).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=o5L-T9e4KY8C&pg=PA154&dq=Mansa,+meaning+Sultan+or+king&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEif22jr7JAhUDXhoKHRHQDZ8Q6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=Mansa%2C%20meaning%20Sultan%20or%20king&f=false An Interview with Ibn Battuta], Kathleen Knoblock, ''Primary Source Fluency Activities: World Cultures'' (In Sub-Saharan Africa), pub.

The name ''Sogolon'' derives from his mother and ''Jata'' means ''lion''. It is the traditional way of praising someone in some [[West Africa]]n societies ([[Gambia]], [[Senegal]], [[Mali]] and [[Guinea]] in particular). The name ''Sundiata'' praises him through his mother which means ''\"the lion of Sogolon\"'' or ''\"Sogolon's lion\"''. The name ''Jata'' derives from ''Jara'' (lion). Jara and many of its variations such as ''jata'', ''jala'' or ''jada'' are merely regional variations, from Gambia, Guinea or Mali, for instance. Sundiata's name is thus a derivation of his mother's name Songolon (''Son'' or its variation ''Sun'') and Jata (lion).<ref name=\"Conrad Sunjata xxxv\">Conrad, David C., ''Sunjata: a West African epic of the Mande peoples'' (eds David C. Conrad, Djanka Tassey Cond\u00e9, trans. David C.

He, Soumaoro, was known as the sorcerer king, for he was adept in the magical arts, though he used them to propel his tyrannical schemes. With great magical ability, a mighty army of blacksmiths, and a dictator's character, any place under his rule despised him. He was especially known as a notoriously cruel leader, stealing wives and queens from their (royal) families, pillaging conquered territories, and killing anyone who opposed his rule. He would soon conquer nine kingdoms in the Ghana Empire before conquering the Mandinka people of Mali, Sundiata\u2019s home, and Balla Fasseke, Sundiata\u2019s lost griot. His crudeness was not spared in Mali either, and he ruled with an iron fist. Upon knowledge of Sundiata returning to Mali from his asylum in Mema, Soumaoro, too busy fighting off Fakoli, sent his son, Sosso Balla. Moreover, Sosso, who was around the same age as Sundiata, was to intercept and relinquish Sundiata\u2019s army before they reached Tabon, a pivotal location on Sundiata\u2019s journey to Mali. This was a grave mistake by Soumaoro, however, for Sundiata\u2019s force was much too overwhelming for Sosso Balla and his leadership, leading to their eventual destruction at the hands of Sundiata at this battle, almost killing Sosso Balla in the process. Sosso Balla, in shame for dishonoring his father with failure, came back in defeat to his father\u2019s dismay. Fakoli Koroma, who Soumaoro was busy fighting instead of Sundiata, was the insurgent nephew of Soumaoro, who rebelled against his uncle when Soumaoro took his wife. Moreover, this happened soon after Sundiata and Soumaoro\u2019s first encounter in which Fakoli, Soumaoro\u2019s general at the time, defeated Sundiata. After all Fakoli did for Soumaoro, this angered him deeply and Fakoli soon fought against Soumaoro, eventually fighting side by side with Sundiata\u2019s forces against the common enemy, the sorcerer king. At the battle of Krina, Soumaoro was finally defeated by an enchanted arrow thrown from Sundiata, that is said to have weakened his magical shield, and an overwhelming military front by Sundiata\u2019s generals.

It is proposed that Sundiata Keita's father, [[Nar\u00e9 Maghann Konat\u00e9]], took the real family name ''Konat\u00e9'' while his successors were \"Keitas in waiting\" (heirs to the throne).<ref name=\"Conrad Sunjata xxxv\" /> The name ''Keita'' is a [[clan]] name rather than a [[surname]].<ref>[[BBC World Service]], see: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter3.shtml See: BBC World Service, The Story of Africa, ''West African Kingdoms'' (under Origins).]</ref> Although in some West African societies a clan can be similar to the family name (see [[Joof family]]), such similarities do not exist between the names ''Keita'' and ''Konat\u00e9''. Both points of contention agree that Keita is not a real surname, but rather a royal name, in spite of the fact that Sundiata is referred to as Sundiata Keita in many scholarly works. At present, there is no consensus among the scholars regarding the name ''Sundiata Konat\u00e9.''\n\n==Battle of Kirina==\n{{further|Battle of Kirina|Military history of the Mali Empire}}\n[[File:Djenne Terracotta Archer (13th-15th cent).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Terracotta archer figure from [[Mali]] (13th-15th century), with a [[quiver]] on his back.

The abductions are traced to Dr. Maaran, a world-famous doctor from [[Chennai]] known for providing {{INR}}5 treatment to patients of all sections of society. Maaran is arrested and interrogated by Ratnavel \"Randy\", a police officer who is assigned the abduction case. Maaran explains his motive for the abductions; An Auto Driver's daughter had been severely injured and  the four were responsible for the death of the auto driver's school-going daughter and his wife due to their greed for money in the name of providing proper healthcare. He adds that he had also killed all of them while they were in his captivity.\n\nAt this juncture, Maaran reveals that he is not Maaran but is his [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] Vetri, a [[Magician (illusionist)|magician]].Vetri was responsible for the death of Dr. Arjun Zachariah, a corrupt doctor who was killed during a stage performance in Paris two years earlier,by Vetri himself by using  Anupallavi who is also his love interest. He further adds that he had saved Maaran from getting killed by the henchmen of Dr. Daniel Arockiyaraj.Daniel,another corrupt doctor had been associated with Arjun who sees Maaran's inexpensive healthcare as a threat to his flourishing hospital business.After beating them up,Vetri knocks out Maaran unconscious and swaps place with him.Then he provides clues to the police which led to his arrest as showed in the beginning. Maaran is rescued, while Vetri, with the help of his magic tricks, manages to escape from Randy.\n\nLater, Maaran confronts Vetri and fights him, believing him to be the cause of all his problems with the law as well as with Daniel, who had threatened Maaran to reveal the location of Vetri while keeping his mother Sarala and fianc\u00e9e Tara hostage. Vadivu, Maaran's compounder and also Vetri's assistant, intervenes in their fight and explains to Maaran why Vetri is targeting doctors indulging in corrupt medical practices in general and Daniel and Arjun in particular.\n\nMaaran was the elder son of Vetrimaaran, a village [[wrestling|wrestler]].Vetrimaaran being referred as Thalapathy by his villagers,decides to build a temple in his area.He holds a large scale event for the building day with a festive mode.However,a fire had started causing many people and children to get injured and two children had died due to their lack of mobility.By the advice of Ice,Vetrimaaran had established a hospital with the help of a younger Daniel and Arjun in his village Manoor in [[Madurai district]]. Daniel and Arjun were also made as the chief doctors of the hospital.\n\nHowever, it soon turns out that Daniel and Arjun were money-minded crooks and performed a [[Caesarean section]] on Vetrimaaran's wife Aishwarya \"Ice\" when she was in labour with her second child, with the intention of extracting more money from Vetrimaaran, even though she could deliver the child [[vaginal delivery|normally]]. Ice lost a lot of blood during the operation, and that, along with an overdose of [[anaesthesia]], led to her death, while the child was declared [[stillborn]]. When Vetrimaaran found out how Ice had died, he went to confront Daniel, empty beer bottles start to hit him and the back of Vetrimaaran was stabbed to death by one of Daniel's henchmen, but just before he died, he placed an unconscious Maaran (who had been struck on the head with a glass bottle by Daniel's henchman) safely on a Chennai-bound lorry. Due to the impact the glass bottle had on his head, Maaran lost his memory and is unable to recollect anything that happened before he was hit on the head.\n\nMeanwhile, Vetrimaaran's second child did not turn out to be stillborn, and this child was none other than Vetri. Vetri was adopted by a famous magician named Salim Ghosh, and it was from him that Vetri learnt all his magic tricks. On hearing Vadivu's story, Maaran reconciles with Vetri and takes his place when police come to arrest Vetri. With Vetri (who is actually Maaran) seemingly in custody, Daniel tries to make a deal with Maaran (who is actually Vetri) to shut down his practice. However, when he finds out the truth, he rushes to Vetri's hideout, bringing with him an unconscious Maaran, who had met with an accident orchestrated by Daniel while he was being taken to court, with the intention of killing both Vetri and Maaran. However, Vetri and Maaran, with the help of their respective professional skills, team up to kill Daniel.\n\nLater, however, Vetri is arrested for his role in the murders of Daniel and Arjun as well as the four people killed earlier in the film and is sentenced to prison for an unspecified period of time. Before going to jail, he gives a press conference justifying his actions and adds that he would continue with the murders until all doctors and hospital staff indulging in corrupt practices are eliminated. In prison, Vetri watches a news report in which a young girl in [[Odisha]] had died due to negligent medical treatment. On hearing this, Vetri escapes with the help of his magic tricks, thus continuing his mission. In a mid-credits scene, Maaran is conferred a statewide recognised medical counsellor post, which he accepts.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in a triple role as\n**Vetrimaaran, a village wrestler, commonly referred by the people as \"Thalapathy\" and who gets killed by Daniel and Kasi\n**Dr. Maaran, Vetrimaaran's first son, a doctor who serves people for just 5 rupees and gets conferred a statewide medical counsellor post\n**Vetri, Vetrimaaran's second son, a magician and Maaran's younger brother who gets arrested for his role in the murders\n* [[Kajal Aggarwal]] as Anu Pallavi, Vetri's love interest, a doctor and Arjun's assistant\n* [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] as Thara, a media anchor and Maaran's love interest\n* [[Nithya Menen]] as Aishwarya \"Ice\" Vetrimaaran, Vetrimaaran's wife who dies in a hospital due to blood loss and overdose of anaesthesia \n* [[S.

The abductions are traced to Dr. Maaran, a world-famous doctor from [[Chennai]] known for providing {{INR}}5 treatment to patients of all sections of society. Maaran is arrested and interrogated by Ratnavel \"Randy\", a police officer who is assigned the abduction case. Maaran explains his motive for the abductions; An Auto Driver's daughter had been severely injured and  the four were responsible for the death of the auto driver's school-going daughter and his wife due to their greed for money in the name of providing proper healthcare. He adds that he had also killed all of them while they were in his captivity.\n\nAt this juncture, Maaran reveals that he is not Maaran but is his [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] Vetri, a [[Magician (illusionist)|magician]].Vetri was responsible for the death of Dr. Arjun Zachariah, a corrupt doctor who was killed during a stage performance in Paris two years earlier,by Vetri himself by using  Anupallavi who is also his love interest. He further adds that he had saved Maaran from getting killed by the henchmen of Dr. Daniel Arockiyaraj.Daniel,another corrupt doctor had been associated with Arjun who sees Maaran's inexpensive healthcare as a threat to his flourishing hospital business.After beating them up,Vetri knocks out Maaran unconscious and swaps place with him.Then he provides clues to the police which led to his arrest as showed in the beginning. Maaran is rescued, while Vetri, with the help of his magic tricks, manages to escape from Randy.\n\nLater, Maaran confronts Vetri and fights him, believing him to be the cause of all his problems with the law as well as with Daniel, who had threatened Maaran to reveal the location of Vetri while keeping his mother Sarala and fianc\u00e9e Tara hostage. Vadivu, Maaran's compounder and also Vetri's assistant, intervenes in their fight and explains to Maaran why Vetri is targeting doctors indulging in corrupt medical practices in general and Daniel and Arjun in particular.\n\nMaaran was the elder son of Vetrimaaran, a village [[wrestling|wrestler]].Vetrimaaran being referred as Thalapathy by his villagers,decides to build a temple in his area.He holds a large scale event for the building day with a festive mode.However,a fire had started causing many people and children to get injured and two children had died due to their lack of mobility.By the advice of Ice,Vetrimaaran had established a hospital with the help of a younger Daniel and Arjun in his village Manoor in [[Madurai district]]. Daniel and Arjun were also made as the chief doctors of the hospital.\n\nHowever, it soon turns out that Daniel and Arjun were money-minded crooks and performed a [[Caesarean section]] on Vetrimaaran's wife Aishwarya \"Ice\" when she was in labour with her second child, with the intention of extracting more money from Vetrimaaran, even though she could deliver the child [[vaginal delivery|normally]]. Ice lost a lot of blood during the operation, and that, along with an overdose of [[anaesthesia]], led to her death, while the child was declared [[stillborn]]. When Vetrimaaran found out how Ice had died, he went to confront Daniel, empty beer bottles start to hit him and the back of Vetrimaaran was stabbed to death by one of Daniel's henchmen, but just before he died, he placed an unconscious Maaran (who had been struck on the head with a glass bottle by Daniel's henchman) safely on a Chennai-bound lorry. Due to the impact the glass bottle had on his head, Maaran lost his memory and is unable to recollect anything that happened before he was hit on the head.\n\nMeanwhile, Vetrimaaran's second child did not turn out to be stillborn, and this child was none other than Vetri. Vetri was adopted by a famous magician named Salim Ghosh, and it was from him that Vetri learnt all his magic tricks. On hearing Vadivu's story, Maaran reconciles with Vetri and takes his place when police come to arrest Vetri. With Vetri (who is actually Maaran) seemingly in custody, Daniel tries to make a deal with Maaran (who is actually Vetri) to shut down his practice. However, when he finds out the truth, he rushes to Vetri's hideout, bringing with him an unconscious Maaran, who had met with an accident orchestrated by Daniel while he was being taken to court, with the intention of killing both Vetri and Maaran. However, Vetri and Maaran, with the help of their respective professional skills, team up to kill Daniel.\n\nLater, however, Vetri is arrested for his role in the murders of Daniel and Arjun as well as the four people killed earlier in the film and is sentenced to prison for an unspecified period of time. Before going to jail, he gives a press conference justifying his actions and adds that he would continue with the murders until all doctors and hospital staff indulging in corrupt practices are eliminated. In prison, Vetri watches a news report in which a young girl in [[Odisha]] had died due to negligent medical treatment. On hearing this, Vetri escapes with the help of his magic tricks, thus continuing his mission. In a mid-credits scene, Maaran is conferred a statewide recognised medical counsellor post, which he accepts.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in a triple role as\n**Vetrimaaran, a village wrestler, commonly referred by the people as \"Thalapathy\" and who gets killed by Daniel and Kasi\n**Dr. Maaran, Vetrimaaran's first son, a doctor who serves people for just 5 rupees and gets conferred a statewide medical counsellor post\n**Vetri, Vetrimaaran's second son, a magician and Maaran's younger brother who gets arrested for his role in the murders\n* [[Kajal Aggarwal]] as Anu Pallavi, Vetri's love interest, a doctor and Arjun's assistant\n* [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] as Thara, a media anchor and Maaran's love interest\n* [[Nithya Menen]] as Aishwarya \"Ice\" Vetrimaaran, Vetrimaaran's wife who dies in a hospital due to blood loss and overdose of anaesthesia \n* [[S.
