[[musical theatre]] in London's [[West_End_theatre|West End]], on [[Broadway_Theatre|Broadway]] and internationally.\n\n==Early life==\n\nGareth John Owen was born in [[Sheffield]], [[United Kingdom]], a son of two teachers, both of whom specialised in special needs. At the age of nine the family, now including a younger sister, moved to the [[Cayman Islands]] where Owen attended Cayman Islands Middle School, while nurturing a life long love of the ocean. Upon returning to the UK the family, missing the warm weather and sea air, moved to [[St_Ives,_Cornwall|St. Ives]] in [[Cornwall]] at the south-western tip of the UK. Here Owen attended both [[Mounts_Bay_Academy|Mounts Bay School]] and [[Truro_and_Penwith_College|Penwith Sixth Form College]] before heading to [[University_of_Plymouth|Plymouth University]] in [[Plymouth]], UK, to study for a Bachelor's Degree in Underwater [[Science]]. At various points, Owen has worked as a grocery packer, [[marina]] fuel attendant, [[milkman]], [[Q-Zar|Quasar]] attendant, commercial boatman, pool lifeguard, [[Muay_Thai|thai-boxing]] instructor, and [[Surf_lifesaving|beach lifeguard]]. He also worked extensively in nightclubs as a lighting jockey, [[Bouncer_(doorman)|doorman]], [[Disc_jockey|DJ]], [[Promoter_(entertainment)|promoter]] and [[Production_manager_(music)|production manager]].\n\n==Career==\n\nOwen was nominated for his first [[Tony Award]] in 2010 for his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of [[Trevor Nunn]]'s musical, ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' starring [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Angela Lansbury]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/awardperson.asp?id=485023 |title=IBDB Person Awards |work=Internet Broadway Database |access-date=4 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023134441/http://www.ibdb.com/awardperson.asp?id=485023 |archive-date=23 October 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nHe was then nominated for an [[Olivier Award]] for his [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Terry Johnson (dramatist)|Terry Johnson]]'s musical, [[End of the Rainbow]] starring multi-award-winning [[Tracie Bennett]] as [[Judy Garland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item114060/Best-Sound-Design/ |title=Olivier Award for Sound Design |work=The Olivier Awards |access-date=14 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110714235819/http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item114060/Best-Sound-Design/ |archive-date=14 July 2011 |df= }}</ref> The show later transferred to Broadway where he went on to pick up a further Tony nomination for Best Sound Design.\n\nIn recent years Owen collected a 2nd Oliver nomination for ''[[Top Hat (musical)|Top Hat]]'', and, after five nominations, finally won the Oliver for Best Sound Design in 2014 with the London production of ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]''.\n\nIn 2015 Owen won the Olivier for Sound Design for the second consecutive year, this time for [[Memphis (musical)|Memphis]] at the Shaftesbury Theatre, starring [[Beverley Knight]]. Composed by [[David Bryan]] from [[Bon Jovi]], and directed by [[Christopher Ashley]], this marked his sixth win/nomination in a row. He also received the prestigious Pro Sound Award for his work on the same production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prosoundawards.com//|title=Pro Sound Award for Best Theatre Sound|work=The Pro Sound Awards|accessdate=23 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Owen won several awards for the Broadway musical [[Come from Away|''Come From Away'']] including the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] and the [[Craig Noel|Craig Noel Award]], as well as a [[Helen Hayes Award]] nomination.\n\nGareth has worked on over two hundred and seventy-five commercial sound designs throughout the world including:

The [[Cowbridge with Llanblethian]] [[Community (Wales)|community]] and civil parish elects a Town Council.<ref>[http://www.cowbridge-tc.gov.uk/about-the-council/ About Cowbridge (Ancient Borough) with Llanblethian Town Council], Cowbridge (Ancient Borough) with Llanblethian Town Council. Retrieved 10 April 2016.</ref> Cowbridge is approximately {{convert|12|mi|}} west of the centre of [[Cardiff]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe town is first recorded as ''Pontyfon'', (with ''mon'' or ''fon'' meaning cow in [[Old Welsh]]), and as ''Pontyfuwch'' (bridge of the cow in modern Welsh) by 1645. The modern Welsh name, ''Y Bont-faen'', translates as 'the stone bridge'. The English name is a direct translation of the older Welsh name of the town.<ref>Wyn Owen, H. and Morgan, R. (2008) ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''. Llandysul: Gomer.</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Roman times===\n{{main|Cowbridge (Roman town)}}\nThe town lies on the site of a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlement identified by some scholars as the [[Roman fort|fort]] of ''Bovium'' (cow-place). Recent excavations have revealed extensive Roman settlement;<ref>The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008.</ref> the town lies alongside a [[Roman road]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Llanblethian, Nr Cowbridge - geograph.org.uk - 856571.jpg|thumb|Llanblethian (June 2008)]]\nThe town centre is still arranged on its [[medieval]] plan, with one long street divided into \"[[burgage plots]]\". It is one of very few medieval [[walled town]]s in Wales, and substantial portions of the walls, together with the south gate, are still standing. On 13 March 1254, Cowbridge received its first borough charter from [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester|Richard de Clare]],<ref>''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''. John Davies, [[Nigel Jenkins]], Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg174. {{ISBN|978-0-7083-1953-6}}</ref> the Lord of Glamorgan. Richard de Clare was one of the most powerful Barons of the day, having huge estates stretching across much of south Wales and also lands in southeast England.\n\nThe [[Cowbridge town wall|town walls]] were built sometime in the latter half of the 13th century.<ref name=\"GG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cofiadurcahcymru.org.uk/arch/query/page.php?watprn=GGAT00248s|title=Cowbridge Town Wall |publisher=The Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Historic Environment Record|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> From 1243, de Clare was actively extending his authority in Glamorgan. In 1245, he seized the manors of Llanblethian, Ruthin and Talyfan from Richard Siward, and the lordships of [[Miskin]] and Glynrhondda from Hywel ap Maredudd. In Llanblethian he founded the town of Cowbridge and in Miskin he founded the castle and town of [[Llantrisant]]. The largely medieval church of the Holy Cross was initially a [[chapel of ease]] to the parish church at Llanblethian. In 1307 [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford|Earl Gilbert de Clare]], grandson of Richard de Clare, began work on the stone fortifications of [[St Quintins Castle]] in Llanblethian.\n\nThe [[Battle of Stalling Down]] was fought near Cowbridge between an English army, serving [[Henry IV of England]] and a combined force of French and Welsh soldiers under [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] in 1403.  Details of the battle, its exact site and its outcome are scant, but the site has been recognised by [[Cadw]] for possible inclusion in a Register of Historic Battlefields in Wales.<ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/battle-sites-set-official-status-1834514 Wales Online, \"Battle sites set to get official status\", 19 May 2011]. Accessed 18 August 2013</ref>\n\n===Georgian times===\n[[File:Cowbridge Clock Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Cowbridge clock tower presented by the [[Bishop of Llandaff]] in 1836]]\nThe 18th century [[antiquary]], [[Iolo Morganwg]], inventor of the present-day rituals of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], kept a bookshop in the High Street, the location of which is now marked with a plaque inscribed with the words ''Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd'' (\"Truth against the world\") in [[Roman script|Roman]] and [[Coelbren y Beirdd]] script. It was just outside the town that he held the first meeting of the [[Gorsedd]], an assembly of bards, in 1795. [[Cowbridge Grammar School]] was founded in 1608 and had close links with [[Jesus College, Oxford]] through its later benefactor, Dr [[Leoline Jenkins]]. Its famous pupils included the poet [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]] and the actor Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]]. The old [[grammar school]] eventually merged with Cowbridge High School for Girls to become a [[comprehensive school]], and the original buildings, having for some time lain derelict, have been converted into private accommodation.\n\n===Notable buildings===\n[[File:Boxing Day Hunt in Cowbridge.jpg|thumb|Boxing Day Hunt in Cowbridge]]\nThe present [[Cowbridge Town Hall]], a building whose foundations date back perhaps as far as the [[Elizabethan era]], served as a prison until 1830, when it was converted into a town hall to replace the former [[Guild Hall]], demolished at that date. The New Palladian Town Hall was built in 1830 by Isaiah Verity of Ash Hall who in gratitude was made a Freeman of Cowbridge. The money for the reconstruction was raised by public subscription.\n\nEight of the original prison cells are still intact, six of which house the exhibits of Cowbridge Museum.<ref>[http://www.cowbridge-tc.gov.uk/abtcouncil.html Cowbridge (Ancient Borough) with Llanblethian Town Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143320/http://cowbridge-tc.gov.uk/abtcouncil.html |date=2014-07-14 }}. Accessed 11 June 2013</ref> The remainder of the building is used by the town council and for public events. The museum holds archaeological finds from Cowbridge and district, as well as displays on the later history of the town, including industrial and domestic artefacts, a photographic collection, and a small historical costume collection.\n\nThe main street contains a number of [[Georgian era|Georgian]] houses, including the former town houses of important local families such as the Edmondes and Carnes. The Carnes' town house is known as Great House, a Grade 2* listed property of Medieval origin.\n\n===Modern times===\nCowbridge contains the following [[public house|inns]]: the Bear Hotel, the Horse and Groom, the Edmondes Arms, the Duke of Wellington and the Vale of Glamorgan. The latter is located at the premises of the former Vale of Glamorgan Brewery.\n\nClosely attached to the town of Cowbridge is the village of Aberthin. Aberthin contains two inns; The Hare and Hounds and The Farmers Arms.\n\nCowbridge once had a railway station, which opened in 1865 and closed in 1951.\n\nOn the 21 March 1950 a [[Bristol Freighter]] (Registration: G-AHJJ) on a test flight took off from [[Bristol Filton Airport]]. The aircraft crashed near Cowbridge after a structural failure of the fuselage. It caused the aircraft to enter spin and crash. The accident killed all four  passengers and crew on board.<ref>http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19500321-0</ref>\n\nCowbridge was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=These towns have been named as the best places to live in Wales|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/towns-named-best-places-wales-12719747|publisher=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nA [[Cowbridge (electoral ward)|Cowbridge]] [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] exists for elections to the [[Vale of Glamorgan Council]]. This ward includes Cowbridge and Llanblethian but stretches south to Llanfair. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,180.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/cowbridge-w05000638#sthash.Ns7sQoDJ.dpbs|title=Ward population 2011 |accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Schools==\n[[Cowbridge Comprehensive School]] has approximately 1500 pupils, and is one of the best performing [[secondary school]]s in Wales. It achieved 94% A*-C at GCSE in 2010. The school was located on three sites, with the Lower School in the south-west of the town and Middle School and [[Sixth Form]] in the north-east. Cowbridge Comprehensive School completed a major redevelopment in September 2010 to bring the entire school to one site (the former Middle School/Sixth Form site) using [[Welsh Assembly Government]] funding.<ref>[http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/our_council/council/minutes,_agendas__reports/reports/cabinet/2008/08-12-03/cowbridge_school.aspx Vale of Glamorgan Council]</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, the new school was officially opened to students. All approximately 1300 students can now be found on the one site instead of the three separate buildings that were all situated in different locations in Cowbridge. The former sixth form site on Aberthin Road is now derelict and awaiting redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pyke|first1=Chris|title=The grand derelict buildings currently for sale in Wales|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/commercial-property/grand-derelict-buildings-currently-sale-14508193|website=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\nY Bontfaen primary school in Borough Close has a roll of about 245 including the nursery Y Blodau Fach.\nYsgol Iolo Morganwg with Y Meithrin (\"the nursery\") is adjacent and is a Welsh speaking school.\n\n==Sport==\nCowbridge is home to [[Cowbridge RFC]] a [[Welsh Rugby Union]] affiliated [[rugby union]] team, which fields two senior, a youth and ladies team.\nCowbridge Cricket Club first played in 1840 and now has six senior and junior teams and is affiliated to the South Wales Cricket Association. Notable cricketers who have played for the club include former test players Hugh Morris, John Clay, [[Tony Lewis]], C F Walters and on one famous occasion [[Douglas Jardine]]. Among the many county cricketers produced by the club are the Glamorgan players Ben Wright and [[Alex Jones (cricketer)|Alex Jones]]. Glamorgan CCC played county fixtures at Cowbridge in the 1930s.\n\nCowbridge also has a leisure centre where can be found various clubs including, tennis, football and badminton. Behind Cowbridge Leisure Centre is Cowbridge Bowling Club and tennis courts.\n\nSeptember 2009 also saw the reintroduction of senior football to Cowbridge Town after a ten-year absence. Starting in the third tier of the Vale of Glamorgan Amateur Football League the team achieved great success in their first season back, achieving an unlikely cup-promotion double. The 2011-12 season saw the club gain their second promotion in three years to reach the premier division.\n\n==Cultural Activities==\nCowbridge is also home to the Cowbridge Amateur Dramatic Society (CADS), based at the Market Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Market Theatre|url=http://www.market-theatre.com/}}</ref> CADS was formed in 1947 and aims to stage three main productions each year. The Society also publishes a newsletter, ''\"The Thespian\"'', three or four times each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Market Theatre|url=http://www.market-theatre.com|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1997, when it 'outgrew' the Town Hall stage, Cowbridge was also home to the Cowbridge Amateur Operatic Society (CAOS).  Founded by a small group of enthusiasts, its first production was  \"The Pirates of Penzance\" in 1969.  CAOS continued its Gilbert and Sullivan theme until 1974, when the show of the year was \"Die Fledermaus\".  Still going strong, and having grown a youth wing (Total CAOS), CAOS is now based at Llantwit Major.\n\nSince 2004, the town has hosted the annual [[Cowbridge Food and Drink Festival]]. Currently, the festival takes place in late spring having originally taken place every October. The festival incorporates various food and drink exhibitors, food court and fringe festival. Many of the town's inns hold beer, ale and cider events.\n\nIn 2010 the Cowbridge Music Festival was founded which takes place every autumn in various venues throughout the town. The festival is made up of classical music, jazz and folk music and boasts an excellent outreach programme.

The modern Welsh name, ''Y Bont-faen'', translates as 'the stone bridge'. The English name is a direct translation of the older Welsh name of the town.<ref>Wyn Owen, H. and Morgan, R. (2008) ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''. Llandysul: Gomer.</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Roman times===\n{{main|Cowbridge (Roman town)}}\nThe town lies on the site of a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlement identified by some scholars as the [[Roman fort|fort]] of ''Bovium'' (cow-place). Recent excavations have revealed extensive Roman settlement;<ref>The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008.</ref> the town lies alongside a [[Roman road]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Llanblethian, Nr Cowbridge - geograph.org.uk - 856571.jpg|thumb|Llanblethian (June 2008)]]\nThe town centre is still arranged on its [[medieval]] plan, with one long street divided into \"[[burgage plots]]\". It is one of very few medieval [[walled town]]s in Wales, and substantial portions of the walls, together with the south gate, are still standing. On 13 March 1254, Cowbridge received its first borough charter from [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester|Richard de Clare]],<ref>''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''.

Richard de Clare was one of the most powerful Barons of the day, having huge estates stretching across much of south Wales and also lands in southeast England.\n\nThe [[Cowbridge town wall|town walls]] were built sometime in the latter half of the 13th century.<ref name=\"GG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cofiadurcahcymru.org.uk/arch/query/page.php?watprn=GGAT00248s|title=Cowbridge Town Wall |publisher=The Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Historic Environment Record|accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> From 1243, de Clare was actively extending his authority in Glamorgan. In 1245, he seized the manors of Llanblethian, Ruthin and Talyfan from Richard Siward, and the lordships of [[Miskin]] and Glynrhondda from Hywel ap Maredudd. In Llanblethian he founded the town of Cowbridge and in Miskin he founded the castle and town of [[Llantrisant]]. The largely medieval church of the Holy Cross was initially a [[chapel of ease]] to the parish church at Llanblethian. In 1307 [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford|Earl Gilbert de Clare]], grandson of Richard de Clare, began work on the stone fortifications of [[St Quintins Castle]] in Llanblethian.\n\nThe [[Battle of Stalling Down]] was fought near Cowbridge between an English army, serving [[Henry IV of England]] and a combined force of French and Welsh soldiers under [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] in 1403.  Details of the battle, its exact site and its outcome are scant, but the site has been recognised by [[Cadw]] for possible inclusion in a Register of Historic Battlefields in Wales.<ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/battle-sites-set-official-status-1834514 Wales Online, \"Battle sites set to get official status\", 19 May 2011].

It was just outside the town that he held the first meeting of the [[Gorsedd]], an assembly of bards, in 1795. [[Cowbridge Grammar School]] was founded in 1608 and had close links with [[Jesus College, Oxford]] through its later benefactor, Dr [[Leoline Jenkins]]. Its famous pupils included the poet [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]] and the actor Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]]. The old [[grammar school]] eventually merged with Cowbridge High School for Girls to become a [[comprehensive school]], and the original buildings, having for some time lain derelict, have been converted into private accommodation.\n\n===Notable buildings===\n[[File:Boxing Day Hunt in Cowbridge.jpg|thumb|Boxing Day Hunt in Cowbridge]]\nThe present [[Cowbridge Town Hall]], a building whose foundations date back perhaps as far as the [[Elizabethan era]], served as a prison until 1830, when it was converted into a town hall to replace the former [[Guild Hall]], demolished at that date. The New Palladian Town Hall was built in 1830 by Isaiah Verity of Ash Hall who in gratitude was made a Freeman of Cowbridge. The money for the reconstruction was raised by public subscription.\n\nEight of the original prison cells are still intact, six of which house the exhibits of Cowbridge Museum.<ref>[http://www.cowbridge-tc.gov.uk/abtcouncil.html Cowbridge (Ancient Borough) with Llanblethian Town Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143320/http://cowbridge-tc.gov.uk/abtcouncil.html |date=2014-07-14 }}. Accessed 11 June 2013</ref> The remainder of the building is used by the town council and for public events. The museum holds archaeological finds from Cowbridge and district, as well as displays on the later history of the town, including industrial and domestic artefacts, a photographic collection, and a small historical costume collection.\n\nThe main street contains a number of [[Georgian era|Georgian]] houses, including the former town houses of important local families such as the Edmondes and Carnes. The Carnes' town house is known as Great House, a Grade 2* listed property of Medieval origin.\n\n===Modern times===\nCowbridge contains the following [[public house|inns]]: the Bear Hotel, the Horse and Groom, the Edmondes Arms, the Duke of Wellington and the Vale of Glamorgan. The latter is located at the premises of the former Vale of Glamorgan Brewery.\n\nClosely attached to the town of Cowbridge is the village of Aberthin. Aberthin contains two inns; The Hare and Hounds and The Farmers Arms.\n\nCowbridge once had a railway station, which opened in 1865 and closed in 1951.\n\nOn the 21 March 1950 a [[Bristol Freighter]] (Registration: G-AHJJ) on a test flight took off from [[Bristol Filton Airport]]. The aircraft crashed near Cowbridge after a structural failure of the fuselage. It caused the aircraft to enter spin and crash. The accident killed all four  passengers and crew on board.<ref>http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19500321-0</ref>\n\nCowbridge was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=These towns have been named as the best places to live in Wales|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/towns-named-best-places-wales-12719747|publisher=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nA [[Cowbridge (electoral ward)|Cowbridge]] [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] exists for elections to the [[Vale of Glamorgan Council]].

It achieved 94% A*-C at GCSE in 2010. The school was located on three sites, with the Lower School in the south-west of the town and Middle School and [[Sixth Form]] in the north-east. Cowbridge Comprehensive School completed a major redevelopment in September 2010 to bring the entire school to one site (the former Middle School/Sixth Form site) using [[Welsh Assembly Government]] funding.<ref>[http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/our_council/council/minutes,_agendas__reports/reports/cabinet/2008/08-12-03/cowbridge_school.aspx Vale of Glamorgan Council]</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, the new school was officially opened to students. All approximately 1300 students can now be found on the one site instead of the three separate buildings that were all situated in different locations in Cowbridge. The former sixth form site on Aberthin Road is now derelict and awaiting redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pyke|first1=Chris|title=The grand derelict buildings currently for sale in Wales|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/commercial-property/grand-derelict-buildings-currently-sale-14508193|website=Wales Online}}</ref>\n\nY Bontfaen primary school in Borough Close has a roll of about 245 including the nursery Y Blodau Fach.\nYsgol Iolo Morganwg with Y Meithrin (\"the nursery\") is adjacent and is a Welsh speaking school.\n\n==Sport==\nCowbridge is home to [[Cowbridge RFC]] a [[Welsh Rugby Union]] affiliated [[rugby union]] team, which fields two senior, a youth and ladies team.\nCowbridge Cricket Club first played in 1840 and now has six senior and junior teams and is affiliated to the South Wales Cricket Association. Notable cricketers who have played for the club include former test players Hugh Morris, John Clay, [[Tony Lewis]], C F Walters and on one famous occasion [[Douglas Jardine]]. Among the many county cricketers produced by the club are the Glamorgan players Ben Wright and [[Alex Jones (cricketer)|Alex Jones]]. Glamorgan CCC played county fixtures at Cowbridge in the 1930s.\n\nCowbridge also has a leisure centre where can be found various clubs including, tennis, football and badminton. Behind Cowbridge Leisure Centre is Cowbridge Bowling Club and tennis courts.\n\nSeptember 2009 also saw the reintroduction of senior football to Cowbridge Town after a ten-year absence. Starting in the third tier of the Vale of Glamorgan Amateur Football League the team achieved great success in their first season back, achieving an unlikely cup-promotion double. The 2011-12 season saw the club gain their second promotion in three years to reach the premier division.\n\n==Cultural Activities==\nCowbridge is also home to the Cowbridge Amateur Dramatic Society (CADS), based at the Market Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Market Theatre|url=http://www.market-theatre.com/}}</ref> CADS was formed in 1947 and aims to stage three main productions each year. The Society also publishes a newsletter, ''\"The Thespian\"'', three or four times each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Market Theatre|url=http://www.market-theatre.com|accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1997, when it 'outgrew' the Town Hall stage, Cowbridge was also home to the Cowbridge Amateur Operatic Society (CAOS).  Founded by a small group of enthusiasts, its first production was  \"The Pirates of Penzance\" in 1969.  CAOS continued its Gilbert and Sullivan theme until 1974, when the show of the year was \"Die Fledermaus\".  Still going strong, and having grown a youth wing (Total CAOS), CAOS is now based at Llantwit Major.\n\nSince 2004, the town has hosted the annual [[Cowbridge Food and Drink Festival]]. Currently, the festival takes place in late spring having originally taken place every October. The festival incorporates various food and drink exhibitors, food court and fringe festival. Many of the town's inns hold beer, ale and cider events.\n\nIn 2010 the Cowbridge Music Festival was founded which takes place every autumn in various venues throughout the town. The festival is made up of classical music, jazz and folk music and boasts an excellent outreach programme. In 2014 the acclaimed violinist [[Nicola Benedetti]] became the festival's patron.\n\nCowbridge History Society was created in 2013 out of a merger between the former Cowbridge & District Local History Society (founded in the 1970s) and Cowbridge Record Society, publishers of several books on the topics relating to the history of the town.

The Karluks and Uyghurs later allied themselves against the Basmyl, and within two years they toppled the Basmyl khagan. The Uyghur yabghu became khagan and the Karluk leader yabghu. This arrangement lasted less than a year.  Hostilities between the Uyghur and Karluk forced the Karluk to migrate westward into the western [[Turgesh]] lands.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=349}}\n\nBy 766 the Karluks had forced the submission of the Turgesh and they established their capital at [[Suyab]] on the [[Chu River]]. The Karluk confederation by now included the Chigil and Tukshi tribes who may have been T\u00fcrgesh tribes incorporated into the Karluk union. By the mid-9th century, the Karluk confederation had gained control of the sacred lands of the Western T\u00fcrks after the destruction of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] by the [[Old Kirghiz]] Control of sacred lands, together with their affiliation with the Ashina clan, allowed the Khaganate to be passed on to the Karluks along with domination of the steppes after the previous Khagan was killed in a revolt.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=350-351}}\n\nDuring the 9th century southern Central Asia was under the rule of the [[Samanids]], while the Central Asian steppe was dominated by Turkic nomads such as the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Oghuz Turks]], and the Karluks. The domain of the Karluks reached as far north as the Irtysh and the [[Kimek tribe|Kimek]] confederation, with encampments extending to the Chi and Ili rivers, where the Chigil and Tukshi tribes lived, and east to the Ferghana valley and beyond. The area to the south and east of the Karluks was inhabited by the Yagma.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=348}} The Karluk center in the 9th and 10th centuries appears to have been at [[Balasagun]] on the Chu River. In the late 9th century the Samanids marched into the steppes and captured [[Taraz]], one of the headquarters of the Karluk khagan, and a large church was transformed into a mosque.\n\n====Formation of the Kara-Khanid Khanate====\n[[File:Sutuq Bughraxan Qebrisi.JPG|thumb|left|Tomb of Sultan Satuk Bughra Khan, the first Muslim khan, in [[Artush]], [[Xinjiang]]]]\n\nDuring the 9th century, the Karluk confederation (including the T\u00fcrgesh descended Chigil and Tukshi tribes) and the Yaghma, possible descendants of the [[Toquz Oghuz]], joined force and formed the first Karluk-Karakhanid khaganate. The Chigils appear to have formed the nucleus of the Karakhanid army. The date of its foundation and the name of its first khan is uncertain, but according to one reconstruction, the first Karakhanid ruler was [[Bilge Kul Qadir Khan]].{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=355-356}} The rulers of the Karakhanids were likely to be from the Chigil and Yaghma tribes \u2013 the Eastern Khagan bore the title ''Arslan Qara Khaqan'' (Arslan \"lion\" was the totem of the Chigil) and the Western Khagan the title ''Bughra Qara Khaqan'' (Bughra \"male camel\" was the totem of the Yaghma). The names of animals were a regular element in the Turkish titles of the Karakhanids: thus Aslan (lion), Bughra (camel), Toghan (falcon), B\u00f6ri (wolf), and Toghrul or Toghr\u00efl (a bird of prey).{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}  Under the Khagans were four rulers with the titles Arslan Ilig, Bughra Ilig, Arslan Tegin and Bughra Tegin.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=355-356}} The titles of the members of the\ndynasty changed with their changing position, normally upwards, in the dynastic hierarchy.\n\nIn the mid-10th century the Kara-Khanids converted to Islam and adopted Muslim names and honorifics, but retained Turkic regnal titles such as Khan, [[Khagan]], Ilek (Ilig) and [[Tegin]].{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/showfile.asp?pubid=518&type=2 |title=Asia Research Institute Working Paper Series No.44 A History of Uighur Religious Conversions (5th-16th Centuries) by Li Tang |access-date=2008-01-19 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080119170546/http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/showfile.asp?pubid=518&type=2 |archive-date=2008-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later they adopted Arab titles sultan and ''sult\u0101n al-sal\u0101t\u012bn'' (sultan of sultans). According to the Ottoman historian known as Munajjim-bashi, a Karakhanid prince named [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] was the first of the khans to convert. After conversion, he obtained a [[fatwa]] which permitted him in effect to kill his presumably still pagan father, after which he conquered [[Kashgar]] (of the old [[Shule Kingdom]]).{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=357}} Later in 960, according to Muslim historians [[Ebn Meskavayh|Ibn Miskawaih]] and [[Ibn al-Athir]], there was a mass conversion of the Turks (reportedly \"200,000 tents of the Turks\"), circumstantial evidence suggests these were the Karakhanids.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=357}}\n\n===Conquest of Transoxiana===\n[[File:Kara-Khanid Khanate.png|thumb|350px|The map of Kara-Khanid Khanate as of 1006 AD when it reached its greatest extent]]\nThe grandson of Satuk Bughra Khan, Hasan (or Harun) b.

Musa (title: Kara Khan or Arslan Khan) resumed the campaign against the Samanids, and by 999 Ali's son Nasr had taken Chach, Samarkand, and Bukhara.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}} The Samanid domains were divided between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana. The [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\nThe Karakhanid state was divided into [[appanage]]s, as was common of Turkic and Mongol nomads. The Karakhanid appanages were associated with four principal urban centers, [[Balasagun]] (then the capital of the Karakhanid state) in Zhetysu, Kashgar in Xinjiang, [[Uzgen]] in [[Fergana]], and Samarkand in Transoxiana. The dynasty's original domains of Zhetysu and Kasgar and their khans retained an implicit seniority over those who ruled in Transoxiana and Fergana.{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} The four sons of Ali (Ahmad, Nasr, Mansur, Muhammad) each held their own independent appanage within the Karakhanid state.  Nasr, the conqueror of Transoxiana, held the large central area of Transoxiana (Samarkand and Bukhara), Fergana (Uzgen) and other areas, although after his death his appanage was further divided.  Ahmad held [[Zhetysu]] and [[Tashkent|Chach]] and became the head of the dynasty after the death of Ali. The brothers Ahmad and Nasr conducted different policies towards the Ghaznavids in the south \u2013 while Ahmad tried to form alliance with [[Mahmud of Ghazna]], Nasr attempted to expand unsuccessfully into the territory of the Ghaznavids.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nAhmad was succeeded by Mansur, and after the death of Mansur, the Hasan Bughra Khan branch of the Karakhanids became dominant.  Hasan's sons Muhammad Toghan Khan II, and Yusuf Kadir Khan who held [[Kashgar]], became in turn the head of the Karakhanid dynasty. The two families, i.e. the descendants of Ali Arslan Khan and Hasan Bughra Khan, would eventually split the Karakhanid Khanate in two.\n\nIn 1017\u20131018, the Karakhanids repelled an attack by a large mass of nomadic Turkish tribes in what was described in Muslim sources as a great victory.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=363}}\n\n===Conquest of western Tarim Basin===\n\nThe Islamic conquest of the Buddhist cities east of Kashgar began when the Turkic Karakhanid Satuq Bughra Khan converted to Islam  in 934 and then captured Kashgar. Satuq Bughra Khan and his son directed endeavors to proselytize Islam among the Turks and engage in military conquests.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=226}} In the mid-10th century, Satuq's son Musa began to put pressure on Khotan, and a long period of war between Kashgar and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] ensued.{{sfn|Millward|2009|p=55-56}} Satok Bughra Khan's nephew or grandson Ali Arslan was said to have been killed by Buddhists during the war;<ref name=\"RingSalkin1994\">{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring|author2=Robert M.

A son of Hasan Bughra Khan, Ali Tegin, seized control of Bukhara and other towns. He expanded his territory further after the death of Mansur. The son of Nasr, [[B\u00f6ritigin]], later waged war against the sons of Ali Tegin, and won control of large part of Transoxania, and made Samarkand the capital. In 1041, another son of Nasr b. Ali, Muhammad 'Ayn ad-Dawlah (reigned 1041\u201352) took over the administration of the western branch of the family that eventually led to a formal separation of the Khara-Khanid Khanate. Ibrahim Tamghach Khan was considered by Muslim historians as a great ruler, and he brought some stability to Western Karakhanids by limiting the appanage system that caused much of the internal strife in the Kara-Khanid Khanate.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nThe Hasan family remained in control of the Eastern Khanate. The Eastern Khanate had its capital at Balasaghun and later Kashgar. The Fergana-Zhetysu areas became the border between the two states and were frequently contested. When the two states were formed, Fergana fell into realm of the Eastern Khanate, but was later captured by Ibrahim and became part of Western Khanate.\n\n===Seljuk suzerainty===\nIn 1040, the [[Seljuk Turks]] defeated the Ghaznavids at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] and entered Iran. Conflict with the Karakhanids broke out, but the Karakhanids were able to withstand attacks by the Seljuks initially, even briefly taking control of Seljuk towns in [[Greater Khorasan]]. The Karakhanids, however, developed serious conflicts with the religious classes (the ''[[ulama]]''), and the ''ulama'' of Transoxiana then requested the intervention of the Seljuks. In 1089, during the reign of Ibrahim's grandson Ahmad b. Khidr, the Seljuks entered and took control of Samarkand, together with the domains belonging to the Western Khanate. The Western Karakhanids Khanate became a [[vassal]] of the Seljuks for half a century, and the rulers of the Western Khanate were largely whomever the Seljuks chose to place on the throne. Ahmad b. Khidr was returned to power by the Seljuks, but in 1095, the ''ulama'' accused Ahmad of heresy and managed to secure his execution.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nThe Karakhanids of Kashgar also declared their submission following a Seljuk campaign into Talas and Zhetysu, but the Eastern Khanate was a Seljuk vassal for only a short time. At the beginning of the 12th century they invaded Transoxiana and briefly occupied the Seljuk town of Termez.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\n=== Qara Khitai Invasion ===\n[[File:Aisha Bibi2.jpg|thumb|upright|The restored mausoleum of [[Ayshah bibi]] near [[Taraz]].]]\n\nThe [[Qara Khitai]] host which invaded Central Asia was composed of remnants from the defunct [[Liao dynasty]] which was annihilated by the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] in 1125. The Khitan noble [[Yelu Dashi]] recruited warriors from various tribes and formed a horde that moved westward to rebuild the Khitan nation. Yelu occupied Balasagun on the Chu River, then defeated the Western Karakhanids in [[Khujand]] in 1137.{{sfn|Asimov|1998}} In 1141 [[Qara Khitai]] became the dominant force in the region after they dealt a devastating blow to the Seljuk Sultan [[Ahmad Sanjar]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] near [[Samarkand]].{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} Several military commanders of Karakhanid lineages such as the father of Osman of [[Khwarezm]] fled from Karakhanid lands in the wake of the Qara Khitai invasion.\n\nDespite losing to the [[Qara Khitai]], the Karakhanid dynasty remained in power as their vassals. The Qara Khitai themselves stayed at [[Zhetysu]] near Balasagun, and allowed some of the Karakhanids to continue to rule as their tax collectors in Samarkand and Kashgar. Under the Qara Khitai the Karakhanids functioned as administrators for sedentary Muslim populations. While the Qara Khitai were Buddhists ruling over a largely Muslim population, they were considered fair-minded rulers whose reign was marked by religious tolerance.{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} Islamic religious life continued uninterrupted and Islamic authority persevered under the Qara Khitai. Kashgar became a [[Nestorian Christianity|Nestorian]] [[metropolitan see]] and Christian gravestones in the [[Chu River|Chu valley]] appeared beginning in this period.{{sfn|Asimov|1998}} However, [[Kuchlug]], a [[Naimans|Naiman]] who usurped the throne of the Qara Khitai Dynasty, instituted anti-Islamic policies on the local populations under his rule.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=194-196}}\n\n=== Downfall ===\nThe decline of the Seljuks following their defeat by the Qara Khitans allowed the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], then a vassal of the Qara Khitai, to expand into former Seljuk territory. In 1207, the citizens of Bukhara revolted against the ''sadrs'' (leaders of the religious classes), which the Khwarezm-Shah [[Muhammad II of Khwarazm|'Ala' ad-Din Muhammad]] used as a pretext to conquer Bukhara. Muhammad then formed an alliance with the Western Karakhanid ruler Uthman (who later married Muhammad's daughter) against the Qara Khitai. In 1210, the [[Khwarezm-Shah]] took Samarkand after the Qara Khitai retreated to deal with the rebellion from the Naiman Kuchlug, who had seized the Qara Khitans' treasury at Uzgen.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}} The Khwarezm-Shah then defeated the Qara Khitai near Talas. Muhammad and Kuchlug had, apparently, agreed to divide up the Qara Khitan's empire.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=370}} In 1212, the population of Samarkand staged a revolt against the Khwarezmians, a revolt which Uthman supported, and massacred them. The Khwarezm-Shah returned, recaptured Samarkand and executed Uthman. He demanded the submission of all leading Karakhanids, and finally extinguished the Western Karakhanid state.\n\nIn 1204, a rebellion of the Eastern Kara-Khanid in Kashgar was suppressed by the Kara-Khitai who took the prince Yusuf hostage to Balasagun.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}   The prince was later released but he was killed in Kashgar by rebels in 1211, effectively ending the Eastern Kara-Khanid.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}  In 1214, the rebels in Kashgar surrendered to [[Kuchlug]], who had usruped the Kara-Khitai throne.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}  In 1218, Kuchlug was killed by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol army]].

In 742, the Karluks were part of an alliance led by the [[Basmyl]] and [[Uyghurs]] that rebelled against the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=142}} In the realignment of power that followed, the Karluks were elevated from a tribe led by an ''el teber'' to one led by a ''[[yabghu]]'', which was one of the highest Turkic dignitaries and also implies membership in the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan in whom the \"heaven-mandated\" right to rule resided.  The Karluks and Uyghurs later allied themselves against the Basmyl, and within two years they toppled the Basmyl khagan. The Uyghur yabghu became khagan and the Karluk leader yabghu. This arrangement lasted less than a year.  Hostilities between the Uyghur and Karluk forced the Karluk to migrate westward into the western [[Turgesh]] lands.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=349}}\n\nBy 766 the Karluks had forced the submission of the Turgesh and they established their capital at [[Suyab]] on the [[Chu River]]. The Karluk confederation by now included the Chigil and Tukshi tribes who may have been T\u00fcrgesh tribes incorporated into the Karluk union. By the mid-9th century, the Karluk confederation had gained control of the sacred lands of the Western T\u00fcrks after the destruction of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] by the [[Old Kirghiz]] Control of sacred lands, together with their affiliation with the Ashina clan, allowed the Khaganate to be passed on to the Karluks along with domination of the steppes after the previous Khagan was killed in a revolt.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=350-351}}\n\nDuring the 9th century southern Central Asia was under the rule of the [[Samanids]], while the Central Asian steppe was dominated by Turkic nomads such as the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Oghuz Turks]], and the Karluks. The domain of the Karluks reached as far north as the Irtysh and the [[Kimek tribe|Kimek]] confederation, with encampments extending to the Chi and Ili rivers, where the Chigil and Tukshi tribes lived, and east to the Ferghana valley and beyond. The area to the south and east of the Karluks was inhabited by the Yagma.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=348}} The Karluk center in the 9th and 10th centuries appears to have been at [[Balasagun]] on the Chu River. In the late 9th century the Samanids marched into the steppes and captured [[Taraz]], one of the headquarters of the Karluk khagan, and a large church was transformed into a mosque.\n\n====Formation of the Kara-Khanid Khanate====\n[[File:Sutuq Bughraxan Qebrisi.JPG|thumb|left|Tomb of Sultan Satuk Bughra Khan, the first Muslim khan, in [[Artush]], [[Xinjiang]]]]\n\nDuring the 9th century, the Karluk confederation (including the T\u00fcrgesh descended Chigil and Tukshi tribes) and the Yaghma, possible descendants of the [[Toquz Oghuz]], joined force and formed the first Karluk-Karakhanid khaganate. The Chigils appear to have formed the nucleus of the Karakhanid army. The date of its foundation and the name of its first khan is uncertain, but according to one reconstruction, the first Karakhanid ruler was [[Bilge Kul Qadir Khan]].{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=355-356}} The rulers of the Karakhanids were likely to be from the Chigil and Yaghma tribes \u2013 the Eastern Khagan bore the title ''Arslan Qara Khaqan'' (Arslan \"lion\" was the totem of the Chigil) and the Western Khagan the title ''Bughra Qara Khaqan'' (Bughra \"male camel\" was the totem of the Yaghma). The names of animals were a regular element in the Turkish titles of the Karakhanids: thus Aslan (lion), Bughra (camel), Toghan (falcon), B\u00f6ri (wolf), and Toghrul or Toghr\u00efl (a bird of prey).{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}  Under the Khagans were four rulers with the titles Arslan Ilig, Bughra Ilig, Arslan Tegin and Bughra Tegin.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=355-356}} The titles of the members of the\ndynasty changed with their changing position, normally upwards, in the dynastic hierarchy.\n\nIn the mid-10th century the Kara-Khanids converted to Islam and adopted Muslim names and honorifics, but retained Turkic regnal titles such as Khan, [[Khagan]], Ilek (Ilig) and [[Tegin]].{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/showfile.asp?pubid=518&type=2 |title=Asia Research Institute Working Paper Series No.44 A History of Uighur Religious Conversions (5th-16th Centuries) by Li Tang |access-date=2008-01-19 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080119170546/http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/showfile.asp?pubid=518&type=2 |archive-date=2008-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later they adopted Arab titles sultan and ''sult\u0101n al-sal\u0101t\u012bn'' (sultan of sultans). According to the Ottoman historian known as Munajjim-bashi, a Karakhanid prince named [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] was the first of the khans to convert. After conversion, he obtained a [[fatwa]] which permitted him in effect to kill his presumably still pagan father, after which he conquered [[Kashgar]] (of the old [[Shule Kingdom]]).{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=357}} Later in 960, according to Muslim historians [[Ebn Meskavayh|Ibn Miskawaih]] and [[Ibn al-Athir]], there was a mass conversion of the Turks (reportedly \"200,000 tents of the Turks\"), circumstantial evidence suggests these were the Karakhanids.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=357}}\n\n===Conquest of Transoxiana===\n[[File:Kara-Khanid Khanate.png|thumb|350px|The map of Kara-Khanid Khanate as of 1006 AD when it reached its greatest extent]]\nThe grandson of Satuk Bughra Khan, Hasan (or Harun) b.

The [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\nThe Karakhanid state was divided into [[appanage]]s, as was common of Turkic and Mongol nomads. The Karakhanid appanages were associated with four principal urban centers, [[Balasagun]] (then the capital of the Karakhanid state) in Zhetysu, Kashgar in Xinjiang, [[Uzgen]] in [[Fergana]], and Samarkand in Transoxiana. The dynasty's original domains of Zhetysu and Kasgar and their khans retained an implicit seniority over those who ruled in Transoxiana and Fergana.{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} The four sons of Ali (Ahmad, Nasr, Mansur, Muhammad) each held their own independent appanage within the Karakhanid state.  Nasr, the conqueror of Transoxiana, held the large central area of Transoxiana (Samarkand and Bukhara), Fergana (Uzgen) and other areas, although after his death his appanage was further divided.  Ahmad held [[Zhetysu]] and [[Tashkent|Chach]] and became the head of the dynasty after the death of Ali. The brothers Ahmad and Nasr conducted different policies towards the Ghaznavids in the south \u2013 while Ahmad tried to form alliance with [[Mahmud of Ghazna]], Nasr attempted to expand unsuccessfully into the territory of the Ghaznavids.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nAhmad was succeeded by Mansur, and after the death of Mansur, the Hasan Bughra Khan branch of the Karakhanids became dominant.  Hasan's sons Muhammad Toghan Khan II, and Yusuf Kadir Khan who held [[Kashgar]], became in turn the head of the Karakhanid dynasty. The two families, i.e. the descendants of Ali Arslan Khan and Hasan Bughra Khan, would eventually split the Karakhanid Khanate in two.\n\nIn 1017\u20131018, the Karakhanids repelled an attack by a large mass of nomadic Turkish tribes in what was described in Muslim sources as a great victory.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=363}}\n\n===Conquest of western Tarim Basin===\n\nThe Islamic conquest of the Buddhist cities east of Kashgar began when the Turkic Karakhanid Satuq Bughra Khan converted to Islam  in 934 and then captured Kashgar.

A son of Hasan Bughra Khan, Ali Tegin, seized control of Bukhara and other towns. He expanded his territory further after the death of Mansur. The son of Nasr, [[B\u00f6ritigin]], later waged war against the sons of Ali Tegin, and won control of large part of Transoxania, and made Samarkand the capital. In 1041, another son of Nasr b. Ali, Muhammad 'Ayn ad-Dawlah (reigned 1041\u201352) took over the administration of the western branch of the family that eventually led to a formal separation of the Khara-Khanid Khanate. Ibrahim Tamghach Khan was considered by Muslim historians as a great ruler, and he brought some stability to Western Karakhanids by limiting the appanage system that caused much of the internal strife in the Kara-Khanid Khanate.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nThe Hasan family remained in control of the Eastern Khanate. The Eastern Khanate had its capital at Balasaghun and later Kashgar. The Fergana-Zhetysu areas became the border between the two states and were frequently contested. When the two states were formed, Fergana fell into realm of the Eastern Khanate, but was later captured by Ibrahim and became part of Western Khanate.\n\n===Seljuk suzerainty===\nIn 1040, the [[Seljuk Turks]] defeated the Ghaznavids at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] and entered Iran. Conflict with the Karakhanids broke out, but the Karakhanids were able to withstand attacks by the Seljuks initially, even briefly taking control of Seljuk towns in [[Greater Khorasan]]. The Karakhanids, however, developed serious conflicts with the religious classes (the ''[[ulama]]''), and the ''ulama'' of Transoxiana then requested the intervention of the Seljuks. In 1089, during the reign of Ibrahim's grandson Ahmad b. Khidr, the Seljuks entered and took control of Samarkand, together with the domains belonging to the Western Khanate. The Western Karakhanids Khanate became a [[vassal]] of the Seljuks for half a century, and the rulers of the Western Khanate were largely whomever the Seljuks chose to place on the throne. Ahmad b. Khidr was returned to power by the Seljuks, but in 1095, the ''ulama'' accused Ahmad of heresy and managed to secure his execution.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nThe Karakhanids of Kashgar also declared their submission following a Seljuk campaign into Talas and Zhetysu, but the Eastern Khanate was a Seljuk vassal for only a short time. At the beginning of the 12th century they invaded Transoxiana and briefly occupied the Seljuk town of Termez.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\n=== Qara Khitai Invasion ===\n[[File:Aisha Bibi2.jpg|thumb|upright|The restored mausoleum of [[Ayshah bibi]] near [[Taraz]].]]\n\nThe [[Qara Khitai]] host which invaded Central Asia was composed of remnants from the defunct [[Liao dynasty]] which was annihilated by the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] in 1125. The Khitan noble [[Yelu Dashi]] recruited warriors from various tribes and formed a horde that moved westward to rebuild the Khitan nation. Yelu occupied Balasagun on the Chu River, then defeated the Western Karakhanids in [[Khujand]] in 1137.{{sfn|Asimov|1998}} In 1141 [[Qara Khitai]] became the dominant force in the region after they dealt a devastating blow to the Seljuk Sultan [[Ahmad Sanjar]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] near [[Samarkand]].{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} Several military commanders of Karakhanid lineages such as the father of Osman of [[Khwarezm]] fled from Karakhanid lands in the wake of the Qara Khitai invasion.\n\nDespite losing to the [[Qara Khitai]], the Karakhanid dynasty remained in power as their vassals. The Qara Khitai themselves stayed at [[Zhetysu]] near Balasagun, and allowed some of the Karakhanids to continue to rule as their tax collectors in Samarkand and Kashgar. Under the Qara Khitai the Karakhanids functioned as administrators for sedentary Muslim populations. While the Qara Khitai were Buddhists ruling over a largely Muslim population, they were considered fair-minded rulers whose reign was marked by religious tolerance.{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} Islamic religious life continued uninterrupted and Islamic authority persevered under the Qara Khitai. Kashgar became a [[Nestorian Christianity|Nestorian]] [[metropolitan see]] and Christian gravestones in the [[Chu River|Chu valley]] appeared beginning in this period.{{sfn|Asimov|1998}} However, [[Kuchlug]], a [[Naimans|Naiman]] who usurped the throne of the Qara Khitai Dynasty, instituted anti-Islamic policies on the local populations under his rule.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=194-196}}\n\n=== Downfall ===\nThe decline of the Seljuks following their defeat by the Qara Khitans allowed the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], then a vassal of the Qara Khitai, to expand into former Seljuk territory. In 1207, the citizens of Bukhara revolted against the ''sadrs'' (leaders of the religious classes), which the Khwarezm-Shah [[Muhammad II of Khwarazm|'Ala' ad-Din Muhammad]] used as a pretext to conquer Bukhara. Muhammad then formed an alliance with the Western Karakhanid ruler Uthman (who later married Muhammad's daughter) against the Qara Khitai. In 1210, the [[Khwarezm-Shah]] took Samarkand after the Qara Khitai retreated to deal with the rebellion from the Naiman Kuchlug, who had seized the Qara Khitans' treasury at Uzgen.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}} The Khwarezm-Shah then defeated the Qara Khitai near Talas. Muhammad and Kuchlug had, apparently, agreed to divide up the Qara Khitan's empire.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=370}} In 1212, the population of Samarkand staged a revolt against the Khwarezmians, a revolt which Uthman supported, and massacred them. The Khwarezm-Shah returned, recaptured Samarkand and executed Uthman. He demanded the submission of all leading Karakhanids, and finally extinguished the Western Karakhanid state.\n\nIn 1204, a rebellion of the Eastern Kara-Khanid in Kashgar was suppressed by the Kara-Khitai who took the prince Yusuf hostage to Balasagun.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}   The prince was later released but he was killed in Kashgar by rebels in 1211, effectively ending the Eastern Kara-Khanid.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}  In 1214, the rebels in Kashgar surrendered to [[Kuchlug]], who had usruped the Kara-Khitai throne.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}  In 1218, Kuchlug was killed by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol army]].

The early Karakhanid rulers, as nomads, lived not in the city but in an army encampment outside the capital, and while by the time of Ibrahim the Karakhanids still maintained a nomadic tradition, their extensive religious and civil constructions showed that they had assimilated the culture and traditions of the settled population of Transoxiana.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nKara-Khanid is arguably the most enduring cultural heritage among coexisting cultures in Central Asia from the 9th to the 13th centuries. The Karluk-Uyghur dialect spoken by the nomadic tribes and turkified sedentary populations under Kara-Khanid rule formed two major branches of the Turkic language family, the [[Chagatai language|Chagatay]] and the [[Kypchak]]. The Kara-Khanid cultural model that combined nomadic Turkic culture with Islamic, sedentary institutions spread east into former [[Gaochang|Kara-Khoja]] and [[Tangut people|Tangut]] territories and west and south into the subcontinent, Khorasan (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Northern Iran), [[Golden Horde]] territories ([[Tataristan]]), and [[Turkey]]. The [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatay]], Timurid, and [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] states and societies inherited most of the cultures of the Kara-Khanids and the [[Khwarezmians]] without much interruption.\n\n==Genetics==\n{{See also|G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks#Genetics|Karluks#Genetics|Kimek tribe#Genetics|Kipchaks#Genetics|Golden Horde#Genetics}}\nA genetic study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in May 2018 examined the remains of three Khara-Khanid individuals. They were found to be carrying the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup G (mtDNA)|G2a2]], [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|A]] and [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|J1c]].

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at [[Cambridge University]], and became President of the [[Footlights]] club, touring internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He had also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and had been a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for over 50 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.<ref>[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010</ref> His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read Economics and Politics before changing to read Law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'' was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run, that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and the revue transferred to the  [[West End of London|West End]] in London, before being taken to both New Zealand and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> He was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' which he performed in and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.  Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the television series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E. L. Wisty]]. Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary [[right-wing]] [[City of London|City]] gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> The \"[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]\" sketch was co-written by the four writers and performers of the series.<ref name=\"BrightRoss2001\">{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}</ref> The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''. The sketch has since become well-known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.}\n\nAlso in 1968, Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD entitled ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]]; however, the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with Garden (and Oddie joining the for the second series).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", the show was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\", whilst in ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' he took part in the sketches \"Top of the Form\" (with Cleese, Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and \"Cha Cha Cha\" (with Cleese and Chapman). Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform \"Funky Gibbon\". Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue'', which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGarden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in typical game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously.

Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He had also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and had been a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for over 50 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.<ref>[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010</ref> His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read Economics and Politics before changing to read Law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'' was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run, that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and the revue transferred to the  [[West End of London|West End]] in London, before being taken to both New Zealand and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> He was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' which he performed in and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.  Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the television series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E.

Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary [[right-wing]] [[City of London|City]] gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> The \"[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]\" sketch was co-written by the four writers and performers of the series.<ref name=\"BrightRoss2001\">{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}</ref> The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''. The sketch has since become well-known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.}\n\nAlso in 1968, Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of [[Do Not Adjust Your Set]], filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD entitled ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]]; however, the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with Garden (and Oddie joining the for the second series).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", the show was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\", whilst in ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' he took part in the sketches \"Top of the Form\" (with Cleese, Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and \"Cha Cha Cha\" (with Cleese and Chapman). Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform \"Funky Gibbon\". Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue'', which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGarden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in typical game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''.
