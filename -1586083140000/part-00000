{"title_page": "Prosumer", "text_new": "{{essay|date=April 2012}}\nA '''prosumer''' is a person who [[Consumption (economics)|consumes]] and [[Production (economics)|produces]] a [[Product (economics)|product]]. The term is derived from ''prosumption'', a [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com era]] business term meaning \"production by consumers\". These terms were coined in 1980 by American [[Futurism|futurist]] [[Alvin Toffler]], and were widely used by many technology writers of the time. The term has since come to refer to a person using [[commons-based peer production]]. Technological breakthrough has fastened the development of prosumption. With the help of additive manufacturing techniques, for example, co-creation takes place at different production stages: design, manufacturing and distribution stages. It also takes place between individual customers, leading to co-design communities. Similarly, mass customisation is often associated with the production of tailored goods or services on a large scale production. This increase in participation has flourished following the increasing popularity of [[Web 2.0]] technologies, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Flickr. This rise in user participation blurs the line between production and consumption activities, with the consumer becoming a prosumer.<ref> Li, R.Y.M. (2018). Addictive manufacturing, prosumption and construction safety, in: An Economic Analysis on Automated Construction Safety, Springer [online] https://www.researchgate.net/search.Search.html?type=publication&query=Addictive%20manufacturing,%20prosumption%20and%20construction%20safety</ref>\n\n==Definitions and origins==\n\nThis blurring of the roles of consumers and producers has its origins in the cooperative [[self-help]] movements that sprang up during various economic crises e.g. the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.\n\n[[Marshall McLuhan]] and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their 1972 book ''Take Today'', (p.&nbsp;4) that with electric technology, the consumer would become a producer. In the 1980 book, ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'', [[futurologist]] [[Alvin Toffler]] coined the term \"prosumer\" when he predicted that the role of producers and [[consumer]]s would begin to blur and merge (even though he described it in his book ''Future Shock'' from 1970). Toffler envisioned a highly saturated [[marketplace]] as [[mass production]] of [[standardization|standardized]] products began to satisfy basic consumer demands. To continue growing [[Profit (economics)|profit]], businesses would initiate a process of [[mass customization]], that is the mass production of highly customized products.\n\nHowever, to reach a high degree of customization, consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying [[design]] requirements. In a sense, this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like [[architect]]s for many decades. However, in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers, a distinction touched upon in the [[Humanity+|H+ Magazine]] essay 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative'.<ref>Lorimer, A. 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative', H+ Magazine, 2014, [online] http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/01/13/prosumption-architecture-the-decentralisation-of-architectural-agency-as-an-economic-imperative/ [04/02/14]</ref>\n\nToffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st-century. Along with more recently published works such as ''[[Revolutionary Wealth]]'' (2006),  one can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the ''prosumer'' as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale. That these concepts are having global impact and reach, however, can be measured in part by noting in particular, Toffler's popularity in [[China]]. Discussing some of these issues with [[Newt Gingrich]] on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[After Words]]'' program in June 2006, Toffler mentioned that ''The Third Wave'' is the second ranked bestseller of all time in China, just behind a work by [[Mao Zedong]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.trumix.com/podshows/521309 |title= C-SPAN - After Words created. Toffler interviewed by Gingrich Episode |publisher = [[C-SPAN]] |date = June 6, 2006 |accessdate  = December 5, 2008 |url-status = dead |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090126051635/http://www.trumix.com/podshows/521309 |archivedate = January 26, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[Don Tapscott]] reintroduced the concept in his 1995 book ''The Digital Economy.'', and his 2006 book ''[[Wikinomics|Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything]]'' with Anthony D. Williams. [[George Ritzer]] and Nathan Jurgenson, in a widely cited article, claimed that prosumption had become a salient characteristic of [[Web 2.0]]. Prosumers create value for companies without receiving wages.\n\nMass customization has not taken place in most areas of the economy. Mass customization has ruled the food and beverage industry for years, as evidenced by the diversity of brand offerings at supermarkets and fast-food chains. Brand extension and dilution are ways companies have sold more under various names, giving consumers thousands of choices. Most consumption continues to be passive, as critics of [[television]], [[sound recording|recorded]] music, and [[fast food]] would argue. Indeed, people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture. In ''The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less'', [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues that [[diminishing returns]] from a [[confusion|confusing]] abundance of consumer choice is producing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and dissatisfaction.<sup>[[#External links|3]]</sup> Still, one key area of high-customization ''is'' taking place: highly involved hobbyists.\n\nIn the digital and online world, \u201dprosumer\u201d is used to describe 21st-century online buyers because not only are they consumers of products, but they are able to produce their own products such as, customised handbags, jewellery with initials, jumpers with team logos etc.\n\nIn the field of renewable energy, prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national (or local) distribution network; whilst at other times (when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it) they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid. This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity. Such households may additionally make use of battery storage to increase their share of self-consumed PV electricity, referred to as prosumage in the literature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schill|first=Wolf-Peter|last2=Zerrahn|first2=Alexander|last3=Kunz|first3=Friedrich|date=2017-06-01|title=Prosumage of solar electricity: pros, cons, and the system perspective|journal=Economics of Energy & Environmental Policy|language=English|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.wsch|issn=2160-5882|hdl=10419/149900|url=http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.552031.de/dp1637.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green Iain Staffell|first=Richard|date=2017-06-01|title='Prosumage' and the British Electricity Market|journal=Economics of Energy & Environmental Policy|language=English|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.rgre|issn=2160-5882}}</ref> It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places. The European Union\u2019s Nobel Grid project, which is part of their Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, uses the term in this way, for example.\n\nToffler\u2019s Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler, who saw Prosumer/Prosumption as a new challenge for marketers.<ref>Kotler, Philip. (1986). Prosumers: A New Type of Customer. Futurist(September\u2013October), 24-28.</ref> Philip Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume, furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it. He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities, and to more sustainable lifestyles, that topic was further developed by Tomasz Szymusiak in 2013 and 2015 in two marketing books.<ref>Szymusiak T., (2013). Social and economic benefits of Prosumption and Lead User Phenomenon in Germany - Lessons for Poland [in:] Sustainability Innovation, Research Commercialization and Sustainability Marketing, Sustainability Solutions, M\u00fcnchen. {{ISBN|978-83-936843-1-1}}</ref><ref>Szymusiak T., (2015).

KG, D\u00fcsseldorf. {{ISBN|978-3-639-89210-9}}</ref>\n\nFrom a corporate perspective, it can be beneficial for a company to open up its processes to the end-users, integrating them as prosumers. Such motivated enthusiasts can be, for instance, brought into a company's research and development process. This may produce strengthened customer relations and faster feedback cycles. Companies and individuals are increasingly utilizing and involving the [[end-user]]s to develop final products and services. In some instances, end-users are creating products on their own, without the interference from or assistance of companies, organizations, etc. For example, [[Lego Mindstorms]] allows users to download software from Lego's website so that the users can edit and update software as they wish.\n\n===Activism===\nAmong some [[activist]] groups,{{which|date=August 2019}} the producer and consumer roles are being combined so as to ''exclude'' (or at least diminish) the role of the [[corporation|corporate]] producer; thus, rather than generating higher corporate profits from [[value-add]]ed products, producers would, at best, be reduced to supplying lower-profit [[commodity]] inputs. Indeed, the more consumer-oriented prosumer spin is irrelevant to many people with diminished disposable income caused by various economic trends such as [[globalization]], [[automation]], and [[wealth concentration]].\n\n== Impact and reception ==\n\n===Adoption===\nIdentifiable trends and movements outside of the mainstream economy that have adopted prosumer terminology and techniques include:\n*a ''Do It Yourself'' ([[DIY]]) approach as a means of economic self-sufficiency or simply as a way to survive on diminished income\n*the [[open source software]] movement creates software on their own, prime example is the successful [[operating system]] [[Linux]] which now dominates the server domain\n*[[Fablab]] movement, self-fabrication capabilities especially [[3d printing]]\n*the [[voluntary simplicity]] movement that seeks personal, social, and environmental goals through prosumer activities such as:\n**growing one's own food\n**repairing clothing and appliances rather than buying new items\n**playing musical instruments rather than listening to recorded music\n*use of new media-creation and distribution technologies to foster independent, open, non-profit, \"consumer-to-consumer\" media and cultures (see [[Wikipedia]], [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]], most of [[Creative Commons]]); many involved in independent media reject [[popular culture|mass culture]] generated by [[concentration of media ownership|concentrated corporate media]]\n*self-sufficient [[barter (economics)|barter]] networks, notably in [[developing nations]], such as Argentina's [[Red Global de Clubes de Trueque Multirec\u00edproco|RGT]] have adopted the term prosumer<sup>[[#External links|4]]</sup>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Commons-based peer production]]\n*[[Creative consumer]]\n*[[Read/write culture]]\n*[[Cost the limit of price]]\n*[[Participatory culture]]\n*[[Power user]]\n*[[Produsage]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Chen, Katherine K.

With the help of additive manufacturing techniques, for example, co-creation takes place at different production stages: design, manufacturing and distribution stages. It also takes place between individual customers, leading to co-design communities. Similarly, mass customisation is often associated with the production of tailored goods or services on a large scale production. This increase in participation has flourished following the increasing popularity of Web 2.0 technologies, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Flickr. This rise in user participation blurs the line between production and consumption activities, with the consumer becoming a prosumer.<ref> Li, R.Y.M. (2018). Addictive manufacturing, prosumption and construction safety, in: An Economic Analysis on Automated Construction Safety, Springer [online] https://www.researchgate.net/search.Search.html?type=publication&query=Addictive%20manufacturing,%20prosumption%20and%20construction%20safety</ref>\n\n==Definitions and origins==\n\nThis blurring of the roles of consumers and producers has its origins in the cooperative [[self-help]] movements that sprang up during various economic crises e.g. the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.\n\n[[Marshall McLuhan]] and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their 1972 book ''Take Today'', (p.&nbsp;4) that with electric technology, the consumer would become a producer. In the 1980 book, ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'', [[futurologist]] [[Alvin Toffler]] coined the term \"prosumer\" when he predicted that the role of producers and [[consumer]]s would begin to blur and merge (even though he described it in his book ''Future Shock'' from 1970). Toffler envisioned a highly saturated [[marketplace]] as [[mass production]] of [[standardization|standardized]] products began to satisfy basic consumer demands. To continue growing [[Profit (economics)|profit]], businesses would initiate a process of [[mass customization]], that is the mass production of highly customized products.\n\nHowever, to reach a high degree of customization, consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying [[design]] requirements. In a sense, this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like [[architect]]s for many decades. However, in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers, a distinction touched upon in the [[Humanity+|H+ Magazine]] essay 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative'.<ref>Lorimer, A. 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative', H+ Magazine, 2014, [online] http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/01/13/prosumption-architecture-the-decentralisation-of-architectural-agency-as-an-economic-imperative/ [04/02/14]</ref>\n\nToffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st-century. Along with more recently published works such as ''[[Revolutionary Wealth]]'' (2006),  one can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the ''prosumer'' as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale. That these concepts are having global impact and reach, however, can be measured in part by noting in particular, Toffler's popularity in [[China]]. Discussing some of these issues with [[Newt Gingrich]] on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[After Words]]'' program in June 2006, Toffler mentioned that ''The Third Wave'' is the second ranked bestseller of all time in China, just behind a work by [[Mao Zedong]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.trumix.com/podshows/521309 |title= C-SPAN - After Words created.

Williams. [[George Ritzer]] and Nathan Jurgenson, in a widely cited article, claimed that prosumption had become a salient characteristic of [[Web 2.0]]. Prosumers create value for companies without receiving wages.\n\nMass customization has not taken place in most areas of the economy. Mass customization has ruled the food and beverage industry for years, as evidenced by the diversity of brand offerings at supermarkets and fast-food chains. Brand extension and dilution are ways companies have sold more under various names, giving consumers thousands of choices. Most consumption continues to be passive, as critics of [[television]], [[sound recording|recorded]] music, and [[fast food]] would argue. Indeed, people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture. In ''The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less'', [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues that [[diminishing returns]] from a [[confusion|confusing]] abundance of consumer choice is producing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and dissatisfaction.<sup>[[#External links|3]]</sup> Still, one key area of high-customization ''is'' taking place: highly involved hobbyists.\n\nIn the digital and online world, \u201dprosumer\u201d is used to describe 21st-century online buyers because not only are they consumers of products, but they are able to produce their own products such as, customised handbags, jewellery with initials, jumpers with team logos etc.\n\nIn the field of renewable energy, prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national (or local) distribution network; whilst at other times (when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it) they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid. This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity. Such households may additionally make use of battery storage to increase their share of self-consumed PV electricity, referred to as prosumage in the literature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schill|first=Wolf-Peter|last2=Zerrahn|first2=Alexander|last3=Kunz|first3=Friedrich|date=2017-06-01|title=Prosumage of solar electricity: pros, cons, and the system perspective|journal=Economics of Energy & Environmental Policy|language=English|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.wsch|issn=2160-5882|hdl=10419/149900|url=http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.552031.de/dp1637.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green Iain Staffell|first=Richard|date=2017-06-01|title='Prosumage' and the British Electricity Market|journal=Economics of Energy & Environmental Policy|language=English|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.5547/2160-5890.6.1.rgre|issn=2160-5882}}</ref> It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places. The European Union\u2019s Nobel Grid project, which is part of their Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, uses the term in this way, for example.\n\nToffler\u2019s Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler, who saw Prosumer/Prosumption as a new challenge for marketers.<ref>Kotler, Philip. (1986). Prosumers: A New Type of Customer. Futurist(September\u2013October), 24-28.</ref> Philip Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume, furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it. He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities, and to more sustainable lifestyles, that topic was further developed by Tomasz Szymusiak in 2013 and 2015 in two marketing books.<ref>Szymusiak T., (2013).

Such motivated enthusiasts can be, for instance, brought into a company's research and development process. This may produce strengthened customer relations and faster feedback cycles. Companies and individuals are increasingly utilizing and involving the [[end-user]]s to develop final products and services. In some instances, end-users are creating products on their own, without the interference from or assistance of companies, organizations, etc. For example, [[Lego Mindstorms]] allows users to download software from Lego's website so that the users can edit and update software as they wish.\n\n===Activism===\nAmong some [[activist]] groups,{{which|date=August 2019}} the producer and consumer roles are being combined so as to ''exclude'' (or at least diminish) the role of the [[corporation|corporate]] producer; thus, rather than generating higher corporate profits from [[value-add]]ed products, producers would, at best, be reduced to supplying lower-profit [[commodity]] inputs. Indeed, the more consumer-oriented prosumer spin is irrelevant to many people with diminished disposable income caused by various economic trends such as [[globalization]], [[automation]], and [[wealth concentration]].\n\n== Impact and reception ==\n\n===Adoption===\nIdentifiable trends and movements outside of the mainstream economy that have adopted prosumer terminology and techniques include:\n*a ''Do It Yourself'' ([[DIY]]) approach as a means of economic self-sufficiency or simply as a way to survive on diminished income\n*the [[open source software]] movement creates software on their own, prime example is the successful [[operating system]] [[Linux]] which now dominates the server domain\n*[[Fablab]] movement, self-fabrication capabilities especially [[3d printing]]\n*the [[voluntary simplicity]] movement that seeks personal, social, and environmental goals through prosumer activities such as:\n**growing one's own food\n**repairing clothing and appliances rather than buying new items\n**playing musical instruments rather than listening to recorded music\n*use of new media-creation and distribution technologies to foster independent, open, non-profit, \"consumer-to-consumer\" media and cultures (see [[Wikipedia]], [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]], most of [[Creative Commons]]); many involved in independent media reject [[popular culture|mass culture]] generated by [[concentration of media ownership|concentrated corporate media]]\n*self-sufficient [[barter (economics)|barter]] networks, notably in [[developing nations]], such as Argentina's [[Red Global de Clubes de Trueque Multirec\u00edproco|RGT]] have adopted the term prosumer<sup>[[#External links|4]]</sup>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Commons-based peer production]]\n*[[Creative consumer]]\n*[[Read/write culture]]\n*[[Cost the limit of price]]\n*[[Participatory culture]]\n*[[Power user]]\n*[[Produsage]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Chen, Katherine K.
