Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], Cheltenham, on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of [[Tenterground]] at [[Spitalfields]], [[London]]. Furthermore, Cooke's father, Francis, is recorded in the 1762 [[English Land Tax|Land Tax Assessment]] Book for the Parish of Saint Mary, Whitechapel, as residing between [[Alie Street]] and [[Leman Street|Leman Street (West side)]], close to the corner of North and East Tenter streets.{{r|\"Land Tax\"}}{{r|Location of Tenterground}}.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date.

In September of the same year, an ad signed by lecturer Dr. Jelveh, then caretaker of Isfahan Province Health and Medical Treatment Department, was published in local newspapers calling on prospective students to enroll in the new institute. The first classes were held at Sadi High School (now Soureh Institute). Many more students enrolled in subsequent years; therefore, the institute had to find a larger campus to accommodate the growing number of new students. On October 29, 1950, the first series of classes were held at the University of Isfahan. Other colleges such as the Medical University, the newly established College of Medicine and Literature College on Shahzadeh Ebrahim street also joined the University of Isfahan and were relocated in the main campus in subsequent years.

A second \"millennium\" edition with a [[CD-ROM]] of software was published in 2001, a third edition in 2008, and a fourth \"ultimate\" edition in 2018.\n\n==Topics==\nThere have been many different calendars in different societies, and there is much difficulty in converting between them, largely because of the impossibility of reconciling the [[irrational number|irrational]] ratios of the daily, monthly, and yearly astronomical cycle lengths using integers.{{r|ranada}} The 14 calendars discussed in the first edition of the book included the [[Gregorian calendar]], [[ISO week date]], [[Julian calendar]], [[Coptic calendar]], [[Ethiopian calendar]], [[Islamic calendar]], modern [[Iranian calendars|Iranian calendar]], [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed calendar]], [[French Republican calendar]], old and modern [[Hindu calendar]]s, [[Maya calendar]], and modern [[Chinese calendar]].{{r|ranada|katz}} Later editions expanded it to many more calendars.{{r|akutowicz|lumiste|cook}} They are divided into two groups: \"arithmetical\" calendars, whose calculations can be performed purely mathematically, independently from the positions of the moon and sun, and \"astronomical\" calendars, based in part on those positions.{{r|mccarthy}}\n\nThe authors design individual [[calendrical calculation]] algorithms for converting each of these calendars to and from a common format, the [[Rata Die]] system of days numbered from January 1 of the (fictional) Gregorian year 1. Combining these methods allows the conversion between any two of the calendars.{{r|katz|kelley}} One of the innovations of the book is the use of clever coding to replace tables of values of mildly-irregular sequences, such as the numbers of days in a month.{{r|willson}} The authors also discuss the history of the calendars they describe, analyze their accuracy with respect to the astronomical events that they were designed to model, and point out important days in the year of each calendar.{{r|katz}} An appendix includes full documentation of the software.{{r|mccarthy|kudlek}}\n\nOne purpose of the book is to provide usable and efficient open software in an area where previous solutions were largely proprietary, incomplete, and buggy.{{r|willson}} Author Edward Reingold originally programmed these methods in [[Emacs Lisp]], as part of the text editor [[GNU Emacs]], and the authors expanded an earlier journal publication on this implementation into the book.{{r|ranada|cook}} This code has been converted to [[Common Lisp]] for the book, with an open license, and included within the book as a precise and unambiguous way of describing each algorithm.{{r|cook}}\n\n==Audience and reception==\nThis is primarily a reference book, but can also be read for pleasure by readers interested in this topic.{{r|willson}} Reviewer [[Victor J. Katz]] recommends this book to anyone who is \"at all interested in how we deal with time\".{{r|katz}} However, reviewer John D. Cook points out that, to understand the details of the algorithms described in the book, readers must be familiar with Lisp coding, and that it is difficult to skim without working through the details.{{r|cook}} On the other hand, despite not being easy reading, reviewer Antonio F. Ra\u00f1ada recommends it not only to \"mathematicians, astronomers or computer scientists, but also for historians or for any person interested in the cultural aspects of science\".{{r|ranada}}\n\nReviewer [[Noel Swerdlow]] views the first edition as a \"work in progress\", preferring the 19th-century tables of Robert Schram to computerized methods.{{r|swerdlow}} And while praising it for avoiding the \"second-hand errors, third-order simplifications, and outright myths\" of many other millennial works on the calendar, reviewer [[Robert Poole (historian)|Robert Poole]] points out as a weakness that it only considers a single version of each calendar, whereas historically these systems went through multiple revisions, and quotes the book as noting that its results are sometimes \"mathematically sensible, but culturally wrong\". Adding that the reduction of a human-produced calendar to a computer calculation is \"sheer hubris\", he nevertheless concludes that \"We can be grateful that so useful a work of reference has been created from a project of such awe-inspiring futility\".{{r|poole}} And reviewer Manfred Kudlek calls this \"the most extensive and detailed publication on calendar systems\" since the early 20th-century ''Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie'' of [[Friedrich Karl Ginzel]].{{r|kudlek}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=akutowicz>{{citation|first=A.|last=Akutowicz|journal=[[zbMATH]]| title = Review of ''Calendrical Calculations'' (2nd ed.)|zbl=1004.01001}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=cook>{{citation|first=John D.|last=Cook|journal=MAA Reviews|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|title=Review of ''Calendrical Calculations'' (4th ed.)|url=https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/calendrical-calculations-the-ultimate-edition|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=katz>{{citation|first=Victor J.|last=Katz|authorlink=Victor J.

Petals are usually accompanied by another set of special leaves called [[sepal]]s, that collectively form the ''calyx'' and lie just beneath the corolla. The calyx and the corolla together make up the [[perianth]]. When the petals and sepals of a flower are difficult to distinguish, they are collectively called [[tepal]]s.

Conversely, genera such as ''[[Rose|Rosa]]'' and ''[[Phaseolus]]'' have well-distinguished sepals and petals. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are referred to as \"petaloid\", as in [[petaloid monocots]], orders of monocots with brightly coloured tepals. Since they include [[Liliales]], an alternative name is lilioid monocots.\n\nAlthough petals are usually the most conspicuous parts of animal-pollinated flowers, wind-pollinated species, such as the [[Poaceae|grasses]], either have very small petals or lack them entirely.\n\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 400\n| image1 = Petal-sepal.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Tetramery (botany)|Tetrameric]] flower of a Primrose [[Onagraceae|willowherb]] (''[[Ludwigia octovalvis]]'') showing petals and sepals\n| image2 = Tulip Tulipa clusiana 'Lady Jane' Rock Ledge Flower 2000px.jpg\n| caption2 = A [[Tulip]]'s actinomorphic flower with three petals and three sepals, that collectively present a good example of an undifferentiated perianth.

The [[merosity|number of petals in a flower]] may hold clues to a plant's classification.  For example, flowers on [[eudicots]] (the largest group of [[dicotyledon|dicots]]) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on [[monocotyledon|monocots]] have three or six petals, although there are many exceptions to this rule.<ref>{{cite journal |title= The origin and diversification of angiosperms |author= Soltis, Pamela S.|authorlink = Pamela S.

If all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape, the flower is said to be '''regular'''<ref name=EB1911/> or '''actinomorphic''' (meaning \"ray-formed\"). Many flowers are symmetrical in only one plane (i.e., symmetry is bilateral) and are termed '''irregular''' or '''zygomorphic''' (meaning \"yoke-\" or \"pair-formed\"). In ''irregular'' flowers, other floral parts may be modified from the ''regular'' form, but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry. Examples of [[Floral symmetry|zygomorphic]] flowers may be seen in [[orchid]]s and members of the [[Fabaceae|pea family]].\n\nIn many plants of the [[Asteraceae|aster family]] such as the sunflower, ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'', the circumference of the [[Head (botany)|flower head]] is composed of ray florets.  Each ray floret is anatomically an individual flower with a single large petal.  Florets in the centre of the disc typically have no or very reduced petals. In some plants such as ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'' the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup ('''[[hypanthium]]''') above the ovary, and from which the petals proper extend.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=p. 365}}{{sfn|Foster|2014|loc=[http://plant-phytography.blogspot.ca/2012/10/hypanthium-cup-shaped-or-tubular.html Hypanthium]}}<ref name=Graham/>\n\nPetal often consists of two parts: the upper, broad part, similar to leaf blade, also called the ''blade'' and the lower part, narrow, similar to leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], called the ''claw'',<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Flower|first=Alfred Barton|last=Rendle|volume=10|pages=561\u2013563}}</ref> separated from each other at the ''limb''.

''Organogenesis of Flowers. A Photographic Text-Atlas''. University of Toronto Press.</ref> Petals of different species of plants vary greatly in colour or colour pattern, both in visible light and in ultraviolet. Such patterns often function as guides to pollinators, and are variously known as [[nectar guide]]s, pollen guides, and floral guides.\n\n==Genetics==\nThe genetics behind the formation of petals, in accordance with the [[ABC Model of Flower Development|ABC model of flower development]], are that sepals, petals, [[stamen]]s, and [[carpels]] are modified versions of each other.  It appears that the mechanisms to form petals evolved very few times (perhaps only once), rather than evolving repeatedly from stamens.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.3732/ajb.0800038 |title= One size fits all?

Pollen is produced by the male flower or by the male organs of [[monoecious|hermaphroditic]] flowers.\n\nPollen does not move on its own and thus requires wind or animal pollinators to disperse the pollen to the [[stigma (botany)]] of the same or nearby flowers. However, pollinators are rather selective in determining the flowers they choose to pollinate. This develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators (unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination). Petals play a major role in competing to attract pollinators. Henceforth pollination dispersal could occur and the survival of many species of flowers could prolong.\n\n==Functions and purposes==\nPetals have various functions and purposes depending on the type of plant. In general, petals operate to protect some parts of the flower and attract/repel specific pollinators.\n\n===Function===\nThis is where the positioning of the flower petals are located on the flower is the corolla e.g. the buttercup having shiny yellow flower petals which contain guidelines amongst the petals in aiding the pollinator towards the nectar. Pollinators have the ability to determine specific flowers they wish to pollinate.<ref>Cares-Suarez, R,  Poch, T, Acevedo, R.F, Acosta-Bravo, I, Pimentel, C,  Espinoza, C, Cares, R.A, Munoz, P, Gonzalez, A.V, Botto-Mahan, C (2011) Do pollinators respond in a dose-dependent manner to flower herbivory?: An experimental assessment in Loasa tricolor (Loasaceae).

[http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Pollination/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/Attracting-pollinators]</ref>\n\n===Shape and size===\nFurthermore, the shape and size of the flower/petals is important in selecting the type of pollinators they need. For example, large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance or that are large themselves.<ref name=SLH/>\nCollectively the scent, colour and shape of petals all play a role in attracting/repelling specific pollinators and providing suitable conditions for pollinating. Some pollinators include insects, birds, bats and the wind.<ref name=SLH/>\nIn some petals, a distinction can be made between a lower narrowed, stalk-like basal part referred to as the claw, and a wider distal part referred to as the blade (or limb). Often the claw and blade are at an angle with one another.\n\n==Types of pollination==\n\n===Wind pollination===\n{{main|Anemophily}}\nWind-pollinated flowers often have small, dull petals and produce little or no scent. Some of these flowers will often have no petals at all. Flowers that depend on wind pollination will produce large amounts of pollen because most of the pollen scattered by the wind tends to not reach other flowers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Wind Pollination in the Angiosperms: Evolutionary and Environmental Considerations|author=Donald R. Whitehead|journal=Evolution|volume=23|issue=1|year=1969|pages=28\u201335|doi=10.2307/2406479|pmid = 28562955|jstor=2406479}}</ref>\n\n===Attracting insects===\nFlowers have various regulatory mechanisms in order to attract insects. One such helpful mechanism is the use of colour guiding marks. Insects such as the bee or butterfly can see the ultraviolet marks which are contained on these flowers, acting as an attractive mechanism which is not visible towards the human eye. Many flowers contain a variety of shapes acting to aid with the landing of the visiting insect and also influence the insect to brush against anthers and stigmas (parts of the flower). One such example of a flower is the pohutukawa (''Metrosideros excelsa'') which acts to regulate colour within a different way. The pohutukawa contains small petals also having bright large red clusters of stamens.<ref name=SLH/>\nAnother attractive mechanism for flowers is the use of scents which are highly attractive to humans. One such example is the rose. On the other hand, some flowers produce the smell of rotting meat and are attractive to insects such as flies. Darkness is another factor which flowers have adapted to as nighttime conditions limit vision and color-perception. Fragrancy can be especially useful for flowers which are pollinated at night by moths and other flying insects.<ref name=SLH/>\n\n===Attracting birds===\nFlowers are also pollinated by birds and must be large and colorful to be visible against natural scenery. In New Zealand, such bird\u2013pollinated native plants include: kowhai (''Sophora'' species), flax (''Phormium tenax'') and kaka beak (''Clianthus puniceus''). Flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change colour in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit. An example is the tree fuchsia (''Fuchsia excorticata'') which are green when needing to be pollinated and turn red for the birds to stop coming and pollinating the flower.<ref name=SLH/>\n\n===Bat-pollinated flowers===\nFlowers can be pollinated by short tailed bats. An example of this is the dactylanthus (''Dactylanthus taylorii''). This plant has its home under the ground acting the role of a parasite on the roots of forest trees. The dactylanthus has only its flowers pointing to the surface and the flowers lack colour but have the advantage of containing lots of nectar and a very strong scent. These act as a very useful mechanism in attracting the bat.<ref>Physics.org (2012). University of Adelaide. \"Flightless parrots, burrowing bats helped parasitic Hades flower\".

If all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape, the flower is said to be '''regular'''<ref name=EB1911/> or '''actinomorphic''' (meaning \"ray-formed\"). Many flowers are symmetrical in only one plane (i.e., symmetry is bilateral) and are termed '''irregular''' or '''zygomorphic''' (meaning \"yoke-\" or \"pair-formed\"). In ''irregular'' flowers, other floral parts may be modified from the ''regular'' form, but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry. Examples of [[Floral symmetry|zygomorphic]] flowers may be seen in [[orchid]]s and members of the [[Fabaceae|pea family]].\n\nIn many plants of the [[Asteraceae|aster family]] such as the sunflower, ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'', the circumference of the [[Head (botany)|flower head]] is composed of ray florets.  Each ray floret is anatomically an individual flower with a single large petal.  Florets in the centre of the disc typically have no or very reduced petals. In some plants such as ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'' the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup ('''[[hypanthium]]''') above the ovary, and from which the petals proper extend.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=p. 365}}{{sfn|Foster|2014|loc=[http://plant-phytography.blogspot.ca/2012/10/hypanthium-cup-shaped-or-tubular.html Hypanthium]}}<ref name=Graham/>\n\nPetal often consists of two parts: the upper, broad part, similar to leaf blade, also called the ''blade'' and the lower part, narrow, similar to leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], called the ''claw'',<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Flower|first=Alfred Barton|last=Rendle|volume=10|pages=561\u2013563}}</ref> separated from each other at the ''limb''. Claws are developed in petals of some flowers of the family ''[[Brassicaceae]]'', such as ''[[Erysimum cheiri]]''.\n\nThe inception and further development of petals shows a great variety of patterns.<ref>Sattler, R. 1973. ''Organogenesis of Flowers. A Photographic Text-Atlas''. University of Toronto Press.</ref> Petals of different species of plants vary greatly in colour or colour pattern, both in visible light and in ultraviolet. Such patterns often function as guides to pollinators, and are variously known as [[nectar guide]]s, pollen guides, and floral guides.\n\n==Genetics==\nThe genetics behind the formation of petals, in accordance with the [[ABC Model of Flower Development|ABC model of flower development]], are that sepals, petals, [[stamen]]s, and [[carpels]] are modified versions of each other.  It appears that the mechanisms to form petals evolved very few times (perhaps only once), rather than evolving repeatedly from stamens.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.3732/ajb.0800038 |title= One size fits all?

Pollen is produced by the male flower or by the male organs of [[monoecious|hermaphroditic]] flowers.\n\nPollen does not move on its own and thus requires wind or animal pollinators to disperse the pollen to the [[stigma (botany)]] of the same or nearby flowers. However, pollinators are rather selective in determining the flowers they choose to pollinate. This develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators (unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination). Petals play a major role in competing to attract pollinators. Henceforth pollination dispersal could occur and the survival of many species of flowers could prolong.\n\n==Functions and purposes==\nPetals have various functions and purposes depending on the type of plant. In general, petals operate to protect some parts of the flower and attract/repel specific pollinators.\n\n===Function===\nThis is where the positioning of the flower petals are located on the flower is the corolla e.g. the buttercup having shiny yellow flower petals which contain guidelines amongst the petals in aiding the pollinator towards the nectar. Pollinators have the ability to determine specific flowers they wish to pollinate.<ref>Cares-Suarez, R,  Poch, T, Acevedo, R.F, Acosta-Bravo, I, Pimentel, C,  Espinoza, C, Cares, R.A, Munoz, P, Gonzalez, A.V, Botto-Mahan, C (2011) Do pollinators respond in a dose-dependent manner to flower herbivory?: An experimental assessment in Loasa tricolor (Loasaceae). Gayana Botanica, Volume 68, Pages 176-181</ref> Using incentives flowers draw pollinators and set up a mutual relation between each other in which case the pollinators will remember to always guard and pollinate these flowers (unless incentives are not consistently met and competition prevails).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Chamberlain S.A |author2=Rudgers J.A | year = 2012 | title = How do plants balance multiple mutualists?

Some flowers are able to change the colour of their petals as a signal to mutual pollinators to approach or keep away.<ref name=SLH>Science Learning Hub. (2012). The University of Waikato. \"Attracting pollinators\". Date Retrieved: August 2013. [http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Pollination/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/Attracting-pollinators]</ref>\n\n===Shape and size===\nFurthermore, the shape and size of the flower/petals is important in selecting the type of pollinators they need. For example, large petals and flowers will attract pollinators at a large distance or that are large themselves.<ref name=SLH/>\nCollectively the scent, colour and shape of petals all play a role in attracting/repelling specific pollinators and providing suitable conditions for pollinating. Some pollinators include insects, birds, bats and the wind.<ref name=SLH/>\nIn some petals, a distinction can be made between a lower narrowed, stalk-like basal part referred to as the claw, and a wider distal part referred to as the blade (or limb). Often the claw and blade are at an angle with one another.\n\n==Types of pollination==\n\n===Wind pollination===\n{{main|Anemophily}}\nWind-pollinated flowers often have small, dull petals and produce little or no scent. Some of these flowers will often have no petals at all. Flowers that depend on wind pollination will produce large amounts of pollen because most of the pollen scattered by the wind tends to not reach other flowers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Wind Pollination in the Angiosperms: Evolutionary and Environmental Considerations|author=Donald R. Whitehead|journal=Evolution|volume=23|issue=1|year=1969|pages=28\u201335|doi=10.2307/2406479|pmid = 28562955|jstor=2406479}}</ref>\n\n===Attracting insects===\nFlowers have various regulatory mechanisms in order to attract insects. One such helpful mechanism is the use of colour guiding marks. Insects such as the bee or butterfly can see the ultraviolet marks which are contained on these flowers, acting as an attractive mechanism which is not visible towards the human eye. Many flowers contain a variety of shapes acting to aid with the landing of the visiting insect and also influence the insect to brush against anthers and stigmas (parts of the flower). One such example of a flower is the pohutukawa (''Metrosideros excelsa'') which acts to regulate colour within a different way. The pohutukawa contains small petals also having bright large red clusters of stamens.<ref name=SLH/>\nAnother attractive mechanism for flowers is the use of scents which are highly attractive to humans. One such example is the rose. On the other hand, some flowers produce the smell of rotting meat and are attractive to insects such as flies. Darkness is another factor which flowers have adapted to as nighttime conditions limit vision and color-perception. Fragrancy can be especially useful for flowers which are pollinated at night by moths and other flying insects.<ref name=SLH/>\n\n===Attracting birds===\nFlowers are also pollinated by birds and must be large and colorful to be visible against natural scenery. In New Zealand, such bird\u2013pollinated native plants include: kowhai (''Sophora'' species), flax (''Phormium tenax'') and kaka beak (''Clianthus puniceus''). Flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change colour in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit. An example is the tree fuchsia (''Fuchsia excorticata'') which are green when needing to be pollinated and turn red for the birds to stop coming and pollinating the flower.<ref name=SLH/>\n\n===Bat-pollinated flowers===\nFlowers can be pollinated by short tailed bats. An example of this is the dactylanthus (''Dactylanthus taylorii''). This plant has its home under the ground acting the role of a parasite on the roots of forest trees. The dactylanthus has only its flowers pointing to the surface and the flowers lack colour but have the advantage of containing lots of nectar and a very strong scent. These act as a very useful mechanism in attracting the bat.<ref>Physics.org (2012). University of Adelaide. \"Flightless parrots, burrowing bats helped parasitic Hades flower\".

At first, immediately after he carried out the massacre, he made a series of partial but slightly varying explanations with the aim of exonerating himself from any blame. Later, after receiving approval for his actions from all his superiors in India, both civil and military, Dyer stated that his actions were a deliberate attempt to punish people he believed were rebels, and to make an example for the rest of the Punjab that would stop what he regarded as a rebellion. Finally, on Dyer's return to England in disgrace in 1920, his lawyers argued that his actions, though deliberate and premeditated, were justified because he was facing an insurrection and that, on those grounds, any amount of firing was permissible.<ref name= colletreviewlloyd/>\n\nDyer wrote an article in the ''Globe'' of 21 January 1921, entitled, \"The Peril to the Empire\". It commenced with \"India does not want self-government. She does not understand it.\" He wrote later that:<ref name=\"Collett-2006\" />{{RP|406-407}}\n*It is only to an enlightened people that free speech and a free press can be extended.

The British Raj must continue, firm and unshaken in its administration of justice to all men.\n\nIn his official response to [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre#The Hunter Commission|the Hunter commission]] that inquired into the shooting, Dyer was unremorseful and stated: \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/sep/20jal.htm|title=Colonel Dyer was hardly remorseful for Jallianwala massacre}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in his account of the massacre [[Nick Lloyd (historian)|Nick Lloyd]] claims that although Dyer later claimed to have undertaken the massacre to \"save\" British India, he had had no such idea in his mind that fateful afternoon. As well as being \"dazed and shaken up\" \u2013 hardly the response of a soldier who had had murder in his mind \u2013 all the witnesses recall how Dyer \"was unnerved and deeply upset about what had happened\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Nick|title=The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day |date=2011 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-0857730770 |edition=Rev |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z6X3AgAAQBAJ |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> \n\n[[Nigel Collett]] - author of the biography ''[[The Butcher of Amritsar]]'' - is convinced that the Amritsar massacre preyed on Dyer's mind from the very day he opened fire. \"He spent the rest of his life trying to justify himself. He persuaded himself it had been his duty to act as he did, but he could not persuade his soul that he had done right. It rotted his mind and, I am guessing here, added to his sickness.\"<ref name=NigelCollet>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050605/asp/look/story_4823931.asp|title=Dyer consequences - interview with Nigel Collett|quote=He (Dyer) was not racially prejudiced; his prejudices were anti-civilian... He was personally interested in his men, of whatever race. He enjoyed their company, liked talking to them directly in his tent and bungalow, recommended many of them for bravery and service awards and defended them against civilians. He took great interest in getting them better rations, finding them good billets, requisitioned fans and bicycles for them (all taken from civilians), whether they were British soldiers or Indian. They loved him in return. He was physically a very brave man, renowned for his courage. Collett's answer is: My interpretation is that Dyer did what he did to assuage his deep-seated fears that the India that was his whole life, and the safety of his family, were under threat in a new mutiny in Punjab in 1919, and that, in Amritsar, he could stop it. But the explanations he gave later for his actions were confusing and unconvincing.}}</ref>\n\nCollett, in his book, portrays Dyer as a man who got on extremely well with his men and his juniors, while his contemporaries and seniors were always wary of him. When he approached a complex political problem, his one thought was to have order; his one tool to get it was the gun. He notes that, at the time of the Amritsar massacre, Dyer was wracked by ill-health and separated from his beloved family. Collett speculates that perhaps this encouraged Dyer's extreme view that the Punjab was on the brink of rebellion, with the empire about to collapse, and feared a mutiny like that of [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857]]. The solution, he decided, was not just to restore order but to show that the state was in charge. It was not enough to have shops and businesses reopen in Amritsar - an example was needed of the consequences of insubordination.<ref name=ButcherofAmritsar>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/a-family-man-whose-bloody-disposition-sent-the-british-into-a-spin/201603.article |title=A family man whose bloody disposition sent the British into a spin|quote=Dyer faced the traumas of boarding school in Ireland and the trials of getting through Sandhurst and obtaining a commission without the help of patrons.

A \"Thirteen Women Committee\" was constituted to present \"the Saviour of the Punjab with the sword of honour and a purse\". Large contributions to the fund were made by civil servants and by British Army and Indian Army officers, although serving members of the military were not allowed to donate to political funds under the King's Regulations (para. 443).<ref name=\"Collett-2006\" />{{RP|390}}\n\nThe ''Morning Post'' had supported Dyer's action on the grounds that the massacre was necessary to \"Protect the honour of European Women\".<ref>Morning Post, cited in Derek Sayer, ''British Reaction of Amritsar massacre'', 1919\u201320, reprinted in ''Jallianwala Bagh Commemoration Volume'', Patiala, 1997, p 45.</ref>\n\nMany Indians, including [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]], were outraged by the fund for Dyer, particularly due to the families of the victims killed at the Jallianwala Bagh, who were still fighting for government compensation.

At first, immediately after he carried out the massacre, he made a series of partial but slightly varying explanations with the aim of exonerating himself from any blame. Later, after receiving approval for his actions from all his superiors in India, both civil and military, Dyer stated that his actions were a deliberate attempt to punish people he believed were rebels, and to make an example for the rest of the Punjab that would stop what he regarded as a rebellion. Finally, on Dyer's return to England in disgrace in 1920, his lawyers argued that his actions, though deliberate and premeditated, were justified because he was facing an insurrection and that, on those grounds, any amount of firing was permissible.<ref name= colletreviewlloyd/>\n\nDyer wrote an article in the ''Globe'' of 21 January 1921, entitled, \"The Peril to the Empire\". It commenced with \"India does not want self-government. She does not understand it.\" He wrote later that:<ref name=\"Collett-2006\" />{{RP|406-407}}\n*It is only to an enlightened people that free speech and a free press can be extended.

The British Raj must continue, firm and unshaken in its administration of justice to all men.\n\nIn his official response to [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre#The Hunter Commission|the Hunter commission]] that inquired into the shooting, Dyer was unremorseful and stated: \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/sep/20jal.htm|title=Colonel Dyer was hardly remorseful for Jallianwala massacre}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in his account of the massacre [[Nick Lloyd (historian)|Nick Lloyd]] claims that although Dyer later claimed to have undertaken the massacre to \"save\" British India, he had had no such idea in his mind that fateful afternoon. As well as being \"dazed and shaken up\" \u2013 hardly the response of a soldier who had had murder in his mind \u2013 all the witnesses recall how Dyer \"was unnerved and deeply upset about what had happened\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Nick|title=The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day |date=2011 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-0857730770 |edition=Rev |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z6X3AgAAQBAJ |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> \n\n[[Nigel Collett]] - author of the biography ''[[The Butcher of Amritsar]]'' - is convinced that the Amritsar massacre preyed on Dyer's mind from the very day he opened fire. \"He spent the rest of his life trying to justify himself. He persuaded himself it had been his duty to act as he did, but he could not persuade his soul that he had done right. It rotted his mind and, I am guessing here, added to his sickness.\"<ref name=NigelCollet>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050605/asp/look/story_4823931.asp|title=Dyer consequences - interview with Nigel Collett|quote=He (Dyer) was not racially prejudiced; his prejudices were anti-civilian... He was personally interested in his men, of whatever race. He enjoyed their company, liked talking to them directly in his tent and bungalow, recommended many of them for bravery and service awards and defended them against civilians. He took great interest in getting them better rations, finding them good billets, requisitioned fans and bicycles for them (all taken from civilians), whether they were British soldiers or Indian. They loved him in return. He was physically a very brave man, renowned for his courage. Collett's answer is: My interpretation is that Dyer did what he did to assuage his deep-seated fears that the India that was his whole life, and the safety of his family, were under threat in a new mutiny in Punjab in 1919, and that, in Amritsar, he could stop it. But the explanations he gave later for his actions were confusing and unconvincing.}}</ref>\n\nCollett, in his book, portrays Dyer as a man who got on extremely well with his men and his juniors, while his contemporaries and seniors were always wary of him. When he approached a complex political problem, his one thought was to have order; his one tool to get it was the gun. He notes that, at the time of the Amritsar massacre, Dyer was wracked by ill-health and separated from his beloved family. Collett speculates that perhaps this encouraged Dyer's extreme view that the Punjab was on the brink of rebellion, with the empire about to collapse, and feared a mutiny like that of [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857]]. The solution, he decided, was not just to restore order but to show that the state was in charge. It was not enough to have shops and businesses reopen in Amritsar - an example was needed of the consequences of insubordination.<ref name=ButcherofAmritsar>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/a-family-man-whose-bloody-disposition-sent-the-british-into-a-spin/201603.article |title=A family man whose bloody disposition sent the British into a spin|quote=Dyer faced the traumas of boarding school in Ireland and the trials of getting through Sandhurst and obtaining a commission without the help of patrons.

There could be no question of undue severity. The mutineers had thrown out the challenge and the punishment, if administered at all, must be complete, unhesitating and immediate.\"<ref name=colletreviewlloyd>{{cite web|url=https://ourtribes.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/my-review-of-nick-lloyds-book-on-the-amritsar-massacre/|title=Nigel Collet's Review of Nick Lloyd's Book on the Amritsar Massacre|quote=Must we continue to try to evade the fact that sometimes those who ran the Empire were capable of catastrophic failures of judgment?

These required that force should be constrained by what was reasonable to achieve an immediate objective; minimum, not maximum, force should be deployed. Moreover, proper warning had to be given. On April 13, 1919, as demonstrated by Collett, Dyer ignored this. While he may have believed the Raj was threatened, and may have thought the mob was out to attack him and his soldiers, this does not justify his cavalier abuse of procedure and his indifference to Indian suffering.
