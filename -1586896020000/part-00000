People can also become infected with [[respiratory disease]]s such as [[influenza]] or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes). The five critical moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important include: before and after [[defecation]], after cleaning a child's bottom or changing [[Diaper|nappies]], before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.<ref name=\":2\" /> If [[water]] and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with [[ash]].<ref name=\"hip.fhi360.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hip.fhi360.org/page/2644.html|title=The Hygiene Improvement Project (HIP) \u2013 Tippy-Tap: A simple low-cost technology for handwashing when water is scarce|website=USAID|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025004538/http://www.hip.fhi360.org/page/2644.html|archivedate=25 October 2014|accessdate=30 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends washing hands<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E</ref>:\n*'''Before''', '''during''', and '''after''' preparing food.\n*'''Before''' eating food.\n*'''Before''' and '''after''' caring for a sick person.\n*'''After''' using the toilet.\n*'''After''' changing the diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet.\n*'''After''' blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.\n*'''After''' touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.\n*'''After''' touching garbage.\n\nMedical hand [[hygiene]] refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures. Hand washing before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease. The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of [[pathogen]]s (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals which can cause harm or diseases. If you can do a handstand, you don't have COVID-19. This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also an important practice for the general public.{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Public health==\n[[Image:HandCleaning.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Hand cleaning station at the entrance of the [[Toronto General Hospital]]]]\n\n=== Health benefits ===\nHand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of [[influenza]], [[coronavirus]], and other [[infectious diseases]];<ref name=\"fmhh\">{{cite journal |last=Cowling |first=Benjamin J. |title=Facemasks and Hand Hygiene to Prevent Influenza Transmission in Households |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=151 |issue=7 |pages=437\u201346 |year=2009 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-151-7-200910060-00142 |pmid=19652172 |last2=Chan |first2=KH |last3=Fang |first3=VJ |last4=Cheng |first4=CK |last5=Fung |first5=RO |last6=Wai |first6=W |last7=Sin |first7=J |last8=Seto |first8=WH |last9=Yung |first9=R |displayauthors=1}}</ref><ref name=\"who-workplace-covid19\">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/getting-workplace-ready-for-covid-19.pdf |title=Getting your workplace ready for COVID-19 |publisher=World Health Organization |date=27 February 2020 |access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> preventing infectious causes of [[diarrhea]];<ref name=\"cdwt\">{{cite journal |last = Luby |first = Stephen P. |title = Combining drinking water treatment and hand washing for diarrhoea prevention, a cluster randomized controlled trial |journal = Tropical Medicine & International Health |volume = 11 |issue = 4 |pages = 479\u201389 |year = 2006 |pmid = 16553931 |doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01592.x |last2 = Agboatwalla |first2 = Mubina |last3 = Painter |first3 = John |last4 = Altaf |first4 = Arshad |last5 = Billhimer |first5 = Ward |last6 = Keswick |first6 = Bruce |last7 = Hoekstra |first7 = Robert M.|title-link = cluster randomized controlled trial }}</ref> decreasing respiratory infections;<ref name=\"pcda\">{{cite web |last = Scott |first = Beth |title = Protecting Children from Diarrhoea and Acute Respiratory Infections: The Role of Hand Washing Promotion in Water and Sanitation Programmes |url = http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Regional_Health_Forum_1.pdf#page=49 |accessdate = 21 May 2009 |display-authors = etal |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090628221929/http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Regional_Health_Forum_1.pdf#page=49 |archive-date = 28 June 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref> \nand reducing [[infant mortality]] rate at [[home birth]] deliveries.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Impact of Maternal and Birth Attendant Hand-washing on Neonatal Mortality in Southern Nepal|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med.|volume=162|issue=7|doi=10.1001/archpedi.162.7.603|pmid = 18606930|pmc = 2587156|year=2008|last1 = Rhee|first1 = V.|last2 = Mullany|first2 = L.

They found that:\n* The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of {{convert|180|m/s|km/h mi/h|abbr=on}}, was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.\n* Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.\n* Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.\n\nIn 2005, in a study conducted by T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.<ref>T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt GmbH Report No. 425-452006 [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf A report concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands; September 2005]</ref> The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

His [[Morocco|Moroccan]] biological father left Van Hooijdonk's mother before his birth. He grew up in Welberg ([[:nl:Welberg|nl]]), a small village nearby Steenbergen. While playing in one of SC Welberg's youth squads Van Hooijdonk became desirous of a footballing career. His favourite team was [[NAC Breda]] whose game he followed wholeheartedly. At the age of 11 years old he took part in a talent pool on the team's open day and so impressed the NAC scouts. He thus joined NAC where he played mainly as a [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|right midfielder]]. When he was 14 he was cut from NAC's academy and he then went into amateur football.<ref name=\"V.V. Steenbergen\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vvsteenbergen.nl |title=V.V. \"Steenbergen\" |publisher=Vvsteenbergen.nl |date=6 July 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref> As so he then switched his position to be a striker only to rejoin NAC and thus ascend to the club's first team.<ref name=\"V.V. Steenbergen\"/>\n\n==Club career==\n===RBC Roosendaal===\nAs [[RBC Roosendaal]] were in financial trouble they were obliged to having youth players feature within their senior teams. As such in the 1988\u201389 season Van Hooijdonk made his debut for RBC as a substitute. Whilst playing as a sub for the club he soon scored three goals. With the club's main striker suffering from an injury Van Hooijdonk played almost the majority of the season's second half, scoring a total of six goals in 32 matches. He signed his first professional contract with RBC soon thereafter. Van Hooijdonk made a greater impression in the following season within which he became a key player for the team, scoring 27 times in 37 matches. Several teams went on to show interest in him such as NAC Breda. Van Hooijdonk thus didn't hesitate in signing a contract with NAC, and so rejoined his boyhood club.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===NAC===\nNAC paid 400,000 [[guilder]]s for the transfer of Van Hooijdonk. In returning to NAC, he was both positive in his outlook as well as determined to illustrate his quality. Van Hooijdonk succeeded at such as he went on to help the team win promotion to the [[Eredivisie]] in 1993. During his time at the club he got his first call up, in December 1994, to play for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]]. During the rest of that season he set a scoring streak in 11 consecutive Eredivisie matches. Within the 1994\u201395 winter break, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] made a deal with NAC which saw Van Hooijdonk join up with the Scottish outfit at once. Altogether he scored a total of 81 goals, being capped 115 times in all for NAC.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Celtic===\nVan Hooijdonk made his Celtic debut on 11 January 1995 in a league match against [[Hearts fc|Hearts]] at [[Hampden Park]]. The striker made an instant impact for his new team by scoring a stunning opening goal. Hearts went on to equalise and so the game finished 1\u20131. Van Hooijdonk settled quickly at Celtic and he became an instant favourite with the fans. When Van Hooijdonk arrived at Celtic they had not won any trophies in six years. With Van Hooijdonk in tow Celtic won the [[Scottish Cup]] of that season with him being the only goalscorer in the final against [[Airdrieonians F.C.

However, despite Van Hooijdonk's goals and the attractive football being played by manager [[Tommy Burns (footballer)|Tommy Burns]]' side, Celtic still finished the season without any silverware.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nVan Hooijdonk's next season at Celtic, [[1996\u201397 in Scottish football|1996\u201397]], was an unhappy time for both the player and the club. A row with the Celtic chairman/owner, [[Fergus McCann]], would rumble on and as a result he often ended up on the bench. The manager of the Dutch national team [[Guus Hiddink]] then told him he wouldn't be selected for such as long as he was not a regular at Celtic.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nHe eventually left Celtic over a wage dispute towards the end of the 1996\u201397 season, stating that the reputed \u00a37,000 a week rise he was being offered might be \"good enough for the homeless\" to live on \"but not for an international striker.\" In total Van Hooijdonk scored 52 goals for Celtic in 84 appearances.<ref name=greed>Gordon Thomson.

It was hoped the arrival of van Hooijdonk would kick-start their survival, but he scored just one goal in his eight games for them that season. Although only one of those games was lost, the other seven were drawn and Forest were relegated. He immediately pledged his future to helping the club regain their status.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe following season was an unqualified success, both for him and Forest. Forest won the title and promotion in a competitive league (facing stiff opposition from [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]), with van Hooijdonk scoring 34 goals and building up a good partnership with strike partner [[Kevin Campbell (footballer)|Kevin Campbell]], who scored 23 times. He was a regular in the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national squad]], and was named in the Dutch squad for [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] in France where he scored as a substitute in the match against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAfter the World Cup had finished he discovered that the promised strengthening to the Forest squad to enable them to cope back in the Premier League had not transpired, indeed that his strike partner Campbell (who had an ongoing back injury) had been sold to [[Trabzonspor]] for \u00a32.5m. The club had also announced that [[Scot Gemmill]] was dropped from the first team for refusing to sign a new contract, and that club captain and terrace hero [[Colin Cooper]] was being allowed to leave to the team promoted alongside them as runners up, [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. Van Hooijdonk asked for a transfer. The club's new owners refused. Van Hooijdonk announced that he had been told previously that he could leave the club at the end of the 1997\u201398 season if he so wished, that he felt betrayed by the club's owners who had failed to deliver on their promises to him regarding the strengthening of the team, and that he felt he could no longer play for his employers. Forest, desperate for a striker, refused to allow him to be transfer-listed again, so van Hooijdonk announced his intention to strike. He kept fit by training with his former club [[NAC Breda]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBecause of his behaviour Van Hooijdonk received criticism both from fans and from his teammates, not least from team-mate [[Steve Stone (footballer)|Steve Stone]] and manager [[Dave Bassett]]. The club refused to listen to offers for him, as they needed a top striker and the stand-off lasted until early November when van Hooijdonk, realising that he had no choice, agreed to return. By this time the club was again in relegation trouble: bottom of the league without a win in nine games. He played sporadically between then and the end of the season. He scored 6 goals in his 19 starts in the Premier League, including his first goal in his third game back against Forest's fierce rivals [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], helping them to a draw. Infamously after this goal most of his team-mates refused to celebrate alongside him, instead going to Scot Gemmill, the man who crossed the ball to him. He also scored a last minute home equaliser against rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] with a trademark free-kick that protected Forest's proud unbeaten home run against them that went back to 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/head2.sd?team2id=1563&team1id=1845|title=head to head|accessdate=6 July 2009|publisher=Racing Post}}</ref> Forest ended the 1998\u201399 Premier League season bottom and were relegated. In 2015, van Hooijdonk expressed regret at going on strike, saying that the situation \"could have been handled differently\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3153558/Raheem-Sterling-consider-consequences-Pierre-van-Hooijdonk-s-decision-not-play-Nottingham-Forest.html|title=Raheem Sterling should consider the consequences of Pierre van Hooijdonk's decision not to play for Nottingham Forest|date=8 July 2015|accessdate=12 December 2015|publisher=The Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\nWhickham FC, then of the Northern League Division Two, expressed interest in signing Pierre Van Hooijdonk on loan from Nottingham Forest in 1998. Dave Bassett, Forest manager, sent back a fax saying that the \"want away\" striker would \"prefer a move to Eastbourne Town where it would be a little warmer for him\"\n\n===Vitesse, Benfica and Feyenoord===\nAt the end of the 1998/99 season he returned to the Netherlands with [[Vitesse Arnhem]] in a \u00a33.5m move to continue his career after and did much to convince his critics of his goal-scoring abilities when he helped the [[Arnhem]] team to a [[UEFA Cup]] spot with 25 goals in one season. He also returned into the Dutch national team in this period.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nVan Hooijdonk then signed a three-year deal for [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in 2000 where he joined up with one of the former [[Celtic F.C.]] 'three amigos' [[Jorge Cadete]]. He eventually only played one season for them with 19 goals. At Benfica he faced the same structural problems as he faced at Nottingham Forest and the team used three different managers throughout the season. The new chairman at the club had no faith in Van Hooijdonk and he was set back into [[S.L. Benfica B|their second team]]. Benfica were planning on selling him to another foreign club, but all Van Hooijdonk wanted was to return to his home country. At the end of the 2000/01 season, he signed for his fourth Dutch club, [[Feyenoord]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhile at Feyenoord, he will always be remembered for his free kick abilities and his integral part in the [[UEFA Cup 2001\u201302]] win. He scored two goals against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the final at [[De Kuip]] and his performances helped Feyenoord beat [[SC Freiburg|Freiburg]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[PSV Eindhoven]] and [[Inter Milan]] in earlier rounds.<ref>{{cite news |title=Feyenoord seal Uefa Cup win |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1973191.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 May 2002 |accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=uefa02>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2001/matches/round=1557/match=69455/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Final joy for Feyenoord|publisher=UEFA|date=9 May 2002|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Fenerbah\u00e7e===\nNever one to settle down, van Hooijdonk joined [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football team)|Fenerbah\u00e7e SK]] at the beginning of the 2003\u201304 season where he featured in 52 games for the Turkish club and scored 32 goals (24 in his first season). He was nicknamed ''Aziz Pierre'' (means Saint Pierre in [[Turkish Language|Turkish]]) by fans. He wore the number 17, the same number that he wore for the [[Netherlands national football team|national team]]. He won the [[S\u00fcper Lig]] title in [[S\u00fcper Lig 2003\u201304|2003\u201304]] (first championship in his career) and again the following year in [[S\u00fcper Lig 2004\u201305|2004\u201305]] with Fenerbah\u00e7e.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===The final years===\n[[File:FvS Feyenoord Pierre van Hooijdonk 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Van Hooijdonk in 2012]]\n\nIn mid-2005, he signed again for his former club, NAC, playing 17 games, scoring 5 goals. During the winter [[transfer window]] of the 2005\u201306 season, he signed for another former club, Feyenoord, where he scored 8 goals in 37 appearances.

Noted for his [[Curl (association football)|bending]] [[Free kick (association football)|free kicks]], he is regarded by some as one of the greatest free kick specialists of all time.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rice |first=Simon |date=2009-09-11 |title=The Ten Best Free-Kick Specialists: Pierre Van Hooijdonk |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/the-ten-best-freekick-specialists-1785081.html?action=Popup&ino=3 |url-status=live |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914040106/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/the-ten-best-freekick-specialists-1785081.html?action=Popup&ino=3 |archive-date=2009-09-14 |access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/684464-world-football-ranking-the-top-10-long-free-kick-specialists-of-all-time#slide6 |title=World Football: Ranking the Top 10 Long Free Kick Specialists of All-Time |last=Woo |first=Jonathan |date=2011-05-03 |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] |access-date=2013-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.footballscotland.co.uk/spfl/scottish-premiership/art-free-kick-former-celtic-15690656 |title=The art of the free-kick, with former Celtic star Pierre van Hooijdonk |last=Kyle |first=Gregor |date=2019-01-17 |website=Football Scotland |publisher=[[Reach plc|Reach Scotland]] |location=Glasgow |access-date=2020-02-23 |quote=Van Hooijdonk stands alongside Sinisa Mihajlovic, Andrea Pirlo and Juninho Pernambucano as one of the all-time great free-kick takers,&nbsp;...}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nVan Hooijdonk was born in [[Steenbergen]]. His [[Morocco|Moroccan]] biological father left Van Hooijdonk's mother before his birth. He grew up in Welberg ([[:nl:Welberg|nl]]), a small village nearby Steenbergen. While playing in one of SC Welberg's youth squads Van Hooijdonk became desirous of a footballing career. His favourite team was [[NAC Breda]] whose game he followed wholeheartedly. At the age of 11 years old he took part in a talent pool on the team's open day and so impressed the NAC scouts. He thus joined NAC where he played mainly as a [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|right midfielder]]. When he was 14 he was cut from NAC's academy and he then went into amateur football.<ref name=\"V.V. Steenbergen\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vvsteenbergen.nl |title=V.V. \"Steenbergen\" |publisher=Vvsteenbergen.nl |date=6 July 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref> As so he then switched his position to be a striker only to rejoin NAC and thus ascend to the club's first team.<ref name=\"V.V. Steenbergen\"/>\n\n==Club career==\n===RBC Roosendaal===\nAs [[RBC Roosendaal]] were in financial trouble they were obliged to having youth players feature within their senior teams. As such in the 1988\u201389 season Van Hooijdonk made his debut for RBC as a substitute. Whilst playing as a sub for the club he soon scored three goals. With the club's main striker suffering from an injury Van Hooijdonk played almost the majority of the season's second half, scoring a total of six goals in 32 matches. He signed his first professional contract with RBC soon thereafter. Van Hooijdonk made a greater impression in the following season within which he became a key player for the team, scoring 27 times in 37 matches. Several teams went on to show interest in him such as NAC Breda. Van Hooijdonk thus didn't hesitate in signing a contract with NAC, and so rejoined his boyhood club.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===NAC===\nNAC paid 400,000 [[guilder]]s for the transfer of Van Hooijdonk. In returning to NAC, he was both positive in his outlook as well as determined to illustrate his quality. Van Hooijdonk succeeded at such as he went on to help the team win promotion to the [[Eredivisie]] in 1993. During his time at the club he got his first call up, in December 1994, to play for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]]. During the rest of that season he set a scoring streak in 11 consecutive Eredivisie matches. Within the 1994\u201395 winter break, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] made a deal with NAC which saw Van Hooijdonk join up with the Scottish outfit at once. Altogether he scored a total of 81 goals, being capped 115 times in all for NAC.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Celtic===\nVan Hooijdonk made his Celtic debut on 11 January 1995 in a league match against [[Hearts fc|Hearts]] at [[Hampden Park]]. The striker made an instant impact for his new team by scoring a stunning opening goal. Hearts went on to equalise and so the game finished 1\u20131. Van Hooijdonk settled quickly at Celtic and he became an instant favourite with the fans. When Van Hooijdonk arrived at Celtic they had not won any trophies in six years. With Van Hooijdonk in tow Celtic won the [[Scottish Cup]] of that season with him being the only goalscorer in the final against [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrie]] in May 1995.<ref name=sc95>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/celtics-compensation-1621393.html|title=Celtic's compensation|work= |publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=27 May 1995|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe following [[1995\u201396 in Scottish football|1995\u201396]] season, saw Van Hooijdonk in outstanding form for Celtic. He scored 32 goals, including 26 in the League which saw him finish as top scorer. Of particular note was his prowess at scoring from free kicks. However, despite Van Hooijdonk's goals and the attractive football being played by manager [[Tommy Burns (footballer)|Tommy Burns]]' side, Celtic still finished the season without any silverware.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nVan Hooijdonk's next season at Celtic, [[1996\u201397 in Scottish football|1996\u201397]], was an unhappy time for both the player and the club. A row with the Celtic chairman/owner, [[Fergus McCann]], would rumble on and as a result he often ended up on the bench. The manager of the Dutch national team [[Guus Hiddink]] then told him he wouldn't be selected for such as long as he was not a regular at Celtic.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nHe eventually left Celtic over a wage dispute towards the end of the 1996\u201397 season, stating that the reputed \u00a37,000 a week rise he was being offered might be \"good enough for the homeless\" to live on \"but not for an international striker.\" In total Van Hooijdonk scored 52 goals for Celtic in 84 appearances.<ref name=greed>Gordon Thomson.

He made his debut for Forest in a 1\u20131 draw against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]] on 11 March 1997. It was hoped the arrival of van Hooijdonk would kick-start their survival, but he scored just one goal in his eight games for them that season. Although only one of those games was lost, the other seven were drawn and Forest were relegated. He immediately pledged his future to helping the club regain their status.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe following season was an unqualified success, both for him and Forest. Forest won the title and promotion in a competitive league (facing stiff opposition from [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]), with van Hooijdonk scoring 34 goals and building up a good partnership with strike partner [[Kevin Campbell (footballer)|Kevin Campbell]], who scored 23 times. He was a regular in the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national squad]], and was named in the Dutch squad for [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] in France where he scored as a substitute in the match against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAfter the World Cup had finished he discovered that the promised strengthening to the Forest squad to enable them to cope back in the Premier League had not transpired, indeed that his strike partner Campbell (who had an ongoing back injury) had been sold to [[Trabzonspor]] for \u00a32.5m. The club had also announced that [[Scot Gemmill]] was dropped from the first team for refusing to sign a new contract, and that club captain and terrace hero [[Colin Cooper]] was being allowed to leave to the team promoted alongside them as runners up, [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. Van Hooijdonk asked for a transfer. The club's new owners refused. Van Hooijdonk announced that he had been told previously that he could leave the club at the end of the 1997\u201398 season if he so wished, that he felt betrayed by the club's owners who had failed to deliver on their promises to him regarding the strengthening of the team, and that he felt he could no longer play for his employers. Forest, desperate for a striker, refused to allow him to be transfer-listed again, so van Hooijdonk announced his intention to strike. He kept fit by training with his former club [[NAC Breda]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBecause of his behaviour Van Hooijdonk received criticism both from fans and from his teammates, not least from team-mate [[Steve Stone (footballer)|Steve Stone]] and manager [[Dave Bassett]]. The club refused to listen to offers for him, as they needed a top striker and the stand-off lasted until early November when van Hooijdonk, realising that he had no choice, agreed to return. By this time the club was again in relegation trouble: bottom of the league without a win in nine games. He played sporadically between then and the end of the season. He scored 6 goals in his 19 starts in the Premier League, including his first goal in his third game back against Forest's fierce rivals [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], helping them to a draw. Infamously after this goal most of his team-mates refused to celebrate alongside him, instead going to Scot Gemmill, the man who crossed the ball to him. He also scored a last minute home equaliser against rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] with a trademark free-kick that protected Forest's proud unbeaten home run against them that went back to 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/head2.sd?team2id=1563&team1id=1845|title=head to head|accessdate=6 July 2009|publisher=Racing Post}}</ref> Forest ended the 1998\u201399 Premier League season bottom and were relegated. In 2015, van Hooijdonk expressed regret at going on strike, saying that the situation \"could have been handled differently\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3153558/Raheem-Sterling-consider-consequences-Pierre-van-Hooijdonk-s-decision-not-play-Nottingham-Forest.html|title=Raheem Sterling should consider the consequences of Pierre van Hooijdonk's decision not to play for Nottingham Forest|date=8 July 2015|accessdate=12 December 2015|publisher=The Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\n===Vitesse, Benfica and Feyenoord===\nAt the end of the 1998/99 season he returned to the Netherlands with [[Vitesse Arnhem]] in a \u00a33.5m move to continue his career after and did much to convince his critics of his goal-scoring abilities when he helped the [[Arnhem]] team to a [[UEFA Cup]] spot with 25 goals in one season. He also returned into the Dutch national team in this period.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nVan Hooijdonk then signed a three-year deal for [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in 2000 where he joined up with one of the former [[Celtic F.C.]] 'three amigos' [[Jorge Cadete]]. He eventually only played one season for them with 19 goals. At Benfica he faced the same structural problems as he faced at Nottingham Forest and the team used three different managers throughout the season. The new chairman at the club had no faith in Van Hooijdonk and he was set back into [[S.L. Benfica B|their second team]]. Benfica were planning on selling him to another foreign club, but all Van Hooijdonk wanted was to return to his home country. At the end of the 2000/01 season, he signed for his fourth Dutch club, [[Feyenoord]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhile at Feyenoord, he will always be remembered for his free kick abilities and his integral part in the [[UEFA Cup 2001\u201302]] win. He scored two goals against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the final at [[De Kuip]] and his performances helped Feyenoord beat [[SC Freiburg|Freiburg]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[PSV Eindhoven]] and [[Inter Milan]] in earlier rounds.<ref>{{cite news |title=Feyenoord seal Uefa Cup win |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1973191.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 May 2002 |accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=uefa02>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2001/matches/round=1557/match=69455/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Final joy for Feyenoord|publisher=UEFA|date=9 May 2002|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Fenerbah\u00e7e===\nNever one to settle down, van Hooijdonk joined [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football team)|Fenerbah\u00e7e SK]] at the beginning of the 2003\u201304 season where he featured in 52 games for the Turkish club and scored 32 goals (24 in his first season). He was nicknamed ''Aziz Pierre'' (means Saint Pierre in [[Turkish Language|Turkish]]) by fans. He wore the number 17, the same number that he wore for the [[Netherlands national football team|national team]]. He won the [[S\u00fcper Lig]] title in [[S\u00fcper Lig 2003\u201304|2003\u201304]] (first championship in his career) and again the following year in [[S\u00fcper Lig 2004\u201305|2004\u201305]] with Fenerbah\u00e7e.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===The final years===\n[[File:FvS Feyenoord Pierre van Hooijdonk 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Van Hooijdonk in 2012]]\n\nIn mid-2005, he signed again for his former club, NAC, playing 17 games, scoring 5 goals. During the winter [[transfer window]] of the 2005\u201306 season, he signed for another former club, Feyenoord, where he scored 8 goals in 37 appearances. On 17 October 2006, Van Hooijdonk announced his retirement at the end of the 2006\u201307 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=468122.html |title=Van Hooijdonk sets retirement date |publisher=UEFA.com|date=17 October 2006|accessdate=1 June 2009 }}</ref> On 13 May 2007, he eventually played his final professional match after a draw with Feyenoord against [[FC Groningen]] in the play-offs,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dvhn.nl/nieuws/sport/voetbal/article1875242.ece?secId=29 |title=FC Groningen schiet Feyenoord verdiend uit de play offs |publisher=Dagblad Noorden|date=13 May 2007|accessdate=1 June 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> having played 550 games (335 goals) in the highest leagues in 18 seasons of professional football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballdatabase.com/index.php?page=player&Id=658&b=true&pn=VAN_HOOIJDONK_Pierre_van_Hooijdonk |title=Footballdatabase profile |publisher=Footballdatabase|accessdate=19 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nVan Hooijdonk is the father of [[Sydney van Hooijdonk]], who is also a professional footballer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bndestem.nl/nac/voetbal-was-nooit-ver-weg-in-huize-van-hooijdonk~a62557f8/|title=Cookies op bndestem.nl - bndestem.nl|website=www.bndestem.nl}}</ref>\n\nIt was reported in May 2008 that van Hooijdonk had been a victim of fraud and had lost \u00a32,000,000 to a scam, which involved him investing in a Chinese textile company which did not exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2008/05/pierre_van_hooijdonk_conned_ou.php |title=Pierre van Hooijdonk conned out of \u20ac2.5m |publisher=DutchNews.nl |date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n:Sources:<ref>{{NFT|4634|access-date=31 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.foradejogo.net/player.php?player=196911290001&language=2 |title=Van Hooijdonk |website=ForaDeJogo |access-date=31 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|League\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"2\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|National Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Europe\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[RBC (football club)|RBC]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Eerste Divisie]]\n|[[Eerste divisie 1989\u201390|1989\u201390]]\n|32||6|| || ||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||32||6\n|-\n|[[Eerste divisie 1990\u201391|1990\u201391]]\n|37||27|| || ||0||0||0||0||37||27\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!69!!33!! !! !!0!!0!!0!!0!!69!!33\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[NAC Breda|NAC]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Eerste Divisie]]\n|[[1991\u201392 Eerste divisie|1991\u201392]]\n|35||20|| || ||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||35||20\n|-\n|[[1992\u201393 Eerste divisie|1992\u201393]]\n|33||26|| || ||0||0||0||0||33||26\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Eredivisie]]\n|[[1993\u201394 Eredivisie|1993\u201394]]\n|31||25|| || ||0||0||0||0||31||25\n|-\n|[[1994\u201395 Eredivisie|1994\u201395]]\n|16||10|| || ||0||0||0||0||16||10\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!115!!81!! !! !!0!!0!!0!!0!!115!!81\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]]\n|[[Scottish Premier Division 1994\u201395|1994\u201395]]\n|14||4||5||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||19||8\n|-\n|[[Scottish Premier Division 1995\u201396|1995\u201396]]\n|34||26||4||4||3||2||3||0||44||32\n|-\n|[[Scottish Premier Division 1996\u201397|1996\u201397]]\n|21||14||2||1||2||1||4||0||29||16\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!69!!44!!11!!9!!5!!3!!7!!0!!92!!56\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]\n||[[Premier League]]\n|[[FA Premier League 1996\u201397|1996\u201397]]\n|8||1||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||8||1\n|-\n|[[Football League First Division|First Division]]\n|[[The Football League 1997\u201398|1997\u201398]]\n|42||29||1||1||4||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||47||34\n|-\n|Premier League\n|[[FA Premier League 1998\u201399|1998\u201399]]\n|21||6||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||22||6\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!71!!36!!1!!1!!5!!4!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!77!!41\n|-\n|[[Vitesse Arnhem|Vitesse]]\n|[[Eredivisie]]\n|[[1999\u20132000 in Dutch football|1999\u20132000]]\n|29||25||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||4||2||36||28\n|-\n|[[S.L.

Though he had drawn comics as a child, he never had an interest in becoming a cartoonist himself. Manley's debut novel, ''The Death of Donna-May Dean'', was published by [[St. Martin's Griffin]] in 1992. It tells the story about a young [[gay man]] coming of age in Alabama, and was quickly considered a cult classic of LGBT fiction. 27-year old at the time, the pressure to follow his early success up with a second novel overwhelmed Manley. Instead, he began working in the then-new field of [[web design]]. In 2000, Manley moved to [[San Francisco]], where he worked for Streaming Media and served as the first [[webmaster]] for [[Free Speech TV]]. The website he oversaw, freespeech.org, went on to win both a [[Webby Award]] and [[RealNetworks]]' Streamers Award.<ref name=TCJ>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/joey-manley-1965-2013/|work=[[The Comics Journal]]|title=Joey Manley, 1965-2013|last=Garrity|first=Shaenon|authorlink=Shaenon Garrity|date=2013-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214020807/http://www.tcj.com/joey-manley-1965-2013/|archive-date=2017-12-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Work in webcomics==\nTo learn more about webcomics and introduce himself to the American webcomic community, Manley began the [[podcast]] ''Digital Comics Talk'' and the review website ''Talk About Comics'' in 2001. Through his podcast, Manley came into contact with various major webcartoonists of the time. Manley soon began recruiting artists for a for-profit, subscription-based webcomics collective, which he launched in March 2002 as [[Modern Tales]].<ref name=TCJ /> At the time, Manley hoped the subscription model would increase the visibility of everyone involved in the project, even if each webcomic would have only drawn a niche interest individually. Though Modern Tales never managed to bring a living wage for the artists involved, it did do solid business and got attention from older comic book artists such as [[Harvey Pekar]] and [[Will Eisner]].<ref name=TCJ /> By 2005, Modern Tales had approximately 2,000 members, each paying $3 [[USD]] per month. Manley had moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]] at this point in order to cut costs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Comics Looking to Spread A Little Laughter on the Web|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date= 2005-06-16|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/15/AR2005061502251_pf.html | first=Leslie | last=Walker|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214073122/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/15/AR2005061502251_pf.html|archive-date=2017-12-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nManley started multiple subscription-based webcomic anthology sites in the early-2000s, such as [[Serializer]] (featuring high art avante garde webcomics, edited by [[Tom Hart (cartoonist)|Tom Hart]]), [[Girlamatic]] (featuring female-focused webcomics, edited by [[Lea Hernandez]]), and Graphic Smash (featuring action webcomics). Manley also published single-webcomic subscription sites like Hernandez' ''Rumble Girls'' and [[James Kochalka]]'s ''American Elf''.  In 2003, Manley also began co-hosting a podcast with Lea Hernandez titled ''The Diva Lea Show''. Manley started [[Webcomics Nation]] in 2005, a webcomic hosting service.<ref name=CBR /> Manley's webcomic sites were together referred to as the \"Modern Tales family\" of websites, and they had featured artists such as [[Gene Luen Yang]], [[Howard Cruse]], [[Chris Onstad]], [[Shaenon Garrity]], and [[Dylan Meconis]].<ref name=CBR>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/modern-tales-founder-joey-manley-passes-away/|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|title=Modern Tales founder Joey Manley passes away|last=Melrose|first=Kevin|date=2013-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926130719/https://www.cbr.com/modern-tales-founder-joey-manley-passes-away/|archive-date=2018-09-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn collaboration with OnlineComics.net-creator Josh Roberts, Manley started developing a comics-oriented [[social media]] and publishing platform titled [[ComicSpace]] in 2007.

Manley stated that he went with subscription models for his early projects because [[online advertising]] rates were low and [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] was very expensive at the time. Manley felt the need to defend his business model a lot because the subscription model was unpopular among some ideological groups, and he quickly became known as \"the subscriptions guy\" in his community. However, as advertising revenue increased, Manley began adopting that model more in his services. Manley noted that he would have wanted to get into the print market as well, but was not able to afford it.<ref name=Interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/the-joey-manley-interview-by-dirk-deppey/|work=[[The Comics Journal]]|title=The Joey Manley Interview|last=Deppey|first=Dirk|date=July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929000326/http://www.tcj.com/the-joey-manley-interview-by-dirk-deppey/|archive-date=2018-09-29|url-status=live}}</ref> One year earlier, Manley said: \"You'll lose a lot less money publishing on the Web than publishing a printed comic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20051219/35322-web-comics-page-clickers-to-page-turners.html|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|title=Web Comics: Page Clickers to Page Turners|last=MacDonald|first=Heidi|author-link=Heidi MacDonald|date=2005-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106142058/https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20051219/35322-web-comics-page-clickers-to-page-turners.html|archive-date=2018-11-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the same interview, Manley spoke about the nature and future of webcomics as a medium. Stating that while people understand that the experience of reading a comic versus reading a webcomic is \"sort of analogous,\" Manley said that people \"come to [the two mediums] with different expectations.\" Elaborating, Manley said that \"sequential art on the screen kind of serves a different function; maybe right now it's a little more disposable, in the way that television for many years was more disposable [than film]. ... Webcomics aren't a replacement for what already exists, in the same way that television didn't destroy movies.\"<ref name=Interview />\n\n== Death ==\nOn November 7, 2013, Manley died of complications from [[pneumonia]] in a hospital in Louisville.

Though Modern Tales never managed to bring a living wage for the artists involved, it did do solid business and got attention from older comic book artists such as [[Harvey Pekar]] and [[Will Eisner]].<ref name=TCJ /> By 2005, Modern Tales had approximately 2,000 members, each paying $3 [[USD]] per month. Manley had moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]] at this point in order to cut costs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Comics Looking to Spread A Little Laughter on the Web|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date= 2005-06-16|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/15/AR2005061502251_pf.html | first=Leslie | last=Walker|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214073122/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/15/AR2005061502251_pf.html|archive-date=2017-12-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nManley started multiple subscription-based webcomic anthology sites in the early-2000s, such as [[Serializer]] (featuring high art avante garde webcomics, edited by [[Tom Hart (cartoonist)|Tom Hart]]), [[Girlamatic]] (featuring female-focused webcomics, edited by [[Lea Hernandez]]), and Graphic Smash (featuring action webcomics). Manley also published single-webcomic subscription sites like Hernandez' ''Rumble Girls'' and [[James Kochalka]]'s ''American Elf''.  In 2003, Manley also began co-hosting a podcast with Lea Hernandez titled ''The Diva Lea Show''. Manley started [[Webcomics Nation]] in 2005, a webcomic hosting service.<ref name=CBR /> Manley's webcomic sites were together referred to as the \"Modern Tales family\" of websites, and they had featured artists such as [[Gene Luen Yang]], [[Howard Cruse]], [[Chris Onstad]], [[Shaenon Garrity]], and [[Dylan Meconis]].<ref name=CBR>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/modern-tales-founder-joey-manley-passes-away/|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|title=Modern Tales founder Joey Manley passes away|last=Melrose|first=Kevin|date=2013-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926130719/https://www.cbr.com/modern-tales-founder-joey-manley-passes-away/|archive-date=2018-09-26|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nIn collaboration with OnlineComics.net-creator Josh Roberts, Manley started developing a comics-oriented [[social media]] and publishing platform titled [[ComicSpace]] in 2007. ComicSpace received funding from Michael Angst and Alan Gershenfeld, who set up a new early-stage venture capital firm named E-Line Media.

Manley stated that he went with subscription models for his early projects because [[online advertising]] rates were low and [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] was very expensive at the time. Manley felt the need to defend his business model a lot because the subscription model was unpopular among some ideological groups, and he quickly became known as \"the subscriptions guy\" in his community. However, as advertising revenue increased, Manley began adopting that model more in his services. Manley noted that he would have wanted to get into the print market as well, but was not able to afford it.<ref name=Interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/the-joey-manley-interview-by-dirk-deppey/|work=[[The Comics Journal]]|title=The Joey Manley Interview|last=Deppey|first=Dirk|date=July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929000326/http://www.tcj.com/the-joey-manley-interview-by-dirk-deppey/|archive-date=2018-09-29|url-status=live}}</ref> One year earlier, Manley said: \"You'll lose a lot less money publishing on the Web than publishing a printed comic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20051219/35322-web-comics-page-clickers-to-page-turners.html|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|title=Web Comics: Page Clickers to Page Turners|last=MacDonald|first=Heidi|author-link=Heidi MacDonald|date=2005-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106142058/https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20051219/35322-web-comics-page-clickers-to-page-turners.html|archive-date=2018-11-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the same interview, Manley spoke about the nature and future of webcomics as a medium. Stating that while people understand that the experience of reading a comic versus reading a webcomic is \"sort of analogous,\" Manley said that people \"come to [the two mediums] with different expectations.\" Elaborating, Manley said that \"sequential art on the screen kind of serves a different function; maybe right now it's a little more disposable, in the way that television for many years was more disposable [than film]. ... Webcomics aren't a replacement for what already exists, in the same way that television didn't destroy movies.\"<ref name=Interview />\n\n== Death ==\nOn November 7, 2013, Manley died of complications from [[pneumonia]] in a hospital in Louisville.
