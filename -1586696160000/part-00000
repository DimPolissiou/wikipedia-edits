Another way to think of it, is that since populations age structures are often very different, but the likelihood of dying by suicide is generally increased with age, in order to avoid masking the sensible differences given by each country's age distributions, countries' rates are reciprocally [[weighted]] into the overall trend to globally frame national suicide rates, and the [[epidemiological]] prevalence of suicide. Age-standardization works over time as a measure of the prevalence of suicide across diversely populated countries, by rounding down when populations are composed of a higher percentage of older people compared to the \"standard\" population, and vice versa.|group=note|name=nam}}</small>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ '''Suicide rates by [[WHO]] region in 2016 (per 100 000 people per year)'''<ref name=\"CrudeRates\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.MHSUICIDEASDRREGv?lang=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117104117/http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.MHSUICIDEASDRREGv?lang=en |archive-date=17 January 2018 |title=Suicide rates, age standardized - Data by WHO Region |publisher=[[WHO]] (archived on 17 January 2018) |year=2015 |accessdate=13 April 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n!

[[Age standardization|Age-standardized]] rates account for the influence that different population age distributions might have on the analysis of crude death rates, statistically addressing the prevailing trends by age-groups and populations' structures, to enhance long term cross-national comparability: based on age-groups' deviation from standardized population structures, rates are rounded up or down (age-adjustment). Basically, the presence of younger individuals in any given age structure carries more weight: if the rate is rounded up that means the [[median age]] is lower than average for that region (or country), and vice versa when rounded down.\n\nMost countries listed below report a higher male suicide rate, as worldwide there are about 3 male suicides out of 4, or a factor of 3:1 (for example,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/|title=Suicide Statistics \u2014 AFSP|website=American Foundation for Suicide Prevention}}</ref> in the United States was 3.36 in 2015, and 3.53 in 2016).{{efn|The male-female ratio shown below is based on the age-standardized rates: as compared to WHO world standard population, women's median age and life expectancy might be greater than that of men's for that country when rounded up, and vice versa when rounded down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.MHSUICIDEv?lang=en|title=Suicide rates, crude - Data by country|last=|first=|year=2016|website=|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nThough age-standardization is common statistical process to categorize mortality data for comparing purposes, this approach often results in rates differing from the official national statistics prepared and endorsed by individual countries (and revisions are also performed periodically). Age-adjusted rates are mortality rates that would have existed if all populations under study had the same age distribution as a \"standard\" population.

Another way to think of it, is that since populations age structures are often very different, but the likelihood of dying by suicide is generally increased with age, in order to avoid masking the sensible differences given by each country's age distributions, countries' rates are reciprocally [[weighted]] into the overall trend to globally frame national suicide rates, and the [[epidemiological]] prevalence of suicide.

[[Age standardization|Age-standardized]] rates account for the influence that different population age distributions might have on the analysis of crude death rates, statistically addressing the prevailing trends by age-groups and populations' structures, to enhance long term cross-national comparability: based on age-groups' deviation from standardized population structures, rates are rounded up or down (age-adjustment). Basically, the presence of younger individuals in any given age structure carries more weight: if the rate is rounded up that means the [[median age]] is lower than average for that region (or country), and vice versa when rounded down.\n\nMost countries listed below report a higher male suicide rate, as worldwide there are about 3 male suicides out of 4, or a factor of 3:1 (for example,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/|title=Suicide Statistics \u2014 AFSP|website=American Foundation for Suicide Prevention}}</ref> in the United States was 3.36 in 2015, and 3.53 in 2016).{{efn|The male-female ratio shown below is based on the age-standardized rates: as compared to WHO world standard population, women's median age and life expectancy might be greater than that of men's for that country when rounded up, and vice versa when rounded down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.MHSUICIDEv?lang=en|title=Suicide rates, crude - Data by country|last=|first=|year=2016|website=|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nThough age-standardization is common statistical process to categorize mortality data for comparing purposes, this approach often results in rates differing from the official national statistics prepared and endorsed by individual countries (and revisions are also performed periodically). Age-adjusted rates are mortality rates that would have existed if all populations under study had the same age distribution as a \"standard\" population.

Inspired by and in contact with some of the most renowned artists of the 20th century, e.g., Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Lam melded his influences and created a unique style, which was ultimately characterized by the prominence of hybrid figures. This distinguished visual style of his also influences a lot of artists. Though he was predominantly a painter, he also worked with sculpture, ceramics and printmaking in his later life.\n\n==Early life==\nWifredo Lam was born and raised in [[Sagua La Grande]], a village in the sugar farming province of [[Villa Clara Province|Villa Clara]], [[Cuba]]. He was of [[multiracial|mixed race]] ancestry: his mother, the former Ana Serafina Castilla, was born to a [[Kongo people|Congolese]] former slave mother and a Cuban [[mulatto]] father and his father, Yam Lam, was a [[Chinese Cubans|Chinese]] immigrant.<ref name=\"Balderrama\">Balderrama, Maria R., ed. ''Wifredo Lam and His Contemporaries 1938\u20131952''. New York: The [[Studio Museum in Harlem]], 1992.</ref> In Sagua La Grande, Lam was surrounded by many people of African descent; his family, like many others, practiced Catholicism alongside their African traditions. Through his godmother, Matonica Wilson, a [[Santer\u00eda]] priestess locally celebrated as a [[Healer (alternative medicine)|healer]] and [[witchcraft|sorceress]], he was exposed to rites of the African [[orisha]]s.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> His contact with African celebrations and spiritual practices proved to be his largest artistic influence.\n\nIn 1916 Lam moved to [[Havana]] to study law, a path that his family had thrust upon him. Simultaneously he also began studying tropical plants at the Botanical Gardens.<ref name=\"Alley\">Alley, Rin. \"Lam, Wifredo.\" Grove Art Online. 27 September 1999. Oxford University Press. <http://www.groveart.com>.</ref> From 1918 to 1923, Lam studied painting at the Escuela de Bellas Artes. However, Lam disliked both academic teaching and painting.  He left for [[Madrid]] in the autumn of 1923 to further his art studies.\n\n==Career in Europe==\nIn 1923 Lam began studying in Madrid under [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza]], the curator of the [[Museo del Prado]] and teacher of [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. In the mornings he would attend his conservative teacher's studio, while he spent his evenings working alongside young, nonconformist painters. At the Prado, Lam discovered and was awed by the work of [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel I]]. While his early paintings were in the [[modernist]] Spanish tradition, his work soon became more simplified and decorative.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> Though Lam's dislike for academic conservatism persisted, his time in Spain marked his technical development in which he began to merge a primitive aesthetic and the traditions of Western composition. In 1929 he married Eva Piriz, but both she and their young son died in 1931 of [[tuberculosis]]; it is likely that this personal tragedy contributed to the dark nature of his work.<ref name=\"Guggenheim\">\"Wifredo Lam.\" Guggenheim Collection.

The influence of [[Surrealism]] was discernible in his work, as well as that of [[Henri Matisse]].<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> Throughout Lam's travels through the Spanish countryside, he developed empathy for the Spanish peasants, whose troubles in some ways mirrored those of the former slaves he grew up around in Cuba.<ref name=\"Richards\">Richards, Paulette. \"Wifredo Lam: a Sketch.\" ''Callaloo'' 34 (1988):  90\u201392. JSTOR.</ref> At the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he sided with the Republicans and used his talent to fashion Republican posters and propaganda. Drafted to defend Madrid, Lam was incapacitated during the fighting in late 1937 and was sent to [[Barcelona]]. There he met Helena Holzer, a German researcher, and the Catalan artist known as [[Manolo (sculptor)|Manolo Hugu\u00e9]]. Manolo gave Lam the letter of introduction that sparked his friendship with [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], whose artwork had impressed and inspired Lam a year before when he saw an exhibition in Madrid.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/>\n\nIn 1938 Lam moved to Paris. He quickly gained the support of Picasso, who introduced him to many of the leading artists of the time, such as [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. Picasso also introduced him to Pierre Loeb, a Parisian art dealer; Loeb gave Lam his first exhibition at the Galerie Pierre Loeb in 1939, which received an enthusiastic response from critics.<ref name=\"Sims\">Sims, Lowery S. ''Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923\u20131982''. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 2002.</ref> Picasso and Lam also exhibited their work together at the Perls Galleries in New York in the same year. Lam's work went from showing the influence of Matisse, seen in his [[still life]]s, landscapes and simplified portraits, to being influenced by [[Cubism]].<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> Mainly working with [[gouache]], Lam began producing stylized figures that appear to be influenced by Picasso. Much of his work in 1938 possessed emotional intensity; the subject matter ranged from interacting couples to women in despair and showed a considerably stronger African influence, seen in the figures\u2019 angular outlines and the synthesis of their bodies.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/>\n\nWhile Lam began simplifying his forms before he came into contact with Picasso's work, it is apparent that Picasso had a significant impact on him. With regard to Picasso's exhibition, Lam said that it was \"not only a revelation, but\u2026 a shock.\"<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> Lam gained the approval of Picasso, whose encouragement has been said to have led Lam to search for his own interpretation of modernism.<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the invasion of Paris by the Germans, Lam left for [[Marseille]] in 1940. There he rejoined many intellectuals, including the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]]s, with whom he had been associated since he met [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] in 1939. While in Marseille, Lam and Breton collaborated on the publication of Breton's poem ''Fata Morgana'', which was illustrated by Lam. Though the drawings he created in Marseille between 1940 and 1941 are known as the ''Fata Morgana'' suite, only about three inspired the illustrations for the poem.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> In 1941 Breton, Lam and [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], accompanied by many others, left for [[Martinique]] only to be imprisoned. After forty days, Lam was released and allowed to leave for Cuba, which he reached in midsummer 1941.\n\n==Havana years==\nUpon Lam's return to [[Havana]], he developed a new awareness of Afro-Cuban traditions. He noticed that the descendants of the slaves were still being oppressed and that the Afro-Cuban culture was degraded and made picturesque for the sake of tourism. He believed that Cuba was in danger of losing its African heritage and therefore sought to free them from cultural subjugation. In an interview with Max-Pol Fouchet, he said,\n<blockquote>\"I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country, but by thoroughly expressing the negro spirit, the beauty of the plastic art of the blacks. In this way I could act as a [[Trojan horse]] that would spew forth hallucinating figures with the power to surprise, to disturb the dreams of the exploiters.\"<ref name=\"Richards\"/></blockquote>\nAdditionally, his time in Cuba marked a rapid evolution of his style. Drawing from his study of tropical plants and familiarity with Afro-Cuban culture, his paintings became characterized by the presence of a hybrid figure\u2014part human, part animal, and part vegetal.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> His style was also distinctive because of its fusion of Surrealist and Cubist approaches with imagery and symbols from Santer\u00eda.<ref name=\"Nessen\">Nessen, Susan. \"Review: Multiculturalism in the Americas.\" ''Art Journal'' 52 (1993):  86\u201391. JSTOR.</ref> In 1943 he began his best-known work, ''The Jungle''. It reflected his mature style, depicting four figures with mask-like heads, half-emerging from dense tropical vegetation. Later that year it was shown in an exhibition at the [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery in New York, where it created controversy. The painting depicted the tension between [[Modernism]] and the vibrancy and energy of [[African culture]].<ref name=\"Richards\"/> ''The Jungle'' was ultimately purchased by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. It is often compared to Picasso's ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', which is hung in the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid.\n\n[[File:Carbonell_and_Wifrido_Lam_durning_an_interview_at_Union_Radio_television_station,_Havana_Cuba,_1952.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Wifredo Lam with fellow artist [[Manuel Carbonell]] (1952)]]\nLam continued to simplify and synthesize abstraction yet continued painting figurally; he also kept on developing the [[mythology]] and [[totemism]] that defined his style.<ref name=\"Sims\"/> In 1944 he married Helana Holzer, whom he divorced in 1950. In 1946 he and Breton spent four months in [[Haiti]]. There Lam enriched his already extensive understanding and knowledge of African divinity and magic rituals through observing [[Voodoun]] ceremonies, although he later said that his contact with the African spirituality that he found throughout the Americas did not directly impact his formal style. African poetry, on the other hand, was said to have had a broadening effect on his paintings.<ref name=\"Richards\"/> In 1950 he worked with [[Ren\u00e9 Portocarrero]] and others; in the village of Santiago de Las Vegas, the group of painters worked on ceramic.<ref>''Victor Moreno \u2013 ein kubanischer Maler'', Felix Busse, Vielflieger Verlag</ref> Lam settled in Paris in 1952 after having divided his time between Cuba, New York and France.\n\n[[File:Sal\u00f3n de Mayo, 1967. Wilfredo Lam. Radiocentro CMQ Sidewalk. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|Sal\u00f3n de Mayo, 1967. Sidewalk insert in front of the [[Radiocentro CMQ Building]] by Wilfredo Lam.]]\nLam, who continued to sympathize with the common man, exhibited a series of paintings at [[Havana University]] in 1955 to demonstrate his support for the students\u2019 protests against Batista's dictatorship. Similarly, in 1965, six years after the revolution, he showed his loyalty to Castro and his goals of social and economic equality by painting ''El Tercer Mundo'' (The Third World) for the presidential palace. In 1960 Lam established a studio in [[Albissola Marina]] on Italy's northwest coast and settled there with his wife Lou Laurin, a Swedish painter, and their three sons. In 1964, he was awarded the Guggenheim International Award and between 1966 and 1967 there were many retrospectives of his work throughout Europe. At the encouragement of [[Asger Jorn]] and after being intrigued by the local pottery-making, Lam began to experiment with ceramics and had his first ceramic exhibition in 1975.  He progressed to model sculptures and cast in metal in his twilight years, often depicting personages similar to those he had painted.\n\nWifredo Lam died on September 11, 1982 in Paris. Having had over one hundred personal exhibitions around the world, Lam had a well established reputation by the time of his death.\n\n==Legacy==\nLam, like many of the most renowned artists of the 20th century, combined radical modern styles with the \"primitive\" arts of the Americas.<ref name=\"Nessen\"/> While [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda]] drew inspiration from [[Pre-Columbian art]], Wifredo Lam was influenced by the Afro-Cubans of that time. Lam dramatically synthesized the Surrealist and Cubist strategies while incorporating the iconography and spirit of Afro-Cuban religion. For that reason, his work does not belong to any particular art movement.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/>\n\nHe held the belief that society focused too much on the individual and sought to show humanity as a whole in his artwork.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> He painted generic figures, creating the universal. To further his goal, he often painted [[African tribal masks|mask]]-like faces. While Cuban culture and mythology permeated his work, it dealt with the nature of man and therefore was wholly relatable to non-Cubans.\n\nOpened in 1983, the '''Wifredo Lam Center for Contemporary Art''' (in Spanish: Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo Wifredo Lam) is a state-run gallery in tribute to Lam and located in Havana, Cuba.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lahabana.com/guide/centro-de-arte-contemporaneo-wifredo-lam/|title=Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo Wifredo Lam|date=2013-12-11|website=Havana City Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> This art gallery is responsible for the organization of the Bienal de la Habana, Cuba, a permanent art collection of approx. 1000 works, and research and study of contemporary visual arts in developing countries.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.afar.com/places/centro-de-arte-contemporaneo-wifredo-lam-la-habana|title=Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo Wifredo Lam|last=|first=|date=2017-03-22|website=www.afar.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 a retrospective exhibition of his works opened at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris; this exhibition is to travel to the Reina Sofia Museum in Spain and the Tate Museum in London afterwards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cubacounterpoints.com/archives/4636|title=THE EY EXHIBITION: WIFREDO LAM|last=Ramos|first=Afonso Dias|date=2016-12-01|website=Cuba Counterpoints|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==''The Jungle''==\n[[Image:'The Jungle', gouache on paper painting by Wifredo Lam, 1943, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|right|Wifredo Lam, ''The Jungle'', [[gouache]] on paper, 1943, [[Museum of Modern Art]]]]\n\n''The Jungle'', which is considered Lam's masterpiece, is exemplary of the artist's mature style. The polymorphism, for which Lam is well known, juxtaposes aspects of humans, animals, and plants, creating monstrous, hybrid creatures. The dense composition creates a claustrophobic feeling while the forms remain difficult to differentiate. The figures\u2019 elongated limbs lack definition, while much emphasis is placed on their large feet, round buttocks, and African-inspired masked heads. Additionally, the iridescent quality of the forms enhances the painting's tropical feeling.\n\n''The Jungle'' was not, however, intended to describe the primitivism of Cuba. Rather, Lam's intention was to depict a spiritual state\u2014that which is surely inspired by Santer\u00eda;<ref name=\"Lucie-Smith\">Lucie-Smith, Edward.

New York: The [[Studio Museum in Harlem]], 1992.</ref> In Sagua La Grande, Lam was surrounded by many people of African descent; his family, like many others, practiced Catholicism alongside their African traditions. Through his godmother, Matonica Wilson, a [[Santer\u00eda]] priestess locally celebrated as a [[Healer (alternative medicine)|healer]] and [[witchcraft|sorceress]], he was exposed to rites of the African [[orisha]]s.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> His contact with African celebrations and spiritual practices proved to be his largest artistic influence.\n\nIn 1916 Lam moved to [[Havana]] to study law, a path that his family had thrust upon him. Simultaneously he also began studying tropical plants at the Botanical Gardens.<ref name=\"Alley\">Alley, Rin. \"Lam, Wifredo.\" Grove Art Online. 27 September 1999. Oxford University Press. <http://www.groveart.com>.</ref> From 1918 to 1923, Lam studied painting at the Escuela de Bellas Artes. However, Lam disliked both academic teaching and painting.  He left for [[Madrid]] in the autumn of 1923 to further his art studies.\n\n==Career in Europe==\nIn 1923 Lam began studying in Madrid under [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza]], the curator of the [[Museo del Prado]] and teacher of [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]. In the mornings he would attend his conservative teacher's studio, while he spent his evenings working alongside young, nonconformist painters. At the Prado, Lam discovered and was awed by the work of [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel I]]. While his early paintings were in the [[modernist]] Spanish tradition, his work soon became more simplified and decorative.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> Though Lam's dislike for academic conservatism persisted, his time in Spain marked his technical development in which he began to merge a primitive aesthetic and the traditions of Western composition. In 1929 he married Eva Piriz, but both she and their young son died in 1931 of [[tuberculosis]]; it is likely that this personal tragedy contributed to the dark nature of his work.<ref name=\"Guggenheim\">\"Wifredo Lam.\" Guggenheim Collection.

The influence of [[Surrealism]] was discernible in his work, as well as that of [[Henri Matisse]].<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> Throughout Lam's travels through the Spanish countryside, he developed empathy for the Spanish peasants, whose troubles in some ways mirrored those of the former slaves he grew up around in Cuba.<ref name=\"Richards\">Richards, Paulette. \"Wifredo Lam: a Sketch.\" ''Callaloo'' 34 (1988):  90\u201392. JSTOR.</ref> At the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he sided with the Republicans and used his talent to fashion Republican posters and propaganda. Drafted to defend Madrid, Lam was incapacitated during the fighting in late 1937 and was sent to [[Barcelona]]. There he met Helena Holzer, a German researcher, and the Catalan artist known as [[Manolo (sculptor)|Manolo Hugu\u00e9]]. Manolo gave Lam the letter of introduction that sparked his friendship with [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], whose artwork had impressed and inspired Lam a year before when he saw an exhibition in Madrid.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/>\n\nIn 1938 Lam moved to Paris. He quickly gained the support of Picasso, who introduced him to many of the leading artists of the time, such as [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. Picasso also introduced him to Pierre Loeb, a Parisian art dealer; Loeb gave Lam his first exhibition at the Galerie Pierre Loeb in 1939, which received an enthusiastic response from critics.<ref name=\"Sims\">Sims, Lowery S. ''Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923\u20131982''. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 2002.</ref> Picasso and Lam also exhibited their work together at the Perls Galleries in New York in the same year. Lam's work went from showing the influence of Matisse, seen in his [[still life]]s, landscapes and simplified portraits, to being influenced by [[Cubism]].<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> Mainly working with [[gouache]], Lam began producing stylized figures that appear to be influenced by Picasso. Much of his work in 1938 possessed emotional intensity; the subject matter ranged from interacting couples to women in despair and showed a considerably stronger African influence, seen in the figures\u2019 angular outlines and the synthesis of their bodies.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/>\n\nWhile Lam began simplifying his forms before he came into contact with Picasso's work, it is apparent that Picasso had a significant impact on him. With regard to Picasso's exhibition, Lam said that it was \"not only a revelation, but\u2026 a shock.\"<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> Lam gained the approval of Picasso, whose encouragement has been said to have led Lam to search for his own interpretation of modernism.<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the invasion of Paris by the Germans, Lam left for [[Marseille]] in 1940. There he rejoined many intellectuals, including the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]]s, with whom he had been associated since he met [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] in 1939. While in Marseille, Lam and Breton collaborated on the publication of Breton's poem ''Fata Morgana'', which was illustrated by Lam. Though the drawings he created in Marseille between 1940 and 1941 are known as the ''Fata Morgana'' suite, only about three inspired the illustrations for the poem.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> In 1941 Breton, Lam and [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], accompanied by many others, left for [[Martinique]] only to be imprisoned. After forty days, Lam was released and allowed to leave for Cuba, which he reached in midsummer 1941.\n\n==Havana years==\nUpon Lam's return to [[Havana]], he developed a new awareness of Afro-Cuban traditions. He noticed that the descendants of the slaves were still being oppressed and that the Afro-Cuban culture was degraded and made picturesque for the sake of tourism. He believed that Cuba was in danger of losing its African heritage and therefore sought to free them from cultural subjugation. In an interview with Max-Pol Fouchet, he said,\n<blockquote>\"I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country, but by thoroughly expressing the negro spirit, the beauty of the plastic art of the blacks. In this way I could act as a [[Trojan horse]] that would spew forth hallucinating figures with the power to surprise, to disturb the dreams of the exploiters.\"<ref name=\"Richards\"/></blockquote>\nAdditionally, his time in Cuba marked a rapid evolution of his style. Drawing from his study of tropical plants and familiarity with Afro-Cuban culture, his paintings became characterized by the presence of a hybrid figure\u2014part human, part animal, and part vegetal.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> His style was also distinctive because of its fusion of Surrealist and Cubist approaches with imagery and symbols from Santer\u00eda.<ref name=\"Nessen\">Nessen, Susan. \"Review: Multiculturalism in the Americas.\" ''Art Journal'' 52 (1993):  86\u201391. JSTOR.</ref> In 1943 he began his best-known work, ''The Jungle''. It reflected his mature style, depicting four figures with mask-like heads, half-emerging from dense tropical vegetation. Later that year it was shown in an exhibition at the [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery in New York, where it created controversy. The painting depicted the tension between [[Modernism]] and the vibrancy and energy of [[African culture]].<ref name=\"Richards\"/> ''The Jungle'' was ultimately purchased by the [[Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art N.Y.]] It is often compared to Picasso's ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', which is hung in the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid.\n\n[[File:Carbonell_and_Wifrido_Lam_durning_an_interview_at_Union_Radio_television_station,_Havana_Cuba,_1952.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Wifredo Lam with fellow artist [[Manuel Carbonell]] (1952)]]\nLam continued to simplify and synthesize abstraction yet continued painting figurally; he also kept on developing the [[mythology]] and [[totemism]] that defined his style.<ref name=\"Sims\"/> In 1944 he married Helana Holzer, whom he divorced in 1950. In 1946 he and Breton spent four months in [[Haiti]]. There Lam enriched his already extensive understanding and knowledge of African divinity and magic rituals through observing [[Voodoun]] ceremonies, although he later said that his contact with the African spirituality that he found throughout the Americas did not directly impact his formal style. African poetry, on the other hand, was said to have had a broadening effect on his paintings.<ref name=\"Richards\"/> In 1950 he worked with [[Ren\u00e9 Portocarrero]] and others; in the village of Santiago de Las Vegas, the group of painters worked on ceramic.<ref>''Victor Moreno \u2013 ein kubanischer Maler'', Felix Busse, Vielflieger Verlag</ref> Lam settled in Paris in 1952 after having divided his time between Cuba, New York and France.\n\n[[File:Sal\u00f3n de Mayo, 1967. Wilfredo Lam. Radiocentro CMQ Sidewalk. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|Sal\u00f3n de Mayo, 1967. Sidewalk insert in front of the [[Radiocentro CMQ Building]] by Wilfredo Lam.]]\nLam, who continued to sympathize with the common man, exhibited a series of paintings at [[Havana University]] in 1955 to demonstrate his support for the students\u2019 protests against Batista's dictatorship. Similarly, in 1965, six years after the revolution, he showed his loyalty to Castro and his goals of social and economic equality by painting ''El Tercer Mundo'' (The Third World) for the presidential palace. In 1960 Lam established a studio in [[Albissola Marina]] on Italy's northwest coast and settled there with his wife Lou Laurin, a Swedish painter, and their three sons. In 1964, he was awarded the Guggenheim International Award and between 1966 and 1967 there were many retrospectives of his work throughout Europe. At the encouragement of [[Asger Jorn]] and after being intrigued by the local pottery-making, Lam began to experiment with ceramics and had his first ceramic exhibition in 1975.  He progressed to model sculptures and cast in metal in his twilight years, often depicting personages similar to those he had painted.\n\nWifredo Lam died on September 11, 1982 in Paris. Having had over one hundred personal exhibitions around the world, Lam had a well established reputation by the time of his death.\n\n==Legacy==\nLam, like many of the most renowned artists of the 20th century, combined radical modern styles with the \"primitive\" arts of the Americas.<ref name=\"Nessen\"/> While [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda]] drew inspiration from [[Pre-Columbian art]], Wifredo Lam was influenced by the Afro-Cubans of that time. Lam dramatically synthesized the Surrealist and Cubist strategies while incorporating the iconography and spirit of Afro-Cuban religion. For that reason, his work does not belong to any particular art movement.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/>\n\nHe held the belief that society focused too much on the individual and sought to show humanity as a whole in his artwork.<ref name=\"Balderrama\"/> He painted generic figures, creating the universal. To further his goal, he often painted [[African tribal masks|mask]]-like faces. While Cuban culture and mythology permeated his work, it dealt with the nature of man and therefore was wholly relatable to non-Cubans.\n\nOpened in 1983, the '''Wifredo Lam Center for Contemporary Art''' (in Spanish: Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo Wifredo Lam) is a state-run gallery in tribute to Lam and located in Havana, Cuba.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lahabana.com/guide/centro-de-arte-contemporaneo-wifredo-lam/|title=Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo Wifredo Lam|date=2013-12-11|website=Havana City Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> This art gallery is responsible for the organization of the Bienal de la Habana, Cuba, a permanent art collection of approx. 1000 works, and research and study of contemporary visual arts in developing countries.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.afar.com/places/centro-de-arte-contemporaneo-wifredo-lam-la-habana|title=Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo Wifredo Lam|last=|first=|date=2017-03-22|website=www.afar.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 a retrospective exhibition of his works opened at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris; this exhibition is to travel to the Reina Sofia Museum in Spain and the Tate Museum in London afterwards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cubacounterpoints.com/archives/4636|title=THE EY EXHIBITION: WIFREDO LAM|last=Ramos|first=Afonso Dias|date=2016-12-01|website=Cuba Counterpoints|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==''The Jungle''==\n[[Image:'The Jungle', gouache on paper painting by Wifredo Lam, 1943, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|right|Wifredo Lam, ''The Jungle'', [[gouache]] on paper, 1943, [[Museum of Modern Art]]]]\n\n''The Jungle'', which is considered Lam's masterpiece, is exemplary of the artist's mature style. The polymorphism, for which Lam is well known, juxtaposes aspects of humans, animals, and plants, creating monstrous, hybrid creatures. The dense composition creates a claustrophobic feeling while the forms remain difficult to differentiate. The figures\u2019 elongated limbs lack definition, while much emphasis is placed on their large feet, round buttocks, and African-inspired masked heads. Additionally, the iridescent quality of the forms enhances the painting's tropical feeling.\n\n''The Jungle'' was not, however, intended to describe the primitivism of Cuba. Rather, Lam's intention was to depict a spiritual state\u2014that which is surely inspired by Santer\u00eda;<ref name=\"Lucie-Smith\">Lucie-Smith, Edward.

Oracle America''''' (previously named ''Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.'' in lower courts) is a current legal case within the United States related to the nature of [[computer code]] and [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright law]]. The dispute centers on the use of parts of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]]'s [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), which are owned by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], within early versions of the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] by [[Google]]. Google has admitted to using the APIs, and has since transitioned Android to a copyright-unburdened engine, but argues their original use of the APIs was within [[fair use]].\n\nOracle initiated the suit arguing that the APIs were copyrightable, seeking {{USD|8.8 billion}} in damages. While two District Court-level jury trials have found in favor of Google, the Federal Circuit court has reversed both decisions, asserting APIs are copyrightable and Google's application of them failed a fair use defense. Google successfully petitioned to the Supreme Court to hear the case in the 2019 term, focusing on the copyrightability of APIs and subsequent fair use. The case is of significant interest within the tech and software industries, as numerous software programs and libraries, particularly in [[open source]], are developed by recreating the functionality of APIs from commercial or competing products to aid developers in [[interoperability]] between different systems or platforms.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Java (software platform)|Java]] was originally developed at [[Sun Microsystems]] starting in December 1990.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Southwick |first1=Karen |title=High Noon: the inside story of Scott McNealy and the rise of Sun Microsystems |date=1999 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York [u.a.] |isbn=0471297135 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare/page/120 120-122] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare/page/120 }}</ref> It included a new [[programming language]], a [[Process virtual machine|virtual machine]], and a set of [[library (computing)|libraries]] for use with the language.<ref name=\"java earlyhistory\">{{cite web |url=http://java.sun.com/features/1998/05/birthday.html |title=Java Technology: The Early Years |author=Jon Byous |date=April 2003 |publisher=[[Sun Microsystems]] |accessdate=2009-08-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530073139/http://java.sun.com/features/1998/05/birthday.html |archivedate=May 30, 2008}}</ref> These libraries are documented to programmers via [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), which tell programmers what information to provide to library functions and what results to expect back, eliminating the programmer's need to know how the virtual machine processed the data.

To qualify for copyright protection a work must be original. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a). The court was therefore \"first to assess whether the expression is original to the programmer\" (p.&nbsp;24), something that Google had already conceded (p.&nbsp;21). This led the court to conclude \"that the overall structure of Oracle's API packages is creative, original, and resembles a taxonomy\" (p.&nbsp;14). It therefore reversed the first instance's decision on the central issue, holding that the \"[[structure, sequence and organization]]\" of an API is copyrightable. It also ruled for Oracle regarding the small amount of literal copying, holding that it was not ''[[de minimis]]''. The case was remanded to the District Court for a second trial, to consider whether Google's use was acceptable anyway, under the [[legal doctrine|doctrine]] of [[fair use]], since the original case had not brought out the facts related to fair use sufficiently for the Appeal Court to rule on that point.<ref name=\"cafc 13-1021\" /><ref name=\"cnet appeals\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/court-sides-with-oracle-over-android-in-java-patent-appeal/ | title=Court sides with Oracle over Android in Java patent appeal | work=CNET | date=May 9, 2014 | accessdate=2014-05-10 | author=Rosenblatt, Seth}}</ref><ref name=\"cafc 13-1021\"/>\n\n=== Supreme Court petition ===\nIn October 2014, Google petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Levine |first1=Dan |title=Google asks Supreme Court to decide Oracle copyright fight |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/08/us-google-oracle-lawsuit-idUSKCN0HX2DG20141008 |accessdate=January 5, 2015 |agency=Reuters |date=October 8, 2014}}</ref>  Oracle responded to the petition in December.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Niccolai |first1=IDG News Service |title=Oracle asks Supreme Court to reject Android copyright case |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2857293/legal/oracle-asks-supreme-court-to-reject-android-copyright-case.html |accessdate=January 5, 2015 |agency=IDG News Service |date=December 8, 2014}}</ref>  Following a discussion of the petition at the Court's January 9 conference,<ref name=\"SCOTUS_docket_14-410\">''Google, Inc. v.

On March 27, 2018, the Court ruled in favor of Oracle.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\">{{cite court |litigants=Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google Inc. |vol=886 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1179 |pinpoint= |court=Fed. Cir. |date=2018 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180327178 |accessdate=2019-12-21 |quote=}}</ref> The ruling analyzed the aspects of a \"fair use\" claim which were to be decided by a judge and jury, respectively. It then looked at the factual matters which, it had to be assumed, the jury had reached, and their implications in law.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/> It noted that in a \"mixed\" case of fact and law, such as the present dispute, the trial jury's role is to decide on the facts. Judge Alsup quoted the Supreme Court case ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' {{ussc|510|569|1994}} in his opinion, noting that: <blockquote>\"truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if any, things, which in an abstract sense, are strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known and used before\"<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Appeal Court's role is to assess whether a reasonable jury could have reached the conclusions it did, and whether the judge's decision could be correct and reasonable in law. The standard review of mixed questions of law and fact concerned three components: \"(1) determining the legal standard governing the question posed and what types of historical facts are relevant to that standard; (2) finding what the historical facts in the case at hand are; and (3) assessing whether the historical facts found satisfy the legal test governing the question to be answered\" (Decision p.&nbsp;19). Except clear error, the role of the jury is limited to determining disputed 'historical facts' (2). The facts are not discussed. \"It It is undisputed that Google copied verbatim the declaring code of the 37 Java API packages 11,500 lines of Oracle\u2019s copyrighted code. It also copied the SSO of the Java API packages. (Decision p.10)\" It is also established and Google recognizes that the software copied is creative and original.\n\nThe Court found that as a matter of law, Google's use of Java could not have fallen within fair use, even if all factual matters decided by the jury had been in Google's favor. The Appeals Court found that Google's use of API code declarations had not met any of the four current criteria for fair use, but was merely untransformed reuse. It had not been transformative, since it was used for the same purposes without even minimal changes or rewrites. It was not minimal, since it was agreed that only 170 lines of the 11,500 lines copied were needed for Google's purposes. It was not within any example of transformation, nor intended to permit third party interoperability, since Google had made no substantial efforts to use them for the purpose of third party interoperability. (In fact it found that Google had tried to ''prevent'' interoperability with other Java and had previously been refused a license by Sun for that reason.<ref name=\"interoperability\" />) It was not transformative in the sense of a new platform either, since other Java smartphones predated Android.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/> It was plausible that the use had harmed Sun/Oracle&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps to a great extent if Oracle were to be believed&nbsp;\u2013 since as a result, vendors began to expecting Oracle to compete on price with a freely available derivative of its own language, and to require very steep discounts and undesired contractual terms.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/> Therefore, Google's use of the Java code and APIs failed to meet all four of the currently accepted criteria under which fair use would be possible.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/>\n\nInstead, the Court found that Google's purpose had been to enhance its nascent Android platform's attractiveness to existing developers, who were often familiar with Java, and to avoid the \"drudgery\" of rewriting the code (which they could have done) needed to implement the 170 lines of API detail which were indeed required. \"Making it easy for oneself\", the court noted, is well established to not fall within valid grounds for fair use. The Court found that \"The fact that Android is free of charge does not make Google's use of the Java API packages noncommercial\".<ref name=\"bbn march2018\">{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/oracle-wins-revival-of-billion-dollar-case-against-google | title = Oracle Wins Revival of Billion-Dollar Case Against Google | first=  Susan | last =Decker |date = March 27, 2018 | accessdate = March 27, 2018 | work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] }}</ref> Oracle <blockquote>\"devised a licensing scheme to attract programmers while simultaneously commercializing the platform.

Oracle America''''' (previously named ''Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.'' in lower courts) is a current legal case within the United States related to the nature of [[computer code]] and [[Copyright law of the United States|copyright law]]. The dispute centers on the use of parts of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]]'s [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), which are owned by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], within early versions of the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] by [[Google]]. Google has admitted to using the APIs, and has since transitioned Android to a copyright-unburdened engine, but argues their original use of the APIs was within [[fair use]].\n\nOracle initiated the suit arguing that the APIs were copyrightable, seeking {{USD|8.8 billion}} in damages. While two District Court-level jury trials have found in favor of Google, the Federal Circuit court has reversed both decisions, asserting APIs are copyrightable and Google's application of them failed a fair use defense. Google successfully petitioned to the Supreme Court to hear the case in the 2019 term, focusing on the copyrightability of APIs and subsequent fair use. The case is of significant interest within the tech and software industries, as numerous software programs and libraries, particularly in [[open source]], are developed by recreating the functionality of APIs from commercial or competing products to aid developers in [[interoperability]] between different systems or platforms.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Java (software platform)|Java]] was originally developed at [[Sun Microsystems]] starting in December 1990.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Southwick |first1=Karen |title=High Noon: the inside story of Scott McNealy and the rise of Sun Microsystems |date=1999 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York [u.a.] |isbn=0471297135 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare/page/120 120-122] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare/page/120 }}</ref> It included a new [[programming language]], a [[Process virtual machine|virtual machine]], and a set of [[library (computing)|libraries]] for use with the language.<ref name=\"java earlyhistory\">{{cite web |url=http://java.sun.com/features/1998/05/birthday.html |title=Java Technology: The Early Years |author=Jon Byous |date=April 2003 |publisher=[[Sun Microsystems]] |accessdate=2009-08-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530073139/http://java.sun.com/features/1998/05/birthday.html |archivedate=May 30, 2008}}</ref> These libraries are documented to programmers via [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), which tell programmers what information to provide to library functions and what results to expect back, eliminating the programmer's need to know how the virtual machine processed the data.

On March 27, 2018, the Court ruled in favor of Oracle.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\">{{cite court |litigants=Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google Inc. |vol=886 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1179 |pinpoint= |court=Fed. Cir. |date=2018 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180327178 |accessdate=2019-12-21 |quote=}}</ref> The ruling analyzed the aspects of a \"fair use\" claim which were to be decided by a judge and jury, respectively. It then looked at the factual matters which, it had to be assumed, the jury had reached, and their implications in law.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/> It noted that in a \"mixed\" case of fact and law, such as the present dispute, the trial jury's role is to decide on the facts. Judge Alsup quoted the Supreme Court case ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' {{ussc|510|569|1994}} in his opinion, noting that: <blockquote>\"truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if any, things, which in an abstract sense, are strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known and used before\"<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Appeal Court's role is to assess whether a reasonable jury could have reached the conclusions it did, and whether the judge's decision could be correct and reasonable in law. The standard review of mixed questions of law and fact concerned three components: \"(1) determining the legal standard governing the question posed and what types of historical facts are relevant to that standard; (2) finding what the historical facts in the case at hand are; and (3) assessing whether the historical facts found satisfy the legal test governing the question to be answered\" (Decision p.&nbsp;19). Except clear error, the role of the jury is limited to determining disputed 'historical facts' (2). The facts are not discussed. \"It It is undisputed that Google copied verbatim the declaring code of the 37 Java API packages 11,500 lines of Oracle\u2019s copyrighted code. It also copied the SSO of the Java API packages. (Decision p.10)\" It is also established and Google recognizes that the software copied is creative and original.\n\nThe Court found that as a matter of law, Google's use of Java could not have fallen within fair use, even if all factual matters decided by the jury had been in Google's favor. The Appeals Court found that Google's use of API code declarations had not met any of the four current criteria for fair use, but was merely untransformed reuse. It had not been transformative, since it was used for the same purposes without even minimal changes or rewrites. It was not minimal, since it was agreed that only 170 lines of the 11,500 lines copied were needed for Google's purposes. It was not within any example of transformation, nor intended to permit third party interoperability, since Google had made no substantial efforts to use them for the purpose of third party interoperability. (In fact it found that Google had tried to ''prevent'' interoperability with other Java and had previously been refused a license by Sun for that reason.<ref name=\"interoperability\" />) It was not transformative in the sense of a new platform either, since other Java smartphones predated Android.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/> It was plausible that the use had harmed Sun/Oracle&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps to a great extent if Oracle were to be believed&nbsp;\u2013 since as a result, vendors began to expecting Oracle to compete on price with a freely available derivative of its own language, and to require very steep discounts and undesired contractual terms.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/> Therefore, Google's use of the Java code and APIs failed to meet all four of the currently accepted criteria under which fair use would be possible.<ref name=\"appeal_20180327\"/>\n\nInstead, the Court found that Google's purpose had been to enhance its nascent Android platform's attractiveness to existing developers, who were often familiar with Java, and to avoid the \"drudgery\" of rewriting the code (which they could have done) needed to implement the 170 lines of API detail which were indeed required. \"Making it easy for oneself\", the court noted, is well established to not fall within valid grounds for fair use. The Court found that \"The fact that Android is free of charge does not make Google's use of the Java API packages noncommercial\".<ref name=\"bbn march2018\">{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/oracle-wins-revival-of-billion-dollar-case-against-google | title = Oracle Wins Revival of Billion-Dollar Case Against Google | first=  Susan | last =Decker |date = March 27, 2018 | accessdate = March 27, 2018 | work = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] }}</ref> Oracle <blockquote>\"devised a licensing scheme to attract programmers while simultaneously commercializing the platform.

Norton & Company]]|year=2005|page=5|ISBN=0-7394-5304-1}}</ref> and was the first of the stories collected in ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' in 1892.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n[[Dr. Watson]] recounts an adventure that started on 20 March 1888. While the currently married Watson is paying Holmes a visit, a masked visitor arrives, introducing himself as Count Von Kramm, an agent for a wealthy client. Holmes quickly deduces that the visitor is, in fact, Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and the hereditary [[List of rulers of Bohemia#Kings|King of Bohemia]]. Realizing Holmes has seen through his guise, the King admits this and tears off his mask.\n\nIt transpires that the King is to become engaged to Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, a young [[Scandinavia]]n princess. However, five years before the events of the story he had enjoyed a liaison with a \"well-known adventuress\", the American opera singer [[Irene Adler]], whilst she was [[prima donna]] of the Imperial Opera of Warsaw. She has since retired and now lives in London. Fearful that should the strictly principled family of his fianc\u00e9e learn of this impropriety, the marriage would be called off, he had sought to regain letters and a photograph of Adler and himself together, which he had sent to her during their relationship as a token. The King's agents have tried to recover the photograph through sometimes forceful means, burglary, stealing her luggage, and waylaying her. An offer to pay for the photograph and letters was also refused. With Adler threatening to send them to his future in-laws, which the King presumes is intended to prevent him from marrying any other woman, he makes the incognito visit to Holmes to request his help in locating and obtaining the photograph.\n\nThe photograph is described to Holmes as a [[cabinet card|cabinet]] (5\u00bd by 4&nbsp; inches) and therefore too bulky for a lady to carry upon her person. As regards expenses, the King says Holmes has carte blanche and gives him \u00a31,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1000|1888|r=-2}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK}}), exclaiming \"I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph!\" Holmes asks Dr. Watson to join him at [[221B Baker Street]] at 3 o'clock the following afternoon.\n\nThe next morning, Holmes goes to Adler's house, disguised as a drunken out-of-work groom. He discovers from the local stable workers that Adler has a gentleman friend, the barrister Godfrey Norton of the [[Inner Temple]], who calls at least once a day. On this particular day, Norton comes to visit Adler, and soon afterward takes a cab to the Church of St. Monica in [[Edgware Road]]. Minutes later, the lady herself gets into her [[Landau (carriage)|landau]], bound for the same place. Holmes follows in a cab and enters a church, where he is unexpectedly asked to be a witness to Norton and Adler's wedding. Curiously, they go their separate ways after the ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, Watson has been waiting for Holmes to arrive, and when Holmes finally does deliver himself back to Baker Street, he starts laughing. Watson is confused and asks what is so funny. Holmes then recounts his tale and comments he thought the situation and position he was in at the wedding was amusing. He also asks whether or not Watson is willing to participate in a scheme to figure out where the picture is hidden in Adler's house. Watson agrees, and Holmes changes into another disguise as a clergyman. The duo departs Baker Street for Adler's house.\n\nWhen Holmes and Watson arrive, a group of jobless men meanders throughout the street. When Adler's coach pulls up, Holmes enacts his plan. A fight breaks out between the men on the street over who gets to help Adler. Holmes rushes into the fight to protect Adler and is seemingly struck and injured. Adler takes him into her sitting room, where Holmes motions for her to have the window opened. As Holmes lifts his hand, Watson recognizes a pre-arranged signal and tosses in a plumber's [[smoke bomb|smoke rocket]]. While smoke billows out of the building, Watson shouts \"FIRE!\" and the cry is echoed up and down the street.\n\nHolmes slips out of Adler's house and tells Watson what he saw. As Holmes expected, Adler rushed to get her most precious possession at the cry of \"fire\" \u2013 the photograph of herself and the King. Holmes was able to see that the picture was kept in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right [[bell pull]]. He was unable to steal it at that moment, however, because the coachman was watching him. He explains all this to Watson before being bid good-night by a familiar-sounding youth, who promptly manages to get lost in the crowd.\n\nThe following morning, Holmes explains his findings to the King. When Holmes, Watson, and the King arrive at Adler's house at 8 am, her elderly maidservant sardonically informs them she left the country by the 5.15 train from [[Charing Cross railway station]]. Holmes quickly goes to the photograph's hiding spot, finding a photo of Irene Adler in an evening dress and a letter dated midnight and addressed to him. In the letter, Adler tells Holmes he did very well in finding the photograph and taking her in with his disguises. She also reveals that she posed as the youth who bid Holmes good-night. Adler has left England with Norton, \"a better man\" than the King, adding she will not compromise the King, despite being \"cruelly wronged\" by him; she had kept the photo only to protect herself from further action he might take.\n\nThe King exclaims how amazing Adler is (\"Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity she was not on my [[Morganatic marriage|level]]?\") Holmes replies Miss Adler is indeed on a much different level from the King (by which he means higher \u2013 an implication lost on the King). Thanking Holmes effusively, the King offers a valuable emerald ring from his finger as further reward.<ref>Holmes does accept a antique snuff box from the King as a gift [\"A Case of Identity\"]</ref> Holmes says there is something he values even more highly \u2013 the photograph of Adler. Ignoring the handshake proffered by the King, Holmes leaves. He keeps the photograph as a reminder of her cleverness, and of being beaten by a woman's wit. Watson also tells that, since their meeting, Holmes always refers to her by the honorable title of \"''the'' woman\".\n\nIn the opening paragraph of the short story, Watson calls her \"the late Irene Adler\", suggesting she is deceased.

Norton & Company]]|year=2005|page=5|ISBN=0-7394-5304-1}}</ref> and was the first of the stories collected in ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' in 1892.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n[[Dr. Watson]] recounts an adventure that started on 20 March 1888. While the currently married Watson is paying Holmes a visit, a masked visitor arrives, introducing himself as Count Von Kramm, an agent for a wealthy client. Holmes quickly deduces that the visitor is, in fact, Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and the hereditary [[List of rulers of Bohemia#Kings|King of Bohemia]]. Realizing Holmes has seen through his guise, the King admits this and tears off his mask.\n\nIt transpires that the King is to become engaged to Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, a young [[Scandinavia]]n princess. However, five years before the events of the story he had enjoyed a liaison with a \"well-known adventuress\", the American opera singer [[Irene Adler]], whilst she was [[prima donna]] of the Imperial Opera of Warsaw. She has since retired and now lives in London. Fearful that should the strictly principled family of his fianc\u00e9e learn of this impropriety, the marriage would be called off, he had sought to regain letters and a photograph of Adler and himself together, which he had sent to her during their relationship as a token. The King's agents have tried to recover the photograph through sometimes forceful means, burglary, stealing her luggage, and waylaying her. An offer to pay for the photograph and letters was also refused. With Adler threatening to send them to his future in-laws, which the King presumes is intended to prevent him from marrying any other woman, he makes the incognito visit to Holmes to request his help in locating and obtaining the photograph.\n\nThe photograph is described to Holmes as a [[cabinet card|cabinet]] (5\u00bd by 4&nbsp; inches) and therefore too bulky for a lady to carry upon her person. As regards expenses, the King says Holmes has carte blanche and gives him \u00a31,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1000|1888|r=-2}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK}}), exclaiming \"I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph!\" Holmes asks Dr. Watson to join him at [[221B Baker Street]] at 3 o'clock the following afternoon.\n\nThe next morning, Holmes goes to Adler's house, disguised as a drunken out-of-work groom. He discovers from the local stable workers that Adler has a gentleman friend, the barrister Godfrey Norton of the [[Inner Temple]], who calls at least once a day. On this particular day, Norton comes to visit Adler, and soon afterward takes a cab to the Church of St. Monica in [[Edgware Road]]. Minutes later, the lady herself gets into her [[Landau (carriage)|landau]], bound for the same place. Holmes follows in a cab and enters a church, where he is unexpectedly asked to be a witness to Norton and Adler's wedding. Curiously, they go their separate ways after the ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, Watson has been waiting for Holmes to arrive, and when Holmes finally does deliver himself back to Baker Street, he starts laughing. Watson is confused and asks what is so funny. Holmes then recounts his tale and comments he thought the situation and position he was in at the wedding was amusing. He also asks whether or not Watson is willing to participate in a scheme to figure out where the picture is hidden in Adler's house. Watson agrees, and Holmes changes into another disguise as a clergyman. The duo departs Baker Street for Adler's house.\n\nWhen Holmes and Watson arrive, a group of jobless men meanders throughout the street. When Adler's coach pulls up, Holmes enacts his plan. A fight breaks out between the men on the street over who gets to help Adler. Holmes rushes into the fight to protect Adler and is seemingly struck and injured. Adler takes him into her sitting room, where Holmes motions for her to have the window opened. As Holmes lifts his hand, Watson recognizes a pre-arranged signal and tosses in a plumber's [[smoke bomb|smoke rocket]]. While smoke billows out of the building, Watson shouts \"FIRE!\" and the cry is echoed up and down the street.\n\nHolmes slips out of Adler's house and tells Watson what he saw. As Holmes expected, Adler rushed to get her most precious possession at the cry of \"fire\" \u2013 the photograph of herself and the King. Holmes was able to see that the picture was kept in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right [[bell pull]]. He was unable to steal it at that moment, however, because the coachman was watching him. He explains all this to Watson before being bid good-night by a familiar-sounding youth, who promptly manages to get lost in the crowd.\n\nThe following morning, Holmes explains his findings to the King. When Holmes, Watson, and the King arrive at Adler's house at 8 am, her elderly maidservant sardonically informs them she left the country by the 5.15 train from [[Charing Cross railway station]]. Holmes quickly goes to the photograph's hiding spot, finding a photo of Irene Adler in an evening dress and a letter dated midnight and addressed to him. In the letter, Adler tells Holmes he did very well in finding the photograph and taking her in with his disguises. She also reveals that she posed as the youth who bid Holmes good-night. Adler has left England with Norton, \"a better man\" than the King, adding she will not compromise the King, despite being \"cruelly wronged\" by him; she had kept the photo only to protect herself from further action he might take.\n\nThe King exclaims how amazing Adler is (\"Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity she was not on my [[Morganatic marriage|level]]?\") Holmes replies Miss Adler is indeed on a much different level from the King (by which he means higher \u2013 an implication lost on the King). Thanking Holmes effusively, the King offers a valuable emerald ring from his finger as further reward.<ref>Holmes does accept a antique snuff box from the King as a gift [\"A Case of Identity\"]</ref> Holmes says there is something he values even more highly \u2013 the photograph of Adler. Ignoring the handshake proffered by the King, Holmes leaves. He keeps the photograph as a reminder of her cleverness, and of being beaten by a woman's wit. Watson also tells that, since their meeting, Holmes always refers to her by the honorable title of \"''the'' woman\".\n\nIn the opening paragraph of the short story, Watson calls her \"the late Irene Adler\", suggesting she is deceased. It has been speculated, however, that the word \"late\" might actually mean \"former\". She married Godfrey Norton, making Adler her former name. (Doyle employs this same usage in \"[[The Adventure of the Priory School]]\" in reference to the Duke's former status as a [[cabinet minister]].)\n\n==Holmes' relationship to Adler==\nAdler earns Holmes' unbounded admiration.<ref name=\"bunson1\">{{cite book |last=Bunson|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew Bunson |title=Encyclopedia Sherlockiana |year=1997 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |page=3 |ISBN=0-02-861679-0}}</ref> When the King of Bohemia says, \"Would she not have made an admirable queen?

Melford''' (born '''George Henry Knauff''', February 19, 1877 \u2013 April 25, 1961) was an American stage and film actor, director, producer, and screenwriter. Often taken for granted as a director today, the stalwart Melford's name by the 1920s was, like Cecil B. DeMille's, appearing in big bold letters above the title of his films.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lost Film Files #23: Burning Sands (1922)|work=MOVIES SILENTLY Celebrate Silent Film|author=Kramer, Fritzi|date=December 30, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2019| url=http://moviessilently.com/tag/george-melford/}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Rochester, New York]], in 1877 (though older sources state 1888), he was the son of German immigrant Henrietta Knauff. Melford had four sisters: Mary Knauff (Mrs. Godfrey Willis Wainwright); Henrietta Knauff; Alice Irene Knauff (Mrs. Edmond Francois Bernoudy) \u2014 all of Los Angeles \u2014 and Mrs. Frederick Kells/Keils of Ottawa, Canada. Melford graduated from [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.{{Citation needed |date=September 2019}}\n\n== Career ==\nHe was an accomplished stage actor working in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], before joining the [[Kalem Company]] motion picture studio in New York City in 1909. Hired by director [[Sidney Olcott]] for [[character actor]] roles, in the fall of 1910 he was sent to work with a film crew on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. In 1911, with [[Robert Vignola]], he co-directed [[Ruth Roland]] in his first short film, ''Arizona Bill'' based on a script he had written. From there Melford went on to direct another 30 films for Kalem Studios until 1915, when he was hired by [[Jesse L. Lasky]] to direct feature-length films for Lasky's [[Paramount Pictures|Feature Play Company]]. That same year Melford became one of the founding members of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].\n[[File:The Sheik with Agnes Ayres and Rudolph Valentino, movie poster, 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Poster for ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'' (1921), directed by George Melford]]\nIn 1916 Melford directed ''[[To Have and to Hold (1916 film)|To Have and to Hold]]'', a film based on the [[Mary Johnston]] novel that had been the [[List of bestselling novels in the United States|bestselling novel in the United States]] for 1900. In 1921 he directed what is probably his most famous [[silent film]]\u2014''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', starring [[Rudolph Valentino]].\n\nMelford remained with Lasky's company for ten years, then joined [[Universal Pictures]], where he directed his first [[Sound film|talkie]] in 1929. The following year he co-directed four Spanish language films including the acclaimed [[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Spanish version of ''Dracula'']]. Melford filmed it simultaneously with the English version on the same sets at night using a different cast and crew. Somewhat of a controversy has arisen about this film. Some sources say that Melford was assigned the job because he could speak Spanish, but other sources claim that Melford could not speak a word of Spanish and had to use a translator to communicate with the actors.  The issue was cleared up when actress [[Lupita Tovar]]\u2014who was in the film\u2014said in an interview on the 75th anniversary DVD of the film that Melford in fact did not speak Spanish and had to use a translator.\n\nHis last major work as a director came in 1937 when he and [[Harry L. Fraser]] co-directed [[Columbia Pictures]]' first [[Serial (film)|serial]], a 15-episode, five-hour-long [[adventure film]] titled [[Jungle Menace]] starring [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]]. At age 60 the [[workaholic]] Melford needed to slow down and decided to give up the stressful job of directing to take on simple [[character actor]] roles. However, in 1946 Harry Fraser convinced him to co-direct \"''Jungle Terror'',\" a feature-length sequel to their successful ''Jungle Menace'' serial.\n\n==Later career and death==\nMelford loved the film business, and although financially independent, he never stopped working. Having directed more than 140 films, he continued to work in small character roles.  In the 1940s he was part of [[Preston Sturges]]' unofficial [[Preston Sturges Unofficial Stock Company Actors|\"stock company\" of character actors]], appearing in six films written and directed by Sturges.{{efn|Melford appeared in ''[[The Great McGinty]]'', ''[[The Lady Eve]]'', ''[[The Miracle of Morgan's Creek]]'', ''[[Hail the Conquering Hero]]'', ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1948 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'', ''[[The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend]]'', Sturges' last American film. Earlier, Melford had also appeared in ''[[Remember the Night]]'', which Sturges wrote.}} He also made a notable appearance in the 1956 epic ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 movie)|The Ten Commandments]]''.\n\nHe appeared in his last film in 1960 at the age of 83,{{Citation needed |date=September 2019}} dying in Hollywood on April 25, 1961, of heart failure at age 84. He is interred in [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ellenberger |first1=Allan R. |title=Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries: A Directory |date=2001 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786409839 |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bOJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&dq=%22George+Melford%22+actor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYzI6BmtnkAhWRfCsKHas7Dg0Q6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=%22George%20Melford%22%20actor&f=false |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn May 9, 1904, Melford married Louise Leroy.

Melford''' (born '''George Henry Knauff''', February 19, 1877 \u2013 April 25, 1961) was an American stage and film actor, director, producer, and screenwriter. Often taken for granted as a director today, the stalwart Melford's name by the 1920s was, like Cecil B. DeMille's, appearing in big bold letters above the title of his films.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lost Film Files #23: Burning Sands (1922)|work=MOVIES SILENTLY Celebrate Silent Film|author=Kramer, Fritzi|date=December 30, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2019| url=http://moviessilently.com/tag/george-melford/}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Rochester, New York]], in 1877 (though older sources state 1888), he was the son of German immigrant Henrietta Knauff. Melford had four sisters: Mary Knauff (Mrs. Godfrey Willis Wainwright); Henrietta Knauff; Alice Irene Knauff (Mrs. Edmond Francois Bernoudy) \u2014 all of Los Angeles \u2014 and Mrs. Frederick Kells/Keils of Ottawa, Canada. Melford graduated from [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.{{Citation needed |date=September 2019}} \n\n== Career ==\nHe was an accomplished stage actor working in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], before joining the [[Kalem Company]] motion picture studio in New York City in 1909. Hired by director [[Sidney Olcott]] for [[character actor]] roles, in the fall of 1910 he was sent to work with a film crew on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. In 1911, with [[Robert Vignola]], he co-directed [[Ruth Roland]] in his first short film, ''Arizona Bill'' based on a script he had written. From there Melford went on to direct another 30 films for Kalem Studios until 1915, when he was hired by [[Jesse L. Lasky]] to direct feature-length films for Lasky's [[Paramount Pictures|Feature Play Company]]. That same year Melford became one of the founding members of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].\n[[File:The Sheik with Agnes Ayres and Rudolph Valentino, movie poster, 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Poster for ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'' (1921), directed by George Melford]]\nIn 1916 Melford directed ''[[To Have and to Hold (1916 film)|To Have and to Hold]]'', a film based on the [[Mary Johnston]] novel that had been the [[List of bestselling novels in the United States|bestselling novel in the United States]] for 1900. In 1921 he directed what is probably his most famous [[silent film]]\u2014''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'', starring [[Rudolph Valentino]].\n\nMelford remained with Lasky's company for ten years, then joined [[Universal Pictures]], where he directed his first [[Sound film|talkie]] in 1929. The following year he co-directed four Spanish language films including the acclaimed [[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Spanish version of ''Dracula'']]. Melford filmed it simultaneously with the English version on the same sets at night using a different cast and crew. Somewhat of a controversy has arisen about this film. Some sources say that Melford was assigned the job because he could speak Spanish, but other sources claim that Melford could not speak a word of Spanish and had to use a translator to communicate with the actors.  The issue was cleared up when actress [[Lupita Tovar]]\u2014who was in the film\u2014said in an interview on the 75th anniversary DVD of the film that Melford in fact did not speak Spanish and had to use a translator.\n\nHis last major work as a director came in 1937 when he and [[Harry L. Fraser]] co-directed [[Columbia Pictures]]' first [[Serial (film)|serial]], a 15-episode, five-hour-long [[adventure film]] titled [[Jungle Menace]] starring [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]]. At age 60 the [[workaholic]] Melford needed to slow down and decided to give up the stressful job of directing to take on simple [[character actor]] roles. However, in 1946 Harry Fraser convinced him to co-direct \"''Jungle Terror'',\" a feature-length sequel to their successful ''Jungle Menace'' serial.\n\n==Later career and death==\nMelford loved the film business, and although financially independent, he never stopped working. Having directed more than 140 films, he continued to work in small character roles.  In the 1940s he was part of [[Preston Sturges]]' unofficial [[Preston Sturges Unofficial Stock Company Actors|\"stock company\" of character actors]], appearing in six films written and directed by Sturges.{{efn|Melford appeared in ''[[The Great McGinty]]'', ''[[The Lady Eve]]'', ''[[The Miracle of Morgan's Creek]]'', ''[[Hail the Conquering Hero]]'', ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1948 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'', ''[[The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend]]'', Sturges' last American film. Earlier, Melford had also appeared in ''[[Remember the Night]]'', which Sturges wrote.}} He also made a notable appearance in the 1956 epic ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 movie)|The Ten Commandments]]''.\n\nHe appeared in his last film in 1960 at the age of 83,{{Citation needed |date=September 2019}} dying in Hollywood on April 25, 1961, of heart failure at age 84. He is interred in [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ellenberger |first1=Allan R. |title=Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries: A Directory |date=2001 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786409839 |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bOJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&dq=%22George+Melford%22+actor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYzI6BmtnkAhWRfCsKHas7Dg0Q6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=%22George%20Melford%22%20actor&f=false |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn May 9, 1904, Melford married Louise Leroy.
