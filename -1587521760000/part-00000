''Zoot Suit'' is based on the [[Sleepy Lagoon murder]] trial and the [[Zoot Suit Riots]].  Debuting in 1979, ''Zoot Suit'' was the first [[Chicano]] play on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In [[1981 in film|1981]], Luis Valdez also directed a [[Zoot Suit (film)|filmed version]] of the play, combining stage and film techniques.\n\n==Plot==\n''Zoot Suit'' tells the story of Henry Reyna and the [[38th Street Gang]], who were tried for the Sleepy Lagoon murder in Los Angeles, during [[World War II]].  After a run-in with a neighboring gang at the local lovers lane, Sleepy Lagoon, the 38th Street Gang gets into a fight at a party, where a young man is murdered.  Discriminated against for their [[zoot suit]]-wearing Chicano identity, twenty-two members of the 38th Street Gang are placed on trial for the murder, found guilty, and sentenced to life in [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]] prison.  Meanwhile, in [[Los Angeles]], Henry's brother Rudy is beaten and stripped of his zoot suit during the Zoot Suit Riots.\n\nThrough the efforts of George and other lawyers, as well as activist-reporter Alice, with whom Henry has a brief romantic encounter, the boys win their court appeal and are freed.  The play ends with a Reyna family reunion as Henry returns home and Rudy is about to leave to join the Marines. The scene suggests that it is not the happy ending we expect, however, as multiple endings of Henry's story are suggested: that he returned to prison and drug abuse, died in the [[Korean War|war in Korea]] and was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously, or married Della and had five children.<ref name=BedfordDrama/>\n\n==Characters==\n* El [[Pachuco]]: an allegorical character of the [[Chicano]] sub-culture of the same name.\n* Henry Reyna: leader of the 38th Street Gang\n* Enrique Reyna: Henry's father\n* Dolores Reyna: Henry's mother\n* Lupe Reyna: Henry's sister\n* Rudy Reyna: Henry's brother\n* George Shearer: lawyer for Henry and the 38th Street boys\n* Alice Bloomfield: reporter and activist for Henry's case, as well as a brief love interest of Henry's\n* Della Barrios: 38th Street Gang member and Henry's girlfriend\n* The 38th Street Gang: includes Smiley Torres, Joey Castro, Tommy Roberts, Elena Torres, and Bertha Villarreal\n* Rafas: leader of the Downey Gang, rival to the 38th Street Gang\n* Downey Gang: include Ragman, Hobo, Cholo, Zooter, Guera, Hoba, Blondie, and Little Blue\n* Lieutenant Edwards and Sergeant Smith: detectives\n* Members of the Press:  includes Press (who doubles as the prosecution), Cub Reporter, and Newsboy\n* The Court: includes Judge F.

On August 1, 1942 Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz was at a birthday party at the Williams Ranch.  A disturbance occurred around 11:00&nbsp;p.m. when a group of twenty white men from the Downey suburb arrived uninvited, complaining about a lack of beer.  The group from Downey Gang were kicked out of the party after demanding more beer.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of men and women from 39th street drove their cars to the nearby swimming hole and lovers lane, dubbed \"Sleepy Lagoon,\" also on the Williams Ranch.  Among the group were Henry Leyvas and his girlfriend Dora Baca, from whom the characters Henry Reyna and Della are contrived.  Also with them was friend Bobby Telles. As the group socialized, three men pulled up and began yelling insults, met equally with words from Leyvas.  The three drove off.  The 38th street group wandered off until they heard a commotion from the parked cars, where Leyvas and Baca remained.  A group of about sixteen men from the Downey gang were beating Leyvas and Baca, prompting members of the 38th street group to defend their friends. After the Downey group left, the group from 38th street gang left to gather more of their group, prior to returning to the Williams Ranch.\n\nThe group arrived at Sleepy Lagoon around 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on the morning of the 2nd, to find no one, so someone suggested the Downey gang had moved to the party at the bunkhouse nearby at the Williams Ranch.  At the party, the Downey gang was not to be found.  Yet, somehow a fight broke out between the party goers and the 38th street gang.  The fight was brief, ending when someone yelled the police were coming.  In the aftermath of the fight, the party-throwers, the Delgadillos, discovered the body of Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz along the road, who had left the party shortly before the 38th street group arrived.  His pockets were turned inside out.  He was rushed to a hospital where he died an hour and a half after admission, with a concussion and two stab wounds.  The circumstances around D\u00edaz's death still remain undetermined.<ref name=Pagan>{{cite book|last1=Pagan|first1=Eduardo Obregon|title=Murder at the Sleepy Lagoon : Zoot Suits, Race, and Riot in Wartime L.A.|date=2003|publisher=U of North Carolina P|location=Chapel Hill, NC}}</ref>\n\n===''The People v. Zammora et al.''===\nIn the process of investigating the murder of Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, hundreds of young men and women in the L.A. area were brought in for police processing.  Among the suspects arrested, several were severely beaten during questioning, including Henry Leyvas, Lupe Leyvas, Benny Alvarez, and Eugene Carpio, and Manuel Reyes. Twenty-two men were placed on trial as a group, under the defense of seven attorneys in ''the People v. Zammora et al.''  George Shibley later joined as an attorney on the case, winning favor from the defendants and their families for his attempts to communicate in Spanish.  Alice McGrath was hired by Shibley to take notes on the trial.  Though the murder weapon was never produced, after six days of deliberation, only five of the twenty-two young men were found \"not guilty.\"  The other seventeen young men were convicted of murdering Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, including Henry Leyvas, who with Jos\u00e9 Ru\u00edz and Robert Telles, was convicted of murder in the first degree and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill.  Leyvas, Ru\u00edz, and Telles were sentenced to life in prison, while the other young men were sentenced to one to five years.\n\nThe ruling was reversed in October 1944 and the men were released, due to the efforts of the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee, with Alice McGrath as executive secretary.

''Zoot Suit'' is based on the [[Sleepy Lagoon murder]] trial and the [[Zoot Suit Riots]].  Debuting in 1979, ''Zoot Suit'' was the first [[Chicano]] play on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In [[1981 in film|1981]], Luis Valdez also directed a [[Zoot Suit (film)|filmed version]] of the play, combining stage and film techniques.\n\n==Plot==\n''Zoot Suit'' tells the story of Henry Reyna and the [[38th Street Gang]], who were tried for the Sleepy Lagoon murder in Los Angeles, during [[World War II]].  After a run-in with a neighboring gang at the local lovers lane, Sleepy Lagoon, the 38th Street Gang gets into a fight at a party, where a young man is murdered.  Discriminated against for their [[zoot suit]]-wearing Chicano identity, twenty-two members of the 38th Street Gang are placed on trial for the murder, found guilty, and sentenced to life in [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]] prison.  Meanwhile, in [[Los Angeles]], Henry's brother Rudy is beaten and stripped of his zoot suit during the Zoot Suit Riots.\n\nThrough the efforts of George and other lawyers, as well as activist-reporter Alice, with whom Henry has a brief romantic encounter, the boys win their court appeal and are freed.  The play ends with a Reyna family reunion as Henry returns home and Rudy is about to leave to join the Marines. The scene suggests that it is not the happy ending we expect, however, as multiple endings of Henry's story are suggested: that he returned to prison and drug abuse, died in the [[Korean War|war in Korea]] and was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously, or married Della and had five children.<ref name=BedfordDrama/>\n\n==Characters==\n* El [[Pachuco]]: an allegorical character of the [[Chicano]] sub-culture of the same name.\n* Henry Reyna: leader of the 38th Street Gang\n* Enrique Reyna: Henry's father\n* Dolores Reyna: Henry's mother\n* Lupe Reyna: Henry's sister\n* Rudy Reyna: Henry's brother\n* George Shearer: lawyer for Henry and the 38th Street boys\n* Alice Bloomfield: reporter and activist for Henry's case, as well as a brief love interest of Henry's\n* Della Barrios: 38th Street Gang member and Henry's girlfriend\n* The 38th Street Gang: includes Smiley Torres, Joey Castro, Tommy Roberts, Elena Torres, and Bertha Villarreal\n* Rafas: leader of the Downey Gang, rival to the 38th Street Gang\n* Downey Gang: include Ragman, Hobo, Cholo, Zooter, Guera, Hoba, Blondie, and Little Blue\n* Lieutenant Edwards and Sergeant Smith: detectives\n* Members of the Press:  includes Press (who doubles as the prosecution), Cub Reporter, and Newsboy\n* The Court: includes Judge F.

On August 1, 1942 Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz was at a birthday party at the Williams Ranch.  A disturbance occurred around 11:00&nbsp;p.m. when a group of twenty white men from the Downey suburb arrived uninvited, complaining about a lack of beer.  The group from Downey Gang were kicked out of the party after demanding more beer.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of men and women from 39th street drove their cars to the nearby swimming hole and lovers lane, dubbed \"Sleepy Lagoon,\" also on the Williams Ranch.  Among the group were Henry Leyvas and his girlfriend Dora Baca, from whom the characters Henry Reyna and Della are contrived.  Also with them was friend Bobby Telles. As the group socialized, three men pulled up and began yelling insults, met equally with words from Leyvas.  The three drove off.  The 38th street group wandered off until they heard a commotion from the parked cars, where Leyvas and Baca remained.  A group of about sixteen men from the Downey gang were beating Leyvas and Baca, prompting members of the 38th street group to defend their friends. After the Downey group left, the group from 38th street gang left to gather more of their group, prior to returning to the Williams Ranch.\n\nThe group arrived at Sleepy Lagoon around 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on the morning of the 2nd, to find no one, so someone suggested the Downey gang had moved to the party at the bunkhouse nearby at the Williams Ranch.  At the party, the Downey gang was not to be found.  Yet, somehow a fight broke out between the party goers and the 38th street gang.  The fight was brief, ending when someone yelled the police were coming.  In the aftermath of the fight, the party-throwers, the Delgadillos, discovered the body of Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz along the road, who had left the party shortly before the 38th street group arrived.  His pockets were turned inside out.  He was rushed to a hospital where he died an hour and a half after admission, with a concussion and two stab wounds.  The circumstances around D\u00edaz's death still remain undetermined.<ref name=Pagan>{{cite book|last1=Pagan|first1=Eduardo Obregon|title=Murder at the Sleepy Lagoon : Zoot Suits, Race, and Riot in Wartime L.A.|date=2003|publisher=U of North Carolina P|location=Chapel Hill, NC}}</ref>\n\n===''The People v. Zammora et al.''===\nIn the process of investigating the murder of Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, hundreds of young men and women in the L.A. area were brought in for police processing.  Among the suspects arrested, several were severely beaten during questioning, including Henry Leyvas, Lupe Leyvas, Benny Alvarez, and Eugene Carpio, and Manuel Reyes. Twenty-two men were placed on trial as a group, under the defense of seven attorneys in ''the People v. Zammora et al.''  George Shibley later joined as an attorney on the case, winning favor from the defendants and their families for his attempts to communicate in Spanish.  Alice McGrath was hired by Shibley to take notes on the trial.  Though the murder weapon was never produced, after six days of deliberation, only five of the twenty-two young men were found \"not guilty.\"  The other seventeen young men were convicted of murdering Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, including Henry Leyvas, who with Jos\u00e9 Ru\u00edz and Robert Telles, was convicted of murder in the first degree and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill.  Leyvas, Ru\u00edz, and Telles were sentenced to life in prison, while the other young men were sentenced to one to five years.\n\nThe ruling was reversed in October 1944 and the men were released, due to the efforts of the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee, with Alice McGrath as executive secretary.  However, many of the young men returned to prison, including Henry Leyvas.<ref name=Pagan/>\n\n===The Zoot Suit Riots===\nWith rising tension between the zoot suiters and military servicemen in the L.A. area, what is known as the Zoot Suit Riots began on June 3, 1943 when a group of sailors claimed to have been robbed and beaten by Pachucos.<ref name=Chiodo>{{cite journal|last1=Chiodo|first1=John J.|title=The Zoot Suit Riots: Exploring Social Issues in American History|journal=Social Studies|date=2013|volume=104|issue=1|page=1}}</ref>  Provoked by a Nazi salute, servicemen beat zoot suit wearing civilians with clubs and other makeshift weapons, and stripped them of their suits.

A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it (usually industrial or agricultural) has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as [[floods]], prolonged [[drought]]s, government actions, uncontrolled [[lawlessness]], [[war]], [[pollution]], or [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear disasters]]. The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighbourhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in past years; for example, those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction.<ref name=Baker/>\n\nSome ghost towns, especially those that preserve period-specific architecture, have become tourist attractions. Some examples are [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] in the United States, [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] in Canada, [[Craco]] in Italy, [[Kolmanskop]] in Namibia, [[Pripyat]] in Ukraine, and [[Danushkodi]] in India.\n\nThe town of [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]] on the Caribbean island of [[Montserrat]] is a ghost town that is the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of Montserrat. It was rendered uninhabitable by volcanic ash from an eruption of the [[Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe definition of a ghost town varies between individuals, and between cultures. Some writers discount settlements that were abandoned as a result of a natural or human-made disaster or other causes using the term only to describe settlements that were deserted because they were no longer economically viable; T. Lindsey Baker, author of ''Ghost Towns of Texas'', defines a ghost town as \"a town for which the reason for being no longer exists\".<ref name=Baker>{{cite book |last=Baker |first= T.

American author Lambert Florin's defined a ghost town as \"a shadowy semblance of a former self\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Shawn|title=Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of Southern Nevada|year=2010|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738570125|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHLCS4HNjuQC&pg=PA7}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons for abandonment==\nFactors leading to the abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources, economic activity shifting elsewhere, railroads and roads bypassing or no longer accessing the town, human intervention, disasters, massacres, wars, and the shifting of politics or fall of empires.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Graves |first1=Philip |last2=Weiler |first2=Stephan |last3=Tynon |first3=Emily |ssrn=1540770 |title=The Economics of Ghost Towns|publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=25 January 2010}}</ref> A town can also be abandoned when it is part of an [[exclusion zone]] due to [[Plymouth, Montserrat|natural]] or [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|man-made causes]].\n\n===Economic activity shifting elsewhere===\n[[File:Abandoned farmhouse, overgrown.jpg|thumb|right|As farms [[Intensive farming|industrialize]], smaller farms are no longer economically viable, leading to rural decay.]]\n\nGhost towns may result when the single activity or resource that created a [[boomtown]] (e.g., nearby mine, mill or resort) is depleted or the resource economy undergoes a \"bust\" (e.g., catastrophic resource price collapse). Boomtowns can often decrease in size as fast as they initially grew. Sometimes, all or nearly the entire population can desert the town, resulting in a ghost town.\n\nThe dismantling of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays will create a temporary community to service a mine site, building all the accommodations, shops and services required, and then remove them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings can be used to facilitate the process. A [[gold rush]] would often bring intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.\n\nIn some cases, multiple factors may remove the economic basis for a community; some former [[mining town]]s on [[U.S. Route 66]] suffered both mine closures when the resources were depleted and loss of highway traffic as US 66 was diverted away from places like [[Oatman, Arizona]] onto a more direct path. Mine and pulp mill closures have led to many ghost towns in British Columbia, Canada including several relatively recent ones: [[Ocean Falls]] which closed in 1973 after the pulp mill was decommissioned, [[Kitsault]] B.C. whose molybdenum mine shut down after only 18 months in 1982, and [[Cassiar, British Columbia|Cassiar]] whose asbestos mine operated from 1952 to 1992.\n\nIn other cases, the reason for abandonment can arise from a town's intended economic function shifting to another, nearby place. This happened to [[Collingwood, Queensland]] in [[Outback]] [[Australia]] when nearby [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]] outperformed Collingwood as a regional centre for the livestock-raising industry. The railway reached Winton in 1899, linking it with the rest of [[Queensland]], and Collingwood was a ghost town by the following year.\n\nThe Middle East has many ghost towns that were created when the shifting of politics or the fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically unviable, such as [[Ctesiphon]].\n\nThe rise of condominium investment and a resulting real estate bubble may also lead to a ghost town, as real estate prices rise and affordable housing becomes less available. Such examples include China and Canada, where housing is often used as an investment rather than for habitation.<!---What does that first clause mean?--->\n\n===Human intervention===\n[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Prior to the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], now falling into ruin, once was a modern tourist area.]]\n\nRailroads and roads bypassing or no longer reaching a town can also create a ghost town. This was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario's historic [[Opeongo Line]], and along [[U.S. Route 66]] after motorists bypassed the latter on the faster moving highways [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Interstate 40|I-40]]. Some ghost towns were founded along railways where [[steam train]]s would stop at periodic intervals to take on water. [[Amboy, California]] was part of one such series of villages along the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] across the [[Mojave Desert]].\n\nRiver re-routing is another factor, one example being the towns along the [[Aral Sea]].\n\nGhost towns may be created when land is [[eminent domain|expropriated]] by a government, and residents are required to relocate. One example is the village of [[Tyneham]] in [[Dorset]], England, acquired during World War II to build an artillery range.\n\nA similar situation occurred in the U.S. when [[NASA]] acquired land to construct the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] (SSC), a rocket testing facility in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] (on the Mississippi side of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]], which is the [[Mississippi]]\u2013[[Louisiana]] state line). This required NASA to acquire a large (approximately {{convert|34|sqmi|adj=on}}) [[buffer zone]] because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing such rockets. Five thinly populated rural Mississippi communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth ([[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]]), along with 700 families in residence, had to be completely relocated away from the facility.\n\n[[File:Akarmaraghosttown.jpg|thumb|[[Akarmara]], a [[mining town]] in [[Abkhazia]]/[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], was abandoned in the early 1990s due to the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u201393)|War in Abkhazia]].]]\nSometimes the town might cease to officially exist, but the physical infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities that had to be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room schoolhouse. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of [[Weston, DuPage County, Illinois|Weston, Illinois]], that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off at the edges of the property, with gatehouses or barricades to prevent unsupervised access.\n\n====Flooding by dams====\nConstruction of dams has produced ghost towns that have been left underwater. Examples include the settlement of [[Loyston, Tennessee]], U.S., inundated by the creation of [[Norris Dam]]. The town was reorganised and reconstructed on nearby higher ground. Other examples are [[The Lost Villages]] of [[Ontario]] flooded by [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] construction in 1958, the hamlets of [[Nether Hambleton]] and [[Middle Hambleton]] in [[Rutland]], England, which were flooded to create [[Rutland Water]], and the villages of [[Ashopton]] and [[Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent]], England, flooded during the construction of the [[Ladybower Reservoir]]. [[Mologa]] in Russia was flooded by the creation of [[Rybinsk reservoir]], and in France the [[Tignes Dam]] flooded the village of Tignes, displacing 78 families.{{Citation needed|reason=The wiki page for this dam does not mention and therefore does not cite the number of displaced families|date=June 2019}} Many ancient villages had to be abandoned during construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, leading to the displacement of many rural people. In the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste, the town of [[Lake Arenal|Arenal]] was rebuilt to make room for the man-made [[Lake Arenal]]. The old town now lies submerged below the lake. [[Old Adaminaby]] was flooded by a dam of the [[Snowy River Scheme]]. Construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] on the [[Nile River]] in Egypt submerged archaeological sites and ancient settlements such as [[Buhen]] under [[Lake Nasser]]. Another example of towns left underwater is [[Tehri]]; by the construction of the [[Tehri Dam]] in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]].\n\n====Massacres====\nSome towns become deserted when their populations are [[massacre]]d. The original French village at [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was destroyed on [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|10 June 1944]] when 642 of its 663 inhabitants were killed by a German [[Waffen-SS]] company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site, and the ruins of the original have been maintained as a memorial.\n\n===Disasters, actual and anticipated===\n[[File:Craco0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Craco]], Italy, was abandoned due to a landslide in 1963. Now it is a popular film set.]]\nNatural and man-made disasters can create ghost towns. For example, after being flooded more than 30 times since their town was founded in 1845, residents of [[Pattonsburg, Missouri]], decided to relocate after two floods in 1993. With government help, the whole town was rebuilt {{convert|3|mi}} away.\n\n[[Craco]], a medieval village in the Italian region of [[Basilicata]], was evacuated after a landslide in 1963. Nowadays it is a famous filming location for many movies, including ''[[The Passion of The Christ]]'' by [[Mel Gibson]], ''[[Christ Stopped at Eboli (film)|Christ Stopped at Eboli]]'' by [[Francesco Rosi]], ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' by [[Catherine Hardwicke]] and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' by [[Marc Forster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Craco,%20Matera,%20Basilicata,%20Italy&ref_=ttloc_loc_14|title=Most Popular Titles With Location Matching \"Craco, Matera, Basilicata, Italy\"|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] was abandoned due to an uncontainable [[mine fire]], which began in 1962 and still rages to this day; eventually the fire reached an abandoned mine underneath the nearby town of [[Byrnesville, Pennsylvania]], which caused that mine to catch on fire too and forced the evacuation of that town as well.\n\n[[File:Pripyat-today.jpg|thumb|[[Prypiat|Pripyat]], Ukraine, was abandoned after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].]]\nGhost towns may also occasionally come into being due to an ''anticipated'' natural disaster \u2013 for example, the Canadian town of [[Lemieux, Ontario]] was abandoned in 1991 after soil testing revealed that the community was built on an unstable bed of [[Leda clay]]. Two years after the last building in Lemieux was demolished, a landslide swept part of the former town-site into the [[South Nation River]]. Two decades earlier, the Canadian town of [[Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec|Saint-Jean-Vianney]], Qu\u00e9bec, also constructed on a Leda clay base, had been abandoned after a landslide on 4 May 1971, which swept away 41 homes, killing 31 people.\n\nFollowing the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, dangerously high levels of nuclear contamination escaped into the surrounding area, and nearly 200 towns and villages in [[Ukraine]] and neighbouring [[Belarus]] were evacuated, including the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]]. The area was so contaminated that many of the evacuees were never permitted to return to their homes. Pripyat is the most famous of these abandoned towns; it was built for the workers of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and had a population of almost 50,000 at the time of the disaster.<ref name=chernobyl>{{cite book|last=Mould|first=R.

Some notable examples are [[Times Beach, Missouri]], whose residents were exposed to a high level of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], and [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]], [[Western Australia]], which was once Australia's largest source of [[blue asbestos]], but was shut down in 1966 due to health concerns.

Contamination due to [[ammunition]] caused by military use may also lead to the development of ghost towns. [[Tyneham]], in [[Dorset]], was requisitioned for military exercises during the [[Second World War]], and remains unpopulated, being littered with unexploded munitions from regular shelling.\n\n==Revived ghost towns==\n\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Walhalla 1910 view4.jpg\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = Walhalla township in 1910\n| caption1  = Walhalla township in 1910\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = WalhallaVicCorner.jpg\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = Walhalla township in 2004\n| caption2  = Part of Walhalla in 2004, showing a mix of original and reconstructed buildings\n<!-- Extra parameters -->\n| header            = \n| header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| header_background = \n| footer            = [[Walhalla, Victoria]] was almost abandoned after being mined for gold, but is now becoming repopulated.\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background = \n| background color  = \n}}\n\nA few ghost towns get a second life, often due to [[heritage tourism]] generating a new economy able to support residents.

Since most of these camps were abandoned in the 1950s, the towns were abandoned as well. One such town is located near the former Gulag camp called [[Butugychag]] (also called Lower Butugychag). Other towns were deserted due to deindustrialisation and the economic crises of the early 1990s attributed to [[post-Soviet conflicts]] \u2013 one example being [[Tkvarcheli]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], a coal mining town that suffered a drastic population decline as a result of the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u20131993)|War in Abkhazia]] in the early 1990s.\n\n===Antarctica===\n[[File:Deception-Base.jpg|thumb|The derelict British base in Whalers Bay, [[Deception Island]], destroyed by a volcanic eruption]]\nThe oldest ghost town in [[Antarctica]] is on [[Deception Island]], where in 1906, a Norwegian-Chilean company set up a whaling station at Whalers Bay, which they used as a base for their factory ship, the ''Gobernador Bories''.

Some other depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts, such as [[K\u00e1n, Hungary|K\u00e1n]], [[Tornak\u00e1polna]], [[Szanticska]], [[Gorica, Hungary|Gorica]], and [[R\u00e9vfalu]].\n\nIn Spain, large zones of the mountainous [[Iberian System]] and the [[Pyrenees]] have undergone heavy depopulation since the early 20th century, leaving a string of ghost towns in areas such as the [[Solana Valley]]. Traditional agricultural practices such as sheep and goat rearing, on which the mountain village economy was based, were not taken over by the local youth, especially after the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |title=Sos Mundo Rural Aragon\u00e9s alerta de la despoblaci\u00f3n de los pueblos |publisher=Diario de Teruel |language=Spanish |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315150215/http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |archive-date=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, thousands of villages were abandoned during the Middle Ages, as a result of [[Black Death]], climate change, revolts, and [[enclosure]], the process by which vast amounts of farmland became privately owned. Since there are rarely any visible remains of these settlements, they are not generally considered ghost towns; instead, they are referred to in archaeological circles as [[deserted medieval village]]s.\n\nSometimes, wars and genocide end a town's life. In 1944, occupying German Waffen-SS troops murdered almost the entire population of the French village [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]. A new settlement was built nearby after the war, but the old town was left depopulated on the orders of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], as a permanent memorial. In Germany, numerous smaller towns and villages in the [[former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]] were completely destroyed in the last two years of the war. These territories later became part of [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and many of the smaller settlements were never rebuilt or repopulated, for example [[K\u0142omino]] (''Westfalenhof''), [[Pstr\u0105\u017ce]] (''Pstransse''), and [[Janowa G\u00f3ra]] (''Johannesberg''). Some villages in England were also abandoned during the war, but for different reasons. [[Imber]], on [[Salisbury Plain]], and  several villages in the [[Stanford Battle Area]], were commandeered by the [[War Office]] for use as training grounds for British and US troops. Although this was intended to be a temporary measure, the residents were never allowed to return, and the villages have been used for military training ever since. Three miles southeast of Imber is [[Copehill Down]], a deserted village purpose-built for training in [[urban warfare]].\n\nDisasters have played a part in the abandonment of settlements within Europe. After the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]] were evacuated due to dangerous radiation levels within the area. As of today, Pripyat remains completely abandoned, and Chernobyl has around 500 remaining inhabitants.\n\n===North America===\n[[File:RobsartHospital.jpg|thumb|[[Robsart Hospital]], one of many abandoned buildings in [[Robsart, Saskatchewan]]]]\n\n====Canada====\n{{See also|Lists of ghost towns in Canada}}\nThere are ghost towns in parts of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Quebec]]. Some were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often [[company town|developed at the behest of the company]]. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most ghost towns were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The ghost towns in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.<ref>Ramsey, Bruce (1963\u20131975). ''Ghost Towns of British Columbia\". Vancouver: Mitchell Press.</ref> Among the most notable are [[Anyox]], [[Kitsault]], and [[Ocean Falls]].\n\nSome ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]]. Barkerville, once the largest town north of [[Kamloops]], is now a year-round provincial museum. In Quebec, [[Val-Jalbert, Quebec|Val-Jalbert]] is a well-known tourist ghost town; founded in 1901 around a mechanical [[pulp mill]] that became obsolete when [[paper mill]]s began to break down [[wood fibre]] by chemical means, it was abandoned when the mill closed in 1927 and re-opened as a park in 1960.\n{{clear left}}\n\n====United States====\n{{See also|List of ghost towns in the United States}}\n[[File:A363, Rhyolite, Nevada, USA, John S Cook and Company building, 2004.jpg|thumb|Cook Bank building in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], a gold mining town]]\nMany ghost towns or abandoned [[unincorporated area|communities]] exist in the American [[Great Plains]], the rural areas of which have lost a third of their population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]] became railroad ghost towns when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds of towns were abandoned when the [[Interstate highway system]] replaced the railroads as the favored mode of travel. Ghost towns are common in mining or [[mill town]]s in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents are compelled to leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually consumed. Some unincorporated towns become ghost towns due to flooding caused by dam projects that created man{{endash}}made lakes, such as [[Oketeyeconne, Georgia|Oketeyeconne]].\n\nSometimes a ghost town consists of many abandoned buildings as in [[Bodie, California]], or standing ruins as in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in [[Graysonia, Arkansas]]. Old mining camps that have lost most of their population at some stage of their history such as [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Oatman, Arizona|Oatman]], [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] are sometimes referred to as ghost towns although they are presently active towns and cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Many U.S. ghost towns, such as [[South Pass City, Wyoming|South Pass City in Wyoming]]<ref>Weis, Norman D.

In 1590, mapmaker [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] arrived at the [[Roanoke Colony]], North Carolina to find it deserted, its inhabitants having vanished without a trace. The [[Zwaanendael Colony]] became a ghost town when every one of the colonists was massacred by Indians in 1632. [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, was abandoned when [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] became the new capital of the colony in 1699. <!-- Consider removing this paragraph, off topic -->\n\nStarting in 2002, an attempt to declare an official ghost town in California stalled when the adherents of the town of [[Bodie, California|Bodie]] and those of [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico]], in [[Southern California]], could not agree on the most deserving settlement for the recognition. A compromise was eventually reached\u2013Bodie became the official state [[gold rush]] ghost town, while Calico was named the official state [[silver rush]] ghost town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/towns/ca_gold_rush_ghost_town.htm |title=California State Gold Rush Ghost Town |publisher=NetState |accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===South America===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a wave of European immigrants arrived in Brazil and settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Other ghost towns were created in the aftermath of dinosaur fossil rushes.\n\nA number of ghost towns throughout South America were once mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] mining camps that prospered in Chile from the end of the [[War of the Pacific|Saltpeter War]] until the invention of synthetic saltpeter during World War I. Some of these towns, such as the [[Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works]] in the [[Atacama Desert]], have been declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. Another former mining town, [[Real de Catorce]] in Mexico, has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood movies such as ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), ''[[The Mexican]]'' (2001), and ''[[Bandidas]]'' (2006).\n\n===Oceania===\nThe boom and bust of gold rushes and the mining of other ores has led to a number of ghost towns in both Australia and New Zealand. Other towns have become abandoned whether due to natural disasters, the weather, or the drowning of valleys to increase the size of lakes.\n\nIn Australia, the [[Victoria gold rush]] led to numerous ghost towns (such as [[Cassilis, Victoria|Cassilis]] and [[Moliagul]]), as did the hunt for gold in [[Western Australia]] (for example, the towns of [[Ora Banda]] and [[Kanowna, Western Australia|Kanowna]]). The mining of iron and other ores has also led to towns thriving briefly before dwindling. \n\nIn New Zealand, the [[Otago gold rush]] similarly led to several ghost towns (such as [[Macetown]]). New Zealand's ghost towns also include numerous coal mining areas in the South Island's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast Region]], including [[Denniston, New Zealand|Denniston]] and [[Stockton, New Zealand|Stockton]]. Natural disasters have also led to the loss of some towns, notably [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]], \"The Buried Village\", destroyed in the [[1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera]], and the Otago town of [[Kelso, New Zealand|Kelso]], abandoned after it was flooded repeatedly after heavy rainstorms. Early settlements on the rugged southwest coast of the South Island at [[Martins Bay]] and [[Port Craig]] were also abandoned, mainly due to the inhospitable terrain.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Abandoned mine#Abandoned mines|Abandoned mine]]\n*[[Abandoned village]]\n*[[Exclusion zone]]\n*[[List of ghost towns by country]]\n*[[Modern ruins]]\n*[[Old field (ecology)]]\n*[[Phantom settlement]]\n*[[Unused highway]]\n*[[Urban decay]]\n*[[Urban exploration]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- This section holds references that are cited by this article -->\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=T.

A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it (usually industrial or agricultural) has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as [[floods]], prolonged [[drought]]s, government actions, uncontrolled [[lawlessness]], [[war]], [[pollution]], or [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear disasters]]. The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighbourhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in past years; for example, those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction.<ref name=Baker/>\n\nSome ghost towns, especially those that preserve period-specific architecture, have become tourist attractions. Some examples are [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] in the United States, [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] in Canada, [[Craco]] in Italy, [[Kolmanskop]] in Namibia, [[Pripyat]] in Ukraine, and [[Danushkodi]] in India.\n\nThe town of [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]] on the Caribbean island of [[Montserrat]] is a ghost town that is the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of Montserrat. It was rendered uninhabitable by volcanic ash from an eruption of the [[Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe definition of a ghost town varies between individuals, and between cultures. Some writers discount settlements that were abandoned as a result of a natural or human-made disaster or other causes using the term only to describe settlements that were deserted because they were no longer economically viable; T. Lindsey Baker, author of ''Ghost Towns of Texas'', defines a ghost town as \"a town for which the reason for being no longer exists\".<ref name=Baker>{{cite book |last=Baker |first= T.

American author Lambert Florin's defined a ghost town as \"a shadowy semblance of a former self\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Shawn|title=Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of Southern Nevada|year=2010|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738570125|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHLCS4HNjuQC&pg=PA7}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons for abandonment==\nFactors leading to the abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources, economic activity shifting elsewhere, railroads and roads bypassing or no longer accessing the town, human intervention, disasters, massacres, wars, and the shifting of politics or fall of empires.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Graves |first1=Philip |last2=Weiler |first2=Stephan |last3=Tynon |first3=Emily |ssrn=1540770 |title=The Economics of Ghost Towns|publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=25 January 2010}}</ref> A town can also be abandoned when it is part of an [[exclusion zone]] due to [[Plymouth, Montserrat|natural]] or [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|man-made causes]].\n\n===Economic activity shifting elsewhere===\n[[File:Abandoned farmhouse, overgrown.jpg|thumb|right|As farms [[Intensive farming|industrialize]], smaller farms are no longer economically viable, leading to rural decay.]]\n\nGhost towns may result when the single activity or resource that created a [[boomtown]] (e.g., nearby mine, mill or resort) is depleted or the resource economy undergoes a \"bust\" (e.g., catastrophic resource price collapse). Boomtowns can often decrease in size as fast as they initially grew. Sometimes, all or nearly the entire population can desert the town, resulting in a ghost town.\n\nThe dismantling of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays will create a temporary community to service a mine site, building all the accommodations, shops and services required, and then remove them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings can be used to facilitate the process. A [[gold rush]] would often bring intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.\n\nIn some cases, multiple factors may remove the economic basis for a community; some former [[mining town]]s on [[U.S. Route 66]] suffered both mine closures when the resources were depleted and loss of highway traffic as US 66 was diverted away from places like [[Oatman, Arizona]] onto a more direct path. Mine and pulp mill closures have led to many ghost towns in British Columbia, Canada including several relatively recent ones: [[Ocean Falls]] which closed in 1973 after the pulp mill was decommissioned, [[Kitsault]] B.C. whose molybdenum mine shut down after only 18 months in 1982, and [[Cassiar, British Columbia|Cassiar]] whose asbestos mine operated from 1952 to 1992.\n\nIn other cases, the reason for abandonment can arise from a town's intended economic function shifting to another, nearby place. This happened to [[Collingwood, Queensland]] in [[Outback]] [[Australia]] when nearby [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]] outperformed Collingwood as a regional centre for the livestock-raising industry. The railway reached Winton in 1899, linking it with the rest of [[Queensland]], and Collingwood was a ghost town by the following year.\n\nThe Middle East has many ghost towns that were created when the shifting of politics or the fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically unviable, such as [[Ctesiphon]].\n\nThe rise of condominium investment and a resulting real estate bubble may also lead to a ghost town, as real estate prices rise and affordable housing becomes less available. Such examples include China and Canada, where housing is often used as an investment rather than for habitation.<!---What does that first clause mean?--->\n\n===Human intervention===\n[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Prior to the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], now falling into ruin, once was a modern tourist area.]]\n\nRailroads and roads bypassing or no longer reaching a town can also create a ghost town. This was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario's historic [[Opeongo Line]], and along [[U.S. Route 66]] after motorists bypassed the latter on the faster moving highways [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Interstate 40|I-40]]. Some ghost towns were founded along railways where [[steam train]]s would stop at periodic intervals to take on water. [[Amboy, California]] was part of one such series of villages along the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] across the [[Mojave Desert]].\n\nRiver re-routing is another factor, one example being the towns along the [[Aral Sea]].\n\nGhost towns may be created when land is [[eminent domain|expropriated]] by a government, and residents are required to relocate. One example is the village of [[Tyneham]] in [[Dorset]], England, acquired during World War II to build an artillery range.\n\nA similar situation occurred in the U.S. when [[NASA]] acquired land to construct the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] (SSC), a rocket testing facility in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] (on the Mississippi side of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]], which is the [[Mississippi]]\u2013[[Louisiana]] state line). This required NASA to acquire a large (approximately {{convert|34|sqmi|adj=on}}) [[buffer zone]] because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing such rockets. Five thinly populated rural Mississippi communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth ([[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]]), along with 700 families in residence, had to be completely relocated away from the facility.\n\n[[File:Akarmaraghosttown.jpg|thumb|[[Akarmara]], a [[mining town]] in [[Abkhazia]]/[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], was abandoned in the early 1990s due to the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u201393)|War in Abkhazia]].]]\nSometimes the town might cease to officially exist, but the physical infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities that had to be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room schoolhouse. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of [[Weston, DuPage County, Illinois|Weston, Illinois]], that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off at the edges of the property, with gatehouses or barricades to prevent unsupervised access.\n\n====Flooding by dams====\nConstruction of dams has produced ghost towns that have been left underwater. Examples include the settlement of [[Loyston, Tennessee]], U.S., inundated by the creation of [[Norris Dam]]. The town was reorganised and reconstructed on nearby higher ground. Other examples are [[The Lost Villages]] of [[Ontario]] flooded by [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] construction in 1958, the hamlets of [[Nether Hambleton]] and [[Middle Hambleton]] in [[Rutland]], England, which were flooded to create [[Rutland Water]], and the villages of [[Ashopton]] and [[Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent]], England, flooded during the construction of the [[Ladybower Reservoir]]. [[Mologa]] in Russia was flooded by the creation of [[Rybinsk reservoir]], and in France the [[Tignes Dam]] flooded the village of Tignes, displacing 78 families.{{Citation needed|reason=The wiki page for this dam does not mention and therefore does not cite the number of displaced families|date=June 2019}} Many ancient villages had to be abandoned during construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, leading to the displacement of many rural people. In the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste, the town of [[Lake Arenal|Arenal]] was rebuilt to make room for the man-made [[Lake Arenal]]. The old town now lies submerged below the lake. [[Old Adaminaby]] was flooded by a dam of the [[Snowy River Scheme]]. Construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] on the [[Nile River]] in Egypt submerged archaeological sites and ancient settlements such as [[Buhen]] under [[Lake Nasser]]. Another example of towns left underwater is [[Tehri]]; by the construction of the [[Tehri Dam]] in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]].\n\n====Massacres====\nSome towns become deserted when their populations are [[massacre]]d. The original French village at [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was destroyed on [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|10 June 1944]] when 642 of its 663 inhabitants were killed by a German [[Waffen-SS]] company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site, and the ruins of the original have been maintained as a memorial.\n\n===Disasters, actual and anticipated===\n[[File:Craco0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Craco]], Italy, was abandoned due to a landslide in 1963. Now it is a popular film set.]]\nNatural and man-made disasters can create ghost towns. For example, after being flooded more than 30 times since their town was founded in 1845, residents of [[Pattonsburg, Missouri]], decided to relocate after two floods in 1993. With government help, the whole town was rebuilt {{convert|3|mi}} away.\n\n[[Craco]], a medieval village in the Italian region of [[Basilicata]], was evacuated after a landslide in 1963. Nowadays it is a famous filming location for many movies, including ''[[The Passion of The Christ]]'' by [[Mel Gibson]], ''[[Christ Stopped at Eboli (film)|Christ Stopped at Eboli]]'' by [[Francesco Rosi]], ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' by [[Catherine Hardwicke]] and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' by [[Marc Forster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Craco,%20Matera,%20Basilicata,%20Italy&ref_=ttloc_loc_14|title=Most Popular Titles With Location Matching \"Craco, Matera, Basilicata, Italy\"|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] was abandoned due to an uncontainable [[mine fire]], which began in 1962 and still rages to this day; eventually the fire reached an abandoned mine underneath the nearby town of [[Byrnesville, Pennsylvania]], which caused that mine to catch on fire too and forced the evacuation of that town as well.\n\n[[File:Pripyat-today.jpg|thumb|[[Prypiat|Pripyat]], Ukraine, was abandoned after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].]]\nGhost towns may also occasionally come into being due to an ''anticipated'' natural disaster \u2013 for example, the Canadian town of [[Lemieux, Ontario]] was abandoned in 1991 after soil testing revealed that the community was built on an unstable bed of [[Leda clay]]. Two years after the last building in Lemieux was demolished, a landslide swept part of the former town-site into the [[South Nation River]]. Two decades earlier, the Canadian town of [[Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec|Saint-Jean-Vianney]], Qu\u00e9bec, also constructed on a Leda clay base, had been abandoned after a landslide on 4 May 1971, which swept away 41 homes, killing 31 people.\n\nFollowing the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, dangerously high levels of nuclear contamination escaped into the surrounding area, and nearly 200 towns and villages in [[Ukraine]] and neighbouring [[Belarus]] were evacuated, including the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]].

It was destroyed during the [[1964 Rameswaram cyclone]] and remains uninhabited in the aftermath.\n\nMany abandoned towns and settlements in the former [[Soviet Union]] were established near [[Gulag]] concentration camps to supply necessary services. Since most of these camps were abandoned in the 1950s, the towns were abandoned as well. One such town is located near the former Gulag camp called [[Butugychag]] (also called Lower Butugychag). Other towns were deserted due to deindustrialisation and the economic crises of the early 1990s attributed to [[post-Soviet conflicts]] \u2013 one example being [[Tkvarcheli]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], a coal mining town that suffered a drastic population decline as a result of the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u20131993)|War in Abkhazia]] in the early 1990s.\n\n===Antarctica===\n[[File:Deception-Base.jpg|thumb|The derelict British base in Whalers Bay, [[Deception Island]], destroyed by a volcanic eruption]]\nThe oldest ghost town in [[Antarctica]] is on [[Deception Island]], where in 1906, a Norwegian-Chilean company set up a whaling station at Whalers Bay, which they used as a base for their factory ship, the ''Gobernador Bories''. Other whaling operations followed suit, and by 1914 there were thirteen factory ships based there. The station ceased to be profitable during the [[Great Depression]], and was abandoned in 1931. In 1969, the station was partially destroyed by a volcanic eruption. There are also many abandoned scientific and military bases in Antarctica, especially in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].\n\nThe Antarctic island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] used to have several thriving whaling settlements during the first half of the 20th century, with a combined population exceeding 2,000 in some years. These included [[Grytviken]] (operating 1904\u201364), [[Leith Harbour]] (1909\u201365), [[Ocean Harbour]] (1909\u201320), [[Husvik]] (1910\u201360), [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]] (1912\u201361) and [[Prince Olav Harbour]] (1917\u201334). The abandoned settlements have become increasingly dilapidated, and remain uninhabited nowadays except for the Museum curator's family at Grytviken. The jetty, the church, dwellings and industrial buildings at Grytviken have recently been renovated by the South Georgian Government, becoming a popular tourist destination. Some historical buildings in the other settlements are being restored as well.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Oradour-sur-Glane-Streets-1294.jpg|thumb|Main street of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]], France, unchanged since the German massacre.]]\n[[Urbanization]] \u2013 the migration of a country's rural population into the cities \u2013 has left many European towns and villages deserted.

The first village officially declared as \"dead\" was [[:hu:Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171|Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171]] in the late 1970s, but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Some other depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts, such as [[K\u00e1n, Hungary|K\u00e1n]], [[Tornak\u00e1polna]], [[Szanticska]], [[Gorica, Hungary|Gorica]], and [[R\u00e9vfalu]].\n\nIn Spain, large zones of the mountainous [[Iberian System]] and the [[Pyrenees]] have undergone heavy depopulation since the early 20th century, leaving a string of ghost towns in areas such as the [[Solana Valley]]. Traditional agricultural practices such as sheep and goat rearing, on which the mountain village economy was based, were not taken over by the local youth, especially after the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |title=Sos Mundo Rural Aragon\u00e9s alerta de la despoblaci\u00f3n de los pueblos |publisher=Diario de Teruel |language=Spanish |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315150215/http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |archive-date=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, thousands of villages were abandoned during the Middle Ages, as a result of [[Black Death]], climate change, revolts, and [[enclosure]], the process by which vast amounts of farmland became privately owned. Since there are rarely any visible remains of these settlements, they are not generally considered ghost towns; instead, they are referred to in archaeological circles as [[deserted medieval village]]s.\n\nSometimes, wars and genocide end a town's life. In 1944, occupying German Waffen-SS troops murdered almost the entire population of the French village [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]. A new settlement was built nearby after the war, but the old town was left depopulated on the orders of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], as a permanent memorial. In Germany, numerous smaller towns and villages in the [[former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]] were completely destroyed in the last two years of the war. These territories later became part of [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and many of the smaller settlements were never rebuilt or repopulated, for example [[K\u0142omino]] (''Westfalenhof''), [[Pstr\u0105\u017ce]] (''Pstransse''), and [[Janowa G\u00f3ra]] (''Johannesberg''). Some villages in England were also abandoned during the war, but for different reasons. [[Imber]], on [[Salisbury Plain]], and  several villages in the [[Stanford Battle Area]], were commandeered by the [[War Office]] for use as training grounds for British and US troops. Although this was intended to be a temporary measure, the residents were never allowed to return, and the villages have been used for military training ever since. Three miles southeast of Imber is [[Copehill Down]], a deserted village purpose-built for training in [[urban warfare]].\n\nDisasters have played a part in the abandonment of settlements within Europe. After the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]] were evacuated due to dangerous radiation levels within the area. As of today, Pripyat remains completely abandoned, and Chernobyl has around 500 remaining inhabitants.\n\n===North America===\n[[File:RobsartHospital.jpg|thumb|[[Robsart Hospital]], one of many abandoned buildings in [[Robsart, Saskatchewan]]]]\n\n====Canada====\n{{See also|Lists of ghost towns in Canada}}\nThere are ghost towns in parts of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Quebec]]. Some were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often [[company town|developed at the behest of the company]]. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most ghost towns were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The ghost towns in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.<ref>Ramsey, Bruce (1963\u20131975). ''Ghost Towns of British Columbia\". Vancouver: Mitchell Press.</ref> Among the most notable are [[Anyox]], [[Kitsault]], and [[Ocean Falls]].\n\nSome ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]]. Barkerville, once the largest town north of [[Kamloops]], is now a year-round provincial museum. In Quebec, [[Val-Jalbert, Quebec|Val-Jalbert]] is a well-known tourist ghost town; founded in 1901 around a mechanical [[pulp mill]] that became obsolete when [[paper mill]]s began to break down [[wood fibre]] by chemical means, it was abandoned when the mill closed in 1927 and re-opened as a park in 1960.\n{{clear left}}\n\n====United States====\n{{See also|List of ghost towns in the United States}}\n[[File:A363, Rhyolite, Nevada, USA, John S Cook and Company building, 2004.jpg|thumb|Cook Bank building in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], a gold mining town]]\nMany ghost towns or abandoned [[unincorporated area|communities]] exist in the American [[Great Plains]], the rural areas of which have lost a third of their population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]] became railroad ghost towns when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds of towns were abandoned when the [[Interstate highway system]] replaced the railroads as the favored mode of travel. Ghost towns are common in mining or [[mill town]]s in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents are compelled to leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually consumed. Some unincorporated towns become ghost towns due to flooding caused by dam projects that created man{{endash}}made lakes, such as [[Oketeyeconne, Georgia|Oketeyeconne]].\n\nSometimes a ghost town consists of many abandoned buildings as in [[Bodie, California]], or standing ruins as in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in [[Graysonia, Arkansas]]. Old mining camps that have lost most of their population at some stage of their history such as [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Oatman, Arizona|Oatman]], [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] are sometimes referred to as ghost towns although they are presently active towns and cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Many U.S. ghost towns, such as [[South Pass City, Wyoming|South Pass City in Wyoming]]<ref>Weis, Norman D.

In 1590, mapmaker [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] arrived at the [[Roanoke Colony]], North Carolina to find it deserted, its inhabitants having vanished without a trace. The [[Zwaanendael Colony]] became a ghost town when every one of the colonists was massacred by Indians in 1632.

Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Other ghost towns were created in the aftermath of dinosaur fossil rushes.\n\nA number of ghost towns throughout South America were once mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] mining camps that prospered in Chile from the end of the [[War of the Pacific|Saltpeter War]] until the invention of synthetic saltpeter during World War I. Some of these towns, such as the [[Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works]] in the [[Atacama Desert]], have been declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. Another former mining town, [[Real de Catorce]] in Mexico, has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood movies such as ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), ''[[The Mexican]]'' (2001), and ''[[Bandidas]]'' (2006).\n\n===Oceania===\nThe boom and bust of gold rushes and the mining of other ores has led to a number of ghost towns in both Australia and New Zealand. Other towns have become abandoned whether due to natural disasters, the weather, or the drowning of valleys to increase the size of lakes.\n\nIn Australia, the [[Victoria gold rush]] led to numerous ghost towns (such as [[Cassilis, Victoria|Cassilis]] and [[Moliagul]]), as did the hunt for gold in [[Western Australia]] (for example, the towns of [[Ora Banda]] and [[Kanowna, Western Australia|Kanowna]]). The mining of iron and other ores has also led to towns thriving briefly before dwindling. \n\nIn New Zealand, the [[Otago gold rush]] similarly led to several ghost towns (such as [[Macetown]]). New Zealand's ghost towns also include numerous coal mining areas in the South Island's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast Region]], including [[Denniston, New Zealand|Denniston]] and [[Stockton, New Zealand|Stockton]]. Natural disasters have also led to the loss of some towns, notably [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]], \"The Buried Village\", destroyed in the [[1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera]], and the Otago town of [[Kelso, New Zealand|Kelso]], abandoned after it was flooded repeatedly after heavy rainstorms. Early settlements on the rugged southwest coast of the South Island at [[Martins Bay]] and [[Port Craig]] were also abandoned, mainly due to the inhospitable terrain.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Abandoned mine#Abandoned mines|Abandoned mine]]\n*[[Abandoned village]]\n*[[Exclusion zone]]\n*[[List of ghost towns by country]]\n*[[Modern ruins]]\n*[[Old field (ecology)]]\n*[[Phantom settlement]]\n*[[Unused highway]]\n*[[Urban decay]]\n*[[Urban exploration]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- This section holds references that are cited by this article -->\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=T.
