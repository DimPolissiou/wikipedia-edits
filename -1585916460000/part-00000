People with idic(15) are typically born with 47 chromosomes in  their body cells, instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is made up of a piece of chromosome 15 that has been duplicated end-to-end like a mirror image. It is the presence of this extra genetic material that is thought to account for the symptoms seen in some people with idic(15). Individuals with idic(15) have a total of four copies of this chromosome 15 region instead of the usual two copies (1 copy each on the [[maternal]] and [[paternal]] chromosomes).\n\nThe syndrome is also often referred to by the broader term '''Chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1 Duplication Syndrome''', shortened to '''Dup15q syndrome'''. Dup15q syndrome is a broader disease term, as it includes both idic(15) and interstitial 15q11.2-q13.1, another type of duplication that causes similar clinical traits.\n\nThe extra chromosome is occasionally found in the [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] state, i.e. some of the cells carry the marker chromosome. However, mostly because of the marker's instability and tendency to be lost during cell division ([[mitosis]]), some cells are completely normal with 46 chromosomes. Occasionally, cells may have more than one idic(15), resulting in 48 or 49 chromosomes in all or some of their cells. A similar clinical picture albeit to a milder degree could be expected in individuals that have the extra chromosome 15 material as an '''interstitial duplication''' (when the extra piece of chromosome 15 is included ''within'' the long arm of one of the two copies of chromosome 15, rather than as a small extra 'marker' chromosome) - often abbreviated to '''int dup(15)'''; the individual thus having 46 chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hogart |first1=Amber |last2=Wu |first2=David |last3=Lasalle |first3=Janine M. |last4=Schanen |first4=N.

Individuals with idic(15) usually have delays in language development and motor skills such as walking or sitting up. Other traits may include low muscle tone ([[hypotonia]]), [[seizures]] (>50%), short stature, and [[intellectual disability]]. Distinctive facial features associated with idic(15) - where present at all - are usually very subtle but may include [[epicanthal fold]]s ([[skin fold]]s at the inner corners of one or both eyes), downward slanting [[Palpebral fissure|palpebral fissures]], broad forehead, a flattened nasal bridge, button nose, and a high arched [[palate]] (roof of the mouth). Some individuals show other signs that can often be associated with chromosomal conditions, such as [[pectus excavatum]], or a unilateral or bilateral [[single transverse palmar crease]]. Many individuals with idic(15) display features of [[autism]], such as problems with communication and social interactions, obsessional interests (often with interactive mechanisms like wheels, doors or switches), unpredictable sleep cycles (and a reduced need for sleep), and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (e.g., lining up toys, playing with a toy in the same manner over and over again, hand flapping, rocking back and forth). Sensory processing is often affected, especially the vestibular system.  A high pain threshold is often observed.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2015.10.007 |pmid=26773682 |title=Parental-reported pain insensitivity in Dup15q |journal=Epilepsy & Behavior |volume=55 |pages=124\u20137 |year=2016 |last1=Luchsinger |first1=Kadi |last2=Lau |first2=Heather |last3=Hedlund |first3=Julie L |last4=Friedman |first4=Daniel |last5=Krushel |first5=Kara |last6=Devinsky |first6=Orrin |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc27132559eba0abb4d8adaab3f1490d9d001d29 }}</ref> If speech develops, it is often [[Echolalia|echolalic]] but some individuals do grasp some language.

In most cases, the abnormal chromosome is generated in the mother's germ cells: the [[oocyte]]s. This finding is due to [[ascertainment bias]]; cases with maternally derived idic(15) usually have clinical findings and attract attention, but those with paternally derived idic(15) usually do not. Thus, diagnosed cases are usually patients where the duplicated material is derived from the mother's egg cell rather than the father's sperm cell.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Cook E.H.

The smallest markers appear to be harmless and they may go undetected. However, if they are large enough to contain a number of important genes, they may result in \"idic(15) syndrome\" which is characterized by learning disabilities, [[autism]] and other neurological symptoms.<ref name=autogenerated2>RJ McKinlay Gardner, Grant R.

In fact, idic(15) is the most frequently identified chromosome problem in individuals with [[autism]]. (A chromosome anomaly involves extra or missing chromosomal material, not changes within the genes such as [[Fragile X syndrome]]). It is suggested that the co-occurrence of autism and idic(15) is not by chance. There may be a gene or genes in the 15q11-q13 region that is/are related to the development of autism in some individuals.\n\nGenetic research studies of individuals without chromosome anomalies also support this idea that an [[autism]]-related gene may be present in 15q11.2-q13.1 Specifically, research studies found that certain [[DNA]] markers from the (15q1.2-q13.1) region were found more often in individuals with autism than in individuals without autism. Although these DNA markers are too small to be genes, they suggest that researchers may be getting close to finding an autism gene in this region.<ref>http://www.exploringautism.org/autism/iso_chr15.htm</ref>\n\nA recent study reported the introduction of two extra copies of just a single gene present in the 15q11.2-q13.1 region, Ube3a, into mice to model the gene copy number expressed in the brain in idic(15).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3002627|pmid = 21974935|pmc = 3356696|title = Increased Gene Dosage of Ube3a Results in Autism Traits and Decreased Glutamate Synaptic Transmission in Mice|journal = Science Translational Medicine|volume = 3|issue = 103|pages = 103ra97|year = 2011|last1 = Smith|first1 = S.

If the abnormality is found prenatally and one of the parents harbour the marker, the child has a chance of not carrying the mutation. Further tests should however be done to prove the marker has not been rearranged while being inherited. This information is also necessary for counseling of future pregnancies. Each family is unique and should therefore be handled individually.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n== Diagnosis==\n\nThe extra chromosome in people with idic(15) can be easily detected through [[chromosome analysis]] (karyotyping). Additional tests are usually required. FISH ([[Fluorescent in situ hybridization]]) is used to confirm the diagnosis by distinguishing idic(15) from other supernumerary marker chromosomes. [[Array CGH]] can be used to determine the gene content and magnitude of copy number variation so that the clinical picture can be foreseen.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wang N.J. |author2=Liu D. |author3=Parokonny A.S. |author4=Schanen N.C. | year = 2004 | title = High-resolution molecular characterization of 15q11\u2013q13 rearrangements by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) with detection of gene dosage | url = | journal = Am.

Families should always discuss the results of chromosome and FISH studies with a [[genetic counselor]] or other genetics professionals to ensure accurate interpretation.\n\n==Management==\n\nAt the present time, there is no specific treatment that can undo any chromosomal abnormality, nor the genetic pattern seen in people with idic(15). The extra chromosomal material in those affected was present at or shortly after [[Conception (biology)|conception]], and its effects on brain development began taking place long before the child was born. Therapies are available to help address many of the symptoms associated with idic(15).  Physical, occupational, and speech therapies along with special education techniques can stimulate children with idic(15) to develop to their full potential.\n\nIn terms of medical management of the symptoms associated with Chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1 Duplication Syndrome, families should be aware that individuals with chromosome 15 duplications may tolerate medications differently and may be more sensitive to side effects for some classes of medications, such as the [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] type medications (SSRI).<ref>Schanen, C: Research update on chromosome 15 duplications \u2013 idic(15) and interstitial duplications: The duplication 15q syndrome.

This EEG signature was first noted as a qualitative pattern in clinical EEG readings and was later described quantitatively  by researchers at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and their collaborators within the network of national Dup15q clinics.<ref name=\"frohlich\" /> This group of researchers found that beta activity in children with Dup15q syndrome is significantly greater than that observed in (1) healthy, typically developing children of the same age and (2) children of the same age and [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] with autism not caused by a known genetic disorder (i.e., nonsyndromic ASD). The EEG signature appears almost identical to beta oscillations induced by [[benzodiazepine]] drugs that modulate [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]], suggesting that the signature is driven by overexpression of duplicated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor genes ''[[GABRA5]]'', ''[[GABRB3]]'', and ''[[GABRG3]]'' found on 15q11.2-q13.1. Treatment monitoring and identification of molecular disease mechanisms may be facilitated by this biomarker.\n\n==References==\n\n<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------\n  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a \n  discussion of different citation methods and how to generate \n  footnotes using the <ref>, </ref> and  <reference /> tags\n----------------------------------------------------------- -->\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  ICD10           = Q99.8\n|  ICD9            = <!--{{ICD9|xxx}}-->\n|  ICDO            = \n|  OMIM            = \n|  DiseasesDB      = \n|  MedlinePlus     = \n|  eMedicineSubj   = \n|  eMedicineTopic  = \n|  MeSH            = \n|  GeneReviewsNBK  = \n|  GeneReviewsName = \n|  Orphanet        = 3306\n}}\n\n[[Category:Genetic disorders with no OMIM]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new) \n| name            =  \n| synonyms        = Non-telomeric tetrasomy 15q<ref>{{cite web |last1=RESERVED |first1=INSERM US14-- ALL RIGHTS |title=Orphanet: Duplication/inversion 15q11 |url=https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&Expert=3306 |website=www.orpha.net |accessdate=22 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n| image           = Isodicentric Chromosome 15 from GM20556.png\n| alt             = \n| caption         = An example of Isodicentric 15.

If the abnormality is found prenatally and one of the parents harbour the marker, the child has a chance of not carrying the mutation. Further tests should however be done to prove the marker has not been rearranged while being inherited. This information is also necessary for counseling of future pregnancies. Each family is unique and should therefore be handled individually.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n== Diagnosis==\n\nThe extra chromosome in people with idic(15) can be easily detected through [[chromosome analysis]] (karyotyping). Additional tests are usually required. FISH ([[Fluorescent in situ hybridization]]) is used to confirm the diagnosis by distinguishing idic(15) from other supernumerary marker chromosomes. [[Array CGH]] can be used to determine the gene content and magnitude of copy number variation so that the clinical picture can be foreseen.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wang N.J. |author2=Liu D. |author3=Parokonny A.S. |author4=Schanen N.C. | year = 2004 | title = High-resolution molecular characterization of 15q11\u2013q13 rearrangements by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) with detection of gene dosage | url = | journal = Am.

Families should always discuss the results of chromosome and FISH studies with a [[genetic counselor]] or other genetics professionals to ensure accurate interpretation.\n\n==Management==\n\nAt the present time, there is no specific treatment that can undo any chromosomal abnormality, nor the genetic pattern seen in people with idic(15). The extra chromosomal material in those affected was present at or shortly after [[Conception (biology)|conception]], and its effects on brain development began taking place long before the child was born. Therapies are available to help address many of the symptoms associated with idic(15).  Physical, occupational, and speech therapies along with special education techniques can stimulate children with idic(15) to develop to their full potential.\n\nIn terms of medical management of the symptoms associated with Chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1 Duplication Syndrome, families should be aware that individuals with chromosome 15 duplications may tolerate medications differently and may be more sensitive to side effects for some classes of medications, such as the [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] type medications (SSRI).<ref>Schanen, C: Research update on chromosome 15 duplications \u2013 idic(15) and interstitial duplications: The duplication 15q syndrome.

This EEG signature was first noted as a qualitative pattern in clinical EEG readings and was later described quantitatively  by researchers at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and their collaborators within the network of national Dup15q clinics.<ref name=\"frohlich\" /> This group of researchers found that beta activity in children with Dup15q syndrome is significantly greater than that observed in (1) healthy, typically developing children of the same age and (2) children of the same age and [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] with autism not caused by a known genetic disorder (i.e., nonsyndromic ASD). The EEG signature appears almost identical to beta oscillations induced by [[benzodiazepine]] drugs that modulate [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]], suggesting that the signature is driven by overexpression of duplicated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor genes ''[[GABRA5]]'', ''[[GABRB3]]'', and ''[[GABRG3]]'' found on 15q11.2-q13.1. Treatment monitoring and identification of molecular disease mechanisms may be facilitated by this biomarker.\n\n==References==\n\n<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------\n  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for a \n  discussion of different citation methods and how to generate \n  footnotes using the <ref>, </ref> and  <reference /> tags\n----------------------------------------------------------- -->\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  ICD10           = Q99.8\n|  ICD9            = <!--{{ICD9|xxx}}-->\n|  ICDO            = \n|  OMIM            = \n|  DiseasesDB      = \n|  MedlinePlus     = \n|  eMedicineSubj   = \n|  eMedicineTopic  = \n|  MeSH            = \n|  GeneReviewsNBK  = \n|  GeneReviewsName = \n|  Orphanet        = 3306\n}}\n\n[[Category:Genetic disorders with no OMIM]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: physcian\u2192physician (title change confirmed)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isodicentric_15"}
