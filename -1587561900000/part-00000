The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, Jayaprakash Narayan.

Furthermore, they were also apprehensions in the region about Gandhi's plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country in 1971.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

She also resolutely refused to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT). Relations with the US were strained badly under President [[Richard Nixon]] and his favouring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969.

The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

Isaac transfers his consciousness to the ship's computer and regains control, enabling Malloy to return the ''Orville'' to its own time. Mercer orders the wormhole's destruction causing Pria to vanish back to the 29th century.

Meanwhile, Alara and Claire locate one of the missing anthropologists who is in an irreversible [[lobotomy|lobotomized]] state. With LaMarr facing a final vote to determine his guilt, Mercer brings one of the planet's inhabitants, Lysella, aboard the ''Orville'' after she witnesses Alara's true appearance. She explains that the [[Court of public opinion|\"Master Feed\"]] works by the public watching the film footage and then mass voting on it. Isaac is able to hack into the planet's system and upload doctored sympathetic images of LaMarr that narrowly swings the vote in his favor. LaMarr and the crew return to the ship and depart. Lysella decides against taking part in a public vote, contemplating the advice the ''Orville'' crew gave her about the difference between opinion and knowledge.\n |LineColor       = 48A4A2\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Orville (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = Into the Fold\n |DirectedBy      = Brannon Braga\n |WrittenBy       = Brannon Braga & [[Andr\u00e9 Bormanis|Andre Bormanis]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|2}}\n |ProdCode        = 1LAB08\n |Viewers         = 3.83<ref name=\"1.08\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-nov-2-2017/|title='Will & Grace' adjusts up, 'Sheldon' and other CBS shows adjust down: Thursday final ratings|last=Porter|first=Rick|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 3, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = While traveling to a recreational planet in a shuttle, Isaac, Finn, and her sons, Marcus and Ty, fall into a spatial fold, and crash land on a planet a thousand light-years away from their original location. The planet, devastated by famine and disease, is populated by cannibals. During the landing, the shuttle breaks in half, separating Finn from the others. She is captured by a [[survivalist]] named Drogen. While she works to escape, Isaac, unfamiliar with the care of human children, is forced to protect Ty and Marcus while simultaneously attempting to repair the shuttle's communication systems and send a distress signal. Ty becomes ill with the planet's indigenous disease. After Finn kills Drogen and reunites with the others, Isaac and Marcus hold off a cannibal attack long enough for the ''Orville'' to rescue them. After Finn cures Ty's infection, Isaac tells her that, for all the children's faults, he still thinks of them fondly.\n |LineColor       = 48A4A2\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Orville (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n |Title           = Cupid's Dagger\n |DirectedBy      = [[Jamie Babbit]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Liz Heldens]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|9}}\n |ProdCode        = 1LAB09\n |Viewers         = 3.69<ref name=\"1.09\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-nov-9-2017/|title='Big Bang Theory' and 'Thursday Night Football' adjust up: Thursday final ratings|last=Porter|first=Rick|website=TV by the Numbers|date=November 10, 2017|accessdate=November 10, 2017}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = The ''Orville'' is dispatched to mediate talks between the Navarians and the Bruidians, two alien species at a centuries-old stalemate over which race lays proper claim over the planet Lapovius. Also assigned to the matter is Darulio ([[Rob Lowe]]), the Retepsian whose affair with Grayson a year prior ended her marriage to Mercer. He will scan an ancient artifact from the planet for DNA to reveal which species was the original inhabitant. Unbeknownst to the crew, Darulio secretes a powerful [[sex pheromone]] during his mating cycle which affects the crew, resulting in trysts between Darulio and Grayson, Darulio and Mercer, and Finn and Yaphit. The affected officers are incapacitated, causing the Navarian and Bruidian delegates to cancel the mediation, and a full-scale battle in orbit around the planet ensues. To avert the crisis, Darulio and Alara expose the ambassadors to a modified version of the pheromone, causing a temporary mutual infatuation that prompts a ceasefire. DNA test results reveal that the planet's inhabitants were common ancestors to both species, legitimizing a mutual claim to the planet. When Grayson asks Darulio if he was in heat when they had their tryst, he says, \"maybe\".\n |LineColor       = 48A4A2\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Orville (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = Firestorm\n |DirectedBy      = Brannon Braga\n |WrittenBy       = [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|16}}\n |ProdCode        = 1LAB10\n |Viewers         = 3.32<ref name=\"1.10\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-nov-16-2017/|title='Supernatural' and NFL adjust up, 'Young Sheldon' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Porter|first=Rick|website=TV by the Numbers|date=November 17, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = When Lt. Payne is trapped beneath debris during a plasma storm, Alara's [[pyrophobia]] causes her to hesitate, resulting in his death. Blaming herself, she tenders her resignation, which Mercer declines. He suggests she discover the source of her fear. Her parents ([[Robert Picardo]] and [[Molly Hagan]]) tell her that when she was an infant, her mother fell asleep while cradling her when a kitchen fire broke out. Alara's cries awoke her mother in time. Soon, the ''Orville'' encounters strange phenomena, including a [[scary clown]], a giant spider that devours Malloy, and murderous versions of Finn and Isaac. It is revealed that Alara is in the holographic simulator. She ordered Isaac to create a program to simulate all her potential fears. Finn erased her short-term memory to ensure an authentic reaction to the program. She completes the program, but Mercer threatens to court martial her for invoking Directive 38 (allowing the chief of security to override the captain's clearance) to prevent anyone from prematurely aborting the simulation.

Grayson discovers that LaMarr has been concealing his intellectual gifts, stemming from his wanting to be accepted by his childhood peers while growing up. Grayson convinces Mercer to assign LaMarr to lead an engineering team assignment in order to evaluate him as a candidate. When Mercer learns that Grayson similarly advocated for Admiral Halsey to consider him for the ''Orville''{{'}}s captaincy, he becomes wracked with doubt and resentment. Grayson insists that he received the position on merit alone. Halsey confirms that Mercer's performance has borne this out.

To elude the Krill pursuers, the ''Orville'' takes refuge in that region. When the protective quantum bubble around the ship begins to fail, LaMarr rises to the occasion, and he and Yaphit help the ship escape the realm.

After leaving, the crew discovers that the planet phases in to the universe for a short period every 11 days as 700 years passes on the planet. They discover that their first visit has resulted in a religion that worships Kelly Grayson and has since grown into a theocracy resembling Earth's middle ages. Admiral Ozawa reprimands Mercer for omitting mention of the contamination, and orders no further contact with the planet. Mercer and Grayson defy this order by returning to the planet to reveal the truth to the society's religious leader, but a subordinate assassinates him. By the planet's next appearance, its society is comparable to early-21st-century Earth, with religious bickering and strife. Resolving to end the suffering, Isaac stays on the planet when it phases out, spending 700 years with them. When the planet reemerges, it has progressed to interstellar space travel, and two of its representatives return Isaac to the ''Orville'' where they inform the crew that despite the tumultuous effect his arrival created, its society evolved away from worshiping Cmdr. Grayson.

Mercer and Grayson speculate whether they could have made their relationship work, but conclude they were incompatible for a long-term romantic relationship, despite their strong camaraderie. Admiral Tucker orders Alara to return the Orville to Earth rather than approach the powerful Calivon in a rescue attempt; Alara disobeys orders and retrieves Mercer and Grayson, along with a kidnapped alien child, by trading an archive of Earth's 21st-century [[reality television]] for them.

The case is arbitrated on Moclus, where Grayson represents Bortus; Grayson disputes male superiority by demonstrating Alara's immense physical strength and Gordon's lesser intelligence. Mercer locates Heveena, an elderly female Moclan who testifies that she has lived a secluded but happy and fulfilling life. Under the male pseudonym \"Gondus Elden,\" she became an esteemed novelist on Moclus. Klyden and the tribunal are unconvinced, and the infant undergoes the surgery.

Isaac initiates repairs and opens the hull's window, enabling the populace to see stars for the first time, moving even Hamelac.

Using the device that she integrated into the ship's systems, Pria hijacks the ''Orville'', navigating it out of a [[dark matter]] storm. Pria is a time-traveling 29th-century artifact dealer. History records that the storm destroyed the ''Orville'', which Pria transports to the future via a [[wormhole]] to sell it to a collector; the crew is to live out their lives in the 29th century. Isaac transfers his consciousness to the ship's computer and regains control, enabling Malloy to return the ''Orville'' to its own time. Mercer orders the wormhole's destruction causing Pria to vanish back to the 29th century. Meanwhile, Malloy pranks Isaac by sticking [[Mr. Potato Head]] pieces on his head and encourages him to retaliate with his own [[practical joke]], a concept unfamiliar to Isaac, who responds by cutting off Malloy's leg (which is subsequently quickly regrown).\n |LineColor       = 48A4A2\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Orville (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Krill\n |DirectedBy      = [[Jon Cassar]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[David A.

Also assigned to the matter is Darulio ([[Rob Lowe]]), the Retepsian whose affair with Grayson a year prior ended her marriage to Mercer. He will scan an ancient artifact from the planet for DNA to reveal which species was the original inhabitant. Unbeknownst to the crew, Darulio secretes a powerful [[sex pheromone]] during his mating cycle which affects the crew, resulting in trysts between Darulio and Grayson, Darulio and Mercer, and Finn and Yaphit. The affected officers are incapacitated, causing the Navarian and Bruidian delegates to cancel the mediation, and a full-scale battle in orbit around the planet ensues. To avert the crisis, Darulio and Alara expose the ambassadors to a modified version of the pheromone, causing a temporary mutual infatuation that prompts a ceasefire.

Payne is trapped beneath debris during a plasma storm, Alara's [[pyrophobia]] causes her to hesitate, resulting in his death. Blaming herself, she tenders her resignation, which Mercer declines. He suggests she discover the source of her fear. Her parents ([[Robert Picardo]] and [[Molly Hagan]]) tell her that when she was an infant, her mother fell asleep while cradling her when a kitchen fire broke out. Alara's cries awoke her mother in time. Soon, the ''Orville'' encounters strange phenomena, including a [[scary clown]], a giant spider that devours Malloy, and murderous versions of Finn and Isaac. It is revealed that Alara is in the holographic simulator. She ordered Isaac to create a program to simulate all her potential fears. Finn erased her short-term memory to ensure an authentic reaction to the program. She completes the program, but Mercer threatens to court martial her for invoking Directive 38 (allowing the chief of security to override the captain's clearance) to prevent anyone from prematurely aborting the simulation. He decides to be lenient, impressed by Alara's ability to overcome every obstacle.\n |LineColor       = 48A4A2\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Orville (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n |Title           = New Dimensions\n |DirectedBy      = Kelly Cronin\n |WrittenBy       = Seth MacFarlane\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|30}}\n |ProdCode        = 1LAB11\n |Viewers         = 3.63<ref name=\"1.11\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-nov-30-2017/|title='Supernatural,' 'Big Bang Theory' and NFL adjust up: Thursday final ratings|last=Porter|first=Rick|work=TV by the Numbers|date=December 4, 2017|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = With Lt. Newton leaving the ''Orville'', Mercer must find a new chief engineer. Although Yaphit is next in line for the position, Cmdr. Grayson discovers that LaMarr has been concealing his intellectual gifts, stemming from his wanting to be accepted by his childhood peers while growing up. Grayson convinces Mercer to assign LaMarr to lead an engineering team assignment in order to evaluate him as a candidate. When Mercer learns that Grayson similarly advocated for Admiral Halsey to consider him for the ''Orville''{{'}}s captaincy, he becomes wracked with doubt and resentment. Grayson insists that he received the position on merit alone. Halsey confirms that Mercer's performance has borne this out. Meanwhile, the ''Orville'' encounters a thief with a cache of plasma rifles stolen from the Krill. He is killed when he passes into a region of two-dimensional space. To elude the Krill pursuers, the ''Orville'' takes refuge in that region. When the protective quantum bubble around the ship begins to fail, LaMarr rises to the occasion, and he and Yaphit help the ship escape the realm. LaMarr is made chief engineer and promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander.\n |LineColor       = 48A4A2\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Orville (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 12\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n |Title           = Mad Idolatry\n |DirectedBy      = Brannon Braga\n |WrittenBy       = Seth MacFarlane\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|12|7}}\n |ProdCode        = 1LAB13\n |Viewers         = 3.54<ref name=\"1.12\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-dec-7-2017/|title='Supernatural' and NFL adjust up: Thursday final ratings|last=Porter|first=Rick|work=TV by the Numbers|date=December 8, 2017|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Grayson leads a shuttle team that crashes on a suddenly appearing planet with a [[Bronze Age]] society. After leaving, the crew discovers that the planet phases in to the universe for a short period every 11 days as 700 years passes on the planet. They discover that their first visit has resulted in a religion that worships Kelly Grayson and has since grown into a theocracy resembling Earth's middle ages. Admiral Ozawa reprimands Mercer for omitting mention of the contamination, and orders no further contact with the planet. Mercer and Grayson defy this order by returning to the planet to reveal the truth to the society's religious leader, but a subordinate assassinates him. By the planet's next appearance, its society is comparable to early-21st-century Earth, with religious bickering and strife. Resolving to end the suffering, Isaac stays on the planet when it phases out, spending 700 years with them. When the planet reemerges, it has progressed to interstellar space travel, and two of its representatives return Isaac to the ''Orville'' where they inform the crew that despite the tumultuous effect his arrival created, its society evolved away from worshiping Cmdr. Grayson. They suggest that as they progress over millennia ahead, they may study the Union.\n |LineColor       = 48A4A2\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], season 1 has a 31% \"tomatometer\" rating, with an average rating of 5.22/10 based on 52 critic reviews.

Although it is a foot race, it is different from [[running]] in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times. This is assessed by [[Referee|race judges]]. Typically held on either [[road]]s or on [[running track]]s, common distances range from {{convert|3000|m|mi}} up to [[100 kilometres race walk|100 kilometres]] (62.1&nbsp;mi).\n\nThere are two racewalking distances contested at the [[Summer Olympics]]: the  [[20 kilometres race walk]] (men and women)  and [[50 kilometres race walk]] (men only).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mulkeen |first1=Jon |title=PREVIEW: WOMEN\u2019S 50KM RACE WALK \u2013 IAAF WORLD RACE WALKING TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS TAICANG 2018 |url=https://www.iaaf.org/news/preview/world-race-walk-champs-2018-women-50km |website=IAAF Official Website |publisher=IAAF |accessdate=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830174251/https://www.iaaf.org/news/preview/world-race-walk-champs-2018-women-50km |archive-date=August 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Both are held as road events. The biennial [[World Athletics Championships]] also features these three events, in addition to a 50&nbsp;km walk for women. The [[IAAF World Race Walking Cup]], first held in 1961, is a stand-alone global competition for the discipline and it has [[10 kilometres race walk]]s for junior athletes, in addition to the Olympic-standard events. The [[IAAF World Indoor Championships]] featured 5000&nbsp;m and 3000&nbsp;m race walk variations, but these were discontinued after 1993. Top level [[List of international athletics championships and games|athletics championships and games]] typically feature 20&nbsp;km racewalking events.\n\nThe sport emerged from a British culture of long-distance competitive walking known as [[pedestrianism]], which began to develop the ruleset that is the basis of the modern discipline around the mid-19th century. Since the mid-20th century onwards, Russian and Chinese athletes have been among the most successful on the global stage, with Europe and parts of Latin America producing most of the remaining top level walkers.\n\nCompared to other forms of foot racing, stride length is reduced; to achieve competitive speeds racewalkers must attain [[Cadence (gait)|cadence]] rates comparable to those achieved by world-class 800 metres runners.<ref name=\"CSM\">{{cite web|last1=Eulich|first1=Whitney|title=Wait...

Violation of this rule is known as ''loss of contact.'' The second rule requires that the supporting leg must straighten from the point of contact with the ground and remain straightened until the body passes directly over it. These rules are judged by the unaided human eye. Athletes regularly lose contact for a few milliseconds per stride, which can be caught on film, but such a short flight phase is said to be undetectable to the human eye.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAthletes stay low to the ground by keeping their arms pumping low, close to their hips.  If one sees a racewalker's shoulders rising, it may be a sign that the athlete is losing contact with the ground. What appears to be an exaggerated swivel to the hip is, in fact, a full rotation of the pelvis. Athletes aim to move the pelvis forward and to minimize sideways motion in order to achieve maximum forward propulsion.  Speed is achieved by stepping quickly with the aim of rapid turnover. This minimizes the risk of the feet leaving the ground. Strides are short and quick, with pushoff coming forward from the ball of the foot, again to minimize the risk of losing contact with the ground.  World-class racewalkers (male and female) can average under four and five minutes per kilometre in a 20-km racewalk.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/records/ |title=100 Metres - men - senior - outdoor - 2016 |website=Iaaf.org |accessdate=2016-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231225226/http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/records/ |archive-date=December 31, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Distances==\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - The Winners of the 10,000 M Walk.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Shaul Ladany]] (centre), in 1969]]\nRaces have been walked at distances as short as {{convert|3|km|mi}}\u2014at the [[Athletics at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 3 kilometres walk|1920 Summer Olympics]]\u2014and as long as [[100 kilometres race walk|100&nbsp;km (62.1&nbsp;mi)]].

Three judges submitting \"red cards\" for violations results in disqualification. There is a scoreboard placed on the course so competitors can see their violation status. If the third violation is received, the chief judge removes the competitor from the course by showing a red paddle. For monitoring reasons, races are held on a looped course or on a track so judges get to see competitors several times during a race. A judge could also \"caution\" a competitor that he or she is in danger of losing form by showing a paddle that indicates either losing contact or bent knees. No judge may submit more than one card for each walker and the chief judge may not submit any cards; it is his or her job only to disqualify the offending walker. Disqualifications are routine at the elite level, such as the famous case of [[Jane Saville]], disqualified within sight of a gold medal in front of her home crowd in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], or Yet Lyu, disqualified 20 meters before the finish line at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics.\n\n==Beginnings==\n[[Image:1908 3500 metre walk final.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The start of the [[Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics - Men's 3500 metre walk|3500 m walk]] final, 1908 Olympics]]\n\nRacewalking developed as one of the original track and field events of the first meeting of the English [[Amateur Athletics Association]] in 1880. The first racewalking codes came from an attempt to regulate rules for popular 19th-century long-distance competitive walking events, called [[pedestrianism]]. Pedestrianism had developed, like footraces and horse racing, as a popular working class British and American pastime, and a venue for wagering. Walkers organised the first English amateur walking championship in 1866, which was won by John Chambers, and judged by the \"fair heel and toe\" rule. This rather vague code was the basis for the rules codified at the first Championships Meeting in 1880 of the [[Amateur Athletics Association]] in England, the birth of modern [[Track and field athletics|athletics]]. With [[football (soccer)]], [[cricket]], and other sports codified in the 19th century, the transition from professional pedestrianism to amateur racewalking was, while relatively late, part of a process of regularisation occurring in most modern sports at this time.\n\n==Olympics==\nRacewalking is an [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics]] (track and field) event with distances of 20 kilometres for both men and women and 50 kilometres for men only. Racewalking first appeared in the modern Olympics in 1904 as a half-mile walk in the 'all-rounder,' the precursor to the 10-event [[decathlon]]. In 1908, stand-alone 1,500m and 3,000m racewalks were added, and\u2014excluding 1924\u2014there has been at least one racewalk (for men) in every Olympics since.  The women's racewalk became an Olympic event only in 1992, following years of active lobbying by female internationals.  A [[IAAF World Race Walking Cup|World Cup]] in racewalking is held biennially, and racewalk events appear in the [[World Athletics Championships]], the [[Commonwealth Games]] and the [[Pan American Games]], among others.\n\n==World Race Walking Challenge==\nSince 2003, the [[IAAF]] has organised the [[IAAF Race Walking Challenge]], an annual worldwide competition series in which elite athletes accumulate points for the right to compete in the IAAF Race Walking Challenge Final and to share over US$200,000 of prize money. The series of televised events takes place in several countries each year including Mexico, Spain, Russia and China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaaf.org/WRC09/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714000654/http://www.iaaf.org/WRC09/index.html |archivedate=July 14, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n==High school==\nRacewalking is sometimes included in high school indoor and outdoor track meets, the rules often more relaxed. The distances walked tend to be relatively short, with the 1500&nbsp;m being the most commonly held event.

Although it is a foot race, it is different from [[running]] in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times. This is assessed by [[Referee|race judges]]. Typically held on either [[road]]s or on [[running track]]s, common distances range from {{convert|3000|m|mi}} up to [[100 kilometres race walk|100 kilometres]] (62.1&nbsp;mi).\n\nThere are two racewalking distances contested at the [[Summer Olympics]]: the  [[20 kilometres race walk]] (men and women)  and [[50 kilometres race walk]] (men only).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mulkeen |first1=Jon |title=PREVIEW: WOMEN\u2019S 50KM RACE WALK \u2013 IAAF WORLD RACE WALKING TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS TAICANG 2018 |url=https://www.iaaf.org/news/preview/world-race-walk-champs-2018-women-50km |website=IAAF Official Website |publisher=IAAF |accessdate=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830174251/https://www.iaaf.org/news/preview/world-race-walk-champs-2018-women-50km |archive-date=August 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Both are held as road events. The biennial [[World Athletics Championships]] also features these three events, in addition to a 50&nbsp;km walk for women. The [[IAAF World Race Walking Cup]], first held in 1961, is a stand-alone global competition for the discipline and it has [[10 kilometres race walk]]s for junior athletes, in addition to the Olympic-standard events. The [[IAAF World Indoor Championships]] featured 5000&nbsp;m and 3000&nbsp;m race walk variations, but these were discontinued after 1993. Top level [[List of international athletics championships and games|athletics championships and games]] typically feature 20&nbsp;km racewalking events.\n\nThe sport emerged from a British culture of long-distance competitive walking known as [[pedestrianism]], which began to develop the ruleset that is the basis of the modern discipline around the mid-19th century. Since the mid-20th century onwards, Russian and Chinese athletes have been among the most successful on the global stage, with Europe and parts of Latin America producing most of the remaining top level walkers.\n\nCompared to other forms of foot racing, stride length is reduced; to achieve competitive speeds racewalkers must attain [[Cadence (gait)|cadence]] rates comparable to those achieved by world-class 800 metres runners.<ref name=\"CSM\">{{cite web|last1=Eulich|first1=Whitney|title=Wait...

Violation of this rule is known as ''loss of contact.'' The second rule requires that the supporting leg must straighten from the point of contact with the ground and remain straightened until the body passes directly over it. These rules are judged by the unaided human eye. Athletes regularly lose contact for a few milliseconds per stride, which can be caught on film, but such a short flight phase is said to be undetectable to the human eye.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAthletes stay low to the ground by keeping their arms pumping low, close to their hips.  If one sees a racewalker's shoulders rising, it may be a sign that the athlete is losing contact with the ground. What appears to be an exaggerated swivel to the hip is, in fact, a full rotation of the pelvis. Athletes aim to move the pelvis forward and to minimize sideways motion in order to achieve maximum forward propulsion.  Speed is achieved by stepping quickly with the aim of rapid turnover. This minimizes the risk of the feet leaving the ground. Strides are short and quick, with pushoff coming forward from the ball of the foot, again to minimize the risk of losing contact with the ground.  World-class racewalkers (male and female) can average under four and five minutes per kilometre in a 20-km racewalk.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/records/ |title=100 Metres - men - senior - outdoor - 2016 |website=Iaaf.org |accessdate=2016-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231225226/http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/records/ |archive-date=December 31, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Distances==\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - The Winners of the 10,000 M Walk.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Shaul Ladany]] (centre), in 1969]]\nRaces have been walked at distances as short as {{convert|3|km|mi}}\u2014at the [[Athletics at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 3 kilometres walk|1920 Summer Olympics]]\u2014and as long as [[100 kilometres race walk|100&nbsp;km (62.1&nbsp;mi)]].

Three judges submitting \"red cards\" for violations results in disqualification. There is a scoreboard placed on the course so competitors can see their violation status. If the third violation is received, the chief judge removes the competitor from the course by showing a red paddle. For monitoring reasons, races are held on a looped course or on a track so judges get to see competitors several times during a race. A judge could also \"caution\" a competitor that he or she is in danger of losing form by showing a paddle that indicates either losing contact or bent knees. No judge may submit more than one card for each walker and the chief judge may not submit any cards; it is his or her job only to disqualify the offending walker. Disqualifications are routine at the elite level, such as the famous case of [[Jane Saville]], disqualified within sight of a gold medal in front of her home crowd in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], or Yet Lyu, disqualified 20 meters before the finish line at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics.\n\n==Beginnings==\n[[Image:1908 3500 metre walk final.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The start of the [[Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics - Men's 3500 metre walk|3500 m walk]] final, 1908 Olympics]]\n\nRacewalking developed as one of the original track and field events of the first meeting of the English [[Amateur Athletics Association]] in 1880. The first racewalking codes came from an attempt to regulate rules for popular 19th-century long-distance competitive walking events, called [[pedestrianism]]. Pedestrianism had developed, like footraces and horse racing, as a popular working class British and American pastime, and a venue for wagering. Walkers organised the first English amateur walking championship in 1866, which was won by John Chambers, and judged by the \"fair heel and toe\" rule. This rather vague code was the basis for the rules codified at the first Championships Meeting in 1880 of the [[Amateur Athletics Association]] in England, the birth of modern [[Track and field athletics|athletics]]. With [[football (soccer)]], [[cricket]], and other sports codified in the 19th century, the transition from professional pedestrianism to amateur racewalking was, while relatively late, part of a process of regularisation occurring in most modern sports at this time.\n\n==Olympics==\nRacewalking is an [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics]] (track and field) event with distances of 20 kilometres for both men and women and 50 kilometres for men only. Racewalking first appeared in the modern Olympics in 1904 as a half-mile walk in the 'all-rounder,' the precursor to the 10-event [[decathlon]]. In 1908, stand-alone 1,500m and 3,000m racewalks were added, and\u2014excluding 1924\u2014there has been at least one racewalk (for men) in every Olympics since.  The women's racewalk became an Olympic event only in 1992, following years of active lobbying by female internationals.  A [[IAAF World Race Walking Cup|World Cup]] in racewalking is held biennially, and racewalk events appear in the [[World Athletics Championships]], the [[Commonwealth Games]] and the [[Pan American Games]], among others.\n\n==World Race Walking Challenge==\nSince 2003, the [[IAAF]] has organised the [[IAAF Race Walking Challenge]], an annual worldwide competition series in which elite athletes accumulate points for the right to compete in the IAAF Race Walking Challenge Final and to share over US$200,000 of prize money. The series of televised events takes place in several countries each year including Mexico, Spain, Russia and China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaaf.org/WRC09/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714000654/http://www.iaaf.org/WRC09/index.html |archivedate=July 14, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n==High school==\nRacewalking is sometimes included in high school indoor and outdoor track meets, the rules often more relaxed. The distances walked tend to be relatively short, with the 1500&nbsp;m being the most commonly held event. Racing also occurs at 3&nbsp;km, 5&nbsp;km and 10&nbsp;km, with records kept and annual rankings published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hsrw.net/main |title=Home - The Home of High School Race Walking

There are also significant foreign populations of expats, primarily from Asia, Turkey, and other Arab countries that are also present in Ta'if.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nIn the 6th century [[Common Era|CE]], the city of T\u0101'if was dominated by the [[Banu Thaqif]] tribe, which still lives in and around the city of Taif today. It has been suggested that Jewish tribes who were displaced by Ethiopian Christians in the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] wars settled near Taif.<ref>Hirschberg, Haim Ze'ev (1972). \"Arabia\" In Encyclopaedia Judaica. 3. Jerusalem: Macmillan. p. 234.</ref> The walled city was a religious centre as it housed the idol of the goddess [[Al-l\u0101t|All\u0101t]], who was then known as \"the lady of T\u0101'if.\" Its climate marked the city out from its dry and barren neighbours closer to the [[Red Sea]]. Wheat, vines, and fruit were grown around T\u0101'if, and this is how the city earned its title \"the Garden of the [[Hejaz]]\". This city was involved in the events of the [[Year of the Elephant]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Muhammed/saw.html |title=The Prophets of Islam - Muhammad |publisher=Islamawareness.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref> Both Ta'if and Mecca (about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest,<ref name=alislam>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/zafar/exampler.html |title=The Excellent Exemplar - Muhammad |publisher=[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|Al-Islam.org]] |date= |accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref> were resorts of pilgrimage. Ta'if was more pleasantly situated than Mecca itself and the people of Ta'if had close trade relations with the people of Mecca. The people of Ta'if carried on agriculture and fruit\u2011growing in addition to their trade activities.<ref name=alislam/>\n\n===7th century: Era of Muhammad===\nIn the early 7th century, [[Muhammad]], who was born in Makkah, preached Islam to the inhabitants of Makkah and the Hijaz, and encountered resistance from many of the people here, including at Ta'if. In 630, the [[Battle of Hunayn]] took place at [[Hunayn (Saudi Arabia)|Hunayn]], close to this city. Shortly after that, the unsuccessful [[Siege of Ta'if]] took place. The city was assaulted by catapults from [[Banu Daws]], but it repelled the attacks. The [[Battle of Tabouk]] in 631 left T\u0101'if completely isolated, so members of Thaq\u012bf arrived in Makkah to negotiate the conversion of the city to [[Islam]]. The idol of Al-l\u0101t was destroyed along with all of the other signs of the city's previously pagan existence.<ref>{{cite book| title = Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi - [[Book of Idols|The Book of Idols]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=[[Ibn Ishaq]] - S\u012bratu Ras\u016blu l-L\u0101hHawting}}</ref>\n\n===16th century===\nOn 17 July 1517, the [[Sharif of Mecca]] capitulated to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Selim I]]. As a sign of this, he surrendered to him the keys of the Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina. As part of the Hejaz, Ta'if was also given over to Ottoman control..\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0627\u0647 - \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629.jpg|thumb|right|Landscape from south of Ta'if]]\n\nThe city remained Ottoman for a further three centuries, until in 1802, when it was retaken by rebels in alliance with the [[House of Saud]]. These forces then proceeded to take Mecca and Medina. The loss was keenly felt by the Ottoman Empire, which viewed itself as the protector of the Holy Cities. The Ottoman sultan, [[Mahmud II]], called upon his nominal viceroy in [[Egypt]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who launched an attack on the Hejaz and reconquered Ta'if in 1813.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1813, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] traveler and [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] visited Ta'if.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burkhardt|first1=John Lewis|title=Travels in Arabia|date=1829|location=London|publisher=John Colburn|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burckhardt/john_lewis/arabia/chapter3.html|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref> He left an eyewitness account on the city just after its recapture by the Muhammad Ali, with whom he obtained several interviews while he was there. Burckhardt reported that the wall and ditch around the city had been built by Othman el Medhayfe. There were three gates and several towers on the city walls, which, however, were weak, being in some places only {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} thick. Burckhardt stated that the castle had been built by Sharif Ghalib. He noted the destruction of the city caused by the conquest of 1802. Most of the buildings were still in ruin while he was there, and the tomb of [[Abdullah ibn Abbas]] \u2013 cousin of Muhammad and ancestor of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] \u2013 had been severely damaged. He also recorded that the population of the city was still mostly [[Banu Thaqif|Thaq\u012bf]]. In terms of trade, the city was an [[entrep\u00f4t]] for [[coffee]].\n\nThe castle and military barracks in Ta'if were repaired by the Ottomans in 1843, a ''{{lang|tr|[[:wikt:h\u00fck\u00fbmet|h\u00fck\u00fbmet]] kona\u011f\u0131}}'' \u2013 mansion for government business \u2013 was built in 1869, and a post office was established sometime later.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Taifroad.jpg|thumb|right|Road to Ta'if in the foreground, with the [[Hijaz Mountains]] in the background]]\n\nPrior to the [[Arab Revolt]], [[Ahmed Bey]] had been made the commander of Ottoman forces in T\u0101'if. He had under him a force of 3,000 soldiers and 10 guns of the mountain artillery. [[Ghalib Pasha]], the governor of the Hejaz was also present in the city. In 1916, the [[Hashemite]]s launched their revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Mecca in June. That city had fallen and then in July, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]], the eldest son of the Hashemite leader and Sharif of Mecca [[Husayn ibn Ali]], was sent with seventy men to T\u0101'if. Whilst his activities in the area aroused the suspicion of Ahmed Bey, Ghalib Pasha was unconcerned by so small a force. Abdullah secretly built up his army to 5,000 men. He then cut the telegraph wires to the city and then went on the attack. All Hashemite assaults on the city were repelled by the mountain guns, and both sides settled down to an uneasy siege. However, Hashemite guns were slowly brought up to T\u0101'if, and then the city held out a little longer; it finally surrendered on 22 September. The city thus later became a part of the self-proclaimed Hashemite [[Kingdom of Hejaz]].\n\nTa'if did not remain in Hashemite hands for very long. However, Tensions between the king of the Hejaz, Husayn ibn Ali, and [[Ibn Saud|Abdulaziz al-Saud]], the sultan of Nejd, soon broke out into violence. Although hostilities subsided in 1919, by September 1924 the then Saudi-sponsored [[Ikhwan]] (militia) under the leadership of [[Sultan bin Bajad]] and [[Khaled bin Luwai]] was ready to attack Ta'if. The city was supposed to have been defended by the king's son, [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali]], but he fled in panic with his troops. Three hundred of Ali's men were slain by the Ikhwan in what became known as the [[Ta'if massacre]].<ref>David Holden in ''The House of Saud''</ref> In 1926 Abdulaziz al-Saud was officially recognized as the new king of Hejaz. Ta'if remained a part of the Kingdom of Hejaz until Abdulaziz al-Saud unified his two kingdoms into one under the title of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1934 the treaty was signed here that established the boundary lines between Yemen and the kingdom.<ref>Merriam-Webster's geographical dictionary. (1997). (Third edition).

However, they later embarked on a project of modernizing the city.

It has been suggested that Jewish tribes who were displaced by Ethiopian Christians in the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] wars settled near Taif.<ref>Hirschberg, Haim Ze'ev (1972). \"Arabia\" In Encyclopaedia Judaica. 3. Jerusalem: Macmillan. p. 234.</ref> The walled city was a religious centre as it housed the idol of the goddess [[Al-l\u0101t|All\u0101t]], who was then known as \"the lady of T\u0101'if.\" Its climate marked the city out from its dry and barren neighbours closer to the [[Red Sea]]. Wheat, vines, and fruit were grown around T\u0101'if, and this is how the city earned its title \"the Garden of the [[Hejaz]]\". This city was involved in the events of the [[Year of the Elephant]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Muhammed/saw.html |title=The Prophets of Islam - Muhammad |publisher=Islamawareness.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref> Both Ta'if and Mecca (about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest,<ref name=alislam>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/zafar/exampler.html |title=The Excellent Exemplar - Muhammad |publisher=[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|Al-Islam.org]] |date= |accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref> were resorts of pilgrimage. Ta'if was more pleasantly situated than Mecca itself and the people of Ta'if had close trade relations with the people of Mecca. The people of Ta'if carried on agriculture and fruit\u2011growing in addition to their trade activities.<ref name=alislam/>\n\n===7th century: Era of Muhammad===\nIn the early 7th century, [[Muhammad]], who was born in Makkah, preached Islam to the inhabitants of Makkah and the Hijaz, and encountered resistance from many of the people here, including at Ta'if. In 630, the [[Battle of Hunayn]] took place at [[Hunayn (Saudi Arabia)|Hunayn]], close to this city. Shortly after that, the unsuccessful [[Siege of Ta'if]] took place. The city was assaulted by catapults from [[Banu Daws]], but it repelled the attacks. The [[Battle of Tabouk]] in 631 left T\u0101'if completely isolated, so members of Thaq\u012bf arrived in Makkah to negotiate the conversion of the city to [[Islam]]. The idol of Al-l\u0101t was destroyed along with all of the other signs of the city's previously pagan existence.<ref>{{cite book| title = Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi - [[Book of Idols|The Book of Idols]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=[[Ibn Ishaq]] - S\u012bratu Ras\u016blu l-L\u0101hHawting}}</ref>\n\n===16th century===\nOn 17 July 1517, the [[Sharif of Mecca]] capitulated to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Selim I]]. As a sign of this, he surrendered to him the keys of the Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina. As part of the Hejaz, Ta'if was also given over to Ottoman control..\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0627\u0647 - \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629.jpg|thumb|right|Landscape from south of Ta'if]]\n\nThe city remained Ottoman for a further three centuries, until in 1802, when it was retaken by rebels in alliance with the [[House of Saud]]. These forces then proceeded to take Mecca and Medina. The loss was keenly felt by the Ottoman Empire, which viewed itself as the protector of the Holy Cities. The Ottoman sultan, [[Mahmud II]], called upon his nominal viceroy in [[Egypt]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who launched an attack on the Hejaz and reconquered Ta'if in 1813.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1813, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] traveler and [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] visited Ta'if.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burkhardt|first1=John Lewis|title=Travels in Arabia|date=1829|location=London|publisher=John Colburn|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burckhardt/john_lewis/arabia/chapter3.html|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref> He left an eyewitness account on the city just after its recapture by the Muhammad Ali, with whom he obtained several interviews while he was there. Burckhardt reported that the wall and ditch around the city had been built by Othman el Medhayfe. There were three gates and several towers on the city walls, which, however, were weak, being in some places only {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} thick. Burckhardt stated that the castle had been built by Sharif Ghalib. He noted the destruction of the city caused by the conquest of 1802. Most of the buildings were still in ruin while he was there, and the tomb of [[Abdullah ibn Abbas]] \u2013 cousin of Muhammad and ancestor of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] \u2013 had been severely damaged. He also recorded that the population of the city was still mostly [[Banu Thaqif|Thaq\u012bf]]. In terms of trade, the city was an [[entrep\u00f4t]] for [[coffee]].\n\nThe castle and military barracks in Ta'if were repaired by the Ottomans in 1843, a ''{{lang|tr|[[:wikt:h\u00fck\u00fbmet|h\u00fck\u00fbmet]] kona\u011f\u0131}}'' \u2013 mansion for government business \u2013 was built in 1869, and a post office was established sometime later.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Taifroad.jpg|thumb|right|Road to Ta'if in the foreground, with the [[Hijaz Mountains]] in the background]]\n\nPrior to the [[Arab Revolt]], [[Ahmed Bey]] had been made the commander of Ottoman forces in T\u0101'if. He had under him a force of 3,000 soldiers and 10 guns of the mountain artillery. [[Ghalib Pasha]], the governor of the Hejaz was also present in the city. In 1916, the [[Hashemite]]s launched their revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Mecca in June. That city had fallen and then in July, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]], the eldest son of the Hashemite leader and Sharif of Mecca [[Husayn ibn Ali]], was sent with seventy men to T\u0101'if. Whilst his activities in the area aroused the suspicion of Ahmed Bey, Ghalib Pasha was unconcerned by so small a force. Abdullah secretly built up his army to 5,000 men. He then cut the telegraph wires to the city and then went on the attack. All Hashemite assaults on the city were repelled by the mountain guns, and both sides settled down to an uneasy siege. However, Hashemite guns were slowly brought up to T\u0101'if, and then the city held out a little longer; it finally surrendered on 22 September. The city thus later became a part of the self-proclaimed Hashemite [[Kingdom of Hejaz]].\n\nTa'if did not remain in Hashemite hands for very long. However, Tensions between the king of the Hejaz, Husayn ibn Ali, and [[Ibn Saud|Abdulaziz al-Saud]], the sultan of Nejd, soon broke out into violence. Although hostilities subsided in 1919, by September 1924 the then Saudi-sponsored [[Ikhwan]] (militia) under the leadership of [[Sultan bin Bajad]] and [[Khaled bin Luwai]] was ready to attack Ta'if. The city was supposed to have been defended by the king's son, [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali]], but he fled in panic with his troops. Three hundred of Ali's men were slain by the Ikhwan in what became known as the [[Ta'if massacre]].<ref>David Holden in ''The House of Saud''</ref> In 1926 Abdulaziz al-Saud was officially recognized as the new king of Hejaz. Ta'if remained a part of the Kingdom of Hejaz until Abdulaziz al-Saud unified his two kingdoms into one under the title of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1934 the treaty was signed here that established the boundary lines between Yemen and the kingdom.<ref>Merriam-Webster's geographical dictionary. (1997). (Third edition).
