This inspired him to design a new type of railway. Instead of the conventional two parallel rails on the ground, it had a single rail sitting above the sand and held at waist height on A-shaped trestles. The carriages sat astride the trestles like panniers.\n\nBy 1881 Lartigue had built a {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[monorail]] to transport [[esparto grass]] across the Algerian desert, with [[mule]]s pulling trains of panniers that straddled the elevated rail.\n\nHowever the Lartigue system as built was not truly a monorail, since it was necessary to add two further rails, one on each side, lower down the A frames.  These did not carry any weight, but unpowered stabilising wheels fitted to all the engines and wagons contacted these extra rails to prevent the vehicles from overbalancing.\n\n==Listowel and Ballybunion Railway==\n[[File:Behr Monorail.jpg|thumb|Junction on Listowel and Ballybunion Railway]]\n[[File:Lartigue, Ballybunion, 1900.jpg|thumb|Ballybunion]]\n[[File:Lartigue Monorail old 007.jpg|thumb|Turntable at Listowel]]\n[[File:Lartigue Monorail (5903843291).jpg|thumb|Passing loop at Lisselton]]\n\nThis was a {{convert|14.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[monorail]] built on the Lartigue principle in [[County Kerry]] in Ireland. It linked [[Ballybunion]] with the [[North Kerry line]] at [[Listowel]]. It had one intermediate station and a [[passing loop]] at [[Lisselton]]. The line ran beside the main Listowel/Ballybunion road (R553). It officially opened on 29 February 1888,<ref>{{cite book|last=Guerin|first=Michael|title=The Lartigue: Listowel and Ballybunion Railway|year=1988|publisher=Lartigue Centenary Committee|location=Listowel|isbn=0-9513549-0-6}}</ref> public services beginning on 5 March.<ref>Newham A.T.

No [[Barony (Ireland)|baronial]] guarantees were sought. However, the system had significant operating drawbacks.\n\nLoads had to be evenly balanced. If a farmer wanted to send a cow to market, he would have to send two [[calf|calves]] to balance it, which would travel back on opposite sides of the same freight wagon, thereby balancing each other.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sekon|first=G. A.|authorlink=George Augustus Nokes |date=November 1924|journal=[[The Railway Magazine]]|location=London}}</ref>\n\nAnother problem with using the Lartigue system in populated areas was that, due to the track's design, it was not possible to build conventional [[level crossing]]s. In order for a road to cross the track, a kind of double-sided [[drawbridge]] had to be constructed, which required an attendant to operate it.  Where farmers' tracks crossed the line there were level crossings based on the principle of a [[Turntable (rail)|turntable]].  These were locked and the farmer in question provided with a key.  Once unlocked, the track could be swivelled to one side to allow the crossing to be used.  Both the swivelling and drawbridge type crossings were automatically linked to signals, which stopped any approaching trains; road traffic was always given priority under this system.\n\nPassengers could not pass from one side of a carriage to another while in motion.  A kind of footbridge was built into one end of some of the passenger coaches, while at least one such bridge was carried on a separate wagon.  This allowed passengers to cross from one side of the train to the other when stopped at a station.\n\nConventional railway [[railroad switch|points]] could not be used, so a similar function was fulfilled by a large number of curved movable pieces of track which, when rotated one way, would connect the main and one other track. When turned end-for-end, the curve went in the opposite direction, and so connected the main and a different track. The devices could not be called [[turntable (rail)|turntables]] because they could only be moved when there was no rolling stock on them. There was, however, a turntable at each terminus.\n\nThe three [[locomotive]]s were of the [[0-3-0]] type, constructed by the [[Hunslet Engine Company]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Newham |first1=A.T. |last2=Foster |first2=Michael |title=The Listowel & Ballybunion Railway |year=1989 |origyear=1967 |publisher=Oakwood Press |location=Headington |isbn=0-85361-376-1 |id=Locomotion Papers LP33 |pages=46, 65 }}</ref> They were specially built with two [[boiler]]s to balance on the track, and consequently two [[Firebox (locomotive)|fireboxes]], one of which had to be stoked by the driver. They were also fitted with powered [[Tender (rail)|tenders]] for auxiliary use on hills.  The tender wheels were driven by two cylinders via [[spur gears]].  Two small chimneys were fitted to each tender to discharge the exhaust steam from these cylinders. A smaller engine, nicknamed the \"coffee pot\", was used in the construction of the railway, having been used previously on a demonstration line at [[Tothill Fields]] in London. It can be seen on an early photo of 1888.\n\nThe track, installations and rolling stock were damaged during the [[Irish Civil War]] of 1922/23, but services continued.  However, the failure to include the railway in the [[Great Southern Railways]], the company created by the Irish Government to run the railways in the [[Irish Free State]], left the financially struggling operation no choice but to close.<ref>Newham A.T.

Several bolts were found to have been removed from the track and discarded some distance away.  Fortunately no-one was injured.<ref>http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BoT_GaleyBridge1889.pdf</ref>\n\nOn 28 November 1907, a double-headed train on a busy race day collided with some sleepers on a trestle and derailed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article108037734 |title=RAILWAY DISASTER. |newspaper=[[The Freeman's Journal (Sydney)|The Freeman's Journal]] |volume=LVIII |issue=3592 |location=Sydney|date=28 November 1907 |accessdate=31 January 2017 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n===Restoration===\n[[File:The Lartigue Monorail at Listowel - geograph.org.uk - 331699.jpg|thumb|The new Lartigue locomotive]]\nIn 2003 the ''Lartigue Monorailway Restoration Committee'', a voluntary organisation from [[Listowel]], opened a {{convert|1|km|mi|1|adj=on}} section of Lartigue monorail on the trackbed of the former North Kerry line in Listowel.

Two small chimneys were fitted to each tender to discharge the exhaust steam from these cylinders. A smaller engine, nicknamed the \"coffee pot\", was used in the construction of the railway, having been used previously on a demonstration line at [[Tothill Fields]] in London. It can be seen on an early photo of 1888.\n\nThe track, installations and rolling stock were damaged during the [[Irish Civil War]] of 1922/23, but services continued.

This brings the Line Islands into the same day as the Kiribati Islands. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth: [[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]] hours. Kiribati is the only country in the world to be situated in all four hemispheres.\n\nKiribati gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]], becoming  a [[sovereign state]] in 1979. The capital, [[South Tarawa]], now the most populated area, consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of [[causeway]]s. These comprise about half the area of [[Tarawa]] Atoll.\n\nKiribati is a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[World Bank]], and became a full member of the [[United Nations]] in 1999.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Kiribati'' was adopted in 1979 at independence. It is the [[Gilbertese]] rendition of ''Gilberts''. This name derives from the English pronunciation of the name of the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named in 1820 by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] as \u00ab \u00eeles Gilbert \u00bb, in English the [[Gilbert Islands]], after the British [[Sea captain|captain]] [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]]. He and captain [[John Marshall (Royal Navy officer)|John Marshall]] sighted some of the islands in 1788, while crossing the Outer Passage route from [[Port Jackson]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yeu4MnVVss0C&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=outer+passage+route+port+jackson+canton#v=onepage|title=Cinderellas of the Empire: Towards a History of Kiribati and Tuvalu|first=Barrie|last=Macdonald|date=6 December 2001|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=9789820203358|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>\n{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91 |title = The Gilberts & Marshalls: A distinguished historian recalls the past of two recently captured pacific groups |journal= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date = 1944-05-22 |author = Samuel Eliot Morison |accessdate = 2009-10-14 |author-link = Samuel Eliot Morison }}</ref>\n\nThe main archipelago was named ''\u00eeles Gilbert'' (''Gilbert Islands'' in English) in about 1820 by Russian admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]] and French captain [[Louis Isidore Duperrey|Louis Duperrey]]. Both of their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago, the Southern part notably, was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the [[British Western Pacific Territories|Western Pacific Order in Council]] of 1877 and in the Pacific Order of 1893.<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/sb-uk_act/po189395.rtf]</ref>\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916 and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenisation.<ref name=brit/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091014051525/http://www.mfep.gov.ki/Facts%20and%20Background.htm Background Note: Kiribati]. mfep.gov.ki</ref> Local oral historians in the form of chiefly lore keepers suggest that the area was first inhabited by a group of seafaring people from [[Melanesia]], who were described as being dark skinned, frizzy haired and short in stature. These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, orally described as being tall and fair skinned. Eventually, both groups intermittently clashed and intermingled until they slowly became a uniform population.\n\nAround 1300 A.D, there was a mass exodus from [[Samoa]] at the same time that [[Cannibalism]] was forcefully abolished there, leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most I-Kiribati people. These Samoans would later bring strong features of Polynesian languages and culture, creating clans based on their own Samoan traditions and slowly intertwining with the indigenous clans and powers already dominant in Kiribati.\n\nAround the 15th century, with the stark contrasting systems of governance between the Northern Islands, primarily under chiefly rule (Uea), and the Central and Southern Islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (Unimwaane)\u2013with the exception of [[Tabiteuea]], the sole island that maintained a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society (Tabiteuea stemming from the root phrase Tabu-Te-Uea meaning \"Chiefs are forbidden\")\u2013civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, fuelled by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which may have happened months or decades before. \n\nThe turmoil would last well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that some Europeans were coerced into using by the more cunning and persuasive among the I-Kiribati leaders. \n\nThe typical military arms of the I-Kiribati at this time were shark-tooth-embedded wooden spears, knives and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre. They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of Kiribati#Kiribati traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one.\n\n[[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] would be the last of the dozens of expansionist Chiefs of Kiribati of this period, despite Abemama historically conforming to the traditional Southern Island's governance of their respective \u201cunimwaane\u201d. He would be immortalised in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book \"In the South Seas\", which delved into the High Chief's character and method of rule during Stevenson's stay in Abemama.\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main|British Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}\nChance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maude, H.

That was eventually resolved and they became part of Kiribati under the [[Treaty of Tarawa]].

The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is directly elected by the people, after the legislature nominates three or four persons from among its members to be candidates in the ensuing presidential election. The president is limited in the terms they can serve for to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). Its members are elected, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Kiribati}}\n\nKiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Fiji. The first three of these provide the majority of the country's foreign aid.

Kiribati is a member of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries.\nEstablished in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] negotiations as early as 1994.\n\nIn 2009, President Tong attended the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] ([[Climate Vulnerable Forum|V11]]) in the [[Maldives]], with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving [[carbon neutrality]].\n\nIn November 2010, Kiribati hosted the [[Tarawa Climate Change Conference]] (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners. The conference strove to create an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC. The conference was a successor event to the Climate Vulnerable Forum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202030155/http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2012 |title=Climate Change in Kiribati, Tarawa Climate Change Conference Issues Ambo Declaration |publisher=Office of the President of Kiribati |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> The ultimate objective of TCCC was to reduce the number and intensity of fault lines between parties to the COP process, explore elements of agreement between the parties and thereby to support Kiribati's and other parties' contribution to [[COP16]] held in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]], from 29 November to 10 December 2010.\n\nIn 2013, President Tong has spoken of climate-change induced sea level rise as \"inevitable\". \"For our people to survive, then they will have to migrate.

The program is now focusing on the country's most vulnerable sectors in the most highly populated areas.\nInitiatives include improving water supply management in and around Tarawa; coastal management protection measures such as mangrove re-plantation and protection of public infrastructure; strengthening laws to reduce coastal erosion; and population settlement planning to reduce personal risks.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120202030155/http://www.climate.gov.ki/Kiribati_climate_change_strategies.html Government of Kiribati Climate Change Strategies]. climate.gov.ki</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Line5304 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|A tropical islet with palm fronds oriented in the direction of the prevailing winds.]]\nThe climate is pleasant from April to October, with predominant northeastern winds and stable temperatures close to {{convert|30|C}}.

Ethnically, the I-Kiribati are [[Micronesia]]ns. Recent archaeological evidence indicates that [[Austronesians]] originally settled the islands thousands of years ago. Around the 14th century, Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans invaded the islands, thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] linguistic traits. Intermarriage among all ancestral groups, however, has led to a population reasonably homogeneous in appearance and traditions.\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe people of Kiribati speak an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] called [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]]. Although English is also an [[official language]], it is not used very often outside the island capital of [[Tarawa]]. It is more likely that English is mixed in its use with Gilbertese. Older generations of I-Kiribati tend to use more complicated versions of the language. Several words in Gilbertese have been adopted from European settlers, for instance, ''kamea'' is the Gilbertese word for dog,<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/kir/glossary.htm Te taetae ni Kiribati \u2013 Kiribati Language Lessons \u2013 Glossary].

In the early 2000s, between 1 and 7% of the population, depending on the island, were annually treated for food poisoning in a hospital. Modernization and cross-cultural exchange of the late 20th century brought new issues of unhealthy diet and lifestyle; heavy smoking, especially among the young population; and external infections, including HIV/AIDS.<ref name=t8>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], 8\u20139</ref>\n\nKiribati is the country with the third highest prevalence of smoking, with 54% of the population reported as smokers.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-01-08/india/45990577_1_smokeless-tobacco-smokers-tobacco-use \"Number of smokers up by 35 million in 30 years, study finds\"].

Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\n===Dance===\n{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}\n[[File:Bonriki International Airport welcome.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The [[Great frigatebird|Frigate bird]] (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.<ref>[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony & Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{see also|Kiribati at the Olympics|Kiribati at the 2014 Commonwealth Games}}\nKiribati has competed at the [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and the [[Summer Olympics]] since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].

Both of their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago, the Southern part notably, was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the [[British Western Pacific Territories|Western Pacific Order in Council]] of 1877 and in the Pacific Order of 1893.<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/sb-uk_act/po189395.rtf]</ref>\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916 and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenisation.<ref name=brit/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091014051525/http://www.mfep.gov.ki/Facts%20and%20Background.htm Background Note: Kiribati]. mfep.gov.ki</ref> Local oral historians in the form of chiefly lore keepers suggest that the area was first inhabited by a group of seafaring people from [[Melanesia]], who were described as being dark skinned, frizzy haired and short in stature. These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, orally described as being tall and fair skinned. Eventually, both groups intermittently clashed and intermingled until they slowly became a uniform population.\n\nAround 1300 A.D, there was a mass exodus from [[Samoa]] at the same time that [[Cannibalism]] was forcefully abolished there, leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most I-Kiribati people. These Samoans would later bring strong features of Polynesian languages and culture, creating clans based on their own Samoan traditions and slowly intertwining with the indigenous clans and powers already dominant in Kiribati.\n\nAround the 15th century, with the stark contrasting systems of governance between the Northern Islands, primarily under chiefly rule (Uea), and the Central and Southern Islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (Unimwaane)\u2013with the exception of [[Tabiteuea]], the sole island that maintained a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society (Tabiteuea stemming from the root phrase Tabu-Te-Uea meaning \"Chiefs are forbidden\")\u2013civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, fuelled by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which may have happened months or decades before. \n\nThe turmoil would last well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that some Europeans were coerced into using by the more cunning and persuasive among the I-Kiribati leaders. \n\nThe typical military arms of the I-Kiribati at this time were shark-tooth-embedded wooden spears, knives and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre. They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of Kiribati#Kiribati traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one.\n\n[[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] would be the last of the dozens of expansionist Chiefs of Kiribati of this period, despite Abemama historically conforming to the traditional Southern Island's governance of their respective \u201cunimwaane\u201d. He would be immortalised in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book \"In the South Seas\", which delved into the High Chief's character and method of rule during Stevenson's stay in Abemama.\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main|British Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}\nChance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maude, H.

The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is directly elected by the people, after the legislature nominates three or four persons from among its members to be candidates in the ensuing presidential election. The president is limited in the terms they can serve for to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). Its members are elected, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Kiribati}}\n\nKiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Fiji.

Kiribati is a member of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries.\nEstablished in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] negotiations as early as 1994.\n\nIn 2009, President Tong attended the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] ([[Climate Vulnerable Forum|V11]]) in the [[Maldives]], with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving [[carbon neutrality]].\n\nIn November 2010, Kiribati hosted the [[Tarawa Climate Change Conference]] (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners.

Commercially viable [[phosphate]] deposits on [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] were exhausted at the time of independence. [[Copra]] and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. Kiribati is considered one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] in the world.\n\nIn one form or another, Kiribati gets a large portion of its income from abroad. Examples include fishing licenses, development assistance, worker [[remittance]]s, and tourism. Given Kiribati's limited domestic production ability, it must import nearly all of its essential foodstuffs and manufactured items; it depends on these external sources of income for financing.\n\nThe economy of Kiribati benefits from international development assistance programs. The multilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were the [[European Union]] (A$9 million), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (A$3.7 million), UNICEF, and the [[World Health Organization]] (A$100,000).<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\"/> The bilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were Australia (A$11 million), Japan (A$2 million), [[New Zealand]] (A$6.6 million), [[Taiwan]] (A$10.6 million), and other donors providing A$16.2 million, including technical assistance grants from the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\">{{cite web |title = Kiribati: Statistical Appendix |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24872.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/114 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |title = Kiribati: 2011 Article IV Consultation-Staff Report, Informational Annexes, Debt Sustainability Analysis, Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion, and Statement by the Executive Director for Kiribati |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24871.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/113 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe major donors in 2010/2011 were Australia (A$15 million), Taiwan (A$11 million); New Zealand (A$6 million), the [[World Bank]] (A$4 million) and the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=mfat>{{cite web |url = http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Pacific/Kiribati.php |title = New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Kiribati established a [[sovereign wealth fund]] to act as a store of wealth for the country's earnings from [[phosphate]] mining.\nIn 2008, the [[Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund]] was valued at US$400 million.<ref>[http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund/kiribati.php Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute].

It is estimated to have grown by 1.75% for the year. Despite a weather-related drop in copra production, private sector activity appears to have picked up, especially in retail. Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20% compared to 2009, although from a very low base.\nDespite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled.

Most houses are made of materials obtained from coconut and pandanus trees. Frequent droughts and infertile soil hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa.

Ethnically, the I-Kiribati are [[Micronesia]]ns. Recent archaeological evidence indicates that [[Austronesians]] originally settled the islands thousands of years ago. Around the 14th century, Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans invaded the islands, thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] linguistic traits. Intermarriage among all ancestral groups, however, has led to a population reasonably homogeneous in appearance and traditions.\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe people of Kiribati speak an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] called [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]]. Although English is also an [[official language]], it is not used very often outside the island capital of [[Tarawa]]. It is more likely that English is mixed in its use with Gilbertese. Older generations of I-Kiribati tend to use more complicated versions of the language.

Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\n===Dance===\n{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}\n[[File:Bonriki International Airport welcome.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The [[Great frigatebird|Frigate bird]] (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.<ref>[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony & Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{see also|Kiribati at the Olympics|Kiribati at the 2014 Commonwealth Games}}\nKiribati has competed at the [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and the [[Summer Olympics]] since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].
