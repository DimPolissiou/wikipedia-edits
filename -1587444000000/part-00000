The [[triboelectric effect]] causes an [[electrostatic charge]] to build up on the surface of the fur due to the cat's motions. The electric field of the charge causes polarization of the molecules of the styrofoam due to [[electrostatic induction]], resulting in a slight attraction of the light plastic pieces to the charged fur. This effect is also the cause of [[static cling]] in clothes.]]\n\nSince [[classical physics]], it has been known that some materials, such as [[amber]], attract lightweight particles after [[triboelectric effect|rubbing]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word for amber, {{lang|grc|\u03ae\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, or ''{{lang|grc-Latn|electron}}'', was thus the source of the word 'electricity'. Electrostatic phenomena arise from the [[force]]s that electric charges exert on each other. Such forces are described by [[Coulomb's law]].\nEven though electrostatically induced forces seem to be rather weak, some electrostatic forces such as the one between an [[electron]] and a [[proton]], that together make up a [[hydrogen]] [[atom]], is about 36 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] stronger than the [[gravitation]]al force acting between them.\n\nThere are many examples of electrostatic phenomena, from those as simple as the attraction of the plastic wrap to one's hand after it is removed from a package to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, the damage of electronic components during manufacturing, and [[photocopier]] & [[laser printing|laser printer]] operation. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the [[interface (matter)|surface]] of objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high [[resistance (electricity)|resistance]] to electrical flow. This is because the charges that transfer are trapped there for a time long enough for their effects to be observed. These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a [[Electrostatic discharge|discharge]]: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static \"shock\" is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with insulated surfaces.\n\n==Coulomb's law==\n{{Main article|Coulomb's law}}\nCoulomb's law states that:\n\n'The magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.'\n\nThe force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.\n\nIf <math>r</math> is the distance (in [[meters]]) between two charges, then the force (in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s) between two point charges <math>q</math> and <math>Q</math> (in [[coulomb]]s) is:\n:<math>F = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0}\\frac{qQ}{r^2}= k_0\\frac{qQ}{r^2}\\, ,</math>\n\nwhere \u03b5<sub>0</sub> is the [[vacuum permittivity]], or permittivity of free space:<ref name=\"Sadiku\">{{cite book |title=Elements of electromagnetics|year=2009|isbn=9780195387759|page=104|author=Matthew Sadiku}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_0 \\approx {10^{-9}\\over 36\\pi} \\;\\; \\mathrm{C^2\\ N^{-1}\\ m^{-2}}\\approx 8.854\\ 187\\ 817 \\times 10^{-12} \\;\\; \\mathrm{C^2\\ N^{-1}\\ m^{-2}}.</math>\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] units of \u03b5<sub>0</sub> are equivalently &ensp;[[ampere|A]]<sup>2</sup>[[second|s]]<sup>4</sup> kg<sup>\u22121</sup>m<sup>\u22123</sup> or [[coulomb|C]]<sup>2</sup>[[newton (unit)|N]]<sup>&minus;1</sup>m<sup>&minus;2</sup> or [[farad|F]] m<sup>&minus;1</sup>.

Field lines begin on positive charge and terminate on negative charge. They are parallel to the direction of the electric field at each point, and the density of these field lines is a measure of the magnitude of the electric field at any given point.\n\nConsider a collection of <math>N</math> particles of charge <math>Q_i</math>, located at points <math>\\vec r_i</math> (called ''source points''), the electric field at <math>\\vec r</math> (called the ''field point'') is:<ref name=\"Purcell\"/>\n\n:<math> \\vec{E}(\\vec r)\n=\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon _0}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{\\widehat\\mathcal R_i Q_i}{\\left \\|\\mathcal\\vec R_i \\right \\|^2} ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vec\\mathcal R_i = \\vec r - \\vec r_i ,</math> is the displacement vector from a ''source point''\n<math>\\vec r_i</math> to the ''field point''\n<math>\\vec r</math>, and\n<math> \\widehat\\mathcal R_i = \\vec\\mathcal R_i / \\left \\|\\vec\\mathcal R_i \\right \\|</math>\nis a [[unit vector]] that indicates the direction of the field. For a single point charge at the origin, the magnitude of this electric field is <math>E =k_eQ/\\mathcal R^2,</math> and points away from that charge is positive. The fact that the force (and hence the field) can be calculated by summing over all the contributions due to individual source particles is an example of the [[superposition principle]]. The electric field produced by a distribution of charges is given by the volume [[charge density]] <math>\\rho (\\vec r)</math> and can be obtained by converting this sum into a [[triple integral]]:\n\n:<math>\\vec{E}(\\vec r)= \\frac {1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\iiint \\frac {\\vec r - \\vec r \\,'}{\\left \\| \\vec r - \\vec r \\,' \\right \\|^3} \\rho (\\vec r \\,')\\operatorname{d}^3 r\\,'</math>\n\n===Gauss' law===\n[[Gauss' law]] states that \"the total electric flux through any closed surface in free space of any shape drawn in an electric field is proportional to the total [[electric charge]] enclosed by the surface.\" Mathematically, Gauss's law takes the form of an integral equation:\n\n:<math>\\oint_S\\vec{E} \\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\vec{A} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0}\\,Q_{enclosed}=\\int_V{\\rho\\over\\varepsilon_0}\\cdot\\operatorname{d}^3 r,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{d}^3 r =\\mathrm{d}x \\ \\mathrm{d}y \\ \\mathrm{d}z</math> is a volume element. If the charge is distributed over a surface or along a line, replace <math>\\rho\\mathrm{d}^3r</math> by <math>\\sigma\\mathrm{d}A</math> or <math>\\lambda\\mathrm{d}\\ell</math>. The [[divergence theorem]] allows Gauss's Law to be written in differential form:\n\n:<math>\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{E} = {\\rho\\over\\varepsilon_0}.</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot</math> is the [[divergence|divergence operator]].\n\n===Poisson and Laplace equations===\nThe definition of electrostatic potential, combined with the differential form of Gauss's law (above), provides a relationship between the potential \u03a6 and the charge density \u03c1:\n:<math>{\\nabla}^2 \\phi = - {\\rho\\over\\varepsilon_0}.</math>\n\nThis relationship is a form of [[Poisson's equation]]. In the absence of unpaired electric charge, the equation becomes [[Laplace's equation]]:\n:<math>{\\nabla}^2 \\phi = 0,</math>\n\n==Electrostatic approximation==\nThe validity of the electrostatic approximation rests on the assumption that the electric field is [[irrotational]]:\n:<math>\\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{E} = 0.</math>\n\nFrom [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], this assumption implies the absence or near-absence of time-varying magnetic fields:\n:<math>{\\partial\\vec{B}\\over\\partial t} = 0.</math>\n\nIn other words, electrostatics does not require the absence of magnetic fields or electric currents. Rather, if magnetic fields or electric currents ''do'' exist, they must not change with time, or in the worst-case, they must change with time only ''very slowly''. In some problems, both electrostatics and [[magnetostatics]] may be required for accurate predictions, but the coupling between the two can still be ignored. Electrostatics and magnetostatics can both be seen as [[Galilean electromagnetism|Galilean limits]] for electromagnetism.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heras|first1=J.

An electric field, <math>E</math>, points from regions of high electric potential to regions of low electric potential, expressed mathematically as\n:<math>\\vec{E} = -\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi.</math>\n\nThe [[gradient theorem]] can be used to establish that the electrostatic potential is the amount of [[work (physics)|work]] per unit charge required to move a charge from point <math>a</math> to point <math>b</math> with the following [[line integral]]:\n:<math> -\\int_a^b{\\vec{E}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\vec \\ell} = \\phi (\\vec b) -\\phi(\\vec a).</math>\n\nFrom these equations, we see that the electric potential is constant in any region for which the electric field vanishes (such as occurs inside a conducting object).\n\n===Electrostatic energy===\n{{Main article|Electric potential energy|Energy density}}\n\nA single [[test particle]]'s potential energy, <math>U_\\mathrm{E}^{\\text{single}}</math>, can be calculated from a [[line integral]] of the work, <math>q_n\\vec E\\cdot\\mathrm d\\vec\\ell</math>. We integrate from a point at infinity, and assume a collection of <math>N</math> particles of charge <math>Q_n</math>, are already situated at the points <math>\\vec r_i</math>. This potential energy (in [[Joule]]s) is:\n\n:<math> U_\\mathrm{E}^{\\text{single}}=q\\phi(\\vec r)=\\frac{q }{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{Q_i}{\\left \\|\\mathcal{\\vec R_i} \\right \\|}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vec\\mathcal {R_i} = \\vec r - \\vec r_i</math> is the distance of each charge <math>Q_i</math> from the [[test charge]] <math>q</math>, which situated at the point <math>\\vec r</math>, and <math>\\phi(\\vec r)</math> is the electric potential that would be at <math>\\vec r</math> if the [[test charge]] were not present. If only two charges are present, the potential energy is <math>k_eQ_1Q_2/r</math>. The total [[electric potential energy]] due a collection of ''N'' charges is calculating by assembling these particles [[Electric Potential Energy|one at a time]]:\n\n:<math>U_\\mathrm{E}^{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1 }{4\\pi \\varepsilon _0}\\sum_{j=1}^N Q_j \\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \\frac{Q_i}{r_{ij}}= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^N Q_i\\phi_i ,</math>\n\nwhere the following sum from, ''j = 1'' to ''N'', excludes ''i = j'':\n\n:<math>\\phi_i = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon _0}\\sum_{j=1 (j\\ne i)}^N \\frac{Q_j}{r_{ij}}.</math>\n\nThis electric potential, <math>\\phi_i</math> is what would be measured at <math>\\vec r_i</math> if the charge <math>Q_i</math> were missing. This formula obviously excludes the (infinite) energy that would be required to assemble each point charge from a disperse cloud of charge. The sum over charges can be converted into an integral over charge density using the prescription <math>\\sum (\\cdots) \\rightarrow \\int(\\cdots)\\rho\\mathrm d^3r</math>:\n\n:<math>U_\\mathrm{E}^{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int\\rho(\\vec{r})\\phi(\\vec{r}) \\operatorname{d}^3 r = \\frac{\\varepsilon_0 }{2} \\int \\left|{\\mathbf{E}}\\right|^2 \\operatorname{d}^3 r</math>,\n\nThis second expression for [[electrostatic energy]] uses the fact that the electric field is the negative [[gradient]] of the electric potential, as well as [[vector calculus identities]] in a way that resembles [[integration by parts]]. These two integrals for electric field energy seem to indicate two mutually exclusive formulas for electrostatic energy density, namely <math>\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\phi</math> and <math>\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 }{2}E^2</math>; they yield equal values for the total electrostatic energy only if both are integrated over all space.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/gujs/issue/45480/435567 |doi=10.5281/zenodo.3252783 |year=2019 |last1=Fedosin |first1=Sergey G. |title=The integral theorem of the field energy |journal=Gazi University Journal of Science |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=686\u2013703}}</ref>\n\n===Electrostatic pressure===\n{{See also|Maxwell stress tensor}}\n\nOn a [[electrical conductor|conductor]], a surface charge will experience a force in the presence of an [[electric field]]. This force is the average of the discontinuous electric field at the surface charge. This average in terms of the field just outside the surface amounts to:\n:<math> P = \\frac{ \\varepsilon_0 }{2} E^2</math>,\n\nThis pressure tends to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of the surface charge.\n\n==Triboelectric series==\n{{Main article|Triboelectric effect}}\n\nThe [[triboelectric effect]] is a type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged when they are brought into contact with a different material and then separated. One of the materials acquires a positive charge, and the other acquires an equal negative charge. The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties. Amber, for example, can acquire an electric charge by friction with a material like wool. This property, first recorded by [[Thales of Miletus]], was the first electrical phenomenon investigated by humans. Other examples of materials that can acquire a significant charge when rubbed together include glass rubbed with silk, and hard rubber rubbed with fur.\n\n==Electrostatic generators==\n{{Main article|Electrostatic generator}}\nThe presence of [[surface charge]] imbalance means that the objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces. This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of [[contact electrification]] and the [[triboelectric effect]]. Rubbing two nonconductive objects generates a great amount of static electricity. This is not just the result of friction; two nonconductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed one on top of the other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. Usually [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]], e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge. Some examples of these substances are [[rubber]], [[plastic]], [[glass]], and [[pith]]. [[Conductor (material)|Conductive]] objects only rarely generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. [[Electrostatic generator]]s, devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.\n\nThe presence of [[electric current]] does not detract from the electrostatic forces nor from the sparking, from the [[corona discharge]], or other phenomena. Both phenomena can exist simultaneously in the same system.\n\n:See also: ''[[Wimshurst machine]]'', and ''[[Van de Graaff generator]]''.\n\n==Charge neutralization==\nNatural electrostatic phenomena are most familiar as an occasional annoyance in seasons of low humidity, but can be destructive and harmful in some situations (e.g. electronics manufacturing). When working in direct contact with integrated circuit electronics (especially delicate [[MOSFET]]s). In the presence of flammable gas, care must be taken to avoid accumulating and suddenly discharging a static charge (see [[Electrostatic discharge]]).\n\n==Electrostatic induction==\n{{Main article|Electrostatic induction}}\nElectrostatic induction, discovered by British scientist [[John Canton]] in 1753 and Swedish professor [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] in 1762<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n| title = Electricity\n| encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Ed.\n| volume = 9\n| pages = 181\n| publisher = The Encyclopaedia Britannica Co.\n| year = 1910\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mz4EAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA181\n| id =\n| accessdate = 2008-06-23}}</ref><ref name=\"Heilbron\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlTLRUn1sy8C&pg=PA387|title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Study of Early Modern Physics|date=1979|publisher=Univ. of California Press|isbn=0520034783|location=|pages=|language=|doi=|id=|last1=Heilbron|first1=J.

For example, if a positively charged object is brought near an uncharged metal object, the mobile negatively-charged [[electron]]s in the metal will be attracted by the external charge, and move to the side of the metal facing it, creating a negative charge on the surface. When the electrons move out of an area they leave a positive charge due to the metal atoms' [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], so the side of the metal object facing away from the charge acquires a positive charge. These ''induced charges'' disappear when the external charge is removed. Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light objects, such as balloons, paper scraps and [[styrofoam]] packing peanuts to static charges. The surface charges induced in conductive objects exactly cancel external electric fields inside the conductor, so there is no electric field inside a metal object. This is the basis for the electric field shielding action of a [[Faraday cage]]. Since the electric field is the [[gradient (calculus)|gradient]] of the voltage, electrostatic induction is also responsible for making the [[electric potential]] ([[voltage]]) constant throughout a conductive object.\n\n==Static electricity==\n{{Main article|Static electricity}}\n[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumbnail|[[Lightning]] over [[Oradea]] in [[Romania]]]]\nBefore the year 1832, when [[Michael Faraday]] published the results of his experiment on the identity of electricities, physicists thought \"static electricity\" was somehow different from other electrical charges. Michael Faraday proved that the electricity induced from the magnet, voltaic electricity produced by a battery, and static electricity are all the same.\n\nStatic electricity is usually caused when certain materials are rubbed against each other, like wool on plastic or the soles of shoes on carpet. The process causes electrons to be pulled from the surface of one material and relocated on the surface of the other material.\n\nA static shock occurs when the surface of the second material, negatively charged with electrons, touches a positively charged conductor, or vice versa.\n\nStatic electricity is commonly used in [[xerography]], [[air filter]]s, and some automotive [[electrostatic coating|coating processes]].\nStatic electricity is a build-up of electric charges on two objects that have become separated from each other. Small electrical components can be damaged by static electricity, and component manufacturers use a number of [[antistatic device]]s to avoid this.\n\n===Static electricity and chemical industry===\nWhen different materials are brought together and then separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet is an example of excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.\n\nA similar charging mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing through pipelines\u2014a process called flow electrification. Fluids which have low electrical conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine as fast as they are separated and hence electrostatic charge generation is not significant. In the [[petrochemical industry]], 50 pS/m is the recommended minimum value of electrical conductivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid.\n\nAn important concept for insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This is similar to the time constant (tau) within an [[RC circuit]]. For insulating materials, it is the ratio of the static [[dielectric constant]] divided by the electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/cm (100 pS/m) will have an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The excess charge within a fluid will be almost completely dissipated after 4 to 5 times the relaxation time, or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.\n\nCharge generation increases at higher fluid velocities and larger pipe diameters, becoming quite significant in pipes {{convert|8|in|mm}} or larger. Static charge generation in these systems is best controlled by limiting fluid velocity. The British standard BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 (formerly BS-5958-Part 2) Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity prescribes velocity limits. Because of its large impact on dielectric constant, the recommended velocity for hydrocarbon fluids containing water should be limited to 1&nbsp;m/s.\n\nBonding and earthing are the usual ways by which charge buildup can be prevented. For fluids with electrical conductivity below 10 pS/m, bonding and earthing are not adequate for charge dissipation, and anti-static additives may be required.\n\n====Applicable standards====\n\n*BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity\n*NFPA 77 (2007) Recommended Practice on Static Electricity\n*API RP 2003 (1998) Protection Against Ignitions Arising Out of Static, Lightning, and Stray Currents\n\n==Electrostatic induction in commercial applications==\nElectrostatic induction was used in the past to build high-voltage generators known as [[influence machine]]s.\nThe main component that emerged in these times is the [[capacitor]].\nElectrostatic induction is also used for electro-mechanic precipitation or projection. In such technologies, charged particles of small sizes are collected or deposited intentionally on surfaces. Applications range from [[electrostatic precipitator]] to [[electrostatic coating]] and [[inkjet printing]].\nRecently a new [[wireless power transfer]] technology has been based on electrostatic induction between oscillating distant dipoles.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Electromagnetism]]\n*[[Electronegativity]]\n*[[Electrostatic discharge]]\n*[[Electrostatic separator]]\n*[[Electrostatic voltmeter]]\n*[[Ionic bond]]\n*[[Permittivity]] and [[relative permittivity]]\n*[[Elementary charge|Quantisation of charge]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=September 2019}}\n*{{cite book |author=Faraday, Michael |title=Experimental Researches in Electricity |location=London |publisher=Royal Inst |year=1839}}{{Gutenberg book|no=14986|name=Experimental Researches in Electricity, Volume 1|author=Michael Faraday}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Halliday, David |author2=Robert Resnick |author3=Kenneth S.

The [[triboelectric effect]] causes an [[electrostatic charge]] to build up on the surface of the fur due to the cat's motions. The electric field of the charge causes polarization of the molecules of the styrofoam due to [[electrostatic induction]], resulting in a slight attraction of the light plastic pieces to the charged fur. This effect is also the cause of [[static cling]] in clothes.]]\n\nSince [[classical physics]], it has been known that some materials, such as [[amber]], attract lightweight particles after [[triboelectric effect|rubbing]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word for amber, {{lang|grc|\u03ae\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, or ''{{lang|grc-Latn|electron}}'', was thus the source of the word 'electricity'. Electrostatic phenomena arise from the [[force]]s that electric charges exert on each other. Such forces are described by [[Coulomb's law]].\nEven though electrostatically induced forces seem to be rather weak, some electrostatic forces such as the one between an [[electron]] and a [[proton]], that together make up a [[hydrogen]] [[atom]], is about 36 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] stronger than the [[gravitation]]al force acting between them.\n\nThere are many examples of electrostatic phenomena, from those as simple as the attraction of the plastic wrap to one's hand after it is removed from a package to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, the damage of electronic components during manufacturing, and [[photocopier]] & [[laser printing|laser printer]] operation. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the [[interface (matter)|surface]] of objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high [[resistance (electricity)|resistance]] to electrical flow. This is because the charges that transfer are trapped there for a time long enough for their effects to be observed. These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a [[Electrostatic discharge|discharge]]: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static \"shock\" is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with insulated surfaces.\n\n==Coulomb's law==\n{{Main article|Coulomb's law}}\nCoulomb's law states that:\n\n'The magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.'\n\nThe force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.\n\nIf <math>r</math> is the distance (in [[meters]]) between two charges, then the force (in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s) between two point charges <math>q</math> and <math>Q</math> (in [[coulomb]]s) is:\n:<math>F = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0}\\frac{qQ}{r^2}= k_0\\frac{qQ}{r^2}\\, ,</math>\n\nwhere \u03b5<sub>0</sub> is the [[vacuum permittivity]], or permittivity of free space:<ref name=\"Sadiku\">{{cite book |title=Elements of electromagnetics|year=2009|isbn=9780195387759|page=104|author=Matthew Sadiku}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_0 \\approx {10^{-9}\\over 36\\pi} \\;\\; \\mathrm{C^2\\ N^{-1}\\ m^{-2}}\\approx 8.854\\ 187\\ 817 \\times 10^{-12} \\;\\; \\mathrm{C^2\\ N^{-1}\\ m^{-2}}.</math>\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI]] units of \u03b5<sub>0</sub> are equivalently &ensp;[[ampere|A]]<sup>2</sup>[[second|s]]<sup>4</sup> kg<sup>\u22121</sup>m<sup>\u22123</sup> or [[coulomb|C]]<sup>2</sup>[[newton (unit)|N]]<sup>&minus;1</sup>m<sup>&minus;2</sup> or [[farad|F]] m<sup>&minus;1</sup>.

Field lines begin on positive charge and terminate on negative charge. They are parallel to the direction of the electric field at each point, and the density of these field lines is a measure of the magnitude of the electric field at any given point.\n\nConsider a collection of <math>N</math> particles of charge <math>Q_i</math>, located at points <math>\\vec r_i</math> (called ''source points''), the electric field at <math>\\vec r</math> (called the ''field point'') is:<ref name=\"Purcell\"/>\n\n:<math> \\vec{E}(\\vec r)\n=\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon _0}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{\\widehat\\mathcal R_i Q_i}{\\left \\|\\mathcal\\vec R_i \\right \\|^2} ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vec\\mathcal R_i = \\vec r - \\vec r_i ,</math> is the displacement vector from a ''source point''\n<math>\\vec r_i</math> to the ''field point''\n<math>\\vec r</math>, and\n<math> \\widehat\\mathcal R_i = \\vec\\mathcal R_i / \\left \\|\\vec\\mathcal R_i \\right \\|</math>\nis a [[unit vector]] that indicates the direction of the field. For a single point charge at the origin, the magnitude of this electric field is <math>E =k_eQ/\\mathcal R^2,</math> and points away from that charge is positive. The fact that the force (and hence the field) can be calculated by summing over all the contributions due to individual source particles is an example of the [[superposition principle]]. The electric field produced by a distribution of charges is given by the volume [[charge density]] <math>\\rho (\\vec r)</math> and can be obtained by converting this sum into a [[triple integral]]:\n\n:<math>\\vec{E}(\\vec r)= \\frac {1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\iiint \\frac {\\vec r - \\vec r \\,'}{\\left \\| \\vec r - \\vec r \\,' \\right \\|^3} \\rho (\\vec r \\,')\\operatorname{d}^3 r\\,'</math>\n\n===Gauss' law===\n[[Gauss' law]] states that \"the total electric flux through any closed surface in free space of any shape drawn in an electric field is proportional to the total [[electric charge]] enclosed by the surface.\" Mathematically, Gauss's law takes the form of an integral equation:\n\n:<math>\\oint_S\\vec{E} \\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\vec{A} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0}\\,Q_{enclosed}=\\int_V{\\rho\\over\\varepsilon_0}\\cdot\\operatorname{d}^3 r,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{d}^3 r =\\mathrm{d}x \\ \\mathrm{d}y \\ \\mathrm{d}z</math> is a volume element. If the charge is distributed over a surface or along a line, replace <math>\\rho\\mathrm{d}^3r</math> by <math>\\sigma\\mathrm{d}A</math> or <math>\\lambda\\mathrm{d}\\ell</math>. The [[divergence theorem]] allows Gauss's Law to be written in differential form:\n\n:<math>\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{E} = {\\rho\\over\\varepsilon_0}.</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot</math> is the [[divergence|divergence operator]].\n\n===Poisson and Laplace equations===\nThe definition of electrostatic potential, combined with the differential form of Gauss's law (above), provides a relationship between the potential \u03a6 and the charge density \u03c1:\n:<math>{\\nabla}^2 \\phi = - {\\rho\\over\\varepsilon_0}.</math>\n\nThis relationship is a form of [[Poisson's equation]]. In the absence of unpaired electric charge, the equation becomes [[Laplace's equation]]:\n:<math>{\\nabla}^2 \\phi = 0,</math>\n\n==Electrostatic approximation==\nThe validity of the electrostatic approximation rests on the assumption that the electric field is [[irrotational]]:\n:<math>\\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{E} = 0.</math>\n\nFrom [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], this assumption implies the absence or near-absence of time-varying magnetic fields:\n:<math>{\\partial\\vec{B}\\over\\partial t} = 0.</math>\n\nIn other words, electrostatics does not require the absence of magnetic fields or electric currents. Rather, if magnetic fields or electric currents ''do'' exist, they must not change with time, or in the worst-case, they must change with time only ''very slowly''. In some problems, both electrostatics and [[magnetostatics]] may be required for accurate predictions, but the coupling between the two can still be ignored. Electrostatics and magnetostatics can both be seen as [[Galilean electromagnetism|Galilean limits]] for electromagnetism.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heras|first1=J.

An electric field, <math>E</math>, points from regions of high electric potential to regions of low electric potential, expressed mathematically as\n:<math>\\vec{E} = -\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi.</math>\n\nThe [[gradient theorem]] can be used to establish that the electrostatic potential is the amount of [[work (physics)|work]] per unit charge required to move a charge from point <math>a</math> to point <math>b</math> with the following [[line integral]]:\n:<math> -\\int_a^b{\\vec{E}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\vec \\ell} = \\phi (\\vec b) -\\phi(\\vec a).</math>\n\nFrom these equations, we see that the electric potential is constant in any region for which the electric field vanishes (such as occurs inside a conducting object).\n\n===Electrostatic energy===\n{{Main article|Electric potential energy|Energy density}}\n\nA single [[test particle]]'s potential energy, <math>U_\\mathrm{E}^{\\text{single}}</math>, can be calculated from a [[line integral]] of the work, <math>q_n\\vec E\\cdot\\mathrm d\\vec\\ell</math>. We integrate from a point at infinity, and assume a collection of <math>N</math> particles of charge <math>Q_n</math>, are already situated at the points <math>\\vec r_i</math>. This potential energy (in [[Joule]]s) is:\n\n:<math> U_\\mathrm{E}^{\\text{single}}=q\\phi(\\vec r)=\\frac{q }{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{Q_i}{\\left \\|\\mathcal{\\vec R_i} \\right \\|}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vec\\mathcal {R_i} = \\vec r - \\vec r_i</math> is the distance of each charge <math>Q_i</math> from the [[test charge]] <math>q</math>, which situated at the point <math>\\vec r</math>, and <math>\\phi(\\vec r)</math> is the electric potential that would be at <math>\\vec r</math> if the [[test charge]] were not present. If only two charges are present, the potential energy is <math>k_eQ_1Q_2/r</math>. The total [[electric potential energy]] due a collection of ''N'' charges is calculating by assembling these particles [[Electric Potential Energy|one at a time]]:\n\n:<math>U_\\mathrm{E}^{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1 }{4\\pi \\varepsilon _0}\\sum_{j=1}^N Q_j \\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \\frac{Q_i}{r_{ij}}= \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^N Q_i\\phi_i ,</math>\n\nwhere the following sum from, ''j = 1'' to ''N'', excludes ''i = j'':\n\n:<math>\\phi_i = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon _0}\\sum_{j=1 (j\\ne i)}^N \\frac{Q_j}{r_{ij}}.</math>\n\nThis electric potential, <math>\\phi_i</math> is what would be measured at <math>\\vec r_i</math> if the charge <math>Q_i</math> were missing. This formula obviously excludes the (infinite) energy that would be required to assemble each point charge from a disperse cloud of charge.

These two integrals for electric field energy seem to indicate two mutually exclusive formulas for electrostatic energy density, namely <math>\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\phi</math> and <math>\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 }{2}E^2</math>; they yield equal values for the total electrostatic energy only if both are integrated over all space.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/gujs/issue/45480/435567 |doi=10.5281/zenodo.3252783 |year=2019 |last1=Fedosin |first1=Sergey G. |title=The integral theorem of the field energy |journal=Gazi University Journal of Science |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=686\u2013703}}</ref>\n\n===Electrostatic pressure===\n{{See also|Maxwell stress tensor}}\n\nOn a [[electrical conductor|conductor]], a surface charge will experience a force in the presence of an [[electric field]]. This force is the average of the discontinuous electric field at the surface charge. This average in terms of the field just outside the surface amounts to:\n:<math> P = \\frac{ \\varepsilon_0 }{2} E^2</math>,\n\nThis pressure tends to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of the surface charge.\n\n==Triboelectric series==\n{{Main article|Triboelectric effect}}\n\nThe [[triboelectric effect]] is a type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged when they are brought into contact with a different material and then separated. One of the materials acquires a positive charge, and the other acquires an equal negative charge. The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties. Amber, for example, can acquire an electric charge by friction with a material like wool. This property, first recorded by [[Thales of Miletus]], was the first electrical phenomenon investigated by humans. Other examples of materials that can acquire a significant charge when rubbed together include glass rubbed with silk, and hard rubber rubbed with fur.\n\n==Electrostatic generators==\n{{Main article|Electrostatic generator}}\nThe presence of [[surface charge]] imbalance means that the objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces. This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of [[contact electrification]] and the [[triboelectric effect]]. Rubbing two nonconductive objects generates a great amount of static electricity. This is not just the result of friction; two nonconductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed one on top of the other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. Usually [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]], e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge. Some examples of these substances are [[rubber]], [[plastic]], [[glass]], and [[pith]]. [[Conductor (material)|Conductive]] objects only rarely generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. [[Electrostatic generator]]s, devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.\n\nThe presence of [[electric current]] does not detract from the electrostatic forces nor from the sparking, from the [[corona discharge]], or other phenomena. Both phenomena can exist simultaneously in the same system.\n\n:See also: ''[[Wimshurst machine]]'', and ''[[Van de Graaff generator]]''.\n\n==Charge neutralization==\nNatural electrostatic phenomena are most familiar as an occasional annoyance in seasons of low humidity, but can be destructive and harmful in some situations (e.g. electronics manufacturing). When working in direct contact with integrated circuit electronics (especially delicate [[MOSFET]]s). In the presence of flammable gas, care must be taken to avoid accumulating and suddenly discharging a static charge (see [[Electrostatic discharge]]).\n\n==Electrostatic induction==\n{{Main article|Electrostatic induction}}\nElectrostatic induction, discovered by British scientist [[John Canton]] in 1753 and Swedish professor [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] in 1762<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n| title = Electricity\n| encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Ed.\n| volume = 9\n| pages = 181\n| publisher = The Encyclopaedia Britannica Co.\n| year = 1910\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mz4EAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA181\n| id =\n| accessdate = 2008-06-23}}</ref><ref name=\"Heilbron\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlTLRUn1sy8C&pg=PA387|title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Study of Early Modern Physics|date=1979|publisher=Univ. of California Press|isbn=0520034783|location=|pages=|language=|doi=|id=|last1=Heilbron|first1=J.

For example, if a positively charged object is brought near an uncharged metal object, the mobile negatively-charged [[electron]]s in the metal will be attracted by the external charge, and move to the side of the metal facing it, creating a negative charge on the surface. When the electrons move out of an area they leave a positive charge due to the metal atoms' [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], so the side of the metal object facing away from the charge acquires a positive charge. These ''induced charges'' disappear when the external charge is removed. Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light objects, such as balloons, paper scraps and [[styrofoam]] packing peanuts to static charges. The surface charges induced in conductive objects exactly cancel external electric fields inside the conductor, so there is no electric field inside a metal object. This is the basis for the electric field shielding action of a [[Faraday cage]]. Since the electric field is the [[gradient (calculus)|gradient]] of the voltage, electrostatic induction is also responsible for making the [[electric potential]] ([[voltage]]) constant throughout a conductive object.\n\n==Static electricity==\n{{Main article|Static electricity}}\n[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumbnail|[[Lightning]] over [[Oradea]] in [[Romania]]]]\nBefore the year 1832, when [[Michael Faraday]] published the results of his experiment on the identity of electricities, physicists thought \"static electricity\" was somehow different from other electrical charges. Michael Faraday proved that the electricity induced from the magnet, voltaic electricity produced by a battery, and static electricity are all the same.\n\nStatic electricity is usually caused when certain materials are rubbed against each other, like wool on plastic or the soles of shoes on carpet. The process causes electrons to be pulled from the surface of one material and relocated on the surface of the other material.\n\nA static shock occurs when the surface of the second material, negatively charged with electrons, touches a positively charged conductor, or vice versa.\n\nStatic electricity is commonly used in [[xerography]], [[air filter]]s, and some automotive [[electrostatic coating|coating processes]].\nStatic electricity is a build-up of electric charges on two objects that have become separated from each other. Small electrical components can be damaged by static electricity, and component manufacturers use a number of [[antistatic device]]s to avoid this.\n\n===Static electricity and chemical industry===\nWhen different materials are brought together and then separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet is an example of excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.\n\nA similar charging mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing through pipelines\u2014a process called flow electrification. Fluids which have low electrical conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine as fast as they are separated and hence electrostatic charge generation is not significant. In the [[petrochemical industry]], 50 pS/m is the recommended minimum value of electrical conductivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid.\n\nAn important concept for insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This is similar to the time constant (tau) within an [[RC circuit]]. For insulating materials, it is the ratio of the static [[dielectric constant]] divided by the electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/cm (100 pS/m) will have an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The excess charge within a fluid will be almost completely dissipated after 4 to 5 times the relaxation time, or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.\n\nCharge generation increases at higher fluid velocities and larger pipe diameters, becoming quite significant in pipes {{convert|8|in|mm}} or larger. Static charge generation in these systems is best controlled by limiting fluid velocity. The British standard BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 (formerly BS-5958-Part 2) Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity prescribes velocity limits. Because of its large impact on dielectric constant, the recommended velocity for hydrocarbon fluids containing water should be limited to 1&nbsp;m/s.\n\nBonding and earthing are the usual ways by which charge buildup can be prevented. For fluids with electrical conductivity below 10 pS/m, bonding and earthing are not adequate for charge dissipation, and anti-static additives may be required.\n\n====Applicable standards====\n\n*BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity\n*NFPA 77 (2007) Recommended Practice on Static Electricity\n*API RP 2003 (1998) Protection Against Ignitions Arising Out of Static, Lightning, and Stray Currents\n\n==Electrostatic induction in commercial applications==\nElectrostatic induction was used in the past to build high-voltage generators known as [[influence machine]]s.\nThe main component that emerged in these times is the [[capacitor]].\nElectrostatic induction is also used for electro-mechanic precipitation or projection. In such technologies, charged particles of small sizes are collected or deposited intentionally on surfaces. Applications range from [[electrostatic precipitator]] to [[electrostatic coating]] and [[inkjet printing]].\nRecently a new [[wireless power transfer]] technology has been based on electrostatic induction between oscillating distant dipoles.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Electromagnetism]]\n*[[Electronegativity]]\n*[[Electrostatic discharge]]\n*[[Electrostatic separator]]\n*[[Electrostatic voltmeter]]\n*[[Ionic bond]]\n*[[Permittivity]] and [[relative permittivity]]\n*[[Elementary charge|Quantisation of charge]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=September 2019}}\n*{{cite book |author=Faraday, Michael |title=Experimental Researches in Electricity |location=London |publisher=Royal Inst |year=1839}}{{Gutenberg book|no=14986|name=Experimental Researches in Electricity, Volume 1|author=Michael Faraday}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Halliday, David |author2=Robert Resnick |author3=Kenneth S.

The regiment had a good fighting reputation, and had important roles in the [[Battle of Hanover]] and the [[Battle of the Wilderness]]. It was present at nearly 175 battles and skirmishes, including [[Battle of Gettysburg, third day cavalry battles|Gettysburg]], [[Third Battle of Winchester|Opequon]], and [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]]. A majority of its fighting was in [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]].\n\nThe regiment was formed in [[New York City]] by Othniel De Forest. Training began in New York before the regiment moved to [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. [[John Hammond (U.S. Representative)|John Hammond]] and Abram H. Krom provided much of the unit's on-field leadership. Both began as captains and finished their military careers as commander of the regiment. The regiment was originally involved with the defense of Washington, and subsequently served in the [[Army of the Potomac]] and then the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]].\n\nThe regiment had 8 officers and 93 men killed or mortally wounded. Disease killed 3 more officers and 222 more enlisted men. Among the prisons where captured members of the regiment were kept were [[Libby Prison]] in Richmond and [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville Prison]] in Georgia. The regiment was commanded by eight different men, although two were in command for only a few days. The [[Medal of Honor]] was awarded to six of the regiment's soldiers.\n\n==Formation and organization==\n{{See also|American Civil War|Origins of the American Civil War}}\nBetween December 20, 1860, and February 1, 1861, seven southern states [[Secession in the United States|seceded]] from the United States and formed the [[Confederate States of America]]. Fighting began on April 12, 1861, when American troops were attacked at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. This is considered the beginning of the American Civil War.

The regiment had a good fighting reputation, and had important roles in the [[Battle of Hanover]] and the [[Battle of the Wilderness]]. It was present at nearly 175 battles and skirmishes, including [[Battle of Gettysburg, third day cavalry battles|Gettysburg]], [[Third Battle of Winchester|Opequon]], and [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]]. A majority of its fighting was in [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]].\n\nThe regiment was formed in [[New York City]] by Othniel De Forest. Training began in New York before the regiment moved to [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. [[John Hammond (U.S. Representative)|John Hammond]] and Abram H. Krom provided much of the unit's on-field leadership. Both began as captains and finished their military careers as commander of the regiment. The regiment was originally involved with the defense of Washington, and subsequently served in the [[Army of the Potomac]] and then the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]].\n\nThe regiment had 8 officers and 93 men killed or mortally wounded. Disease killed 3 more officers and 222 more enlisted men. Among the prisons where captured members of the regiment were kept were [[Libby Prison]] in Richmond and [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville Prison]] in Georgia. The regiment was commanded by eight different men, although two were in command for only a few days. The [[Medal of Honor]] was awarded to six of the regiment's soldiers.\n\n==Formation and organization==\n{{See also|American Civil War|Origins of the American Civil War}}\nBetween December 20, 1860, and February 1, 1861, seven southern states [[Secession in the United States|seceded]] from the United States and formed the [[Confederate States of America]]. Fighting began on April 12, 1861, when American troops were attacked at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. This is considered the beginning of the American Civil War. Four additional states, including [[Virginia]], seceded during the next three months.<ref name=\"CWTfacts\">{{cite web\n|title=Civil War Facts\n|publisher=Civil War Trust\n|url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/civil-war-facts\n|accessdate=2017-06-25}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Othniel De Forest 5NY Cavalry.png|thumb|120px|right|Col.

He is frequently cited as one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history. His films, which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories, cover a wide range of genres, and are noted for their [[realism (art movement)|realism]], dark humor, unique cinematography, extensive set designs, and evocative use of music.\n\nKubrick was raised in [[the Bronx]], New York City, and attended [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|William Howard Taft High School]] from 1941 to 1945. He received average grades, but displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school. After working as a photographer for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films on a shoestring budget, and made his first major Hollywood film, ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'', for [[United Artists]] in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with [[Kirk Douglas]], the war picture ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957) and the historical epic ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960). His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew, and he was approached by [[Marlon Brando]] to film what would become ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961), though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself.\n\nCreative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of the Hollywood industry, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at [[Childwickbury Manor]] in [[Hertfordshire]], which he shared with his wife [[Christiane Kubrick|Christiane]], became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first productions in Britain were two films with [[Peter Sellers]], ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) and ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964).\n\nA demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the [[filmmaking]] process, from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators. He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same shot in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography. The scientific realism and innovative special effects of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) were without precedent in the history of cinema, and the film earned him his only personal Oscar, for Best [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Visual Effects]]. [[Steven Spielberg]] has referred to the film as his generation's \"big bang\", and it is regarded as one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films ever made]]. For the 18th-century period film ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975), Kubrick obtained [[Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7|lenses developed by Zeiss]] for [[NASA]], to film scenes under natural candlelight. With ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), he became one of the first directors to make use of a [[Steadicam]] for stabilized and fluid tracking shots.

He didn't say much. He was thin, skinny, and kind of poor\u2014like we all were.\"{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=38}} Kubrick quickly became known for his story-telling in photographs. His first, published on April 16, 1946, was entitled \"A Short Story from a Movie Balcony\" and staged a fracas between a man and a woman, during which the man is slapped in the face, caught genuinely by surprise.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=19}} In another assignment, 18 pictures were taken of various people waiting in a dental office. It has been said retrospectively that this project demonstrated an early interest of Kubrick in capturing individuals and their feelings in mundane environments.{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=36}} In 1948, he was sent to Portugal to document a travel piece, and covered the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]].{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=30}}{{efn|Coverage of the circus gave Kubrick grounds for developing his documentary skills and capturing athletic movements on camera, and the photos were published in a four-page spread for the May 25 issue, \"Meet the People\". The same issue also covered his journalism work documenting the work of opera star [[Ris\u00eb Stevens]] with deaf children.{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|pp=41\u20132}}}} Kubrick, a boxing enthusiast, eventually began photographing boxing matches for the magazine. His earliest, \"Prizefighter\", was published on January 18, 1949, and captured a boxing match and the events leading up to it, featuring [[Walter Cartier]].{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=59}} On April 2, 1949, he published a photo essay, named \"Chicago-City of Extremes\" in ''Look'', which displayed his talent early on for creating atmosphere with imagery, including a photograph taken above a congested Chicago street at night. The following year, on July 18, 1950, the magazine published his photo essay, \"Working Debutante \u2013 [[Betsy von Furstenberg]]\", which featured a [[Pablo Picasso]] portrait of Angel F. de Soto in the background.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=16\u20137}} Kubrick was also assigned to photograph numerous jazz musicians, from [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Erroll Garner]] to [[George Lewis (clarinetist)|George Lewis]], [[Eddie Condon]], [[Phil Napoleon]], [[Papa Celestin]], [[Alphonse Picou]], [[Muggsy Spanier]], [[Sharkey Bonano]], and others.{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=52}}\n\nKubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz on May 28, 1948. They lived together in a small apartment at 36 West 16th Street, off [[Sixth Avenue]] just north of [[Greenwich Village]].{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=31}} During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the cinemas of New York City. He was inspired by the complex, fluid camerawork of the director [[Max Oph\u00fcls]], whose films influenced Kubrick's later visual style, and by the director [[Elia Kazan]], whom he described as America's \"best director\" at that time, with his ability of \"performing miracles\" with his actors.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=36}} Friends began to notice that Kubrick had become obsessed with the art of filmmaking\u2014one friend, [[David Vaughan (dance archivist)|David Vaughan]], observed that Kubrick would scrutinize the film at the cinema when it went silent, and would go back to reading his paper when people started talking.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=19}} He also spent many hours reading books on film theory and writing down notes. [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s theoretical writings had a profound impact on Kubrick, and he took a great number of notes from books in the library of [[Arthur Rothstein]], the photographic technical director of ''Look'' magazine.{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=37}}{{efn| Kubrick was particularly fascinated with Eisenstein's ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' and played the [[Prokofiev]] soundtrack to the film over and over constantly to the point that his sister broke it in fury.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=23}}}}\n\n==Film career==\n{{see also|Filmography and awards of Stanley Kubrick}}\n\n===Short films (1951\u20131953)===\nKubrick shared a love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who after graduating from high school had the intention of directing a film version of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. Through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company, [[The March of Time]], Kubrick learned that it could cost $40,000 to make a proper short film, money he could not afford. He had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning all he could about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=23}}\n\nKubrick decided to make a short film documentary about boxer [[Walter Cartier]], whom he had photographed and written about for ''Look'' magazine a year earlier. He rented a camera and produced a 16-minute black-and-white documentary, ''[[Day of the Fight]]''. Kubrick found the money independently to finance it. He had considered asking [[Montgomery Clift]] to narrate it, whom he had met during a photographic session for ''Look'', but settled on CBS news veteran [[Douglas Edwards]].{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=68}} According to Paul Duncan the film was \"remarkably accomplished for a first film\", and used a backward tracking shot to film a scene in which Cartier and his brother walk towards the camera, a device which later became one of Kubrick's characteristic camera movements.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=25}} Vincent Cartier, Walter's brother and manager, later reflected on his observations of Kubrick during the filming. He said, \"Stanley was a very stoic, impassive but imaginative type person with strong, imaginative thoughts. He commanded respect in a quiet, shy way. Whatever he wanted, you complied, he just captivated you. Anybody who worked with Stanley did just what Stanley wanted\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=23}}{{efn|Walter Cartier also said of Kubrick: \"Stanley comes in prepared like a fighter for a big fight, he knows exactly what he's doing, where he's going and what he wants to accomplish. He knew the challenges and he overcame them\".{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=59}}}} After a score was added by Singer's friend [[Gerald Fried]], Kubrick had spent $3900 in making it, and sold it to RKO-Path\u00e9 for $4000, which was the most the company had ever paid for a short film at the time.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=25}} Kubrick described his first effort at filmmaking as having been valuable since he believed himself to have been forced to do most of the work,{{Sfn|King|Molloy|Tzioumakis|2013|p=156}} and he later declared that the \"best education in film is to make one\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=15}}\n\nInspired by this early success, Kubrick quit his job at ''Look'' and visited professional filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about the technical aspects of filmmaking. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker because of the number of bad films he had seen, remarking, \"I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, but I know I can make a better film than that\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=13}} He began making ''[[Flying Padre]]'' (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called \"Sky Pilot\", a pun on the slang term for a priest.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=39}} During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in ''Flying Padre'' are later echoed in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) and ''[[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|Ivan the Terrible]]'' (1944/1958).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=25}}\n\n''Flying Padre'' was followed by ''[[The Seafarers]]'' (1953), Kubrick's first color film, which was shot for the [[Seafarers International Union of North America|Seafarers International Union]] in June 1953. It has shots of ships, machinery, a canteen, and a union meeting. For the cafeteria scene in the film, Kubrick chose a long, sideways-shooting [[dolly shot]] to establish the life of the seafarer's community; this shot is an early demonstration of a technique which would become a signature of his. The montage of speaker and audience echoes scenes from Eisenstein's ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925) and ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'' (1928).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=28}} ''Day of the Fight'', ''Flying Padre'' and ''The Seafarers'' constitute Kubrick's only surviving documentary works; some historians believe he made others.{{Sfn|Thuss|2002|p=110}}\n\n===Early feature work (1953\u20131955)===\n[[File:Fear and Desire (1953).webm|thumb|''Fear and Desire'' (1953)]]\nAfter raising $1000 showing his short films to friends and family, Kubrick found the finances to begin making his first feature film, ''[[Fear and Desire]]'' (1953), originally running with the title ''The Trap'', written by his friend [[Howard Sackler]]. Kubrick's uncle, Martin Perveler, a Los Angeles pharmacy owner, invested a further $9000 on condition that he be credited as executive producer of the film.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=26}} Kubrick assembled several actors and a small crew totaling 14 people (five actors, five crewmen, and four others to help transport the equipment) and flew to the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] in California for a five-week, low-budget shoot.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=26}}   Later renamed ''The Shape of Fear'' before finally being named ''Fear and Desire'', it is a fictional [[allegory]] about a team of soldiers who survive a plane crash and are caught behind enemy lines in a war. During the course of the film, one of the soldiers becomes infatuated with an attractive girl in the woods and binds her to a tree. This scene is noted for its close-ups on the face of the actress. Kubrick had intended for ''Fear and Desire'' to be a [[silent film|silent picture]] in order to ensure low production costs; the added sounds, effects, and music ultimately brought production costs to around $53,000, exceeding the budget.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=50}} He was bailed out by producer [[Richard de Rochemont]] on the condition that he help in de Rochemont's production of a five-part television series about [[Abraham Lincoln]] on location in [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=26\u20137}}\n\n''Fear and Desire'' was a commercial failure, but garnered several positive reviews upon release. Critics such as the reviewer from ''[[The New York Times]]'' believed that Kubrick's professionalism as a photographer shone through in the picture, and that he \"artistically caught glimpses of the grotesque attitudes of death, the wolfishness of hungry men, as well as their bestiality, and in one scene, the wracking effect of lust on a pitifully juvenile soldier and the pinioned girl he is guarding\". Columbia University scholar [[Mark Van Doren]] was highly impressed by the scenes with the girl bound to the tree, remarking that it would live on as a \"beautiful, terrifying and weird\" sequence which illustrated Kubrick's immense talent and guaranteed his future success.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=27}} Kubrick himself later expressed embarrassment with ''Fear and Desire'', and attempted over the years to keep prints of the film out of circulation.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=56}}{{efn|Kubrick called ''Fear and Desire'' a \"bumbling, amateur film exercise&nbsp;... a completely inept oddity, boring and pretentious\", and also referred to it as \"a lousy feature, very self-conscious, easily discernible as an intellectual effort, but very roughly, and poorly, and ineffectively made\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=27}}}} During the production of the film, Stanley almost killed his cast with poisonous gasses by mistake.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867001,00.html|title=\"The New Pictures,\" ''Time'', June 4, 1956 | date=June 4, 1956 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFollowing ''Fear and Desire'', Kubrick began working on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the commercial failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a [[film noir]] script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title ''Kiss Me, Kill Me'', and then ''The Nymph and the Maniac'', ''[[Killer's Kiss]]'' (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like ''Fear and Desire'', it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=28}} Kubrick began shooting footage in [[Times Square]], and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with [[cinematography]] and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12\u201314 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=30}}\n[[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929) directly influenced the film with the painting laughing at a character, and [[Martin Scorsese]] has, in turn, cited Kubrick's innovative shooting angles and atmospheric shots in ''Killer's Kiss'' as an influence on ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=32}} Actress [[Chris Chase|Irene Kane]], the star of ''Killer's Kiss'', observed: \"Stanley's a fascinating character. He thinks movies should move, with a minimum of dialogue, and he's all for sex and sadism\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=63}} ''Killer's Kiss'' met with limited commercial success and made very little money in comparison with its production budget of $75,000.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=32}} Critics have praised the film's camerawork, but its acting and story are generally considered mediocre.{{sfnm|1a1=Baxter|1y=1997|1p=69|2a1=Duncan|2y=2003|2p=32}}{{efn|Kubrick himself thought of the film as an amateurish effort\u2014a student film.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=102}} Despite this, the film historian Alexander Walker considers the film to be \"oddly compelling\".{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=55}}}}\n\n===Hollywood success and beyond (1956\u20131962)===\nWhile playing chess in Washington Square, Kubrick met producer [[James B.

The film starred [[Sterling Hayden]], with whom Kubrick had been impressed in ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'' (1950).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=38}}\n\nKubrick and Harris moved to [[Los Angeles]] from New York City and signed with the [[Sam Jaffe (producer)|Jaffe Agency]] to shoot the picture, which became Kubrick's first full-length feature film shot with a professional cast and crew. The Union in Hollywood stated that Kubrick would not be permitted to be both the director and the cinematographer of the movie, so veteran cinematographer [[Lucien Ballard]] was hired for the shooting. Kubrick agreed to waive his fee for the production, which was shot in just 24 days on a budget of $330,000.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=115}} He clashed with Ballard during the shooting, and on one occasion Kubrick threatened to fire Ballard following a camera dispute, despite being only 27 years old at the time and 20 years Ballard's junior.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=38}} Hayden recalled that Kubrick was \"cold and detached. Very mechanical, always confident.

Several contemporary critics lauded the film, with a reviewer for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' comparing its camerawork to that of [[Orson Welles]].{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=43}} Today, critics generally consider ''The Killing'' to be among the best films of Kubrick's early career; its nonlinear narrative and clinical execution also had a major influence on later directors of [[crime film]]s, including [[Quentin Tarantino]]. [[Dore Schary]] of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] was highly impressed as well, and offered Kubrick and Harris $75,000 to write, direct, and produce a film, which ultimately became ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=42}}{{efn|Kubrick and Harris had thought that the positive reception from critics had made their presence known in Hollywood, but [[Max Youngstein]] of United Artists disagreed with Schary on the merit of the film and still considered Kubrick and Harris to be \"Not far from the bottom\" of the pool of new talent at the time. {{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=42}}}}\n\n[[File:Paths of Glory trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolphe Menjou]] (''left'') and [[Kirk Douglas]] (''right'') in ''Paths of Glory'' (1957)]]\n''Paths of Glory'', set during [[World War I]], is based on [[Humphrey Cobb]]'s 1935 antiwar novel, which Kubrick had read while waiting in his father's office.

''Paths of Glory'' became Kubrick's first significant commercial success, and established him as an up-and-coming young filmmaker. Critics praised the film's unsentimental, spare, and unvarnished combat scenes and its raw, black-and-white cinematography.

Kubrick became preoccupied with the issue of [[nuclear war]] as the [[Cold War]] unfolded in the 1950s, and even considered moving to Australia because he feared that New York City might be a likely target for the Russians.

Just before filming began, Kubrick hired noted journalist and satirical author [[Terry Southern]] to transform the script into its final form, a black comedy, loaded with sexual innuendo,{{sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=87\u20139}} becoming a film which showed Kubrick's talents as a \"unique kind of absurdist\" according to the film scholar Abrams.{{sfn|Abrams|2007|p=30}} Southern made major contributions to the final script, and was co-credited (above Peter George) in the film's opening titles; his perceived role in the writing later led to a public rift between Kubrick and Peter George, who subsequently complained in a letter to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine that Southern's intense but relatively brief (November 16 to December 28, 1962) involvement with the project was being given undue prominence in the media, while his own role as the author of the film's source novel, and his ten-month stint as the script's co-writer, were being downplayed \u2013 a perception Kubrick evidently did little to address.<ref>Hill, Lee (2001).

The story is based on [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s 1926 Freudian novella ''Traumnovelle'' (''[[Dream Story]]'' in English), which Kubrick relocated from turn-of-the-century Vienna to New York City in the 1990s. Kubrick said of the novel: \"A difficult book to describe\u2014what good book isn't.

He had intended hiring the armed forces of an entire country to make the film, as he considered Napoleonic battles to be \"so beautiful, like vast lethal ballets\", with an \"aesthetic brilliance that doesn't require a military mind to appreciate\". He wanted them to be replicated as authentically as possible on screen.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=236\u20137}} Kubrick had sent research teams to scout for locations across Europe, and commissioned screenwriter and director [[Andrew Birkin]], one of his young assistants on ''2001'', to the [[Isle of Elba]], [[Slavkov u Brna|Austerlitz]], and [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], taking thousands of pictures for his later perusal.

Work on ''Aryan Papers'' depressed Kubrick enormously, and he eventually decided that Steven Spielberg's ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) covered much of the same material.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=179}}\n\nAccording to biographer John Baxter, Kubrick had shown an interest in directing a [[pornographic film]] based on a satirical novel written by Terry Southern, titled ''[[Blue Movie (novel)|Blue Movie]]'', about a director who makes Hollywood's first big-budget porn film. Baxter claims that Kubrick concluded that he did not have the patience or temperament to become involved in the porn industry, and Southern stated that Kubrick was \"too ultra conservative\" towards sexuality to have gone ahead with it, but liked the idea.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=195, 248}} Kubrick was unable to direct a film of Umberto Eco's ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' as Eco had given his publisher instructions to never sell the film rights to any of his books after his dissatisfaction with the film version of ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Film Review|year=2000|publisher=Orpheus Pub.|page=11}}</ref> Also, when the film rights to [[J.

Kubrick recommended this work to others for many years. Thomas Nelson describes this book as \"the greatest influence of any single written work on the evolution of [Kubrick's] private aesthetics\". Kubrick also found the ideas of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] to be essential to his understanding the basics of directing, and gave himself a crash course to learn his methods.{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=21}}\n\nKubrick's family and many critics felt that his Jewish ancestry may have contributed to his worldview and aspects of his films. After his death, both his daughter and wife stated that he was not religious, but \"did not deny his Jewishness, not at all\".

British screenwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], who worked closely with Kubrick in his final years, believes that the originality of Kubrick's films was partly because he \"had a (Jewish?) respect for scholars\". He declared that it was \"absurd to try to understand Stanley Kubrick without reckoning on Jewishness as a fundamental aspect of his mentality\".{{sfn|Raphael|1999|pp=107\u20138}}\n[[File:Madame de...par Max Oph\u00fcls de 1953.jpg|thumb|left|Director [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] was a major influence on Kubrick; pictured is his film ''[[The Earrings of Madame de...]]'' (1953).]]\nWalker notes that Kubrick was influenced by the tracking and \"fluid camera\" styles of director [[Max Oph\u00fcls]], and used them in many of his films, including ''Paths of Glory'' and ''2001: A Space Odyssey''. Kubrick noted how in Ophuls' films \"the camera went through every wall and every floor\".{{Sfn|Kagan|2000|p=2}} He once named Oph\u00fcls' ''[[Le Plaisir]]'' (1952) as his favorite film. According to film historian John Wakeman, Oph\u00fcls himself learned the technique from director [[Anatole Litvak]] in the 1930s, when he was his assistant, and whose work was \"replete with the camera trackings, pans and swoops which later became the trademark of Max Oph\u00fcls\".{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=677\u201383}} Geoffrey Cocks believes that Kubrick was also influenced by Oph\u00fcls' stories of thwarted love and a preoccupation with predatory men, while Herr notes that Kubrick was deeply inspired by [[G. W.

He explained in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna:\n<blockquote>\"One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, what is it that you were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what [[T. S. Eliot]] said to someone who had asked him\u2014I believe it was ''[[The Waste Land]]''\u2014what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said.' If I could have said it any differently, I would have\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=12}}</blockquote>\n\nKubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can be appreciated both by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual, because their \"emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects\". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction experienced by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=12}} In a ''Time'' magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: \"The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves.\"{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=13}} He also said: \"Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=161}}\n\n[[File:Production notes (8648671917).jpg|thumb|left|Kubrick's production notes from ''The Killing'']]\n[[Diane Johnson]], who co-wrote the screenplay for ''The Shining'' with Kubrick, notes that he \"always said that it was better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and that you should choose a work that isn't a masterpiece so you can improve on it. Which is what he's always done, except with ''Lolita''\".{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=293}} When deciding on a subject for a film, there were a number of aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would \"appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=11}} According to his co-producer [[Jan Harlan]], Kubrick mostly \"wanted to make films about things that mattered, that not only had form, but substance\".<ref name=Rose>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinephiliabeyond.org/an-hour-about-the-life-and-work-of-filmmaker-stanley-kubrick/ |title=An hour about the life and work of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick |publisher=Video interview with Charlie Rose, Christiane Kubrick, Martin Scorsese and Jan Harlan |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=August 11, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220024522/http://www.cinephiliabeyond.org/an-hour-about-the-life-and-work-of-filmmaker-stanley-kubrick/ |archivedate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> Kubrick believed that audiences quite often were attracted to \"enigmas and allegories\" and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly.{{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=38}}\n\nAlthough none of his features display graphic sex scenes, sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the \"furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape\" in his films.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=248}} He further points out that films like ''A Clockwork Orange'' are \"powerfully homoerotic\", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being \"made up with doll-like false eyelashes\", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid ([[Aubrey Morris]]).{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=250}} British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be \"preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil\", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as \"black as coal\", questioning his outlook on humanity.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=14}} A few of his pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as ''Lolita'' and ''Dr. Strangelove''; many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining \"the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=10}} Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost \"obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one\".{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=59}}\nKubrick stated that \"there is no deliberate pattern to the stories that I have chosen to make into films. About the only factor at work each time is that I try not to repeat myself\".{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=153}} As a result, Kubrick was often misunderstood by critics, and only once did he have unanimously positive reviews upon the release of a film\u2014for ''Paths of Glory''.{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=297}}\n\n===Writing and staging scenes===\n[[File:Tunnel Arancia Meccancia.jpg|thumb|The tunnel used in the making of ''A Clockwork Orange'']]\nFilm author Patrick Webster considers Kubrick's methods of writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical [[auteur theory]] of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming.{{sfn|Webster|2010|p=68}} Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick's collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness to allow him to improvise a scene, stating that \"there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn't work he knew it, and we had to keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=68}}\nOnce Kubrick was confident in the overall staging of a scene, and felt the actors were prepared, he would then develop the visual aspects, including camera and lighting placement. Walker believes that Kubrick was one of \"very few film directors competent to instruct their lighting photographers in the precise effect they want\".{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=26}} Baxter believes that Kubrick was heavily influenced by his ancestry and always possessed a European perspective to filmmaking, particularly the Austro-Hungarian empire and his admiration for Max Ophuls and [[Richard Strauss]].{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=13}}\n\n[[Gilbert Adair]], writing in a review for ''Full Metal Jacket'', commented that \"Kubrick's approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression\".{{Sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=12\u20133}} Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a \"visual filmmaker\", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=295}} Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it \"more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals\" as he put it.{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=26}} Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: \"I think you have to view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=145}} Kubrick also said: \"I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools.\"{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=157}}\n\n===Directing===\n{{quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=They work with Stanley and go through hells that nothing in their careers could have prepared them for, they think they must have been mad to get involved, they think that they'd die before they would ever work with him again, that fixated maniac; and when it's all behind them and the profound fatigue of so much intensity has worn off, they'd do anything in the world to work for him again.

Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=38}} Nicole Kidman explains that the large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a \"deeper place\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index4.html |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 4 |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |date=February 22, 2002 |accessdate=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524201007/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index4.html |archivedate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as \"irrational\"; he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=403}} Kubrick explained: \"Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try\"&nbsp;...{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=94}}\n\n\"When you make a movie, it takes a few days just to get used to the crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=73}} He also told biographer Michel Ciment: \"It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera.\"{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=153}}\n\nKubrick would devote his personal breaks to having lengthy discussions with actors. Among those who valued his attention was [[Tony Curtis]], star of ''Spartacus'', who said Kubrick was his favorite director, adding, \"his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors.\"{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=193}} He further added, \"Kubrick had his own approach to film-making. He wanted to see the actor's faces. He didn't want cameras always in a wide shot twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, he wanted to keep the camera moving. That was his style.\"{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=2}} Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in ''A Clockwork Orange'', noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which is what made Kubrick \"such a great director\".{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=38}} Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvise and to \"break the rules\", particularly with Peter Sellers in ''Lolita'', which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=136}}\nDuring an interview, Ryan O'Neal recalled Kubrick's directing style: \"God, he works you hard. He moves you, pushes you, helps you, gets cross with you, but above all he teaches you the value of a good director. Stanley brought out aspects of my personality and acting instincts that had been dormant&nbsp;... My strong suspicion [was] that I was involved in something great\".{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=385}} He further added that working with Kubrick was \"a stunning experience\" and that he never recovered from working with somebody of such magnificence.<ref name=tribute>{{cite web|title=Stanley Kubrick: Five legendary stories of the filmmaker 'with the black eyes' |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/11/09/stanley-kubrick-stories |work=Entertainment Weekly |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |date=November 9, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006054445/http://www.ew.com/article/2012/11/09/stanley-kubrick-stories |archivedate=October 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\n[[File:WarRoomModel.DrStrangelove.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the War Room from ''Dr Strangelove'']]\nKubrick credited the ease with which he photographed scenes to his early years as a photographer.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=196}} He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to handle that after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=177}} Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as \"a detective\".{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=176}} Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] on ''Barry Lyndon'', remarked that Kubrick \"questions everything\",{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=407}} and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer. Alcott considered Kubrick to be the \"nearest thing to genius I've ever worked with, with all the problems of a genius\".{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=391}}\n\n[[File:Stanley Kubrick LACMA exhibit - \"A\" Camera.jpg|thumb|Kubrick's camera, possibly used in ''Barry Lyndon'']]\nAmong Kubrick's innovations in cinematography are his use of special effects, as in ''2001'', where he used both [[slit-scan photography]] and [[front projection effect|front-screen projection]], which won Kubrick his only Oscar for special effects. Some reviewers have described and illustrated with video clips, Kubrick's use of \"[[one-point perspective]]\", which leads the viewer's eye towards a central vanishing point. The technique relies on creating a complex visual symmetry using parallel lines in a scene which all converge on that single point, leading away from the viewer. Combined with camera motion it could produce an effect that one writer describes as \"hypnotic and thrilling\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Sampson, Mike |url=http://screencrush.com/kubrick-one-point-perspective-mashup/ |title=Must Watch: Kubrick and the Art of the One-Point Perspective |work=Screen Crush |date=August 30, 2012 |accessdate=December 30, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101031717/http://screencrush.com/kubrick-one-point-perspective-mashup/ |archivedate=January 1, 2015}}</ref> ''The Shining'' was among the first half-dozen features to use the then-revolutionary [[Steadicam]] (after the 1976 films ''[[Bound for Glory (1976 film)|Bound for Glory]]'', ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' and ''[[Rocky]]''). Kubrick used it to its fullest potential, which gave the audience smooth, stabilized, motion-tracking by the camera. Kubrick described Steadicam as being like a \"magic carpet\", allowing \"fast, flowing, camera movements\" in the maze in ''The Shining'' which otherwise would have been impossible.{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=189}}\n\nKubrick was among the first directors to use [[video assist]] during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of ''2001'', he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=294}} On some films, such as ''Barry Lyndon'', he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly zoom out to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's technical knowledge about lenses \"dazzled the manufacturer's engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers\".{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=389}} For ''Barry Lyndon'' he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using \"pure candlelight\", and in doing so Kubrick \"made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting&nbsp;... You almost posed like for portraits.\"{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=400}} LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick's \"magic lens\" and that he became a \"legend\" among cameramen around the world.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=408}}\n\n===Editing and music===\n[[File:Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti (1984).jpg|thumb|[[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], whose music Kubrick used in ''2001'', ''The Shining'' and ''Eyes Wide Shut''|upright]]\nKubrick spent extensive hours editing, often working seven days a week, and more hours a day as he got closer to deadlines.{{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=42}} For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element to be put in balance with [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]] (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by [[Vsevolod Pudovkin|Pudovkin]]'s treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often \"re-direct\" a film, and he remarked: \"I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking&nbsp;... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form\u2014a point so important it cannot be overstressed&nbsp;... It can make or break a film\".{{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=42}} Biographer John Baxter stated that \"Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months&nbsp;... he arranged and rearranged the tens of thousands of scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing\".{{Sfn|Baxter|1997|p=6}}\n\nKubrick's attention to music was an aspect of what many referred to as his \"perfectionism\" and extreme attention to minute details, which his wife Christiane attributed to an addiction to music. In his last six films, Kubrick usually chose music from existing sources, especially classical compositions. He preferred selecting recorded music over having it composed for a film, believing that no hired composer could do as well as the public domain classical composers. He also felt that building scenes from great music often created the \"most memorable scenes\" in the best films.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|pp=153, 156}} In one instance, for a scene in ''Barry Lyndon'' which was written into the screenplay as merely, \"Barry duels with Lord Bullingdon\", he spent forty-two working days in the editing phase. During that period, he listened to what LoBrutto describes as \"every available recording of seventeenth-and eighteenth- century music, acquiring thousands of records to find [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s sarabande used to score the scene\".{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=405}} Jack Nicholson likewise observed his attention to music for his films, stating that Kubrick \"listened constantly to music until he discovered something he felt was right or that excited him\".{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=297}}\n\nKubrick is credited with introducing Hungarian composer [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]] to a broad Western audience by including his music in ''2001'', ''The Shining'' and ''Eyes Wide Shut''. According to Baxter, the music in ''2001'' was \"at the forefront of Kubrick's mind\" when he conceived the film.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=225}} During earlier screening he played music by [[Mendelssohn]]{{efn|Baxter states that Kubrick had originally intended using the scherzo from Mendelssohn's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' to accompany the shuttle docking at the space station but changed his mind after hearing Johann Strauss's ''[[The Blue Danube|Blue Danube]]'' waltz.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=226}}}} and [[Vaughan Williams]], and Kubrick and writer Clarke had listened to [[Carl Orff]]'s transcription of ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', consisting of 13th century sacred and secular songs.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=225}} Ligeti's music employed the new style of [[micropolyphony]], which used sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly over time, a style he originated. Its inclusion in the film became a \"boon for the relatively unknown composer\" partly because it was introduced alongside background by [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]] and [[Richard Strauss]].{{Sfn|Duchesneau|Marx|2011|p=xx}}\n\nIn addition to Ligeti, Kubrick also enjoyed a collaboration with composer [[Wendy Carlos]], whose 1968 album ''[[Switched-On Bach]]''\u2014which re-interpreted [[baroque music]] through the use of a [[Moog synthesizer]]\u2014caught his attention. In 1971, Carlos composed and recorded music for the soundtrack of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Additional music not used in the film was released in 1972 as ''[[Wendy Carlos's Clockwork Orange]]''. Kubrick later collaborated with Carlos on ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980). The opening of the film, in which the camera follows Jack Torrance's yellow VW beetle through the mountains to the Overlook Hotel, employs Carlos' eerie rendering of \"Dies Irae\" (Day of Wrath) from [[Hector Berlioz|Hector Berlioz's]] ''[[Symphonie fantastique|Symphonie Fantastique]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/shining_opening.htm |title=Kubrick's ''The Shining'' \u2013 The Opening |author= |date= |work=idyllopuspress.com |accessdate=March 10, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305203245/http://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/shining_opening.htm |archivedate=March 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{main|Personal life of Stanley Kubrick|Political and religious beliefs of Stanley Kubrick}}\nKubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz, a caricaturist, on May 29, 1948, when he was nineteen years old. They had attended Taft High School together and had lived in the same apartment block on Shakespeare Avenue.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=19}} The couple lived together in [[Greenwich Village]] and divorced three years later in 1951. He met his second wife, the Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer [[Ruth Sobotka]], in 1952. They lived together in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] beginning in 1952, married in January 1955, and moved to Hollywood in July 1955, where she played a brief part as a ballet dancer in Kubrick's film, ''Killer's Kiss'' (1955). The following year she was art director for his film, ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'' (1956). They divorced in 1957.{{sfn|Duncan|2003a|p=48}}\n\nDuring the production of ''Paths of Glory'' in Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress [[Christiane Kubrick|Christiane Harlan]], who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and the couple remained together for 40 years, until his death in 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together: Anya Renata (April 6, 1959 \u2013 July 7, 2009) and [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian Vanessa]] (born August 5, 1960).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=68}} In 1959 they settled into a home at 316 South Camden Drive in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, aged six.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=165}} They also lived in New York City, during which time Christiane studied art at the [[Art Students League of New York]], later becoming an independent artist.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=224}} The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make ''Lolita'', and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film, ''Dr. Strangelove''. Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite convenient to Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, and he and Christiane had become alarmed with the increase in violence in New York City.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=271}}\n[[File:Stanley Kubricks G\u00e4stehaus.jpg|thumb|Stanley Kubrick Guest House at Abbots Mead, Borehamwood where he edited his most important films]]\n[[File:20050613-007-childwickbury.jpg|thumb|Kubrick's [[Childwickbury Manor]] in Hertfordshire, England]]\nIn 1965 the Kubricks bought Abbots Mead on Barnet Lane, just south-west of the Elstree/Borehamwood studio complex in England. Kubrick worked almost exclusively from this home for 14 years where, with some exceptions, he researched, invented special effects techniques, designed ultra-low light lenses for specially modified cameras, pre-produced, edited, post-produced, advertised, distributed and carefully managed all aspects of four of his films. In 1978, Kubrick moved into [[Childwickbury Manor]] in [[Hertfordshire]], a mainly 18th-century stately home, which was once owned by a wealthy racehorse owner, about {{convert|30|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}} north of London and a 10-minute drive from his previous home at Abbotts Mead. His new home became a workplace for Kubrick and his wife, \"a perfect family factory\" as Christiane called it,{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=374}} and Kubrick converted the stables into extra production rooms besides ones within the home that he used for editing and storage.{{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=368}}\n\nA workaholic, Kubrick rarely took a vacation or left England during the forty years before his death.{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=145}} LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, similar to those of [[Greta Garbo]], [[Howard Hughes]], and [[J. D. Salinger]].{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=1}} Michael Herr, Kubrick's co-screenwriter on ''Full Metal Jacket'', who knew him well, considers his \"reclusiveness\" to be myth: \"[He] was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people&nbsp;... he was one of the most gregarious men I ever knew, and it didn't change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone.\" {{sfn|Herr|2001|p=6}} LoBrutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was because he insisted in remaining near his home, but the reason for this was because for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York City or around London. He disliked living in Los Angeles, and thought London a superior film production center to New York City.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=491}}\n\nAs a person, Kubrick was described by [[Norman Lloyd]] as \"a very dark, sort of a glowering type who was very serious\".{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=85}} [[Marisa Berenson]], who starred in ''Barry Lyndon'', fondly recalled: \"There was great tenderness in him and he was passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence, but he also had a great sense of humor. He was a very shy person and self-protective, but he was filled with the thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day.\"{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=289}} Kubrick was particularly fond of machines and technical equipment, to the point that his wife Christiane once stated that \"Stanley would be happy with eight tape recorders and one pair of pants\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=7}} Kubrick had obtained a pilot's license in August 1947; some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying, stemming from an incident in the early 1950s when a colleague had been killed in a plane crash. Kubrick had been sent the charred remains of his camera and notebooks which, according to Duncan, traumatized him for life.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=62}}{{efn|Duncan notes that during the filming of ''Spartacus'' in Spain, Kubrick had suffered a nervous breakdown after the flight and was \"terribly ill\" during the filming there, and his return flight would be his last one.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=62}} [[Matthew Modine]], star of ''Full Metal Jacket'', has stated that the stories about his fear of flying were \"fabricated\", and that Kubrick simply preferred spending most of his time in England, where his films were produced and where he lived.<ref name=\"Modine2\">{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/07/matthew-modine-full-metal-jacket-app|title='Full Metal Jacket' at 25: Matthew Modine tries to answer, 'What was Stanley like?'|work= Entertainment Weekly|date=August 7, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2014|last=Labrecque|first=Jeff|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908110411/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/07/matthew-modine-full-metal-jacket-app/|archivedate=September 8, 2012}}</ref>}} Kubrick also had a strong mistrust of doctors and medicine, especially those he did not know, and on one occasion he had a dentist from the Bronx flown to London to treat him.{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=328}}\n\n===Death===\n\nOn March 7, 1999, six days after screening a final cut of ''Eyes Wide Shut'' for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep at the age of 70, suffering a heart attack.<ref>Jan Harlan in Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures\"</ref> His funeral was held five days later at his home estate at [[Childwickbury Manor]], with only close friends and family in attendance, totaling approximately 100 people.

He is frequently cited as one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history. His films, which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories, cover a wide range of genres, and are noted for their [[realism (art movement)|realism]], dark humor, unique cinematography, extensive set designs, and evocative use of music.\n\nKubrick was raised in [[the Bronx]], New York City, and attended [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|William Howard Taft High School]] from 1941 to 1945. He received average grades, but displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school. After working as a photographer for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films on a shoestring budget, and made his first major Hollywood film, ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'', for [[United Artists]] in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with [[Kirk Douglas]], the war picture ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957) and the historical epic ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960). His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew, and he was approached by [[Marlon Brando]] to film what would become ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961), though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself.\n\nCreative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of the Hollywood industry, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at [[Childwickbury Manor]] in [[Hertfordshire]], which he shared with his wife [[Christiane Kubrick|Christiane]], became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first productions in Britain were two films with [[Peter Sellers]], ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) and ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964).\n\nA demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the [[filmmaking]] process, from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators. He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same shot in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography. The scientific realism and innovative special effects of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) were without precedent in the history of cinema, and the film earned him his only personal Oscar, for Best [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Visual Effects]]. [[Steven Spielberg]] has referred to the film as his generation's \"big bang\", and it is regarded as one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films ever made]]. For the 18th-century period film ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975), Kubrick obtained [[Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7|lenses developed by Zeiss]] for [[NASA]], to film scenes under natural candlelight. With ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), he became one of the first directors to make use of a [[Steadicam]] for stabilized and fluid tracking shots. While many of Kubrick's films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release\u2014particularly ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971), which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the UK following a mass media frenzy\u2014most were nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]], [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], or [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Awards, and underwent critical reevaluations. His last film, ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', was completed shortly before his death in 1999 at the age of 70.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\nKubrick was born in the [[Society for the Lying-In Hospital|Lying-In Hospital]] at 307 Second Avenue in [[Manhattan]], New York City to a [[Jewish]] family.<ref name=jewishheritage>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/culture/345528/the-secret-jewish-history-of-stanley-kubrick/|title=The Secret Jewish History of Stanley Kubrick|publisher=}}</ref>{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=17}} He was the first of two children of Jacob Leonard Kubrick (May 21, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 October 19, 1985), known as Jack or Jacques, and his wife Sadie Gertrude Kubrick (''{{nee}}'' Perveler; October 28, 1903&nbsp;\u2013 April 23, 1985), known as Gert.

His [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] was discovered to be above average but his attendance was poor, and he missed 56 days in his first term alone, as many as he attended.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=17}} He displayed an interest in literature from a young age and began reading Greek and Roman myths and the fables of the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm brothers]] which \"instilled in him a lifelong affinity with Europe\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=18}} He spent most Saturdays during the summer watching the [[New York Yankees]] and would later photograph two boys watching the game in an assignment for ''Look'' magazine to emulate his own childhood excitement with baseball.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=19}} When Kubrick was 12 his father Jack taught him [[chess]]. The game remained a lifelong interest of Kubrick's,<ref>Bernstein, Jeremy, ''[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1966/11/12/how-about-a-little-game How about a little game?]'', New Yorker, November 12, 1966, republished on June 18, 2017 among a ''selection of stories from The New Yorker's archive''</ref> appearing in many of his films.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|pp=105\u20136}} Kubrick, who later became a member of the [[United States Chess Federation]], explained that chess helped him develop \"patience and discipline\" in making decisions.{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=11}} At the age of 13, Kubrick's father bought him a [[Graflex]] camera, triggering a fascination with [[Photography|still photography]]. He befriended a neighbor, Marvin Traub who shared his passion for photography.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=11}} Traub had his own darkroom where the young Kubrick and he would spend many hours perusing photographs and watching the chemicals \"magically make images on photographic paper\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=15}} The two indulged in numerous photographic projects for which they roamed the streets looking for interesting subjects to capture and spent time in local cinemas studying films. Freelance photographer [[Weegee]] (Arthur Fellig) had a considerable influence on Kubrick's development as a photographer; Kubrick would later hire Fellig as the special stills photographer for ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964).{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=22}} As a teenager Kubrick was also interested in [[jazz]], and briefly attempted a career as a drummer.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=26}}\n\nKubrick attended [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|William Howard Taft High School]] from 1941 to 1945.

Later in life Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve the excellence in school of which he knew Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the family library at home, while at the same time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.{{sfn|Cocks|2004| pp=22\u201325, 30}}\n\n==Photographic career==\n[[File:Stanley Kubrick 1949 with Rosemary Williams a showgirl.jpg|thumb|left|Kubrick with showgirl Rosemary Williams in 1949]]\nWhile still in high school Kubrick was chosen as an official school photographer.

G. Warren Schloat, Jr., another new photographer for the magazine at the time, recalled that he thought Kubrick lacked the personality to make it as a director in Hollywood, remarking, \"Stanley was a quiet fellow. He didn't say much. He was thin, skinny, and kind of poor\u2014like we all were.\"{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=38}} Kubrick quickly became known for his story-telling in photographs. His first, published on April 16, 1946, was entitled \"A Short Story from a Movie Balcony\" and staged a fracas between a man and a woman, during which the man is slapped in the face, caught genuinely by surprise.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=19}} In another assignment, 18 pictures were taken of various people waiting in a dental office. It has been said retrospectively that this project demonstrated an early interest of Kubrick in capturing individuals and their feelings in mundane environments.{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=36}} In 1948, he was sent to Portugal to document a travel piece, and covered the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]].{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=30}}{{efn|Coverage of the circus gave Kubrick grounds for developing his documentary skills and capturing athletic movements on camera, and the photos were published in a four-page spread for the May 25 issue, \"Meet the People\".

His earliest, \"Prizefighter\", was published on January 18, 1949, and captured a boxing match and the events leading up to it, featuring [[Walter Cartier]].{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=59}} On April 2, 1949, he published a photo essay, named \"Chicago-City of Extremes\" in ''Look'', which displayed his talent early on for creating atmosphere with imagery, including a photograph taken above a congested Chicago street at night. The following year, on July 18, 1950, the magazine published his photo essay, \"Working Debutante \u2013 [[Betsy von Furstenberg]]\", which featured a [[Pablo Picasso]] portrait of Angel F. de Soto in the background.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=16\u20137}} Kubrick was also assigned to photograph numerous jazz musicians, from [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Erroll Garner]] to [[George Lewis (clarinetist)|George Lewis]], [[Eddie Condon]], [[Phil Napoleon]], [[Papa Celestin]], [[Alphonse Picou]], [[Muggsy Spanier]], [[Sharkey Bonano]], and others.{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=52}}\n\nKubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz on May 28, 1948. They lived together in a small apartment at 36 West 16th Street, off [[Sixth Avenue]] just north of [[Greenwich Village]].{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=31}} During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the cinemas of New York City. He was inspired by the complex, fluid camerawork of the director [[Max Oph\u00fcls]], whose films influenced Kubrick's later visual style, and by the director [[Elia Kazan]], whom he described as America's \"best director\" at that time, with his ability of \"performing miracles\" with his actors.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=36}} Friends began to notice that Kubrick had become obsessed with the art of filmmaking\u2014one friend, [[David Vaughan (dance archivist)|David Vaughan]], observed that Kubrick would scrutinize the film at the cinema when it went silent, and would go back to reading his paper when people started talking.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=19}} He also spent many hours reading books on film theory and writing down notes. [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s theoretical writings had a profound impact on Kubrick, and he took a great number of notes from books in the library of [[Arthur Rothstein]], the photographic technical director of ''Look'' magazine.{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=37}}{{efn| Kubrick was particularly fascinated with Eisenstein's ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' and played the [[Prokofiev]] soundtrack to the film over and over constantly to the point that his sister broke it in fury.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=23}}}}\n\n==Film career==\n{{see also|Filmography and awards of Stanley Kubrick}}\n\n===Short films (1951\u20131953)===\nKubrick shared a love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who after graduating from high school had the intention of directing a film version of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. Through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company, [[The March of Time]], Kubrick learned that it could cost $40,000 to make a proper short film, money he could not afford. He had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning all he could about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=23}}\n\nKubrick decided to make a short film documentary about boxer [[Walter Cartier]], whom he had photographed and written about for ''Look'' magazine a year earlier. He rented a camera and produced a 16-minute black-and-white documentary, ''[[Day of the Fight]]''. Kubrick found the money independently to finance it. He had considered asking [[Montgomery Clift]] to narrate it, whom he had met during a photographic session for ''Look'', but settled on CBS news veteran [[Douglas Edwards]].{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=68}} According to Paul Duncan the film was \"remarkably accomplished for a first film\", and used a backward tracking shot to film a scene in which Cartier and his brother walk towards the camera, a device which later became one of Kubrick's characteristic camera movements.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=25}} Vincent Cartier, Walter's brother and manager, later reflected on his observations of Kubrick during the filming. He said, \"Stanley was a very stoic, impassive but imaginative type person with strong, imaginative thoughts. He commanded respect in a quiet, shy way. Whatever he wanted, you complied, he just captivated you. Anybody who worked with Stanley did just what Stanley wanted\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=23}}{{efn|Walter Cartier also said of Kubrick: \"Stanley comes in prepared like a fighter for a big fight, he knows exactly what he's doing, where he's going and what he wants to accomplish. He knew the challenges and he overcame them\".{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=59}}}} After a score was added by Singer's friend [[Gerald Fried]], Kubrick had spent $3900 in making it, and sold it to RKO-Path\u00e9 for $4000, which was the most the company had ever paid for a short film at the time.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=25}} Kubrick described his first effort at filmmaking as having been valuable since he believed himself to have been forced to do most of the work,{{Sfn|King|Molloy|Tzioumakis|2013|p=156}} and he later declared that the \"best education in film is to make one\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=15}}\n\nInspired by this early success, Kubrick quit his job at ''Look'' and visited professional filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about the technical aspects of filmmaking. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker because of the number of bad films he had seen, remarking, \"I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, but I know I can make a better film than that\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=13}} He began making ''[[Flying Padre]]'' (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called \"Sky Pilot\", a pun on the slang term for a priest.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=39}} During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in ''Flying Padre'' are later echoed in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) and ''[[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|Ivan the Terrible]]'' (1944/1958).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=25}}\n\n''Flying Padre'' was followed by ''[[The Seafarers]]'' (1953), Kubrick's first color film, which was shot for the [[Seafarers International Union of North America|Seafarers International Union]] in June 1953. It has shots of ships, machinery, a canteen, and a union meeting. For the cafeteria scene in the film, Kubrick chose a long, sideways-shooting [[dolly shot]] to establish the life of the seafarer's community; this shot is an early demonstration of a technique which would become a signature of his. The montage of speaker and audience echoes scenes from Eisenstein's ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925) and ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'' (1928).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=28}} ''Day of the Fight'', ''Flying Padre'' and ''The Seafarers'' constitute Kubrick's only surviving documentary works; some historians believe he made others.{{Sfn|Thuss|2002|p=110}}\n\n===Early feature work (1953\u20131955)===\n[[File:Fear and Desire (1953).webm|thumb|''Fear and Desire'' (1953)]]\nAfter raising $1000 showing his short films to friends and family, Kubrick found the finances to begin making his first feature film, ''[[Fear and Desire]]'' (1953), originally running with the title ''The Trap'', written by his friend [[Howard Sackler]]. Kubrick's uncle, Martin Perveler, a Los Angeles pharmacy owner, invested a further $9000 on condition that he be credited as executive producer of the film.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=26}} Kubrick assembled several actors and a small crew totaling 14 people (five actors, five crewmen, and four others to help transport the equipment) and flew to the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] in California for a five-week, low-budget shoot.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=26}}   Later renamed ''The Shape of Fear'' before finally being named ''Fear and Desire'', it is a fictional [[allegory]] about a team of soldiers who survive a plane crash and are caught behind enemy lines in a war. During the course of the film, one of the soldiers becomes infatuated with an attractive girl in the woods and binds her to a tree. This scene is noted for its close-ups on the face of the actress. Kubrick had intended for ''Fear and Desire'' to be a [[silent film|silent picture]] in order to ensure low production costs; the added sounds, effects, and music ultimately brought production costs to around $53,000, exceeding the budget.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=50}} He was bailed out by producer [[Richard de Rochemont]] on the condition that he help in de Rochemont's production of a five-part television series about [[Abraham Lincoln]] on location in [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=26\u20137}}\n\n''Fear and Desire'' was a commercial failure, but garnered several positive reviews upon release. Critics such as the reviewer from ''[[The New York Times]]'' believed that Kubrick's professionalism as a photographer shone through in the picture, and that he \"artistically caught glimpses of the grotesque attitudes of death, the wolfishness of hungry men, as well as their bestiality, and in one scene, the wracking effect of lust on a pitifully juvenile soldier and the pinioned girl he is guarding\". Columbia University scholar [[Mark Van Doren]] was highly impressed by the scenes with the girl bound to the tree, remarking that it would live on as a \"beautiful, terrifying and weird\" sequence which illustrated Kubrick's immense talent and guaranteed his future success.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=27}} Kubrick himself later expressed embarrassment with ''Fear and Desire'', and attempted over the years to keep prints of the film out of circulation.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=56}}{{efn|Kubrick called ''Fear and Desire'' a \"bumbling, amateur film exercise&nbsp;... a completely inept oddity, boring and pretentious\", and also referred to it as \"a lousy feature, very self-conscious, easily discernible as an intellectual effort, but very roughly, and poorly, and ineffectively made\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=27}}}} During the production of the film, Stanley almost killed his cast with poisonous gasses by mistake.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867001,00.html|title=\"The New Pictures,\" ''Time'', June 4, 1956 | date=June 4, 1956 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFollowing ''Fear and Desire'', Kubrick began working on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the commercial failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a [[film noir]] script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title ''Kiss Me, Kill Me'', and then ''The Nymph and the Maniac'', ''[[Killer's Kiss]]'' (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like ''Fear and Desire'', it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=28}} Kubrick began shooting footage in [[Times Square]], and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with [[cinematography]] and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12\u201314 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=30}}\n[[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929) directly influenced the film with the painting laughing at a character, and [[Martin Scorsese]] has, in turn, cited Kubrick's innovative shooting angles and atmospheric shots in ''Killer's Kiss'' as an influence on ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=32}} Actress [[Chris Chase|Irene Kane]], the star of ''Killer's Kiss'', observed: \"Stanley's a fascinating character.

The Union in Hollywood stated that Kubrick would not be permitted to be both the director and the cinematographer of the movie, so veteran cinematographer [[Lucien Ballard]] was hired for the shooting. Kubrick agreed to waive his fee for the production, which was shot in just 24 days on a budget of $330,000.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=115}} He clashed with Ballard during the shooting, and on one occasion Kubrick threatened to fire Ballard following a camera dispute, despite being only 27 years old at the time and 20 years Ballard's junior.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=38}} Hayden recalled that Kubrick was \"cold and detached.

Kubrick became preoccupied with the issue of [[nuclear war]] as the [[Cold War]] unfolded in the 1950s, and even considered moving to Australia because he feared that New York City might be a likely target for the Russians. He studied over 40 military and political research books on the subject and eventually reached the conclusion that \"nobody really knew anything and the whole situation was absurd\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=87}} After buying the rights to the novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'', Kubrick collaborated with its author, [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]], on the script. It was originally written as a serious political thriller, but Kubrick decided that a \"serious treatment\" of the subject would not be believable, and thought that some of its most salient points would be fodder for comedy.{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=29}} Kubrick and George then reworked the script as a satire (provisionally titled \"The Delicate Balance of Terror\") in which the plot of ''Red Alert'' was situated as a film-within-a-film made by an alien intelligence, but this idea was also abandoned, and Kubrick decided to make the film as \"an outrageous black comedy\". Just before filming began, Kubrick hired noted journalist and satirical author [[Terry Southern]] to transform the script into its final form, a black comedy, loaded with sexual innuendo,{{sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=87\u20139}} becoming a film which showed Kubrick's talents as a \"unique kind of absurdist\" according to the film scholar Abrams.{{sfn|Abrams|2007|p=30}} Southern made major contributions to the final script, and was co-credited (above Peter George) in the film's opening titles; his perceived role in the writing later led to a public rift between Kubrick and Peter George, who subsequently complained in a letter to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine that Southern's intense but relatively brief (November 16 to December 28, 1962) involvement with the project was being given undue prominence in the media, while his own role as the author of the film's source novel, and his ten-month stint as the script's co-writer, were being downplayed \u2013 a perception Kubrick evidently did little to address.<ref>Hill, Lee (2001).

Clarke]]'s novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'', about a superior race of alien beings who assist mankind in eliminating their old selves. After meeting Clarke in New York City in April 1964, Kubrick made the suggestion to work on his 1948 short story ''The Sentinel'', about a tetrahedron which is found on the Moon which alerts aliens of mankind.{{sfnm|1a1=Baxter|1y=1997|1p=205|2a1=Duncan|2y=2003|2p=105}} That year, Clarke began writing the novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and the screenplay was written by Kubrick and Clarke in collaboration. The film's theme, the birthing of one intelligence by another, is developed in two parallel intersecting stories on two very different time scales. One depicts transitions between various stages of man, from ape to \"star child\", as man is reborn into a new existence, each step shepherded by an enigmatic alien intelligence seen only in its artifacts: a series of seemingly indestructible eons-old black monoliths. In space, the enemy is a supercomputer known as HAL who runs the spaceship, a character which novelist [[Clancy Sigal]] described as being \"far, far more human, more humorous and conceivably decent than anything else that may emerge from this far-seeing enterprise\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=208}}{{efn|Several commentators have speculated that HAL is a slur on IBM, with the letters alphabetically falling before it, and point out that Kubrick inspected the IBM 7090 during ''Dr Strangelove''.

The special effects team continued working diligently until the end of the year to complete the film, taking the cost to $10.5 million.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=117}} ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' was conceived as a [[Cinerama]] spectacle and was photographed in [[Super Panavision 70]], giving the viewer a \"dazzling mix of imagination and science\" through ground-breaking effects, which earned Kubrick his only personal Oscar, an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]].{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=117}}{{Efn|Biographer John Baxter quotes Ken Adam as saying that Kubrick was not responsible for most of the effects, and that Wally Veevers was the man behind about 85% of them in film.

Kubrick had originally received a copy of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|novel of the same name]] from Terry Southern while they were working on ''Dr. Strangelove'', but had rejected it on the grounds that [[Nadsat]],{{Efn|The name is derived from the Russian suffix for \"teen\"}} a street language for young teenagers, was too difficult to comprehend. In 1969, the decision to make a film about the degeneration of youth was a more timely one; the [[New Hollywood]] movement was witnessing a great number of films that were centered around the sexuality and rebelliousness of young people, which no doubt influenced Kubrick in Baxter's opinion.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=243}} ''A Clockwork Orange'' was shot over 1970\u20131971 on a budget of \u00a32 million.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=129}} Kubrick abandoned his use of CinemaScope in the filming, deciding that the 1.66:1 widescreen format was, in the words of Baxter, an \"acceptable compromise between spectacle and intimacy\", and favored his \"rigorously symmetrical framing\", which \"increased the beauty of his compositions\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=252}} The film heavily features \"pop erotica\" of the period, including a giant white plastic set of male genitals, decor which Kubrick had intended to give it a \"slightly futuristic\" look.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=250, 254}} McDowell's role in [[Lindsay Anderson]]'s ''[[if....]]'' (1968) was crucial to his casting as Alex,{{efn|Kubrick had been impressed with his ability to \"shift from schoolboy innocence to insolence and, if needed, violence\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=246\u20137}}}} and Kubrick professed that he probably would not have made the film if McDowell had been unavailable.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=247}}\n\n[[File:Stanley Kubrick - WB promo.jpg|right|thumb|Kubrick in a publicity photo for ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', 1971]]\nBecause of its depiction of teenage violence, ''A Clockwork Orange'' became one of the most controversial films of its time, and part of an ongoing debate about violence and its glorification in cinema.

Kubrick was also intrigued by [[Gustav Hasford]]'s Vietnam War novel ''[[The Short-Timers]].'' With the vision in mind to shoot what would become ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), Kubrick began working with both Herr and Hasford separately on a script. He eventually found Hasford's novel to be \"brutally honest\" and decided to shoot a film which closely follows the novel.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=170}} All of the film was shot at a cost of $17 million within a 30-mile radius of his house between August 1985 and September 1986, later than scheduled as Kubrick shut down production for five months following a near-fatal accident with a jeep involving Lee Ermey.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=175}} A derelict gasworks in [[Beckton]] in the [[London Docklands]] area posed as the ruined city of [[Hu\u1ebf]],{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=341}} which makes the film visually very different from other Vietnam War films. Around 200 palm trees were imported via 40-foot trailers by road from North Africa, at a cost of \u00a31000 a tree, and thousands of plastic plants were ordered from Hong Kong to provide foliage for the film.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=471}} Kubrick explained he made the film look realistic by using natural light, and achieved a \"newsreel effect\" by making the Steadicam shots less steady, {{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=246}} which reviewers and commentators thought contributed to the bleakness and seriousness of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0030.html |title=Regarding Full Metal Jacket |publisher=The Kubrick Site |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603233024/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0030.html |archivedate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to critic [[Michel Ciment]], the film contained some of Kubrick's trademark characteristics, such as his selection of ironic music, portrayals of men being dehumanized, and attention to extreme detail to achieve realism. In a later scene, United States Marines patrol the ruins of an abandoned and destroyed city singing the theme song to the [[Mickey Mouse Club]] as a sardonic counterpoint.{{sfn|Webster|2010|p=135}} The film opened strongly in June 1987, taking over $30 million in the first 50 days alone,{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=354}} but critically it was overshadowed by the success of [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', released a year earlier.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=179}} Co-star [[Matthew Modine]] stated one of Kubrick's favorite reviews read: \"The first half of ''FMJ'' is brilliant.

Tom Cruise portrays a doctor who witnesses a bizarre masked quasireligious orgiastic ritual at a country mansion, a discovery which later threatens his life. The story is based on [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s 1926 Freudian novella ''Traumnovelle'' (''[[Dream Story]]'' in English), which Kubrick relocated from turn-of-the-century Vienna to New York City in the 1990s. Kubrick said of the novel: \"A difficult book to describe\u2014what good book isn't. It explores the sexual ambivalence of a happy marriage and tries to equate the importance of sexual dreams and might-have-beens with reality. All of Schnitzler's work is psychologically brilliant\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=181}} Kubrick was almost 70, but worked relentlessly for 15 months to get the film out by its planned release date of July 16, 1999. He commenced a script with [[Frederic Raphael]],{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=151}} and worked 18 hours a day, while maintaining complete confidentiality about the film.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=363}}\n\n''Eyes Wide Shut'', like ''Lolita'' and ''A Clockwork Orange'' before it, faced censorship before release. Kubrick sent an unfinished preview copy to the stars and producers a few months before release, but his sudden death on March 7, 1999, came a few days after he finished editing. He never saw the final version released to the public,{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=311}} but he did see the preview of the film with Warner Bros., Cruise, and Kidman, and had reportedly told Warner executive Julian Senior that it was his \"best film ever\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=184}} At the time, critical opinion of the film was mixed, and it was viewed less favorably than most of Kubrick's films. Roger Ebert awarded it 3.5 out of 4 stars, comparing the structure to a thriller and writing that it is \"like an erotic daydream about chances missed and opportunities avoided\", and thought that Kubrick's use of lighting at Christmas made the film \"all a little garish, like an urban sideshow\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/eyes-wide-shut-1999 |title=Eyes Wide Shut |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=July 16, 1999 |accessdate=August 17, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802051007/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/eyes-wide-shut-1999 |archivedate=August 2, 2015}}</ref> [[Stephen Hunter]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' disliked the film, writing that it \"is actually sad, rather than bad.

Kubrick had been given a copy of the Mike Zwerin book ''Swing Under the Nazis'' after he had finished production on ''Full Metal Jacket'', the front cover of which featured a photograph of Schulz-Koehn. A screenplay was never completed and Kubrick's film adaptation plan was never initiated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanley Kubrick's Unmade Film About Jazz in the Third Reich |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/03/stanley-kubricks-unmade-film-about-jazz-in-the-third-reich/274225/ |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 26, 2013 |author=Hughes, James |date=March 25, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326084141/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/03/stanley-kubricks-unmade-film-about-jazz-in-the-third-reich/274225/ |archivedate=March 26, 2013}}</ref> The unfinished ''Aryan Papers'', based on [[Louis Begley]]'s debut novel ''[[Wartime Lies]]'', was a factor in the abandonment of the project. Work on ''Aryan Papers'' depressed Kubrick enormously, and he eventually decided that Steven Spielberg's ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) covered much of the same material.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=179}}\n\nAccording to biographer John Baxter, Kubrick had shown an interest in directing a [[pornographic film]] based on a satirical novel written by Terry Southern, titled ''[[Blue Movie (novel)|Blue Movie]]'', about a director who makes Hollywood's first big-budget porn film. Baxter claims that Kubrick concluded that he did not have the patience or temperament to become involved in the porn industry, and Southern stated that Kubrick was \"too ultra conservative\" towards sexuality to have gone ahead with it, but liked the idea.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=195, 248}} Kubrick was unable to direct a film of Umberto Eco's ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' as Eco had given his publisher instructions to never sell the film rights to any of his books after his dissatisfaction with the film version of ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Film Review|year=2000|publisher=Orpheus Pub.|page=11}}</ref> Also, when the film rights to [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' were sold to United Artists, [[the Beatles]] approached Kubrick to direct them in a film based on the books, but Kubrick was unwilling to produce a film based on a very popular book.{{Sfn|Robb|Simpson|2013|p=4104}} Director Peter Jackson has reported that Tolkien was against the involvement of the Beatles.{{Sfn|Bogstad|Kaveny|2011|p=6}}\n\n==Career influences==\n[[File:Nurse Battleship Potemkin.jpg|thumb|As a young man, Kubrick was fascinated by the films of [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and would watch films like ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) (pictured) frequently.]]\n\n{{Quote|text=Anyone who has ever been privileged to direct a film knows that, although it can be like trying to write ''War and Peace'' in a bumper car at an amusement park, when you finally get it right, there are not many joys in life that can equal the feeling.|author=Stanley Kubrick|source=accepting the [[Directors Guild of America Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]]{{Sfn|Duncan|2003|p= 9}}}}\n\nAs a young man, Kubrick was fascinated by the films of Soviet filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]].{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=55}} Kubrick read Pudovkin's seminal theoretical work, ''Film Technique,'' which argues that editing makes film a unique art form, and it needs to be employed to manipulate the medium to its fullest. Kubrick recommended this work to others for many years. Thomas Nelson describes this book as \"the greatest influence of any single written work on the evolution of [Kubrick's] private aesthetics\". Kubrick also found the ideas of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] to be essential to his understanding the basics of directing, and gave himself a crash course to learn his methods.{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=21}}\n\nKubrick's family and many critics felt that his Jewish ancestry may have contributed to his worldview and aspects of his films. After his death, both his daughter and wife stated that he was not religious, but \"did not deny his Jewishness, not at all\". His daughter noted that he wanted to make a film about the Holocaust, the ''Aryan Papers'', having spent years researching the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/unmade-stanley-kubrick/6.asp |title=Unmade Stanley Kubrick: Aryan Papers |work=Empire |accessdate=August 11, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213135846/http://www.empireonline.com/features/unmade-stanley-kubrick/6.asp |archivedate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> Most of Kubrick's friends and early photography and film collaborators were Jewish, and his first two marriages were to daughters of recent Jewish immigrants from Europe. British screenwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], who worked closely with Kubrick in his final years, believes that the originality of Kubrick's films was partly because he \"had a (Jewish?) respect for scholars\". He declared that it was \"absurd to try to understand Stanley Kubrick without reckoning on Jewishness as a fundamental aspect of his mentality\".{{sfn|Raphael|1999|pp=107\u20138}}\n[[File:Madame de...par Max Oph\u00fcls de 1953.jpg|thumb|left|Director [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] was a major influence on Kubrick; pictured is his film ''[[The Earrings of Madame de...]]'' (1953).]]\nWalker notes that Kubrick was influenced by the tracking and \"fluid camera\" styles of director [[Max Oph\u00fcls]], and used them in many of his films, including ''Paths of Glory'' and ''2001: A Space Odyssey''. Kubrick noted how in Ophuls' films \"the camera went through every wall and every floor\".{{Sfn|Kagan|2000|p=2}} He once named Oph\u00fcls' ''[[Le Plaisir]]'' (1952) as his favorite film. According to film historian John Wakeman, Oph\u00fcls himself learned the technique from director [[Anatole Litvak]] in the 1930s, when he was his assistant, and whose work was \"replete with the camera trackings, pans and swoops which later became the trademark of Max Oph\u00fcls\".{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=677\u201383}} Geoffrey Cocks believes that Kubrick was also influenced by Oph\u00fcls' stories of thwarted love and a preoccupation with predatory men, while Herr notes that Kubrick was deeply inspired by [[G. W. Pabst]], who earlier tried, but was unable to adapt Schnitzler's ''Traumnovelle'', the basis of ''Eyes Wide Shut''.{{sfn|Herr|2001|p=27}} Film critic Robert Kolker sees the influence of [[Orson Welles|Welles]]' moving camera shots on Kubrick's style.

He explained in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna:\n<blockquote>\"One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, what is it that you were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what [[T. S. Eliot]] said to someone who had asked him\u2014I believe it was ''[[The Waste Land]]''\u2014what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said.' If I could have said it any differently, I would have\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=12}}</blockquote>\n\nKubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can be appreciated both by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual, because their \"emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects\". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction experienced by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=12}} In a ''Time'' magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: \"The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves.\"{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=13}} He also said: \"Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=161}}\n\n[[File:Production notes (8648671917).jpg|thumb|left|Kubrick's production notes from ''The Killing'']]\n[[Diane Johnson]], who co-wrote the screenplay for ''The Shining'' with Kubrick, notes that he \"always said that it was better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and that you should choose a work that isn't a masterpiece so you can improve on it. Which is what he's always done, except with ''Lolita''\".{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=293}} When deciding on a subject for a film, there were a number of aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would \"appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=11}} According to his co-producer [[Jan Harlan]], Kubrick mostly \"wanted to make films about things that mattered, that not only had form, but substance\".<ref name=Rose>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinephiliabeyond.org/an-hour-about-the-life-and-work-of-filmmaker-stanley-kubrick/ |title=An hour about the life and work of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick |publisher=Video interview with Charlie Rose, Christiane Kubrick, Martin Scorsese and Jan Harlan |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=August 11, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220024522/http://www.cinephiliabeyond.org/an-hour-about-the-life-and-work-of-filmmaker-stanley-kubrick/ |archivedate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> Kubrick believed that audiences quite often were attracted to \"enigmas and allegories\" and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly.{{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=38}}\n\nAlthough none of his features display graphic sex scenes, sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the \"furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape\" in his films.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=248}} He further points out that films like ''A Clockwork Orange'' are \"powerfully homoerotic\", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being \"made up with doll-like false eyelashes\", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid ([[Aubrey Morris]]).{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=250}} British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be \"preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil\", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as \"black as coal\", questioning his outlook on humanity.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=14}} A few of his pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as ''Lolita'' and ''Dr. Strangelove''; many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining \"the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=10}} Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost \"obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one\".{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=59}}\nKubrick stated that \"there is no deliberate pattern to the stories that I have chosen to make into films. About the only factor at work each time is that I try not to repeat myself\".{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=153}} As a result, Kubrick was often misunderstood by critics, and only once did he have unanimously positive reviews upon the release of a film\u2014for ''Paths of Glory''.{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=297}}\n\n===Writing and staging scenes===\n[[File:Tunnel Arancia Meccancia.jpg|thumb|The tunnel used in the making of ''A Clockwork Orange'']]\nFilm author Patrick Webster considers Kubrick's methods of writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical [[auteur theory]] of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming.{{sfn|Webster|2010|p=68}} Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick's collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness to allow him to improvise a scene, stating that \"there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn't work he knew it, and we had to keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=68}}\nOnce Kubrick was confident in the overall staging of a scene, and felt the actors were prepared, he would then develop the visual aspects, including camera and lighting placement. Walker believes that Kubrick was one of \"very few film directors competent to instruct their lighting photographers in the precise effect they want\".{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=26}} Baxter believes that Kubrick was heavily influenced by his ancestry and always possessed a European perspective to filmmaking, particularly the Austro-Hungarian empire and his admiration for Max Ophuls and [[Richard Strauss]].{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=13}}\n\n[[Gilbert Adair]], writing in a review for ''Full Metal Jacket'', commented that \"Kubrick's approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression\".{{Sfn|Duncan|2003|pp=12\u20133}} Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a \"visual filmmaker\", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=295}} Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it \"more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals\" as he put it.{{sfn|Walker|1972|p=26}} Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: \"I think you have to view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=145}} Kubrick also said: \"I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools.\"{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=157}}\n\n===Directing===\n{{quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=They work with Stanley and go through hells that nothing in their careers could have prepared them for, they think they must have been mad to get involved, they think that they'd die before they would ever work with him again, that fixated maniac; and when it's all behind them and the profound fatigue of so much intensity has worn off, they'd do anything in the world to work for him again.

Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=38}} Nicole Kidman explains that the large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a \"deeper place\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index4.html |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 4 |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |date=February 22, 2002 |accessdate=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524201007/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index4.html |archivedate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as \"irrational\"; he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=403}} Kubrick explained: \"Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try\"&nbsp;...{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=94}}\n\n\"When you make a movie, it takes a few days just to get used to the crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=73}} He also told biographer Michel Ciment: \"It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera.\"{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=153}}\n\nKubrick would devote his personal breaks to having lengthy discussions with actors. Among those who valued his attention was [[Tony Curtis]], star of ''Spartacus'', who said Kubrick was his favorite director, adding, \"his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors.\"{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=193}} He further added, \"Kubrick had his own approach to film-making. He wanted to see the actor's faces. He didn't want cameras always in a wide shot twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, he wanted to keep the camera moving. That was his style.\"{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=2}} Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in ''A Clockwork Orange'', noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which is what made Kubrick \"such a great director\".{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=38}} Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvise and to \"break the rules\", particularly with Peter Sellers in ''Lolita'', which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=136}}\nDuring an interview, Ryan O'Neal recalled Kubrick's directing style: \"God, he works you hard. He moves you, pushes you, helps you, gets cross with you, but above all he teaches you the value of a good director. Stanley brought out aspects of my personality and acting instincts that had been dormant&nbsp;... My strong suspicion [was] that I was involved in something great\".{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=385}} He further added that working with Kubrick was \"a stunning experience\" and that he never recovered from working with somebody of such magnificence.<ref name=tribute>{{cite web|title=Stanley Kubrick: Five legendary stories of the filmmaker 'with the black eyes' |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/11/09/stanley-kubrick-stories |work=Entertainment Weekly |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |date=November 9, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006054445/http://www.ew.com/article/2012/11/09/stanley-kubrick-stories |archivedate=October 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\n[[File:WarRoomModel.DrStrangelove.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the War Room from ''Dr Strangelove'']]\nKubrick credited the ease with which he photographed scenes to his early years as a photographer.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=196}} He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to handle that after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=177}} Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as \"a detective\".{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=176}} Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] on ''Barry Lyndon'', remarked that Kubrick \"questions everything\",{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=407}} and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer.

Some reviewers have described and illustrated with video clips, Kubrick's use of \"[[one-point perspective]]\", which leads the viewer's eye towards a central vanishing point.

Kubrick used it to its fullest potential, which gave the audience smooth, stabilized, motion-tracking by the camera. Kubrick described Steadicam as being like a \"magic carpet\", allowing \"fast, flowing, camera movements\" in the maze in ''The Shining'' which otherwise would have been impossible.{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=189}}\n\nKubrick was among the first directors to use [[video assist]] during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of ''2001'', he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=294}} On some films, such as ''Barry Lyndon'', he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly zoom out to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's technical knowledge about lenses \"dazzled the manufacturer's engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers\".{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=389}} For ''Barry Lyndon'' he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using \"pure candlelight\", and in doing so Kubrick \"made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting&nbsp;... You almost posed like for portraits.\"{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=400}} LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick's \"magic lens\" and that he became a \"legend\" among cameramen around the world.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=408}}\n\n===Editing and music===\n[[File:Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti (1984).jpg|thumb|[[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], whose music Kubrick used in ''2001'', ''The Shining'' and ''Eyes Wide Shut''|upright]]\nKubrick spent extensive hours editing, often working seven days a week, and more hours a day as he got closer to deadlines.{{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=42}} For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element to be put in balance with [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]] (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by [[Vsevolod Pudovkin|Pudovkin]]'s treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often \"re-direct\" a film, and he remarked: \"I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking&nbsp;... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form\u2014a point so important it cannot be overstressed&nbsp;... It can make or break a film\".{{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=42}} Biographer John Baxter stated that \"Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months&nbsp;... he arranged and rearranged the tens of thousands of scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing\".{{Sfn|Baxter|1997|p=6}}\n\nKubrick's attention to music was an aspect of what many referred to as his \"perfectionism\" and extreme attention to minute details, which his wife Christiane attributed to an addiction to music. In his last six films, Kubrick usually chose music from existing sources, especially classical compositions. He preferred selecting recorded music over having it composed for a film, believing that no hired composer could do as well as the public domain classical composers. He also felt that building scenes from great music often created the \"most memorable scenes\" in the best films.{{sfn|Ciment|1980|pp=153, 156}} In one instance, for a scene in ''Barry Lyndon'' which was written into the screenplay as merely, \"Barry duels with Lord Bullingdon\", he spent forty-two working days in the editing phase. During that period, he listened to what LoBrutto describes as \"every available recording of seventeenth-and eighteenth- century music, acquiring thousands of records to find [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s sarabande used to score the scene\".{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=405}} Jack Nicholson likewise observed his attention to music for his films, stating that Kubrick \"listened constantly to music until he discovered something he felt was right or that excited him\".{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=297}}\n\nKubrick is credited with introducing Hungarian composer [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]] to a broad Western audience by including his music in ''2001'', ''The Shining'' and ''Eyes Wide Shut''. According to Baxter, the music in ''2001'' was \"at the forefront of Kubrick's mind\" when he conceived the film.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=225}} During earlier screening he played music by [[Mendelssohn]]{{efn|Baxter states that Kubrick had originally intended using the scherzo from Mendelssohn's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' to accompany the shuttle docking at the space station but changed his mind after hearing Johann Strauss's ''[[The Blue Danube|Blue Danube]]'' waltz.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=226}}}} and [[Vaughan Williams]], and Kubrick and writer Clarke had listened to [[Carl Orff]]'s transcription of ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', consisting of 13th century sacred and secular songs.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=225}} Ligeti's music employed the new style of [[micropolyphony]], which used sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly over time, a style he originated. Its inclusion in the film became a \"boon for the relatively unknown composer\" partly because it was introduced alongside background by [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]] and [[Richard Strauss]].{{Sfn|Duchesneau|Marx|2011|p=xx}}\n\nIn addition to Ligeti, Kubrick also enjoyed a collaboration with composer [[Wendy Carlos]], whose 1968 album ''[[Switched-On Bach]]''\u2014which re-interpreted [[baroque music]] through the use of a [[Moog synthesizer]]\u2014caught his attention. In 1971, Carlos composed and recorded music for the soundtrack of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Additional music not used in the film was released in 1972 as ''[[Wendy Carlos's Clockwork Orange]]''. Kubrick later collaborated with Carlos on ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980). The opening of the film, in which the camera follows Jack Torrance's yellow VW beetle through the mountains to the Overlook Hotel, employs Carlos' eerie rendering of \"Dies Irae\" (Day of Wrath) from [[Hector Berlioz|Hector Berlioz's]] ''[[Symphonie fantastique|Symphonie Fantastique]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/shining_opening.htm |title=Kubrick's ''The Shining'' \u2013 The Opening |author= |date= |work=idyllopuspress.com |accessdate=March 10, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305203245/http://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/shining_opening.htm |archivedate=March 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{main|Personal life of Stanley Kubrick|Political and religious beliefs of Stanley Kubrick}}\nKubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz, a caricaturist, on May 29, 1948, when he was nineteen years old. They had attended Taft High School together and had lived in the same apartment block on Shakespeare Avenue.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=19}} The couple lived together in [[Greenwich Village]] and divorced three years later in 1951. He met his second wife, the Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer [[Ruth Sobotka]], in 1952. They lived together in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] beginning in 1952, married in January 1955, and moved to Hollywood in July 1955, where she played a brief part as a ballet dancer in Kubrick's film, ''Killer's Kiss'' (1955). The following year she was art director for his film, ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'' (1956). They divorced in 1957.{{sfn|Duncan|2003a|p=48}}\n\nDuring the production of ''Paths of Glory'' in Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress [[Christiane Kubrick|Christiane Harlan]], who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and the couple remained together for 40 years, until his death in 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together: Anya Renata (April 6, 1959 \u2013 July 7, 2009) and [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian Vanessa]] (born August 5, 1960).{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=68}} In 1959 they settled into a home at 316 South Camden Drive in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, aged six.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=165}} They also lived in New York City, during which time Christiane studied art at the [[Art Students League of New York]], later becoming an independent artist.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=224}} The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make ''Lolita'', and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film, ''Dr. Strangelove''. Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite convenient to Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, and he and Christiane had become alarmed with the increase in violence in New York City.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=271}}\n[[File:Stanley Kubricks G\u00e4stehaus.jpg|thumb|Stanley Kubrick Guest House at Abbots Mead, Borehamwood where he edited his most important films]]\n[[File:20050613-007-childwickbury.jpg|thumb|Kubrick's [[Childwickbury Manor]] in Hertfordshire, England]]\nIn 1965 the Kubricks bought Abbots Mead on Barnet Lane, just south-west of the Elstree/Borehamwood studio complex in England. Kubrick worked almost exclusively from this home for 14 years where, with some exceptions, he researched, invented special effects techniques, designed ultra-low light lenses for specially modified cameras, pre-produced, edited, post-produced, advertised, distributed and carefully managed all aspects of four of his films. In 1978, Kubrick moved into [[Childwickbury Manor]] in [[Hertfordshire]], a mainly 18th-century stately home, which was once owned by a wealthy racehorse owner, about {{convert|30|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}} north of London and a 10-minute drive from his previous home at Abbotts Mead. His new home became a workplace for Kubrick and his wife, \"a perfect family factory\" as Christiane called it,{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=374}} and Kubrick converted the stables into extra production rooms besides ones within the home that he used for editing and storage.{{Sfn|Walker|1972|p=368}}\n\nA workaholic, Kubrick rarely took a vacation or left England during the forty years before his death.{{Sfn|Ciment|1980|p=145}} LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, similar to those of [[Greta Garbo]], [[Howard Hughes]], and [[J. D. Salinger]].{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=1}} Michael Herr, Kubrick's co-screenwriter on ''Full Metal Jacket'', who knew him well, considers his \"reclusiveness\" to be myth: \"[He] was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people&nbsp;... he was one of the most gregarious men I ever knew, and it didn't change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone.\" {{sfn|Herr|2001|p=6}} LoBrutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was because he insisted in remaining near his home, but the reason for this was because for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York City or around London. He disliked living in Los Angeles, and thought London a superior film production center to New York City.{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=491}}\n\nAs a person, Kubrick was described by [[Norman Lloyd]] as \"a very dark, sort of a glowering type who was very serious\".{{Sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=85}} [[Marisa Berenson]], who starred in ''Barry Lyndon'', fondly recalled: \"There was great tenderness in him and he was passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence, but he also had a great sense of humor. He was a very shy person and self-protective, but he was filled with the thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day.\"{{sfn|Ciment|1980|p=289}} Kubrick was particularly fond of machines and technical equipment, to the point that his wife Christiane once stated that \"Stanley would be happy with eight tape recorders and one pair of pants\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=7}} Kubrick had obtained a pilot's license in August 1947; some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying, stemming from an incident in the early 1950s when a colleague had been killed in a plane crash. Kubrick had been sent the charred remains of his camera and notebooks which, according to Duncan, traumatized him for life.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=62}}{{efn|Duncan notes that during the filming of ''Spartacus'' in Spain, Kubrick had suffered a nervous breakdown after the flight and was \"terribly ill\" during the filming there, and his return flight would be his last one.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=62}} [[Matthew Modine]], star of ''Full Metal Jacket'', has stated that the stories about his fear of flying were \"fabricated\", and that Kubrick simply preferred spending most of his time in England, where his films were produced and where he lived.<ref name=\"Modine2\">{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/07/matthew-modine-full-metal-jacket-app|title='Full Metal Jacket' at 25: Matthew Modine tries to answer, 'What was Stanley like?'|work= Entertainment Weekly|date=August 7, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2014|last=Labrecque|first=Jeff|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908110411/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/07/matthew-modine-full-metal-jacket-app/|archivedate=September 8, 2012}}</ref>}} Kubrick also had a strong mistrust of doctors and medicine, especially those he did not know, and on one occasion he had a dentist from the Bronx flown to London to treat him.{{sfn|LoBrutto|1999|p=328}}\n\n===Death===\n\nOn March 7, 1999, six days after screening a final cut of ''Eyes Wide Shut'' for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep at the age of 70, suffering a heart attack.<ref>Jan Harlan in Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures\"</ref> His funeral was held five days later at his home estate at [[Childwickbury Manor]], with only close friends and family in attendance, totaling approximately 100 people.

[[Kaddish]], the Jewish prayer of mourning, was recited. A few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background.{{sfn|Walker|1972|pp=373\u20134}} Among those who gave eulogies were [[Terry Semel]], Jan Harlan, Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. He was buried next to his favorite tree on the estate.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

By this time, Tina Turner had already released two solo albums, ''[[Tina Turns the Country On]]'' (1974) and ''[[Acid Queen (album)|Acid Queen]]'' (1975), on the [[United Artists]] label to which she and Ike Turner were signed. She then continued as a solo artist with the albums ''[[Rough (album)|Rough]]'' (1978) and ''[[Love Explosion]]'' (1979). However, none of these releases were commercially successful, and Turner left the label at the end of the decade. After collaborating with the British electronic group, [[B.E.F. (British Electric Foundation)|B.E.F.]] in 1982, Turner signed a new contract with [[EMI Records]] in the UK, and released the single \"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\" (a cover of the [[Al Green]] song) in late 1983. Produced by B.E.F., the single was a UK Top 10 hit. Import copies began to sell well in the US which prompted [[Capitol Records]] (a subsidiary of EMI) to sign Turner and release the single there themselves, which made the [[Billboard 100|Billboard]] Top 30 in Spring 1984. By this time, Turner had begun work on a full album, ''[[Private Dancer]]'', which was released in May 1984 and became a worldwide hit. It spawned a string of hit singles, including \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\", which still stands as Turner's biggest hit, peaking at #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. The success of the album established Turner as a major solo artist earning her a comeback that is widely regarded as one of the most successful of all time.\n\nFollowing her success in 1984, Turner co-starred with [[Mel Gibson]] in the 1985 film, ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]''. She recorded two songs for the film's [[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], with \"[[We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]\" giving her another huge international hit. She then released her second album for Capitol in 1986, ''[[Break Every Rule]]'', which also spawned major hits on the US Hot 100, including \"[[Typical Male]]\" (#2) and \"[[What You Get Is What You See]]\" (#13). Turner embarked on a large scale world tour in 1987, and released her first live album, ''[[Tina Live in Europe]]'', in 1988. She returned with her next studio album, ''[[Foreign Affair (Tina Turner album)|Foreign Affair]]'', in 1989. Its lead single, \"[[The Best (song)|The Best]]\" was a worldwide hit that year and the album sold over 1.5 million copies in the [[United Kingdom]] alone<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/tinaturner/biography|title=Tina Turner: Biography: Rolling Stone|last=Simon & Schuster|year=2001|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> but was less successful in the US.\n\nHer first compilation album, ''[[Simply the Best (Tina Turner album)|Simply the Best]]'', was released in 1991 and was another huge seller in the UK, selling over 2.4 million copies. Turner switched from the US Capitol label to [[Virgin Records]] (both were subsidiaries of EMI, and would later be merged by EMI to become the [[Capitol Music Group]] in 2007). In 1993, she recorded the soundtrack to the film about her life, ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (album)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'', producing the hit single, \"[[I Don't Wanna Fight]]\", her first US Top 10 hit since 1986. In 1995, she performed the title song for the ''[[James Bond]]'' film ''[[GoldenEye]]''.

By this time, Tina Turner had already released two solo albums, ''[[Tina Turns the Country On]]'' (1974) and ''[[Acid Queen (album)|Acid Queen]]'' (1975), on the [[United Artists]] label to which she and Ike Turner were signed. She then continued as a solo artist with the albums ''[[Rough (album)|Rough]]'' (1978) and ''[[Love Explosion]]'' (1979). However, none of these releases were commercially successful, and Turner left the label at the end of the decade. After collaborating with the British electronic group, [[B.E.F. (British Electric Foundation)|B.E.F.]] in 1982, Turner signed a new contract with [[EMI Records]] in the UK, and released the single \"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\" (a cover of the [[Al Green]] song) in late 1983. Produced by B.E.F., the single was a UK Top 10 hit. Import copies began to sell well in the US which prompted [[Capitol Records]] (a subsidiary of EMI) to sign Turner and release the single there themselves, which made the [[Billboard 100|Billboard]] Top 30 in Spring 1984. By this time, Turner had begun work on a full album, ''[[Private Dancer]]'', which was released in May 1984 and became a worldwide hit. It spawned a string of hit singles, including \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\", which still stands as Turner's biggest hit, peaking at #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. The success of the album established Turner as a major solo artist earning her a comeback that is widely regarded as one of the most successful of all time.\n\nFollowing her success in 1984, Turner co-starred with [[Mel Gibson]] in the 1985 film, ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]''. She recorded two songs for the film's [[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], with \"[[We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]\" giving her another huge international hit. She then released her second album for Capitol in 1986, ''[[Break Every Rule]]'', which also spawned major hits on the US Hot 100, including \"[[Typical Male]]\" (#2) and \"[[What You Get Is What You See]]\" (#13). Turner embarked on a large scale world tour in 1987, and released her first live album, ''[[Tina Live in Europe]]'', in 1988. She returned with her next studio album, ''[[Foreign Affair (Tina Turner album)|Foreign Affair]]'', in 1989. Its lead single, \"[[The Best (song)|The Best]]\" was a worldwide hit that year and the album sold over 1.5 million copies in the [[United Kingdom]] alone<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/tinaturner/biography|title=Tina Turner: Biography: Rolling Stone|last=Simon & Schuster|year=2001|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> but was less successful in the US.\n\nHer first compilation album, ''[[Simply the Best (Tina Turner album)|Simply the Best]]'', was released in 1991 and was another huge seller in the UK, selling over 2.4 million copies. Turner switched from the US Capitol label to [[Virgin Records]] (both were subsidiaries of EMI, and would later be merged by EMI to become the [[Capitol Music Group]] in 2007). In 1993, she recorded the soundtrack to the film about her life, ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (album)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'', producing the hit single, \"[[I Don't Wanna Fight]]\", her first US Top 10 hit since 1986. In 1995, she performed the title song for the ''[[James Bond]]'' film ''[[GoldenEye]]''. Her next studio album was 1996's ''[[Wildest Dreams (Tina Turner album)|Wildest Dreams]]'', followed by 1999's ''[[Twenty Four Seven (Tina Turner album)|Twenty Four Seven]]'', her last studio album to date.<ref name=\"allmusicbio\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5714/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Tina Turner > Biography|last=Bush|first=John|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:21em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"|[[Billboard 200|US]]<br><ref name=\"usaalbums\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/tina-turner/chart-history/billboard-200|title=Tina Turner Chart History > Billboard 200|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"|[[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|US R&B]]<br><ref name=r&b/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"|[[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br><ref name=\"aus\">Australian chart positions:\n*Top 100 ([[Kent Music Report]]) peaks to June 12, 1988: {{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition= Illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], N.S.W.|year=1993|page=314|isbn=0-646-11917-6}} N.B.

The earliest on record occurred at the turn of the 19th century after Poland [[Third Partition of Poland|lost its statehood]]. However, for much of the [[Cold War]] period most of the Polish population was restricted in their ability to travel outside of [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]] at all.\n\nMore recently in 2004, an influx occurred after [[2004 enlargement of the European Union#Poland|Poland joined]] the [[European Union]], thereby easing restrictions on Polish citizens' eligibility to work in other [[European Economic Area]] states. As of 1 January 2017, there were 13,795 [[Polish people]] living in Iceland.

The earliest on record occurred at the turn of the 19th century after Poland [[Third Partition of Poland|lost its statehood]]. However, for much of the [[Cold War]] period most of the Polish population was restricted in their ability to travel outside of [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]] at all.\n\nMore recently in 2004, an influx occurred after [[2004 enlargement of the European Union#Poland|Poland joined]] the [[European Union]], thereby easing restrictions on Polish citizens' eligibility to work in other [[European Economic Area]] states. As of 1 January 2017, there were 13,795 [[Polish people]] living in Iceland.
