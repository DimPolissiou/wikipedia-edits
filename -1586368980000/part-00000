{"title_page": "SCCA National Sports Car Championship", "text_new": "The '''SCCA National Sports Car Championship''' was a [[sports car racing]] series organized by the [[Sports Car Club of America]] from 1951 until 1964.  It was the first post-[[World War II]] sports car series organized in the [[United States]].  An amateur championship, it was eventually replaced by the professional [[United States Road Racing Championship]] and the amateur [[SCCA National Championship Runoffs|American Road Race of Champions]], which continues to this day as the SCCA National Championship Runoffs.\n\n==History==\nThe championship was created in 1951 from existing SCCA events.  Until 1953 a single championship was awarded, with points paid based on finishing position within each class.  Beginning in 1954 champions were named in each class.\n\nFollowing the 1962 season, the professional [[USAC Road Racing Championship]] collapsed, leaving many competitors looking for a series. The SCCA created the [[United States Road Racing Championship]] as a professional series for 1963, moving focus away from the amateur National Championship.  For 1965, the SCCA dropped the national championship series and awarded national championships to champions from each region.  Top drivers from the regions were invited to the [[SCCA National Championship Runoffs|American Road Race of Champions]] (today known as the National Championship Runoffs) at the end of the season.  For 1966, national championships were awarded only to winners at the ARRC, a system which continues today as the Runoffs has become the most prestigious road racing event for club racers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krej\u010d\u00ed|first=Martin|title=SCCA National Sports Car Championship|url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/nationals.html|work=World Sports Racing Prototypes|accessdate=29 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603122858/http://wsrp.ic.cz/nationals.html|archivedate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Champions==\n\n===Overall (1951\u20131953)===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n!

It was the first post-[[World War II]] sports car series organized in the [[United States]].  An amateur championship, it was eventually replaced by the professional [[United States Road Racing Championship]] and the amateur [[SCCA National Championship Runoffs|American Road Race of Champions]], which continues to this day as the SCCA National Championship Runoffs.\n\n==History==\nThe championship was created in 1951 from existing SCCA events.  Until 1953 a single championship was awarded, with points paid based on finishing position within each class.  Beginning in 1954 champions were named in each class.\n\nFollowing the 1962 season, the professional [[USAC Road Racing Championship]] collapsed, leaving many competitors looking for a series. The SCCA created the [[United States Road Racing Championship]] as a professional series for 1963, moving focus away from the amateur National Championship.  For 1965, the SCCA dropped the national championship series and awarded national championships to champions from each region.  Top drivers from the regions were invited to the [[SCCA National Championship Runoffs|American Road Race of Champions]] (today known as the National Championship Runoffs) at the end of the season.  For 1966, national championships were awarded only to winners at the ARRC, a system which continues today as the Runoffs has become the most prestigious road racing event for club racers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krej\u010d\u00ed|first=Martin|title=SCCA National Sports Car Championship|url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/nationals.html|work=World Sports Racing Prototypes|accessdate=29 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603122858/http://wsrp.ic.cz/nationals.html|archivedate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Champions==\n\n===Overall (1951\u20131953)===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n!

Dewey gave his famous command, \"You may fire when you are ready, Gridley\".<ref name=\"DANFS\" /> At the conclusion of the battle, Gridley was not in a condition to celebrate, suffering from dysentery and what appears to have been liver cancer.

On May 25, Gridley was to begin his journey home. One crewman recorded the event as follows:\n<blockquote>\nHe came up out of his cabin dressed in civilian clothes and was met by the rear admiral [Dewey] who extended him a most cordial hand. A look of troubled disappointment flitted across the captain's brow, but vanished when he stepped to the head of the gangway and, looking, over saw, not the launch, but a twelve-oared cutter manned entirely by officers of the ''Olympia''. There were men in the boat who has not pulled a stroke for a quarter of a century. Old Glory was at the stern and a captain's silken coach-whip at the bow; and when Captain Gridley, beloved alike by officers and men, entered the boat, it was up oars, and all that, just as though they were common sailors who were to row him over to the Zafiro. When he sat down upon the handsome boat-cloth that was spread for him, he bowed his head, and his hands hid his face as First-Lieutenant Reese, acting coxswain, ordered, 'Shove off; out oars; give away!' Later in the day the lookout on the bridge reported, 'Zafiro under way sir,' and the deck officer passed on the word until a little twitter from Pat Murray's pipe brought all the other bo's'ns around him, and in concert they sang out, 'Stand by to man the rigging!' Not the ''Olympia'' alone, but every other ship in the squadron dressed and manned, and the last we ever saw of our dear captain he was sitting on a chair out on the Zafiro's quarter-deck, apparently listening to the [''Olympia's''] old band play.\n</blockquote>\n\nGridley was physically spent, and his health began to sink even faster once he was finally released from the strain of command. He was transferred from the ''Zafiro'' to the commercial steamer ''[[SS Coptic (1881)|Coptic]]'' on May 27, but he had to be taken aboard on a stretcher. He knew that his condition was grave and wrote simply, \"I think I am done for it, personally.\"\n\n===Death and burial===\nAboard the ''Coptic'', on June 5, 1898, Gridley died while the vessel was in Kobe, Japan.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nHis body was cremated and sent home.
