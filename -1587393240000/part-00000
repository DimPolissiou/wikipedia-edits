{"title_page": "Genetic history of the British Isles", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=December 2017}}\n{{update|date=July 2017}}}}\n\nThe '''genetic history of the British Isles''' is the subject of research within the larger field of human [[population genetics]]. It has developed in parallel with [[DNA test]]ing technologies capable of identifying genetic similarities and differences between populations. The conclusions of population genetics regarding the [[British Isles]] in turn draw upon and contribute to the larger field of understanding the history of [[human]]ity in the British Isles generally, complementing work in [[British Isles#Languages|linguistics]], [[History of the British Isles|archeology]], [[History of the British Isles|history]] and [[genealogy]].\n\nResearch concerning the most important routes of migration into the British Isles is the subject of debate. Apart from the most obvious route across the narrowest point of the [[English Channel]] into [[Kent]], other routes may have been important over the millennia, including a [[Doggerland|land bridge]] in the [[Mesolithic]] period, and also maritime connections along the Atlantic coasts.\n\nThe periods of the most important migrations are contested. The [[Neolithic]] introduction of [[farming]] technologies from [[Europe]] is frequently proposed as a period of major population change in the British Isles. Such technology could either have been learned by locals from a small number of [[immigrants]] or by [[colonists]] who significantly changed the population.\n\nOther potentially important historical periods of migration which have been subject to consideration in this field include the introduction of [[Celtic languages]] and technologies (during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages), the [[Roman Britain|Roman era]], the period of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] influx, the period of [[Anglo-Saxon]] influx, the [[Viking]] era, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of 1066]] and the era of the [[European wars of religion]]. There are also many potential eras of movement between different parts of the British Isles.\n\n==Analyses of nuclear DNA==\n\n===Mesolithic population===\nMesolithic Britons were closely related to other Mesolithic people throughout Western Europe.\n\n===Near-total population replacement by Neolithic farmers===\n\nMesolithic Britons were closely related to other Mesolithic people throughout Europe, but Neolithic individuals are close to Iberian and Central European Middle Neolithic populations, modelled as having about 75% ancestry from Anatolian farmers with the rest coming from [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s (WHG) in continental Europe. Some British Neolithic individuals had slightly (about 10%) more WHG genes, suggesting that some members of the WHG population in Britain did pass on their genes. Neolithic individuals from Wales have no detectable local admixture of Western hunter-gatherer genes, those from South East England and Scotland show the highest admixture of WHG genes, and those from South-West and Central England are intermediate. This suggests that farming was brought to the British Isles by sea from north-west mainland Europe, by a population that was, or became in succeeding generations, relatively large.\n\n===Near-total population replacement of Neolithic farmers by North-\u0421entral European Bell Beaker People===\nAccording to a 2017 study by Olalde et al., the spread of the [[Bell Beaker]] culture to Britain from the lower Rhine area in the early Bronze Age introduced high levels of [[steppe-related ancestry]], resulting in a near-complete transformation of the local gene pool within a few centuries, replacing about 90% of the local Neolithic-derived lineages between 2,400 BC and 2,000 BC.<ref name=\"Olalde et al.\">{{cite biorxiv |last1=Olalde |first1=I |display-authors=et. al |date=May 2017|title=The Beaker Phenomenon and the Genomic Transformation of Northwest Europe|biorxiv=10.1101/135962}}</ref> These people exhibiting the Beaker culture were likely an offshoot of the [[Corded Ware]] culture, as they had little genetic affinity to the Iberian Beaker people.<ref>http://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/01/dutch-beakers-like-no-other-beakers.html; {{harvnb|Olalde|Brace|Allentoft|Armit|2018}}</ref> In addition to the large steppe-derived component, they had a smaller proportion of continental Neolithic and Western Hunter Gatherer DNA.

The Normans were partly descended from Vikings.\n\n==Early studies of protein polymorphisms in modern populations==\n\nEarly studies by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] used [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] from proteins found within [[human]] [[blood]] (such as the [[ABO blood group system|ABO blood groups]], Rhesus blood antigens, [[major histocompatibility complex|HLA loci]], [[Antibody|immunoglobulins]], [[G6PD]] [[isoenzyme]]s, amongst others).<ref>{{harvnb|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}}</ref> One of the lasting proposals of this study with regards to [[Europe]] is that within most of the continent, the majority of genetic diversity may best be explained by immigration coming from the southeast towards the northwest or in other words from the [[Middle East]] towards [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. He proposed at the time that the [[invention of agriculture]] might be the best explanation for this.\n\n==Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA from modern populations==\n\nWith the advent of DNA analysis, modern populations were sampled for [[mitochondrial DNA]] to study the female line of descent, and [[Y chromosome]] DNA to study male descent. As opposed to large scale sampling within the [[autosomal DNA]], Y DNA and mitochondrial DNA represent specific types of genetic descent and can therefore reflect only particular aspects of past human movement. Early usage of this technology has led to many theories that will be discussed in this section, including the proposed Basque origin of the modern British, in addition to the theory that the British gene pool has undergone very little change in the past 6,000 years.\n\nFor Britain, major research projects aimed at collecting more data include the Oxford Genetic Atlas Project (OGAP), which was associated with [[Bryan Sykes]] of [[Oxford University]] and more recently the ''[[People of the British Isles]]'', also associated with Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleofthebritishisles.org|title=Home - People of the British Isles|website=www.peopleofthebritishisles.org}}</ref>\n\nA 2010 DNA study published in ''[[PLOS Biology]]'' claimed that [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic]] farmers from the Middle East had a significant impact on the [[Y-DNA]] of European males, the majority of whom have paternal lineage tracing back to Middle-Eastern farmers during the Neolithic expansion. In contrast, the [[mtDNA]] of European females show the majority having maternal lineage tracing back to earlier hunter-gatherers predating the Neolithic expansion.<ref>{{harvnb|Balaresque|Bowden|Adams|Ho-Yee|2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Bryan Sykes produced an analysis of 6,000 samples from the OGAP project in his book ''Blood of the Isles''.<ref name=\"Sykes 2006\">{{harvnb|Sykes|2006}}</ref> [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] in his 2006 book ''The Origins of the British'' used the data from {{harvnb|Weale|Weiss|Jager|Bradman|2002}}, {{harvnb|Capelli|Redhead|Abernethy|Gatrix|2003}} and {{harvnb|Rosser|Zerjal|Hurles|Adojaan|2000}} for Europe. In opposition to [[Mesolithic]] origin theories, Sykes and Oppenheimer argued for significant immigration from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] into Britain and Ireland. Much of this argument depended on paternal [[Y chromosome]] DNA evidence Oppenheimer reviewed in the Weale and Capelli studies and suggested that correlations of gene frequency mean nothing without a knowledge of the genetic prehistory of the regions in question. His criticism of these studies is that they generated models based on the historical evidence of Gildas and Procopius, and then selected methodologies to test against these populations. Weale's transect spotlights that Belgium is further west in the genetic map than North Walsham, Asbourne and Friesland. In Oppenheimer's view, this is evidence that the [[Belgae]] and other continental people \u2013 and hence continental genetic markers indistinguishable from those ascribed to Anglo-Saxons \u2013 arrived earlier and were already strongly represented in the 5th century in particular regions or areas.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\">{{harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006}}</ref>\n\nOppenheimer, based on the Weale and Capelli studies, proposed that none of the invasions since the Romans have had a significant impact on the gene pool of the British Isles, and that the inhabitants from prehistoric times belong to an [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] genetic grouping. He says that most people in Britain and Ireland are genetically similar to the [[Basque people]] of northern [[Spain]] and southwestern [[France]], from 90% in [[Wales]] to 66% in [[East Anglia]].<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\"/> Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow \u2013 one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe \u2013 which occurred just after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\"/> He reports works on linguistics by Forster and Toth which suggest that the [[Indo-European languages]] began to fragment some 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age. He claims that the [[Celtic languages]] split from Indo-European far earlier than the date generally asserted by most researchers of Indo-European linguistics, some 6000 years ago.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\"/> He claims that the English language split from the other [[Germanic languages]] before the Roman period, and became the English that was spoken by the [[Belgae]] tribes of what is now southern and eastern [[England]], northeastern [[France]], and [[Belgium]] prior to their conquest by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and long before the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\"/>\n\nBryan Sykes, a former geneticist at Oxford University, came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer, which he set forth in his 2006 book called ''Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History'', published in the United States and Canada as ''Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland''. {{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\nIn 2012, from a highly enlarged whole-genome mitochondrial database published, the authors concluded that the most archaic maternal [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] lineages in Europe came from a Middle Eastern migration into Europe during the [[Late Glacial Maximum|Late Glacial period]], ~19\u201312 thousand years ago and not as late as the Neolithic as was previously proposed.<ref>{{harvnb|Pala|Olivieri|Achilli|Accetturo|2012}}</ref> They argued that this population came from a contracted European population [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|refugium]] on the [[Anatolian Plateau]] which spread to three refugia, [[Franco-Cantabrian region|Franco-Cantabria]], the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[East European Plain]]. From these three areas the lineages would then have repopulated Europe.\n\nThe work of Sykes and Oppenheimer regarding the British has recently been seriously challenged. More recent developments in genetic research demonstrate that R1b haplogroups came from the Steppe invaders from the east, rather than from Iberia or France.<ref name= Olalde>{{harvnb|Olalde|Brace|Allentoft|Armit|2018}}</ref> [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]]'s Harvard laboratory found that over 90% of the British Neolithic population was overturned by the Bell Beaker People from the [[Lower Rhine]], who had little genetic relation to the Iberian Bell Beaker people or South Europeans.<ref name= Olalde/> Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as the British and Irish cluster genetically very closely with other North European populations, rather than Iberians, Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.<ref>{{harvnb|Novembre|Johnson|Bryc|Kutalik|2008}}; {{harvnb|Lao|Lu|Nothnagel|Junge|2008}}</ref>\n\nInvaders of Steppe origin brought R1b in significant proportions to the Iberian peninsula replacing 100% of Y-DNA lineages but only 40% of their total DNA .

In a widely cited article, through DNA testing, [[#Weale|Weale ''et al.'' (2002)]] argued that the Y DNA data showed signs of a mass [[Anglo-Saxon]] immigration from the European continent, affecting up to 100% of the male genepool in Central England. The signatures of Germanic influx to England is now widely accepted and has been shown in other studies, such as {{harvnb|Capelli|Redhead|Abernethy|Gatrix|2003}}. The Capelli study, with higher sample numbers, gave much lower frequencies of \"Germanic\" genetic markers in England than did Weale. They describe such markers as typically ranging between 20% and 40%, with [[York]] forming an outlier at 60%. Most of [[Scotland]] showed a very similar genetic composition to England. North German/Danish genetic frequencies were indistinguishable, thus precluding any ability to distinguish between the genetic influence of the Anglo-Saxon source populations and the later, and better documented, influx of Danish Vikings.<ref>{{harvnb|Capelli|Redhead|Abernethy|Gatrix|2003}}</ref>\n\nA study into the Norwegian Viking ancestry of British people found that there is evidence of particular concentrations in certain areas; especially the [[North Sea]] islands of [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]], but also to a lesser extent the Western Isles, including Skye, in Scotland, [[Anglesey]] in Wales, the [[Isle of Man]], and the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], Mid-Cheshire, [[West Lancashire]] and [[Cumbria]] in England.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Goodacre 2005\"/><ref name=\"Wellcome\">{{cite news|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/2004/Features/WTX022535.htm|title=Gene geography: Do you have Viking ancestry in your DNA?|date=2004|publisher=Wellcome Trust|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Branagan\">{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/39Time-team39-to-seek-out.4930477.jp|title='Time team' to seek out genetic secrets of Yorkshire's Viking past|last=Branagan|first=Mark|date=30 January 2009|work=Yorkshire Post|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Irish population ===\nIn Ireland, population genetic studies, including surname studies, have been undertaken by a team under Dan Bradley. Databases on Britain and Ireland, as well as on various surnames, are being built up from personal DNA tests, for example at [[FamilyTree DNA]]. A widely reported article in this area was {{harvnb|Moore|McEvoy|Cape|Simms|2006}}, which provided Y DNA evidence that in some cases Irish surname groups were highly dominated by single male lines, presumed to be those of dynastic founders, such as [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]].\n\nSince 2010, use has been made of technologies which can test hundreds of thousands of possible mutation points ([[single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]s) in the rest of the [[human genome]] (the [[autosomal DNA]]). The results of these large studies have shown that the main patterns of relatedness between European populations are simply geographical, meaning that the British and Irish are simply most genetically related to the people in neighbouring countries. This has not yet led to any new theories concerning migrations.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Dushlaine|Morris|Moskvina|Kirov|2010a}}; {{harvnb|O'Dushlaine|McQuillan|Weale|Crouch|2010b}}</ref>\n\nIt has been proposed that Y chromosome diversity tends to change more quickly than the overall population, because at least sometimes, some male lines move more quickly than the general population, meaning that the most common Y chromosomes in areas will reflect relatively recent \"waves\" of human movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Chiaroni|Underhill|Cavalli-Sforza|2009}}</ref>\n\nTwo new genetic studies have recently been published on the Irish both showing that there is a large Northwestern French component to the Irish (called Celtic in this study) and a West Norwegian admixture event timed to the Viking era.<ref>{{harvnb|Gilbert|O'Reilly|Merrigan|McGettigan|2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/08/230797.full.pdf |title=Data |publisher=www.biorxiv.org |date=2017 |accessdate=2019-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ancestry-gaelic-irish-3744043-Dec2017/|title=Are Irish people really that diverse genetically?

He has given maps and proposals concerning ancient migrations for [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[England]].\n\nSykes and Oppenheimer have each given nicknames to various haplogroups to allow easier recognition, including the principal ones in the isles. Below the normal scientific names are given, followed by the popularised \"clan names\" of Sykes, and in some cases also of Oppenheimer:-\n\n'''mtDNA'''\n*[[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)]] Helena (Sykes), Helina (Oppenheimer)\n*[[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)]] Isha\n*[[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)]] Jasmine\n*[[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)]] Tara\n*[[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)]] [[Velda]] (Sykes), Vera (Oppenheimer)\n*[[Haplogroup W (mtDNA)]] Wanda\n*[[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)]] Xenia\n*[[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)]] Europa (Oppenheimer)\n...and within U...\n:*[[Haplogroup U2 (mtDNA)]] Uta\n:*[[Haplogroup U3 (mtDNA)]] Uma\n:*[[Haplogroup U4 (mtDNA)]] Ulrika\n:*[[Haplogroup U5 (mtDNA)]] Ursula\n\nSykes found that the maternal clan (haplogroup) pattern was similar throughout England but with a definite trend from east and north to the south and west. The minor clans are mainly found in the east of England. Sykes found Haplogroup H to be dominant in Ireland and Wales. A few differences were found between North, Mid and [[South Wales]]. There was a closer link between [[North Wales|North]] and [[Mid Wales]] than either had with the South.\n\nSykes found that 10% of the Irish population were in Haplogroup U5 called Ursula. He calculated a date of 7,300 BC for the entry of this lineage into Ireland. Similar dates were proposed for the other mitochondrial haplogroups, implying that mitochondrial lines in Ireland are far older there than the arrival of [[Iron Age]] [[Celt]]s. Little difference was found between the maternal clans in the four provinces.\n\n==Y chromosome DNA==\n{{main|Y-DNA haplogroups in populations of Europe}}\nIn 2006, Sykes produced an analysis of 6,000 samples from the OGAP project in his book ''Blood of the Isles''.<ref name=\"Sykes 2006\"/> designating five main [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups|Y-DNA]] haplogroups for various regions of the isles. As with mitochondrial haplogroups not only Sykes but also Stephen Oppenheimer chose to popularise the concept by giving them \"clan names\". The following gives their normal scientific names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isogg.org/tree/|title=ISOGG 2018 Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree|first=Copyright 2018 by|last=ISOGG|website=www.isogg.org}}</ref>\n*[[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)]].

While it was once seen as a lineage connecting the Britain and Ireland to Iberia (where it is also common), opinions concerning its origins have changed. It is now known R1b and R1a entered Europe with [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] migrants likely originating around the [[Black Sea]];{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} R1 is now the most common haplotype in Europe. The second most common R1b subclade in England is [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)#R1b1a2a1a1a (R-U106)|R1b-S21]], which is most common in [[North Sea]] areas such as [[eastern England]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]]. Ireland is dominated by R1b-L21 (\"Celtic\"), which is also found in north western [[France]], the north coast of [[Spain]], and western [[Norway]] on [[continental Europe]].<ref>{{harvnb|Balaresque|Bowden|Adams|Ho-Yee|2010}}; {{harvnb|Myres|Rootsi|Lin|J\u00e4rve|2011}}; {{harvnb|Cruciani|Trombetta|Antonelli|Pascone|2011}}</ref> But R1B L21 is also common and dominates certain parts of England more so than other lineages.\n\nThere are various smaller and geographically well-defined Y-DNA Haplogroups under R1b in Western Europe.\n\n'''Haplogroup R1a''', a distant cousin of R1b, is most common in [[Eastern Europe]]. In Britain it is associated with Scandinavian immigration during periods of Viking settlement. 25% of men in Norway belong to this haplogroup; it is much more common in Norway than the rest of Scandinavia and are survivors of its original population predating the 5000 BCE invasion of haplogroup I. Around 9% of all Scottish men belong to the Norwegian R1a subclade, which peaks at over 30% in [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bowden|Balaresque|King|Hansen|2008}}</ref> However, there is no conclusive evidence that all came with Vikings, and similarities could have arisen from similar pre-Viking settlement patterns. Current Scandinavians belong to a range of haplogroups.\n\n'''Haplogroup I''' is a grouping of several quite distantly related lineages. Looking at the three main clusters, according to {{harvnb|Rootsi|Kivisild|Benuzzi|Help|2004}} with up-dated nomenclature according to ISOGG:<ref name=isogg/>-\n*I1a in Rootsi ''et al.'', now known as I1, is mainly associated with [[Scandinavia]] in modern populations and is common in several parts of England, with frequency as high in [[Eastern England]] as it is in Scandinavia.\n*I1b in Rootsi ''et al.'', now known as I2a, is associated with the [[Balkans]].\n*I1c in Rootsi ''et al.'', now known as I2b, is less clearly associated with any particular part of Europe.\n\n'''Haplogroups E1b1b and J''' in Europe are regarded as markers of Neolithic movements from the Middle East to [[Southern Europe]] and likely to Northern Europe from there. These haplogroups are found most often in Southern Europe and [[North Africa]]. Both are rare in Northern Europe; E1b1b is found in 1% of Norwegian men, 1.5% of Scottish, 2% of English, 2.5% of Danish, 3% of Swedish and 5.5% of German. It reaches its peak in Europe in [[Kosovo]] at 47.5% and [[Greece]] at 30%.<ref>{{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Uncommon Y haplogroups===\nGeneticists have found that seven men with the surname Revis, which originates in [[Yorkshire]], carry a genetic signature previously found only in people of [[West Africa]]n origin. All of the men belonged to [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)#A1a-M31|Haplogroup A1a]] (M31), a subclade of [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup A]] which geneticists believe originated in Eastern or [[Southern Africa]].<ref name=King2007a>{{harvnb|King|Parkin|Swinfield|Cruciani|2007a}}</ref> The men are not regarded as [[phenotype|phenotypically]] African and there are no documents, anecdotal evidence or oral traditions suggesting that the Revis family has African ancestry. It has been conjectured that the presence of this haplogroup may date from the [[Roman Britain|Roman era]], when both Africans and Romans of African descent are known to have settled in Britain.<ref name=King2007a/> According to Bryan Sykes, \"although the Romans ruled from AD 43 until 410, they left a tiny genetic footprint.\" The genetics of some visibly white (European) people in England suggests that they are \"descended from north African, Middle Eastern and Roman clans\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nGeneticists have shown that former [[President of the United States|American president]] [[Thomas Jefferson]], who might have been of Welsh descent, along with two other British men of the 85 British men with the surname Jefferson, carry the rare Y chromosome marker [[Haplogroup T (Y-DNA)|T]]. This is typically found in [[East Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. It is also found in 4.5% of Greek men, 3.5% of [[Estonia]]n, and 2.5% of Spanish and Italian men, also scattered across the [[Alps]]. There have been no other documented cases of Haplogroup T occurring in Northern Europe other than those two cases. The presence of scattered and diverse European haplotypes within the network is nonetheless consistent with Jefferson's patrilineage belonging to an ancient and rare indigenous European type.<ref>{{harvnb|King|Bowden|Balaresque|Adams|2007b}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-3}}\n*[[Prehistoric Britain]]\n*[[Historical immigration to Great Britain]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon

It has developed in parallel with [[DNA test]]ing technologies capable of identifying genetic similarities and differences between populations. The conclusions of population genetics regarding the [[British Isles]] in turn draw upon and contribute to the larger field of understanding the history of [[human]]ity in the British Isles generally, complementing work in [[British Isles#Languages|linguistics]], [[History of the British Isles|archeology]], [[History of the British Isles|history]] and [[genealogy]].\n\nResearch concerning the most important routes of migration into the British Isles is the subject of debate. Apart from the most obvious route across the narrowest point of the [[English Channel]] into [[Kent]], other routes may have been important over the millennia, including a [[Doggerland|land bridge]] in the [[Mesolithic]] period, and also maritime connections along the Atlantic coasts.\n\nThe periods of the most important migrations are contested. The [[Neolithic]] introduction of [[farming]] technologies from [[Europe]] is frequently proposed as a period of major population change in the British Isles. Such technology could either have been learned by locals from a small number of [[immigrants]] or by [[colonists]] who significantly changed the population.\n\nOther potentially important historical periods of migration which have been subject to consideration in this field include the introduction of [[Celtic languages]] and technologies (during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages), the [[Roman Britain|Roman era]], the period of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] influx, the period of [[Anglo-Saxon]] influx, the [[Viking]] era, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of 1066]] and the era of the [[European wars of religion]]. There are also many potential eras of movement between different parts of the British Isles.\n\n==Analyses of nuclear DNA==\n\n===Mesolithic population===\nMesolithic Britons were closely related to other Mesolithic people throughout Western Europe. This population probably had pale-colored eyes,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lotzof |first1=Kerry |title=Cheddar Man |url=https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/cheddar-man-mesolithic-britain-blue-eyed-boy.html |website=Natural History Museum}}</ref> [[lactose intolerance]], dark curly or wavy hair and very dark or black skin.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=18 March 2018|title=Cheddar Man FAQ |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/our-work/origins-evolution-and-futures/human-adaptation-diet-disease/cheddar-man-faq.html|website=www.nhm.ac.uk}}; {{harvnb|Walsh|Chaitanya|Breslin|Muralidharan|2017}}</ref>\n\n===Near-total population replacement by Neolithic farmers===\n\nMesolithic Britons were closely related to other Mesolithic people throughout Europe, but Neolithic individuals are close to Iberian and Central European Middle Neolithic populations, modelled as having about 75% ancestry from Anatolian farmers with the rest coming from [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s (WHG) in continental Europe. Some British Neolithic individuals had slightly (about 10%) more WHG genes, suggesting that some members of the WHG population in Britain did pass on their genes. Neolithic individuals from Wales have no detectable local admixture of Western hunter-gatherer genes, those from South East England and Scotland show the highest admixture of WHG genes, and those from South-West and Central England are intermediate. This suggests that farming was brought to the British Isles by sea from north-west mainland Europe, by a population that was, or became in succeeding generations, relatively large.\n\n===Near-total population replacement of Neolithic farmers by North-\u0421entral European Bell Beaker People===\nAccording to a 2017 study by Olalde et al., the spread of the [[Bell Beaker]] culture to Britain from the lower Rhine area in the early Bronze Age introduced high levels of [[steppe-related ancestry]], resulting in a near-complete transformation of the local gene pool within a few centuries, replacing about 90% of the local Neolithic-derived lineages between 2,400 BC and 2,000 BC.<ref name=\"Olalde et al.\">{{cite biorxiv |last1=Olalde |first1=I |display-authors=et. al |date=May 2017|title=The Beaker Phenomenon and the Genomic Transformation of Northwest Europe|biorxiv=10.1101/135962}}</ref> These people exhibiting the Beaker culture were likely an offshoot of the [[Corded Ware]] culture, as they had little genetic affinity to the Iberian Beaker people.<ref>http://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2019/01/dutch-beakers-like-no-other-beakers.html; {{harvnb|Olalde|Brace|Allentoft|Armit|2018}}</ref> In addition to the large steppe-derived component, they had a smaller proportion of continental Neolithic and Western Hunter Gatherer DNA.

Scotland was found to have both more Steppe and more Western Hunter Gatherer ancestry than England. These proportions are similar to other Northwest European populations.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature14317|pmid = 25731166| pmc=5048219| title=Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe| journal=Nature| volume=522| issue=7555| pages=207\u2013211| year=2015| last1=Haak| first1=Wolfgang| last2=Lazaridis| first2=Iosif| last3=Patterson| first3=Nick| last4=Rohland| first4=Nadin| last5=Mallick| first5=Swapan| last6=Llamas| first6=Bastien| last7=Brandt| first7=Guido| last8=Nordenfelt| first8=Susanne| last9=Harney| first9=Eadaoin| last10=Stewardson| first10=Kristin| last11=Fu| first11=Qiaomei| last12=Mittnik| first12=Alissa| last13=B\u00e1nffy| first13=Eszter| last14=Economou| first14=Christos| last15=Francken| first15=Michael| last16=Friederich| first16=Susanne| last17=Pena| first17=Rafael Garrido| last18=Hallgren| first18=Fredrik| last19=Khartanovich| first19=Valery| last20=Khokhlov| first20=Aleksandr| last21=Kunst| first21=Michael| last22=Kuznetsov| first22=Pavel| last23=Meller| first23=Harald| last24=Mochalov| first24=Oleg| last25=Moiseyev| first25=Vayacheslav| last26=Nicklisch| first26=Nicole| last27=Pichler| first27=Sandra L.| last28=Risch| first28=Roberto| last29=Rojo Guerra| first29=Manuel A.| last30=Roth| first30=Christina| displayauthors=29|bibcode = 2015Natur.522..207H|arxiv = 1502.02783}}</ref>\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon Settlement ===\n\nA 2016 study concluded that on average 25\u201340% of the ancestry of modern Britons was contributed by Anglo-Saxon immigrants, with the highest proportion found in East England (38% on average).<ref name=\"Schiffels nature\">{{cite journal|title=Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon genomes from East England reveal British migration history|first1=Stephan|last1=Schiffels|first2=Wolfgang|last2=Haak|first3=Pirita|last3=Paajanen|first4=Bastien|last4=Llamas|first5=Elizabeth|last5=Popescu|first6=Louise|last6=Loe|first7=Rachel|last7=Clarke|first8=Alice|last8=Lyons|first9=Richard|last9=Mortimer|first10=Duncan|last10=Sayer|first11=Chris|last11=Tyler-Smith|first12=Alan|last12=Cooper|first13=Richard|last13=Durbin|date=19 January 2016|journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|pages=ncomms10408|doi=10.1038/ncomms10408|pmid = 26783965|pmc=4735688|bibcode=2016NatCo...710408S}}</ref>\n\n=== Viking Influence===\n\nA study into the Norwegian Viking ancestry of British and Irish people found that there is evidence of particular concentrations in certain areas; especially the [[North Sea]] islands of [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]], but also to a lesser extent the Western Isles (including Skye in Scotland), [[Anglesey]] in Wales, the [[Isle of Man]], and the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], [[West Lancashire]] and [[Cumbria]] in England.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Excavating Past Population Structures by Surname-Based Sampling: The Genetic Legacy of the Vikings in Northwest England\"</ref><ref name=\"Goodacre 2005\">{{harvnb|Goodacre|Helgason|Nicholson|Southam|2005}}</ref>\n\nAnother important Viking influence was the long standing connection between North Eastern England and Denmark, resulting in the Danelaw region during the Dark Ages. The Normans were partly descended from Vikings.\n\n==Early studies of protein polymorphisms in modern populations==\n\nEarly studies by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] used [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] from proteins found within [[human]] [[blood]] (such as the [[ABO blood group system|ABO blood groups]], Rhesus blood antigens, [[major histocompatibility complex|HLA loci]], [[Antibody|immunoglobulins]], [[G6PD]] [[isoenzyme]]s, amongst others).<ref>{{harvnb|Cavalli-Sforza|1997}}</ref> One of the lasting proposals of this study with regards to [[Europe]] is that within most of the continent, the majority of genetic diversity may best be explained by immigration coming from the southeast towards the northwest or in other words from the [[Middle East]] towards [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. He proposed at the time that the [[invention of agriculture]] might be the best explanation for this.\n\n==Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA from modern populations==\n\nWith the advent of DNA analysis, modern populations were sampled for [[mitochondrial DNA]] to study the female line of descent, and [[Y chromosome]] DNA to study male descent. As opposed to large scale sampling within the [[autosomal DNA]], Y DNA and mitochondrial DNA represent specific types of genetic descent and can therefore reflect only particular aspects of past human movement. Early usage of this technology has led to many theories that will be discussed in this section, including the proposed Basque origin of the modern British, in addition to the theory that the British gene pool has undergone very little change in the past 6,000 years.\n\nFor Britain, major research projects aimed at collecting more data include the Oxford Genetic Atlas Project (OGAP), which was associated with [[Bryan Sykes]] of [[Oxford University]] and more recently the ''[[People of the British Isles]]'', also associated with Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleofthebritishisles.org|title=Home - People of the British Isles|website=www.peopleofthebritishisles.org}}</ref>\n\nA 2010 DNA study published in ''[[PLOS Biology]]'' claimed that [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic]] farmers from the Middle East had a significant impact on the [[Y-DNA]] of European males, the majority of whom have paternal lineage tracing back to Middle-Eastern farmers during the Neolithic expansion. In contrast, the [[mtDNA]] of European females show the majority having maternal lineage tracing back to earlier hunter-gatherers predating the Neolithic expansion.<ref>{{harvnb|Balaresque|Bowden|Adams|Ho-Yee|2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Bryan Sykes produced an analysis of 6,000 samples from the OGAP project in his book ''Blood of the Isles''.<ref name=\"Sykes 2006\">{{harvnb|Sykes|2006}}</ref> [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] in his 2006 book ''The Origins of the British'' used the data from {{harvnb|Weale|Weiss|Jager|Bradman|2002}}, {{harvnb|Capelli|Redhead|Abernethy|Gatrix|2003}} and {{harvnb|Rosser|Zerjal|Hurles|Adojaan|2000}} for Europe. In opposition to [[Mesolithic]] origin theories, Sykes and Oppenheimer argued for significant immigration from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] into Britain and Ireland. Much of this argument depended on paternal [[Y chromosome]] DNA evidence Oppenheimer reviewed in the Weale and Capelli studies and suggested that correlations of gene frequency mean nothing without a knowledge of the genetic prehistory of the regions in question. His criticism of these studies is that they generated models based on the historical evidence of Gildas and Procopius, and then selected methodologies to test against these populations. Weale's transect spotlights that Belgium is further west in the genetic map than North Walsham, Asbourne and Friesland. In Oppenheimer's view, this is evidence that the [[Belgae]] and other continental people \u2013 and hence continental genetic markers indistinguishable from those ascribed to Anglo-Saxons \u2013 arrived earlier and were already strongly represented in the 5th century in particular regions or areas.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\">{{harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006}}</ref>\n\nOppenheimer, based on the Weale and Capelli studies, proposed that none of the invasions since the Romans have had a significant impact on the gene pool of the British Isles, and that the inhabitants from prehistoric times belong to an [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] genetic grouping. He says that most people in Britain and Ireland are genetically similar to the [[Basque people]] of northern [[Spain]] and southwestern [[France]], from 90% in [[Wales]] to 66% in [[East Anglia]].<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\"/> Oppenheimer suggests that the division between the West and the East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion but originates with two main routes of genetic flow \u2013 one up the Atlantic coast, the other from neighbouring areas of Continental Europe \u2013 which occurred just after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\"/> He reports works on linguistics by Forster and Toth which suggest that the [[Indo-European languages]] began to fragment some 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age. He claims that the [[Celtic languages]] split from Indo-European far earlier than the date generally asserted by most researchers of Indo-European linguistics, some 6000 years ago.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\"/> He claims that the English language split from the other [[Germanic languages]] before the Roman period, and became the English that was spoken by the [[Belgae]] tribes of what is now southern and eastern [[England]], northeastern [[France]], and [[Belgium]] prior to their conquest by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and long before the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer 2006\"/>\n\nBryan Sykes, a former geneticist at Oxford University, came to fairly similar conclusions as Oppenheimer, which he set forth in his 2006 book called ''Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of our Tribal History'', published in the United States and Canada as ''Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland''. {{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\nIn 2012, from a highly enlarged whole-genome mitochondrial database published, the authors concluded that the most archaic maternal [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] lineages in Europe came from a Middle Eastern migration into Europe during the [[Late Glacial Maximum|Late Glacial period]], ~19\u201312 thousand years ago and not as late as the Neolithic as was previously proposed.<ref>{{harvnb|Pala|Olivieri|Achilli|Accetturo|2012}}</ref> They argued that this population came from a contracted European population [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|refugium]] on the [[Anatolian Plateau]] which spread to three refugia, [[Franco-Cantabrian region|Franco-Cantabria]], the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[East European Plain]]. From these three areas the lineages would then have repopulated Europe.\n\nThe work of Sykes and Oppenheimer regarding the British has recently been seriously challenged. More recent developments in genetic research demonstrate that R1b haplogroups came from the Steppe invaders from the east, rather than from Iberia or France.<ref name= Olalde>{{harvnb|Olalde|Brace|Allentoft|Armit|2018}}</ref> [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]]'s Harvard laboratory found that over 90% of the British Neolithic population was overturned by the Bell Beaker People from the [[Lower Rhine]], who had little genetic relation to the Iberian Bell Beaker people or South Europeans.<ref name= Olalde/> Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as the British and Irish cluster genetically very closely with other North European populations, rather than Iberians, Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.<ref>{{harvnb|Novembre|Johnson|Bryc|Kutalik|2008}}; {{harvnb|Lao|Lu|Nothnagel|Junge|2008}}</ref>\n\nInvaders of Steppe origin brought R1b in significant proportions to the Iberian peninsula replacing 100% of Y-DNA lineages but only 40% of their total DNA . This in stark contrast to the 90% autosomal turnover in the British Isles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2018/10/07/i-dont-need-to-forgive-my-enemies/|title=I don\u2019t need to forgive my enemies.|date=October 8, 2018}}</ref> There is therefore significant haplogroup similarity between these populations, which led to early scholars proposing a Basque origin for the British, although there is little whole genome autosomal similarity.\n\n=== Germanic genetics ===\n\nAnother subject in the literature which has been widely discussed is whether genetics can show signs of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invasions, particularly in England. In a widely cited article, through DNA testing, [[#Weale|Weale ''et al.'' (2002)]] argued that the Y DNA data showed signs of a mass [[Anglo-Saxon]] immigration from the European continent, affecting up to 100% of the male genepool in Central England. The signatures of Germanic influx to England is now widely accepted and has been shown in other studies, such as {{harvnb|Capelli|Redhead|Abernethy|Gatrix|2003}}. The Capelli study, with higher sample numbers, gave much lower frequencies of \"Germanic\" genetic markers in England than did Weale. They describe such markers as typically ranging between 20% and 40%, with [[York]] forming an outlier at 60%. Most of [[Scotland]] showed a very similar genetic composition to England. North German/Danish genetic frequencies were indistinguishable, thus precluding any ability to distinguish between the genetic influence of the Anglo-Saxon source populations and the later, and better documented, influx of Danish Vikings.<ref>{{harvnb|Capelli|Redhead|Abernethy|Gatrix|2003}}</ref>\n\nA study into the Norwegian Viking ancestry of British people found that there is evidence of particular concentrations in certain areas; especially the [[North Sea]] islands of [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]], but also to a lesser extent the Western Isles, including Skye, in Scotland, [[Anglesey]] in Wales, the [[Isle of Man]], and the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], Mid-Cheshire, [[West Lancashire]] and [[Cumbria]] in England.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Goodacre 2005\"/><ref name=\"Wellcome\">{{cite news|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/2004/Features/WTX022535.htm|title=Gene geography: Do you have Viking ancestry in your DNA?|date=2004|publisher=Wellcome Trust|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Branagan\">{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/39Time-team39-to-seek-out.4930477.jp|title='Time team' to seek out genetic secrets of Yorkshire's Viking past|last=Branagan|first=Mark|date=30 January 2009|work=Yorkshire Post|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Irish population ===\nIn Ireland, population genetic studies, including surname studies, have been undertaken by a team under Dan Bradley. Databases on Britain and Ireland, as well as on various surnames, are being built up from personal DNA tests, for example at [[FamilyTree DNA]]. A widely reported article in this area was {{harvnb|Moore|McEvoy|Cape|Simms|2006}}, which provided Y DNA evidence that in some cases Irish surname groups were highly dominated by single male lines, presumed to be those of dynastic founders, such as [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]].\n\nSince 2010, use has been made of technologies which can test hundreds of thousands of possible mutation points ([[single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]s) in the rest of the [[human genome]] (the [[autosomal DNA]]). The results of these large studies have shown that the main patterns of relatedness between European populations are simply geographical, meaning that the British and Irish are simply most genetically related to the people in neighbouring countries. This has not yet led to any new theories concerning migrations.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Dushlaine|Morris|Moskvina|Kirov|2010a}}; {{harvnb|O'Dushlaine|McQuillan|Weale|Crouch|2010b}}</ref>\n\nIt has been proposed that Y chromosome diversity tends to change more quickly than the overall population, because at least sometimes, some male lines move more quickly than the general population, meaning that the most common Y chromosomes in areas will reflect relatively recent \"waves\" of human movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Chiaroni|Underhill|Cavalli-Sforza|2009}}</ref>\n\nTwo new genetic studies have recently been published on the Irish both showing that there is a large Northwestern French component to the Irish (called Celtic in this study) and a West Norwegian admixture event timed to the Viking era.<ref>{{harvnb|Gilbert|O'Reilly|Merrigan|McGettigan|2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/08/230797.full.pdf |title=Data |publisher=www.biorxiv.org |date=2017 |accessdate=2019-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ancestry-gaelic-irish-3744043-Dec2017/|title=Are Irish people really that diverse genetically?

He has given maps and proposals concerning ancient migrations for [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[England]].\n\nSykes and Oppenheimer have each given nicknames to various haplogroups to allow easier recognition, including the principal ones in the isles. Below the normal scientific names are given, followed by the popularised \"clan names\" of Sykes, and in some cases also of Oppenheimer:-\n\n'''mtDNA'''\n*[[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)]] Helena (Sykes), Helina (Oppenheimer)\n*[[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)]] Isha\n*[[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)]] Jasmine\n*[[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)]] Tara\n*[[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)]] [[Velda]] (Sykes), Vera (Oppenheimer)\n*[[Haplogroup W (mtDNA)]] Wanda\n*[[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)]] Xenia\n*[[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)]] Europa (Oppenheimer)\n...and within U...\n:*[[Haplogroup U2 (mtDNA)]] Uta\n:*[[Haplogroup U3 (mtDNA)]] Uma\n:*[[Haplogroup U4 (mtDNA)]] Ulrika\n:*[[Haplogroup U5 (mtDNA)]] Ursula\n\nSykes found that the maternal clan (haplogroup) pattern was similar throughout England but with a definite trend from east and north to the south and west. The minor clans are mainly found in the east of England. Sykes found Haplogroup H to be dominant in Ireland and Wales. A few differences were found between North, Mid and [[South Wales]]. There was a closer link between [[North Wales|North]] and [[Mid Wales]] than either had with the South.\n\nSykes found that 10% of the Irish population were in Haplogroup U5 called Ursula. He calculated a date of 7,300 BC for the entry of this lineage into Ireland. Similar dates were proposed for the other mitochondrial haplogroups, implying that mitochondrial lines in Ireland are far older there than the arrival of [[Iron Age]] [[Celt]]s. Little difference was found between the maternal clans in the four provinces.\n\n==Y chromosome DNA==\n{{main|Y-DNA haplogroups in populations of Europe}}\nIn 2006, Sykes produced an analysis of 6,000 samples from the OGAP project in his book ''Blood of the Isles''.<ref name=\"Sykes 2006\"/> designating five main [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups|Y-DNA]] haplogroups for various regions of the isles. As with mitochondrial haplogroups not only Sykes but also Stephen Oppenheimer chose to popularise the concept by giving them \"clan names\". The following gives their normal scientific names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isogg.org/tree/|title=ISOGG 2018 Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree|first=Copyright 2018 by|last=ISOGG|website=www.isogg.org}}</ref>\n*[[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)]].

Eshu (Sykes)\n*[[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)]]. Re (Sykes)\n\nThe larger [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)]] is dominant in [[Western Europe]], not only Britain and Ireland. While it was once seen as a lineage connecting the Britain and Ireland to Iberia (where it is also common), opinions concerning its origins have changed. It is now known R1b and R1a entered Europe with [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] migrants likely originating around the [[Black Sea]];{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} R1 is now the most common haplotype in Europe. The second most common R1b subclade in England is [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)#R1b1a2a1a1a (R-U106)|R1b-S21]], which is most common in [[North Sea]] areas such as [[eastern England]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]]. Ireland is dominated by R1b-L21 (\"Celtic\"), which is also found in north western [[France]], the north coast of [[Spain]], and western [[Norway]] on [[continental Europe]].<ref>{{harvnb|Balaresque|Bowden|Adams|Ho-Yee|2010}}; {{harvnb|Myres|Rootsi|Lin|J\u00e4rve|2011}}; {{harvnb|Cruciani|Trombetta|Antonelli|Pascone|2011}}</ref> But R1B L21 is also common and dominates certain parts of England more so than other lineages.\n\nThere are various smaller and geographically well-defined Y-DNA Haplogroups under R1b in Western Europe.\n\n'''Haplogroup R1a''', a distant cousin of R1b, is most common in [[Eastern Europe]]. In Britain it is associated with Scandinavian immigration during periods of Viking settlement. 25% of men in Norway belong to this haplogroup; it is much more common in Norway than the rest of Scandinavia and are survivors of its original population predating the 5000 BCE invasion of haplogroup I. Around 9% of all Scottish men belong to the Norwegian R1a subclade, which peaks at over 30% in [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bowden|Balaresque|King|Hansen|2008}}</ref> However, there is no conclusive evidence that all came with Vikings, and similarities could have arisen from similar pre-Viking settlement patterns. Current Scandinavians belong to a range of haplogroups.\n\n'''Haplogroup I''' is a grouping of several quite distantly related lineages. Looking at the three main clusters, according to {{harvnb|Rootsi|Kivisild|Benuzzi|Help|2004}} with up-dated nomenclature according to ISOGG:<ref name=isogg/>-\n*I1a in Rootsi ''et al.'', now known as I1, is mainly associated with [[Scandinavia]] in modern populations and is common in several parts of England, with frequency as high in [[Eastern England]] as it is in Scandinavia.\n*I1b in Rootsi ''et al.'', now known as I2a, is associated with the [[Balkans]].\n*I1c in Rootsi ''et al.'', now known as I2b, is less clearly associated with any particular part of Europe.\n\n'''Haplogroups E1b1b and J''' in Europe are regarded as markers of Neolithic movements from the Middle East to [[Southern Europe]] and likely to Northern Europe from there. These haplogroups are found most often in Southern Europe and [[North Africa]]. Both are rare in Northern Europe; E1b1b is found in 1% of Norwegian men, 1.5% of Scottish, 2% of English, 2.5% of Danish, 3% of Swedish and 5.5% of German. It reaches its peak in Europe in [[Kosovo]] at 47.5% and [[Greece]] at 30%.<ref>{{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Uncommon Y haplogroups===\nGeneticists have found that seven men with the surname Revis, which originates in [[Yorkshire]], carry a genetic signature previously found only in people of [[West Africa]]n origin. All of the men belonged to [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)#A1a-M31|Haplogroup A1a]] (M31), a subclade of [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup A]] which geneticists believe originated in Eastern or [[Southern Africa]].<ref name=King2007a>{{harvnb|King|Parkin|Swinfield|Cruciani|2007a}}</ref> The men are not regarded as [[phenotype|phenotypically]] African and there are no documents, anecdotal evidence or oral traditions suggesting that the Revis family has African ancestry. It has been conjectured that the presence of this haplogroup may date from the [[Roman Britain|Roman era]], when both Africans and Romans of African descent are known to have settled in Britain.<ref name=King2007a/> According to Bryan Sykes, \"although the Romans ruled from AD 43 until 410, they left a tiny genetic footprint.\" The genetics of some visibly white (European) people in England suggests that they are \"descended from north African, Middle Eastern and Roman clans\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nGeneticists have shown that former [[President of the United States|American president]] [[Thomas Jefferson]], who might have been of Welsh descent, along with two other British men of the 85 British men with the surname Jefferson, carry the rare Y chromosome marker [[Haplogroup T (Y-DNA)|T]]. This is typically found in [[East Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. It is also found in 4.5% of Greek men, 3.5% of [[Estonia]]n, and 2.5% of Spanish and Italian men, also scattered across the [[Alps]]. There have been no other documented cases of Haplogroup T occurring in Northern Europe other than those two cases. The presence of scattered and diverse European haplotypes within the network is nonetheless consistent with Jefferson's patrilineage belonging to an ancient and rare indigenous European type.<ref>{{harvnb|King|Bowden|Balaresque|Adams|2007b}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-3}}\n*[[Prehistoric Britain]]\n*[[Historical immigration to Great Britain]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon

{"title_page": "John Hill Hewitt", "text_new": "{{short description|American songwriter, playwright and poet}}\n[[Image:John Hill Hewitt1852.jpg|thumb|John Hill Hewitt, 1852]]\n\n'''John Hill Hewitt''' (July 11, 1801, New York City&mdash;October 7, 1890, [[Baltimore]]) was an American songwriter, playwright, and poet. He is best known for his songs about the [[Southern United States|American South]], including \"A Minstrel's Return from the War\", \"The Soldier's Farewell\", \"The Stonewall Quickstep\", and \"Somebody's Darling\". His output during the [[American Civil War]] earned him the [[epithet]]s \"Bard of the Stars and Bars\"<ref>Silber 57.</ref> and \"Bard of the Confederacy\".<ref name=\"Abel 63\">Abel 63.</ref>\n\nOver his career, Hewitt wrote over 300 songs, a number of [[cantata]]s and [[operetta]]s, and one [[oratorio]], as well as plays, poems, and articles for magazines and newspapers.<ref name=\"Abel 63\"/> He also worked as a [[theatre manager]], [[editing|magazine]] and [[newspaper editor]], concert performer, and music teacher at seminaries for women.\n\n==Early life and career==\n\nHewitt was born in New York City, into a musical family. His father, [[James Hewitt (musician)|James Hewitt]], was an influential [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]], composer, and musician; his sister, [[Sophia Hewitt Ostinelli]], would eventually become a renowned pianist. His brother, [[James Lang Hewitt]], eventually took over his father's publishing operations; James was married to the poet, [[Mary E. Hewitt]]. His niece was soprano [[Eliza Biscaccianti]].\n\nNevertheless, Hewitt's father tried to steer his son away from the music business, [[apprenticeship|apprenticing]] him in a number of other fields. In 1818, Hewitt entered [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. His grades were bad overall, but the school provided his first formal musical training. By 1822, Hewitt did not have the grades to graduate, and his military career ended when he challenged a school officer to a [[duel]].\n\n==Hewitt in the South==\n\nHewitt moved to [[Augusta, Georgia]], in 1823 to join his father's theatrical troupe. Their theatre burned down soon after his arrival, but Hewitt decided to stay in Augusta and open a music store where he could give private lessons for [[flute]] and piano. He became enamored of the South and its genteel traditions, and he enjoyed the attention paid to him by the wealthy parents of his pupils. However, Hewitt grew disillusioned as he realized that his dinner invitations came because his hosts wanted live music, not his company.\n\nStill, Hewitt took a permanent teaching position at the Baptist Female Academy in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], in 1824, tutoring on the side. When a rival intimated that Hewitt was in fact a [[mulatto]], Hewitt's private students quit him. He eventually had [[John C. Calhoun]] write a letter attesting to the allegation's falsity.\n\n==Bard of the Confederacy==\n\nIn 1825, Hewitt wrote \"[http://imslp.org/wiki/The_Minstrel%27s_Return_from_the_War_(Hewitt,_John_Hill) The Minstrel's Return from the War]\" and published it through his brother in [[Boston]]. The song eventually became a success internationally, making him the first American-born composer whose fame reached both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Abel 63\"/> He married Estelle Mangin in 1827. In 1833 Hewitt was editor of the [[Baltimore Saturday Visiter]]. Not until 1840 would Hewitt pursue writing as a profession. That year he moved to Washington, D.C., to start and edit a newspaper. Over the next few years, he moved again and again, eventually ending up in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. There he took a position at the Chesapeake Female College and remained for nine years. His wife died during this tenure.\n\nBy the start of the [[American Civil War]], Hewitt had moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia. He attempted to join the [[Confederate States Army]], giving his background at West Point for credentials. He was already 60 years old, however, and the army would only offer him a [[drill sergeant|drillmaster]] position. Hewitt turned it down. Instead, he took a job in November 1861 as the manager of the [[Richmond Theatre]]. During his stint there, he staged many of his own works, but in less than two years, the theatre owners grew tired of his authoritarian management practices. Hewitt was replaced by [[R. D'Orsey Ogden]].\n\nHe moved back to Augusta, where he joined [[Alfred Waldron (writer)|Alfred Waldron]] to write pieces for the theatre and for the [[Queen Sisters]], including the [[ballad]] operas ''[[King Linkum the First]]'' and ''[[The Vivandiere]]''. He also began tutoring in private again, and he married an 18-year-old pupil named Mary Smith in 1863. With her he would father four more children, for a total of 11.\n\nIn 1863 and 1864, Hewitt traveled with the Queen Sisters as a songwriter. They popularized his song \"[[All Quiet Along the Potomac Tonight]]\", which became such a hit that his publisher went through five printings of the sheet music.<ref name=\"Abel 63\"/> His poetry, music, and drama grew increasingly pro-[[Southern United States|Southern]] and pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]]. He published through [[John Schreiner]] beginning in 1864, but sent pieces secretly to the Blackmars under the pen name \"Eugene Raymond\". His ''[[Jephtha]]'' in 1846 may have been the first [[oratorio]] written by an American.<ref>Lawrence 396.</ref> Hewitt's output earned him the [[epithet]]s \"Bard of the Stars and Bars\" and \"Father of the American Ballad\".\n\nHewitt eventually bought the Augusta-based Blackmar publishers, but the business failed after the war. Hewitt returned to Virginia to teach at the Wesleyan Female Institute in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] and at the Dunbar Female Institute in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]]. He bounced back and forth between Maryland and Georgia for the next few years, eventually ending up in Baltimore. He remained there until his death on 7 October 1890.\n\n==Notes==\n\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n\n* Abel, E. Lawrence (2000).

We love her verse and everything that she's brought to the song \u2013 I think she really elevates it.\" Cara said, \"I met Dan last year and we got on really well, we talked about doing something together and he sent me the song a little while later. I loved the concept and thought it was both sonically and lyrically really great, as all Bastille stuff is.

When talking about the collabration, [[Dan Smith (singer)|Dan Smith]] said, \"I'd always heard 'Another Place' as a duet and wanted it to be a story told from two perspectives, it's not something we've ever done, outside of our mixtapes, but we are huge fans of Alessia's \u2014 her voice and her song-writing are so distinct and brilliant \u2014 and we sent it to her to see if she'd be up for jumping on it with us. We love her verse and everything that she's brought to the song \u2013 I think she really elevates it.\" Cara said, \"I met Dan last year and we got on really well, we talked about doing something together and he sent me the song a little while later. I loved the concept and thought it was both sonically and lyrically really great, as all Bastille stuff is. It all came together pretty naturally, and I can't wait for people to hear it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/bastille-alessia-cara-reworking-another-place-doom-days-2563739|title=Bastille call upon Alessia Cara for reworking of their track 'Another Place'|publisher=[[NME]]|accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nA music video to accompany the release of \"Another Place\" was first released onto YouTube on 1 November 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85Ur_SJU1Qg|title=Bastille, Alessia Cara - Another Place|via=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Digital download (Album version)\n| title1  = Another Place\n| length1 = 3:31\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Digital download (Single)\n| title1  = Another Place\n| note1   = with.
