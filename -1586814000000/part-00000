He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]\n \n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008.

[[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. \n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]]\n[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus.

The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|149x149px|Cynic - Focus]]\n \n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008.

[[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. \n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]]\n[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]]\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus.

The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full-length record by 2021.\n\nIn 2016, Masvidal, along with collaborator [[Amy Correia]], composed the musical score for the award-winning feature film ''[[The Tiger Hunter]]'', featuring lead actor [[Danny Pudi]] \n\nMasvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures. His credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. In 2013 Masvidal founded composing collective [http://stillmotionmusic.com/ Still Motion Music] which scored music for numerous TV series on H2, National Geographic, Bravo, ABC and PBS. Masvidal also has a library songs regularly performed on network and cable television. Music writer Jeff Wagner, in his book ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]:'' Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal, stated that \"any viewer of ''3rd Rock from the Sun'', ''That '70s Show'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and any number of random television programs has probably stumbled across Cynic's core members without even knowing it.\" In 2015, Masvidal produced a children's album for actor [[Jim Carrey]] titled ''How Roland Rolls''.\n[[File:Cynic Humanoid.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Humanoid (Single)]]\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2018, Cynic released a digital single, titled \"Humanoid\". The song marked the first new music from the progressive pioneers since the band's 2014 album ''Kindly Bent to Free Us''. The artwork for \"Humanoid\" features a detail from the painting \"Ayahuasca Dream\" by [[Robert Venosa]], Cynic's longtime collaborator and celebrated artist who passed away in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn 2019 and 2020 Masvidal ventured into releasing work as a solo artist under the name 'Masvidal' releasing three conceptual albums titled ''Mythical Human Vessel.''

Yuan Xiangqin walks past Jiang Zhishu and trips on the stairs, taking along Zhishu's phone. As Jiang Zhishu tries to figure how to save Yuan Xiangqin and his phone from breaking, Xiangqin reluctantly grabs on to his tie and their lips meet, signalling their first meeting. She then meets Jiang Zhishu again at a school assembly as he talks about his ongoing project in Boston, and finds out he's an extraordinarily smart person with a 200IQ score in the A class.\n\nTwo years later, she still is fawning over Jiang Zhishu, over his social media page. Whilst trying to get rid of the F class for bees, she sees a social media update for his account saying that he's walking back to the A building and hundreds of fans including herself start running. As the A class gate closes, she has an ultimatum to confess to him. Later on in F class, she notices that a fire drill will start, shutting down all technology and thus allowing her to get through the A gate. She runs, finds Jiang Zhishu and confesses, to which he cold-heartedly rejects. All students in the A grade recorded this embarrassing moment and thus make fun of Yuan Xiangqin whilst the principal scolds her for wasting Zhishu's time.\n\nXiangqin's house later collapses due to poor construction, combined with the previous confession, she is the centre of everyone's attention. As Jiang Zhishu walks past, Xiangqin challenges Zhishu that an F grader can get on the top 100 list for a trial exam. He agrees. Xiangqin moves in to her father's friend's house, without knowing that it is where Jiang Zhishu resides. Over the course of time, Xiangqin and Zhishu get closer through Zhishu's mother where she encourages their relationship and encounters at school and at his house.\n\nTo save Xiangqin from embarrassment over not making the top 100, she begs Zhishu to help her study for the mock exam which he reluctantly agrees to due to her having an embarrassing video of his received by his mother. She makes 100th tied, whilst Zhishu still remains 1st. Zhishu and his cohort then embarrasses Xiangqin at an athletics carnival as she is revealed to reside in Zhishu's house, into which she streams the embarrassing video of his at his house. Xiangqin and Zhishu then quarrel before Zhishu kisses Xiangqin on the lips before leaving.\n\nTwo years later, Xiangqin is seen to support Zhishu at Zhishu's mother's request but is left out of his life as Zhishu wants to live his own life and become a veterinary doctor. Xiangqin follows Zhishu around to see another woman living at his apartment but finds out that she is there for business only. She is relieved and Zhishu kisses Xiangqin one more time before finding out his father becoming sick and thus takes over his business, adding stress and pressure to his life. Caring for Xiangqin but prioritising the business, he throws away Xiangqin in order to marry another woman to combine their businesses and thus save his father's business. Xiangqin then promptly rejects his love and runs away. Zhishu's father and mother disagree with Zhishu's decision to marry and tells him it should be from his heart whom he should marry.\n\nAnother year passes by, and we see Xiangqin looking through Zhishu's social media. Zhishu then posts an update at the school hall in which he will talk at an assembly, in which Xiangqin goes to reluctantly. She then enters the hall and sees that no one is there but him. Zhishu then hides away and Xiangqin calls Zhishu's brother, into which he responds that only certain people can see what he posts. She then realises that the posts were meant for her. Zhishu then proposes to Xiangqin in which she agrees. A flashback occurs at the end in which Zhishu wakes up from his slumber during his time where he tutors Xiangqin and sees the love letter Xiangqin wrote for him. At that time, the audience finds out that Zhishu was in love with her.\n\nTheir marriage is seen in the post-credits scene.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Darren Wang]] as Jiang Zhishu \n* [[Lin Yun]] as Yuan Xiangqin \n* Kenji Chen as Ah Jin\n* [[Cecilia Choi]] as Sha Hui\n* [[Christopher Lee Meng Soon|Christopher Lee]] as Zhishu's father\n* [[Christy Chung]] as Zhishu's mother\n* [[Tai Chih-yuan]] as Xiangqin's father\n* [[Tsai Yi-chen]] as Li Mei \n* [[This Group Of People]] as various supporting roles\n\n==Soundtrack==\n*Really Foolish (\u771f\u7684\u50bb) by [[Lala Hsu]] \n*Proof of Heartbeat (\u5fc3\u8df3\u7684\u8bc1\u660e) by Liu Renyu \n*I Belong To You by [[Kuo Shu-yao]]\n*Hundred Ways Of Not Liking You (\u4e00\u767e\u4e2a\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5) by \u623f\u4e1c\u7684\u732b\n\n== Release ==\nOutside of Taiwan, Fall in Love at First Kiss was released in Malaysia, China, Australia, New Zealand, United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom on exactly the same day.

The colonial government favored imports of British textiles. Colonial authorities attempted to suppress the local weaving culture. Muslin production greatly declined and the knowledge of weaving was nearly eradicated.

Almon |pages=194\u2013195}}</ref> As a result, the quality of muslin suffered and the finesse of the cloth was lost.\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Dress-making and sewing ===\n[[File:Muslin-Dresses-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Advantages of wearing Muslin Dresses!'' (1802), [[James Gillray]] caricatured a hazard of untreated muslin: its flammability.]]\n\nWhen [[sewing]] clothing, a [[dressmaker]] may test the fit of a garment, using an inexpensive muslin fabric before cutting pieces from expensive fabric, thereby avoiding potential costly mistakes. This garment is often called a \"muslin,\" and the process is called \"making a muslin.\" In this context, \"muslin\" has become the generic term for a test or fitting garment, regardless of what it is made from.\n\nMuslin is also often used as a backing or lining for quilts, and thus can often be found in wide widths in the quilting sections of fabric stores.\n\nIn Asia, Muslin is used for making sarees. Bengali or Dhakai Muslin Saree is popular in Asia. \n\n<br />\n\n=== Shellac polishing ===\nMuslin is used as a French polishing pad.\n\n=== Culinary ===\n{{main|Cheesecloth}}\nMuslin can be used as a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]:\n* In a funnel when decanting fine wine or port to prevent sediment from entering the decanter\n* To separate liquid from mush (for example, to make apple juice: wash, chop, boil, mash, then filter by pouring the mush into a muslin bag suspended over a jug)\n* To retain a liquidy solid (for example, in home cheese-making, when the milk has curdled to a gel, pour into a muslin bag and squash between two saucers (upside down under a brick) to squeeze out the liquid whey from the cheese curd)\n\nMuslin is the material for the traditional [[pudding cloth|cloth]] wrapped around a [[Christmas pudding]].\n\nMuslin is the fabric wrapped around the items in [[barmbrack]], a fruitcake traditionally eaten at Halloween in Ireland.\n\nMuslin is used when making traditional [[Kava culture#Fiji|Fijian Kava]] as a filter.\n\n[[beekeeping|Beekeepers]] use muslin to filter melted beeswax to clean it of particles and debris.\n\n=== Theater and photography ===\nMuslin is often the cloth of choice for theater sets. It is used to mask the background of [[set construction|sets]] and to establish the mood or feel of different scenes. It receives paint well and, if treated properly, can be made translucent.\n\nIt also holds dyes well. It is often used to create nighttime scenes because when dyed, it often gets a wavy look with the color varying slightly, such that it resembles a night sky. Muslin [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinks]] after it is painted or sprayed with water, which is desirable in some common techniques such as [[Flats (theater)|soft-covered flats]].\n\nIn video production as well, muslin is used as a cheap [[Chroma key|greenscreen or bluescreen]], either pre-colored or painted with latex paint (diluted with water). It is commonly used as a background for the [[chroma key]] technique.\n\nMuslin is the most common backdrop material used by photographers for formal portrait backgrounds. These backdrops are usually painted, most often with an abstract mottled pattern.\n\nIn the early days of [[silent film]]-making, and up until the late 1910s, movie studios did not have the elaborate lights needed to illuminate indoor sets, so most interior scenes were sets built outdoors with large pieces of muslin hanging overhead to diffuse sunlight.\n\n=== Medicine ===\n[[File:Semplici medicamenti per i soldati.jpg|thumb|A [[first-aid]] packet of 5m of \"hydrophilic muslin\", given to Italian soldiers in World War I]]\nSurgeons use muslin [[gauze]] in [[cerebrovascular]] [[neurosurgery]] to wrap around [[aneurysm]]s or intracranial vessels at risk for bleeding.<ref>{{citation |last=Pool |first=J. |date=1976 |title=Muslin gauze in intracranial vascular surgery.

A large piece of the fabric used on the original Wright Flyer (1903) was passed down to Wright descendants. The fabric was made available to The Wright Experience<ref>The Wright Experience</ref>(reproduction of the Wright gliders and Flyer and reenactment of the first flight on its 100th anniversary) for examination as it was no longer commercially available a century after its use by the Wrights. To create an authentic modern reproduction of the original fabric, three different companies were needed which produced the thread, the weaving, and the finishing.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Muslin trade in Bengal]]\n* [[Jamdani]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Muslin}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last1=Asher|first1=Catherine B.|last2=Talbot|first2=Cynthia|title=India Before Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvaGuaJIJgoC&pg=PA281|year= 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80904-7|pages=281\u2013}}\n*{{citation|last=Eaton|first=Richard M.|title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC&pg=PA202|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20507-9|pages=202\u2013}}\n*Islam, Khademul. 2016.

The colonial government favored imports of British textiles. Colonial authorities attempted to suppress the local weaving culture. Muslin production greatly declined and the knowledge of weaving was nearly eradicated. It is alleged that in some instances the weavers were rounded up and their thumbs chopped off, although this has been refuted as an alleged misreading of a report from 1772.<ref>{{citation |last1=Bolts |first1=William |date=1772 |title=Considerations on India affairs |publisher=J Almon |page=194 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Edwards |first=Michael |date=June 1976 |title=Growth of the British Cotton Trade 1780\u20131815 |publisher=Augustus M Kelley Pubs |page=37 |isbn=0-678-06775-9}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Marshall |first=P.

(1802), [[James Gillray]] caricatured a hazard of untreated muslin: its flammability.]]\n\nWhen [[sewing]] clothing, a [[dressmaker]] may test the fit of a garment, using an inexpensive muslin fabric before cutting pieces from expensive fabric, thereby avoiding potential costly mistakes. This garment is often called a \"muslin,\" and the process is called \"making a muslin.\" In this context, \"muslin\" has become the generic term for a test or fitting garment, regardless of what it is made from.\n\nMuslin is also often used as a backing or lining for quilts, and thus can often be found in wide widths in the quilting sections of fabric stores.\n\nIn Asia, Muslin is used for making sarees. Bengali or Dhakai Muslin Saree is popular in Asia. \n\n<br />\n\n=== Shellac polishing ===\nMuslin is used as a French polishing pad.\n\n=== Culinary ===\n{{main|Cheesecloth}}\nMuslin can be used as a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]:\n* In a funnel when decanting fine wine or port to prevent sediment from entering the decanter\n* To separate liquid from mush (for example, to make apple juice: wash, chop, boil, mash, then filter by pouring the mush into a muslin bag suspended over a jug)\n* To retain a liquidy solid (for example, in home cheese-making, when the milk has curdled to a gel, pour into a muslin bag and squash between two saucers (upside down under a brick) to squeeze out the liquid whey from the cheese curd)\n\nMuslin is the material for the traditional [[pudding cloth|cloth]] wrapped around a [[Christmas pudding]].\n\nMuslin is the fabric wrapped around the items in [[barmbrack]], a fruitcake traditionally eaten at Halloween in Ireland.\n\nMuslin is used when making traditional [[Kava culture#Fiji|Fijian Kava]] as a filter.\n\n[[beekeeping|Beekeepers]] use muslin to filter melted beeswax to clean it of particles and debris.\n\n=== Theater and photography ===\nMuslin is often the cloth of choice for theater sets. It is used to mask the background of [[set construction|sets]] and to establish the mood or feel of different scenes. It receives paint well and, if treated properly, can be made translucent.\n\nIt also holds dyes well. It is often used to create nighttime scenes because when dyed, it often gets a wavy look with the color varying slightly, such that it resembles a night sky. Muslin [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinks]] after it is painted or sprayed with water, which is desirable in some common techniques such as [[Flats (theater)|soft-covered flats]].\n\nIn video production as well, muslin is used as a cheap [[Chroma key|greenscreen or bluescreen]], either pre-colored or painted with latex paint (diluted with water). It is commonly used as a background for the [[chroma key]] technique.\n\nMuslin is the most common backdrop material used by photographers for formal portrait backgrounds. These backdrops are usually painted, most often with an abstract mottled pattern.\n\nIn the early days of [[silent film]]-making, and up until the late 1910s, movie studios did not have the elaborate lights needed to illuminate indoor sets, so most interior scenes were sets built outdoors with large pieces of muslin hanging overhead to diffuse sunlight.\n\n=== Medicine ===\n[[File:Semplici medicamenti per i soldati.jpg|thumb|A [[first-aid]] packet of 5m of \"hydrophilic muslin\", given to Italian soldiers in World War I]]\nSurgeons use muslin [[gauze]] in [[cerebrovascular]] [[neurosurgery]] to wrap around [[aneurysm]]s or intracranial vessels at risk for bleeding.<ref>{{citation |last=Pool |first=J. |date=1976 |title=Muslin gauze in intracranial vascular surgery.

A large piece of the fabric used on the original Wright Flyer (1903) was passed down to Wright descendants. The fabric was made available to The Wright Experience<ref>The Wright Experience</ref>(reproduction of the Wright gliders and Flyer and reenactment of the first flight on its 100th anniversary) for examination as it was no longer commercially available a century after its use by the Wrights. To create an authentic modern reproduction of the original fabric, three different companies were needed which produced the thread, the weaving, and the finishing.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Muslin trade in Bengal]]\n* [[Jamdani]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Muslin}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last1=Asher|first1=Catherine B.|last2=Talbot|first2=Cynthia|title=India Before Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvaGuaJIJgoC&pg=PA281|year= 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80904-7|pages=281\u2013}}\n*{{citation|last=Eaton|first=Richard M.|title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC&pg=PA202|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20507-9|pages=202\u2013}}\n*Islam, Khademul. 2016.

It descended to his grandson [[Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam]] (1745-1816) of [[Mount Merrion]], Dublin, Ireland, who named it \"FitzWilliam House\" and there formed his famous art collection and by his will founded the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in Cambridge. The monument to Sir Matthew Decker and Richard FitzWilliam survives against the external wall of St Mary Magdalene's Church, Richmond. FitzWilliam's heir was his cousin [[George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke]] (1759-1827), of [[Wilton House]] in Wiltshire, who renamed the house \"Pembroke House\".

Each coach has two [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]] [[diesel engine]]s underneath, which drive the wheels mechanically through a [[fluid flywheel]]. The driver's cab at each end of the unit means it can be driven from either end, making it ideal when running to [[Coopersale]], and speeding up turn-around times. The windows in the ends mean passengers in either coach get an excellent view of the line ahead or behind and also get to watch the driver in action.

There was talk of the line being electrified by the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] with overhead electrification before the [[Second World War]] intervened. Some local lines were electrified quite early on, for example to Shenfield and Southend, and the next generations of EMUs continue to work services on those lines into Liverpool Street.\n\nWhile the 3rd & 4th conductor rails were removed by the new owners, the line still hosts electric style units, though without the electrification they are hauled by a [[diesel locomotive]].

The Buffet was moved again in 2001 to the workshops at Ovington and where the coach finally received covered accommodation.

There were 127 of this type of vehicle and they were delivered new in 1959 to Southall depot working services between Paddington and the suburbs. They continued to be based in the London area until withdrawal in the 1990s, they arrived at the Railway in 2004. Each coach has two [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]] [[diesel engine]]s underneath, which drive the wheels mechanically through a [[fluid flywheel]]. The driver's cab at each end of the unit means it can be driven from either end, making it ideal when running to [[Coopersale]], and speeding up turn-around times. The windows in the ends mean passengers in either coach get an excellent view of the line ahead or behind and also get to watch the driver in action. The unit ran in an unusual dark blue and white 'EOR' livery until 2007, when it was taken out of service by the new owner when services were suspended. The interior has been refurbished, the unit is receiving attention to the exterior bodywork. DMBS is being restored; DMS is in service twinned with a Class 121 unpowered driving trailer.<ref>http://eorailway.co.uk/departments/rolling-stock/mus/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n| [[File:EOR DMU LeeScott.JPG|150px]]\n|  DMBS is being restored; DMS operational.\n|-\n| [[British Rail]]\n| W56287 -\n| [[British Rail Class 121|Class 121 DTS(Trailer)]]\n| \n| \n|  Operational\n|}\n\n===DEMUs ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The volunteer team at EOR has restored the unit, complete with its commuter-style interior and is now painted in former \"Network SouthEast\" livery.

There was talk of the line being electrified by the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] with overhead electrification before the [[Second World War]] intervened. Some local lines were electrified quite early on, for example to Shenfield and Southend, and the next generations of EMUs continue to work services on those lines into Liverpool Street.\n\nWhile the 3rd & 4th conductor rails were removed by the new owners, the line still hosts electric style units, though without the electrification they are hauled by a [[diesel locomotive]]. Due to cost, safety issues and legislation it is not possible to re-electrify the branch.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Origin\n! Number\n! Class\n! Notes\n!

The Buffet was moved again in 2001 to the workshops at Ovington and where the coach finally received covered accommodation. The owner decided in 2010, that carriage would fit in well here, and after needing to vacate the site at Ovington, the ownership of carriage was transferred to Epping Ongar Railway Holdings Limited, on the understanding that, in due course, it would be restored to its former glory.
