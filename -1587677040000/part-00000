The UK arm of [[Poale Zion]], a Jewish workers movement, called ''Poale Zion (Great Britain)'', later the [[Jewish Labour Movement]], affiliated to the Labour Party in 1920.{{efn|There was a division of labour between Poale Zion and [[Chaim Weizmann]], the leader of the general Zionist movement, who lobbied in Britain for support for a Jewish state on the grounds that the latter would conform to the liberal capitalist model that would serve the interests of the British Empire: 'The British, he wrote in 1924, \"have come to realize that they have very little to lean on for protection of the jugular vein of the British Empire, except a Palestine peacefully developed and economically and politically stable. They begin to realize that such a Palestine can only be brought into effect if Jewish enterprise is allowed free course in that country\".'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=3}}}} Many prominent Labour leaders had an affinity with the goals of [[Labour Zionism]], but were initially reluctant to press for parliamentary support for relieving obstacles to Jewish immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], given the party's commitment to an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialistic policy]]. In 1920, they gave unqualified support to both the [[Balfour Declaration]] and the British [[Mandate for Palestine]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|pp=26\u201328}} The basic principles that evolved stressed (a) gradual growth of a Jewish homeland through selective immigration; (b) the formation of a [[One-state solution|binational society]] and (c) criticism of Zionism's [[Separatism|separatist agenda]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|p=89}}\n\n===Support for Israel===\nGenerally, Labour support for Israel continued, in the expectancy that the Labour Zionist strand in Jewish state-building would lead to socialism and development in the Middle East generally. [[Ernest Bevin]], Britain's [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 1945 to 1951, was critical of Zionist goals; he argued that Jews should be convinced to resettle in Europe, and said that Americans supported Jewish immigration to Palestine because \"they did not want too many Jews in New York\". Bevin also voiced antisemitic canards between Jews and finance, as well as communism. There is no evidence that this affected his political decisions.{{sfn|Weiler|2016|pp=75,170ff}}{{efn|British officials of the Mandatory administration dealing with the conflicting demands of the Arab and Jewish communities were conscious of the potential international reverberation of their decisions particularly in the US and in Muslim countries. They were inclined to see the Zionists as more troublesome, endlessly petitioning with new demands and calling the administration to account on the basis of the Mandate and the Balfour Declaration. If the Zionist movement's demand in Palestine was turned down at the first port of call its representatives were likely to raise the matter at a higher level, if necessary all the way up the chain of command to ministers in London. With antisemitism endemic among colonial officials, as among all sections of British society, they often expressed their resentment at attempts to outmanoeuvre them in racist terms.

The UK arm of [[Poale Zion]], a Jewish workers movement, called ''Poale Zion (Great Britain)'', later the [[Jewish Labour Movement]], affiliated to the Labour Party in 1920.{{efn|There was a division of labour between Poale Zion and [[Chaim Weizmann]], the leader of the general Zionist movement, who lobbied in Britain for support for a Jewish state on the grounds that the latter would conform to the liberal capitalist model that would serve the interests of the British Empire: 'The British, he wrote in 1924, \"have come to realize that they have very little to lean on for protection of the jugular vein of the British Empire, except a Palestine peacefully developed and economically and politically stable. They begin to realize that such a Palestine can only be brought into effect if Jewish enterprise is allowed free course in that country\".'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=3}}}} Many prominent Labour leaders had an affinity with the goals of [[Labour Zionism]], but were initially reluctant to press for parliamentary support for relieving obstacles to Jewish immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], given the party's commitment to an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialistic policy]]. In 1920, they gave unqualified support to both the [[Balfour Declaration]] and the British [[Mandate for Palestine]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|pp=26\u201328}} The basic principles that evolved stressed (a) gradual growth of a Jewish homeland through selective immigration; (b) the formation of a [[One-state solution|binational society]] and (c) criticism of Zionism's [[Separatism|separatist agenda]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|p=89}}\n\n===Support for Israel===\nGenerally, Labour support for Israel continued, in the expectancy that the Labour Zionist strand in Jewish state-building would lead to socialism and development in the Middle East generally. [[Ernest Bevin]], Britain's [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 1945 to 1951, was critical of Zionist goals; he argued that Jews should be convinced to resettle in Europe, and said that Americans supported Jewish immigration to Palestine because \"they did not want too many Jews in New York\". Bevin also voiced antisemitic canards between Jews and finance, as well as communism. There is no evidence that this affected his political decisions.{{sfn|Weiler|2016|pp=75,170ff}}{{efn|British officials of the Mandatory administration dealing with the conflicting demands of the Arab and Jewish communities were conscious of the potential international reverberation of their decisions particularly in the US and in Muslim countries. They were inclined to see the Zionists as more troublesome, endlessly petitioning with new demands and calling the administration to account on the basis of the Mandate and the Balfour Declaration. If the Zionist movement's demand in Palestine was turned down at the first port of call its representatives were likely to raise the matter at a higher level, if necessary all the way up the chain of command to ministers in London. With antisemitism endemic among colonial officials, as among all sections of British society, they often expressed their resentment at attempts to outmanoeuvre them in racist terms. Yet, if this was an overtly hostile form of racism by comparison with the apparently more benign, paternalistic and version directed at the Arabs, British rule nonetheless maintained the political and economic framework that favoured Jewish nation-building at the expense of Arab interests.'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=5}}}}\n\n===Growing sympathy for Palestine===\n[[Aberystwyth University]]'s James R. Vaughn says the rise of a radical [[anti-Zionism]] in the Labour Party started with the creation of the Labour Middle East Council in 1969 by [[Christopher Mayhew]].{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|pp=1\u201325}}{{efn|Both Bevin and Mayhew (the latter later defected to the Liberal Party), had been subject to death threats by the [[Stern Gang]] in the 1940s.{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|p=4}}}} [[Dave Rich]] concurs that Mayhew founded the council in order to change the \"pro-Israel\" position of the Labour Party{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=26}} and references the influence of pro-Palestinian activists within the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]].{{sfn|Rich|2018|p=98}}\n\nBy the 1980s, with the election of [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party, the emergence of [[Religious nationalism|messianic nationalism]], [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economic reforms]], the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupation of the West Bank]] and of the [[Gaza Strip]], and the decline of the [[Israeli Labor Party]], socialism declined in Israel. These factors contributed to falling Labour support for Israel, at the same time as there was growing sympathy for Palestinian aspirations for statehood.{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=2}} According to June Edmunds, Lecturer in Sociology of the [[University of Sussex]], the party's leadership was initially supportive of Israel but shifted to support Palestine in the early 1980s, although the membership did not; later challenges to this shift eventually resulted in a more balanced view of both sides and broad support for a [[two-state solution]].<ref name=EdmundsJune>{{Cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/11/1/23/1647783|title=The Evolution of British Labour Party Policy on Israel from 1967 to the Intifada|first=June|last=Edmunds|date=1 January 2000|journal=Twentieth Century British History|volume=11|issue=1|pages=23\u201341|via=academic.oup.com|doi=10.1093/tcbh/11.1.23}}</ref> Edmunds credits the shift towards Palestine aspirations to more moderate appeals by Palestinians, a sharp shift to the right in Israeli politics and an increase in anti-colonial politics among the left.<ref name=EdmundsJune />\n\n[[Richard Seymour (writer)|Richard Seymour]] wrote in 2018 that \"Palestinian rights have been a growing concern in the British Left since the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]]\"{{sfn|Seymour|2018b}} when \"the British trade union movement and the Labour Party began to break with Israel in response\".{{sfn|Seymour|2018a}} The Labour Committee on Palestine was formed in June 1982 to challenge the Labour Middle East Council, which supported a two-state solution, and to oppose the \"Zionist state as racist, exclusivist, expansionist and a direct agency of imperialism\". Labour politicians [[Ken Livingstone]] of the [[Greater London Council]] and [[Ted Knight (politician)|Ted Knight]] of the [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] were early supporters; the chair was former British Anti-Zionist Organization (BAZO) activist Tony Greenstein.{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=143}} The new Committee backed a resolution at the 1982 [[Labour Party Conference (UK)|Labour Party Conference]] to recognise the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\", which passed at the Conference, \"embarrassing\" the Party leadership.{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=144}}\n\nAntisemitic attitudes are said to have been rare in the Labour Party in the 1980s.{{sfn|Rich|2018}}{{sfn|Hirsh|2017}} In his 2012 book, ''The British Left and Zionism: History of a Divorce'', [[Manchester University]]'s Paul Kelemen ascribed the shift in Labour's views to Israel's increasingly right-leaning politics and to the left's opposition to the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza]]. He found no evidence that antisemitism played a role in the left's changing perceptions of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in that period.{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=185}}{{sfn|Kolpinskaya|2014|p=450}} Daniel L. Staetsky, a senior research fellow for the [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]], stated in his 2017 study ''Antisemitism in Contemporary Great Britain: A Study of Attitudes Towards Jews and Israel'' that, in the 1980s, parts of the political left assumed strong pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel positions, and faced accusations of antisemitism within the Labour Party.{{sfn|Staetsky|2017|p=42}} He found that anti-Israeli positions did not correlate generally with antisemitism, since the majority of those surveyed who were critical of Israel did not espouse an antisemitic attitude<ref>{{harvnb|Staetsky|2017|p=66}} \"We have discovered that anti-Israel attitudes are not, as a general rule, antisemitic.

Yet, all parts of those on the left of the political spectrum \u2013 including the 'slightly left-of-centre,' the 'fairly left-wing' and the 'very left-wing' \u2013 exhibit higher levels of anti-Israelism than average. The most antisemitic group on the political spectrum consists of those who identify as very right-wing: the presence of antisemitic attitudes in this group is two to four times higher compared to the general population.

The most recent analyses support an offshore location for the epicenter, although significant uncertainty remains.<ref name=lomax/> An offshore epicenter is supported by the occurrence of a local [[tsunami]] recorded by a tide gauge at the [[San Francisco Presidio]]; the wave had an amplitude of approximately 3 in (8&nbsp;cm) and an approximate period of 40{{ndash}}45 minutes.<ref>[http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/tsunami/1906.html Tsunami Record from the Great 1906 San Francisco Earthquake], United States Geological Survey, 2008</ref>\n\nAnalysis of triangulation data before and after the earthquake strongly suggest that the rupture along the San Andreas Fault was about 500&nbsp;km in length, in agreement with observed intensity data.

Over a period of 60 years, the city had become the financial, trade and cultural center of the [[Western United States|West]]; operated the busiest port on the West Coast; and was the \"gateway to the Pacific\", through which growing U.S. economic and military power was projected into the Pacific and Asia. Over 80% of the city was destroyed by the earthquake and fire. Though San Francisco rebuilt quickly, the disaster diverted trade, industry and population growth south to Los Angeles,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} which during the 20th century became the largest and most important urban area in the West. Many of the city's leading poets and writers retreated to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]] where, as \"The Barness\", they established the arts colony reputation that continues today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/5aa/5aa300.htm |title=The Carmel Monterey Peninsula Art Colony: A History |first=Barbara J. |last=Klein |publisher=Traditional Fine Arts Organization |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827084926/http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/5aa/5aa300.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2009  }}</ref>\n\nThe 1908 Lawson Report, a study of the 1906 quake led and edited by Professor Andrew Lawson of the University of California, showed that the same [[San Andreas Fault]] which had caused the disaster in San Francisco ran close to Los Angeles as well.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bgQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25 |title=The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906: Report of the State Earthquake Investigation Commission ... |last=Lawson |first=Andrew Cowper |last2=Reid |first2=Harry Fielding |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington |year=1908 |pages=25 |language=en}}</ref> The earthquake was the first natural disaster of its magnitude to be documented by photography and motion picture footage and occurred at a time when the science of [[seismology]] was blossoming.\n\n===Intensity===\nThe most important characteristic of the shaking intensity noted in [[Andrew Lawson]]'s (1908) report was the clear [[correlation]] of intensity with underlying geologic conditions.

Rebuilding funds were immediately tied up by the fact that virtually all the major banks had been sites of the conflagration, requiring a lengthy wait of seven-to-ten days before their fire-proof vaults could cool sufficiently to be safely opened. The Bank of Italy had evacuated its funds and was able to provide liquidity in the immediate aftermath. Its president also immediately chartered and financed the sending of two ships to return with shiploads of lumber from Washington and Oregon mills which provided the initial reconstruction materials and surge.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In 1929, Bank of Italy was renamed and is now known as [[Bank of America]].

Until 1906, the school faculty had provided care at the City-County Hospital ([[San Francisco General Hospital]], 1915\u20132016, but ''Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (SFGH)'' since 2016), but did not have a hospital of its own. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, more than 40,000 people were relocated to a makeshift tent city in Golden Gate Park and were treated by the faculty of the Affiliated Colleges. This brought the school, which until then was located on the western outskirts of the city, in contact with significant population and fueled the commitment of the school towards civic responsibility and health care, increasing the momentum towards the construction of its own health facilities. Finally, in April 1907, one of the buildings was renovated for outpatient care with 75 beds. This created the need to train nursing students, and, in 1907, the [[UCSF School of Nursing|UC Training School for Nurses]] was established, adding a fourth professional school to the Affiliated Colleges.<ref>{{cite web|title=1868\u20131898 \u2013 Introduction \u2013 A History of UCSF |url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/story.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe grandeur of citywide reconstruction schemes required investment from Eastern monetary sources, hence the spin and de-emphasis of the earthquake, the promulgation of the tough new building codes, and subsequent reputation sensitive actions such as the official low death toll. One of the more famous and ambitious plans came from famed urban planner [[Daniel Burnham]]. His bold plan called for, among other proposals, [[Baron Haussmann|Haussmann]]-style avenues, boulevards, [[arterial thoroughfare]]s that radiated across the city, a massive civic center complex with classical structures, and what would have been the largest urban park in the world, stretching from [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]] to [[Lake Merced]] with a large [[wikt:athenaeum|atheneum]] at its peak.

It was pressed ahead mainly by re-insurers. Their aim; a uniform solution to insurance payouts resulting from fires caused by earthquakes. Until 1910, a few countries, especially in Europe, followed the call for an exclusion of the earthquake hazard from all fire insurance contracts. In the U.S., the question was discussed differently. But the traumatized public reacted with fierce opposition. On August 1, 1909, the [[California Senate]] enacted the California Standard Form of Fire Insurance Policy, which did not contain any earthquake clause. Thus the state decided that insurers would have to pay again if another earthquake was followed by fires. Other earthquake-endangered countries followed the California example.<ref>[http://www.rewi.hu-berlin.de/FHI/articles/0610roeder.htm See T.

Previously interpreted as precursory activity to the 1906 earthquake, they have been found to have a strong seasonal pattern and are now believed to be due to large seasonal sediment loads in coastal bays that overlie faults as a result of the erosion caused by [[hydraulic mining]] in the later years of the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FPL00001268 Seasonal Seismicity of Northern California Before the Great 1906 Earthquake], (Journal) Pure and Applied Geophysics, ISSN 0033-4553 (Print) 1420-9136 (Online), volume 159, Numbers 1\u20133 / January 2002, Pages 7\u201362.</ref>\n\nFor years, the epicenter of the quake was assumed to be near the town of [[Olema, California|Olema]], in the [[Point Reyes]] area of [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], due to local earth displacement measurements. In the 1960s, a seismologist at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] proposed that the epicenter was more likely offshore of San Francisco, to the northwest of the [[Golden Gate]]. The most recent analyses support an offshore location for the epicenter, although significant uncertainty remains.<ref name=lomax/> An offshore epicenter is supported by the occurrence of a local [[tsunami]] recorded by a tide gauge at the [[San Francisco Presidio]]; the wave had an amplitude of approximately 3 in (8&nbsp;cm) and an approximate period of 40{{ndash}}45 minutes.<ref>[http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/tsunami/1906.html Tsunami Record from the Great 1906 San Francisco Earthquake], United States Geological Survey, 2008</ref>\n\nAnalysis of triangulation data before and after the earthquake strongly suggest that the rupture along the San Andreas Fault was about 500&nbsp;km in length, in agreement with observed intensity data. The available seismological data support a significantly shorter rupture length, but these observations can be reconciled by allowing propagation at speeds above the [[S-wave]] velocity ([[supershear earthquake|supershear]]).

At the time of the disaster, San Francisco had been the ninth-largest city in the United States and the largest on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], with a population of about 410,000. Over a period of 60 years, the city had become the financial, trade and cultural center of the [[Western United States|West]]; operated the busiest port on the West Coast; and was the \"gateway to the Pacific\", through which growing U.S. economic and military power was projected into the Pacific and Asia. Over 80% of the city was destroyed by the earthquake and fire. Though San Francisco rebuilt quickly, the disaster diverted trade, industry and population growth south to Los Angeles,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} which during the 20th century became the largest and most important urban area in the West. Many of the city's leading poets and writers retreated to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]] where, as \"The Barness\", they established the arts colony reputation that continues today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/5aa/5aa300.htm |title=The Carmel Monterey Peninsula Art Colony: A History |first=Barbara J. |last=Klein |publisher=Traditional Fine Arts Organization |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827084926/http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/5aa/5aa300.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2009  }}</ref>\n\nThe 1908 Lawson Report, a study of the 1906 quake led and edited by Professor Andrew Lawson of the University of California, showed that the same [[San Andreas Fault]] which had caused the disaster in San Francisco ran close to Los Angeles as well.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bgQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25 |title=The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906: Report of the State Earthquake Investigation Commission ... |last=Lawson |first=Andrew Cowper |last2=Reid |first2=Harry Fielding |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington |year=1908 |pages=25 |language=en}}</ref> The earthquake was the first natural disaster of its magnitude to be documented by photography and motion picture footage and occurred at a time when the science of [[seismology]] was blossoming.\n\n===Intensity===\nThe most important characteristic of the shaking intensity noted in [[Andrew Lawson]]'s (1908) report was the clear [[correlation]] of intensity with underlying geologic conditions.

Rebuilding funds were immediately tied up by the fact that virtually all the major banks had been sites of the conflagration, requiring a lengthy wait of seven-to-ten days before their fire-proof vaults could cool sufficiently to be safely opened. The Bank of Italy had evacuated its funds and was able to provide liquidity in the immediate aftermath. Its president also immediately chartered and financed the sending of two ships to return with shiploads of lumber from Washington and Oregon mills which provided the initial reconstruction materials and surge.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In 1929, Bank of Italy was renamed and is now known as [[Bank of America]]. Eleven days after the earthquake a rare Sunday baseball game was played in New York City (which would not allow regular Sunday baseball until 1919) between the Highlanders (soon to be the Yankees) and the Philadelphia Athletics to raise money for quake victims. <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gqF84JTKCNoC&pg=SA7-PA86&lpg=SA7-PA86&dq=%22Sunday+ball+remained+off+limits+in+several+big-league+cities%22&source=bl&ots=x2h9ub4DIh&sig=ACfU3U0xMFBujHf6oI3WIPnVqkcjlSGkoQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiwjt2T1a_gAhVFC6wKHT5gA44Q6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Sunday%20ball%20remained%20off%20limits%20in%20several%20big-league%20cities%22&f=false Baseball in the Garden of Eden: The Secret History of the Early Game], John Thorn, Simon & Schuster Paperbacks, 2011.</ref>\n\n[[William James]], the pioneering American psychologist, was teaching at Stanford at the time of the earthquake and traveled into San Francisco to observe first-hand its aftermath.

Every one is talking of it this afternoon, and no one is in the least degree dismayed.

Until 1906, the school faculty had provided care at the City-County Hospital ([[San Francisco General Hospital]], 1915\u20132016, but ''Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (SFGH)'' since 2016), but did not have a hospital of its own. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, more than 40,000 people were relocated to a makeshift tent city in Golden Gate Park and were treated by the faculty of the Affiliated Colleges. This brought the school, which until then was located on the western outskirts of the city, in contact with significant population and fueled the commitment of the school towards civic responsibility and health care, increasing the momentum towards the construction of its own health facilities. Finally, in April 1907, one of the buildings was renovated for outpatient care with 75 beds. This created the need to train nursing students, and, in 1907, the [[UCSF School of Nursing|UC Training School for Nurses]] was established, adding a fourth professional school to the Affiliated Colleges.<ref>{{cite web|title=1868\u20131898 \u2013 Introduction \u2013 A History of UCSF |url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/story.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe grandeur of citywide reconstruction schemes required investment from Eastern monetary sources, hence the spin and de-emphasis of the earthquake, the promulgation of the tough new building codes, and subsequent reputation sensitive actions such as the official low death toll. One of the more famous and ambitious plans came from famed urban planner [[Daniel Burnham]]. His bold plan called for, among other proposals, [[Baron Haussmann|Haussmann]]-style avenues, boulevards, [[arterial thoroughfare]]s that radiated across the city, a massive civic center complex with classical structures, and what would have been the largest urban park in the world, stretching from [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]] to [[Lake Merced]] with a large [[wikt:athenaeum|atheneum]] at its peak.

The study also provides insight into what held the city back from making these changes before 1906: the presence of old residential buildings. In reconstruction, developers built relatively fewer of these buildings, and the majority of the reduction came through single-family houses. Also, aside from merely expanding nonresidential uses in many neighborhoods, the fire created economic opportunities in new areas, resulting in clusters of business activity that emerged only in the wake of the disaster.

It was pressed ahead mainly by re-insurers. Their aim; a uniform solution to insurance payouts resulting from fires caused by earthquakes. Until 1910, a few countries, especially in Europe, followed the call for an exclusion of the earthquake hazard from all fire insurance contracts. In the U.S., the question was discussed differently. But the traumatized public reacted with fierce opposition. On August 1, 1909, the [[California Senate]] enacted the California Standard Form of Fire Insurance Policy, which did not contain any earthquake clause. Thus the state decided that insurers would have to pay again if another earthquake was followed by fires.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads.

Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water\u2014the \"deep vee\" hull, designed by Ray Hunt, found in approximately 75% of modern power boats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[Diesel engine|diesel engines]].

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century.

The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave.
