Major public works included the [[Riverside Expressway]], the [[Gateway Bridge]], and later, the redevelopment of [[South Bank, Queensland|South Bank]], starting with the [[Queensland Art Gallery]].\n\nBetween 1968 and 1987, when Queensland was governed by [[Premier of Queensland|Premier]] [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], whose government was characterised by strong [[social conservatism]] and the [[Queensland street marches|use of police force against demonstrators]], and which ended with the [[Fitzgerald Inquiry]] into police corruption, Brisbane developed a counterculture focussed on the [[University of Queensland]], [[Queensland street marches|street marches]] and [[Brisbane punk rock]] music.\n\nBrisbane hosted the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]] and the 1988 World Exposition (known locally as [[World Expo 88]]). These events were accompanied by a scale of public expenditure, construction, and development not previously seen in the state of Queensland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/Templates/Games_PastGames_1982.htm |title=ACGA Past Games 1982 |publisher=Commonwealth Games Australia |accessdate=28 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917163227/http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/Templates/Games_PastGames_1982.htm |archivedate=17 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ozbird.com/oz/OzCulture/expo88/brisbane/default.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/19990128080738/http://www.ozbird.com/oz/OzCulture/expo88/brisbane/default.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 January 1999|title=Expo 88 / Brisbane|publisher=OZ Culture|accessdate=28 December 2007|author=Rebecca Bell}}</ref> Brisbane's population growth far exceeded the national average in the last two decades of the 20th century, with a high level of interstate migration from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]].\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Skylines of Brisbane CBD in June 2019 seen from Paddington, Queensland.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Brisbane from [[Paddington, Queensland|Paddington]]]]\n\nAfter three decades of record population growth, Brisbane was hit again by a major [[2010\u20132011 Queensland floods|flood in January 2011]].

The city is centred along the [[Brisbane River]], and its eastern suburbs line the shores of [[Moreton Bay]], a bay of the [[Coral Sea]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]].

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at [[Moreton Bay]] in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The HF stands for ''High Fidelity''. It was a very successful rally car, winning the [[World Rally Championship]] in 1974, 1975 and 1976.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lancia Stratos HF.jpg|thumb|left|Lancia Stratos HF Prototype]]\n\nLancia traditionally used the design house [[Pininfarina]] and had not used [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] before. Bertone desired to create an opportunity for a relationship with Lancia and knew that Lancia was looking for a replacement for the ageing [[Lancia Fulvia|Fulvia]] for use in [[Rallying|rally sports]]. Bertone decided to design an eye-catching model to show to Lancia.  Bertone used the running gear of a Fulvia Coup\u00e9 which belonged to one of his friends and built a running model around it. When Bertone himself appeared at the Lancia factory gates with the Stratos Zero he passed underneath the barrier, to great applause from the Lancia workers. After that Lancia and Bertone agreed to develop a new rally car based on the ideas of Bertone's designer [[Marcello Gandini]]. Gandini had already designed the [[Lamborghini Miura]] and was working on the [[Lamborghini Countach|Countach]] at the time. \n\nLancia presented the Bertone-designed Lancia Stratos HF prototype at the [[Turin Motor Show#1971|1971 Turin Motor Show]], a year after the announcement of the Stratos Zero concept car. The prototype Stratos HF (Chassis 1240) was fluorescent red in colour and featured a distinctive crescent-shaped wrap-around windshield providing maximum forward visibility with almost no rear visibility. The prototype had three different engines in its early development life: the Lancia Fulvia engine, the [[Lancia Beta]] engine and finally, for the 1971 public launch, the mid-mounted [[Ferrari Dino engine#V6|Dino Ferrari V6]] producing {{convert|190|hp|0|abbr=on}} in road trim. The use of this engine had been planned from the beginning of the project, but [[Enzo Ferrari]] was reluctant to sign off the use of this engine in a car he saw as a competitor to his own [[Dino (automobile)|Dino V6]]. After the production of the Dino had ended, the \"Commendatore\" (a popular nickname for Enzo Ferrari) agreed to deliver the engines for the Stratos, upon which Lancia suddenly received 500 units.\n[[File:Sandro Munari - Lancia Stratos Marlboro Prototype (1973 Targa Florio) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Lancia Stratos HF 2.4 V6 Prototype at 1973 [[Targa Florio]]]]\n\nThe Stratos was a successful rally car during the 1970s and early 1980s.

Despite the fact that the Stratos was never intended to be a race car, there were two Group 5 racing cars built with {{convert|560|hp|0|abbr=on}}, using a single [[K\u00fchnle, Kopp & Kausch|KKK]] turbocharger.\n\nThe car won the [[1974 World Rally Championship season|1974]], [[1975 World Rally Championship season|1975]] and [[1976 World Rally Championship season|1976]] [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|championship titles]] in the hands of [[Sandro Munari]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Waldeg\u00e5rd]], and might have gone on to win more had not internal politics within the Fiat group placed rallying responsibility on the [[Fiat 131]] Abarths. As well as victories on the [[1975 Monte Carlo Rally|1975]], 1976 and [[1977 World Rally Championship season|1977]] [[Monte Carlo Rally]], all courtesy of Munari, the Stratos won the event with the private Chardonnet Team as late as [[1979 World Rally Championship season|1979]].<ref name=\"sportscarmarket.com\"/>\n[[File:Lancia Stratos Turbo.jpg|thumb|Lancia Stratos Turbo Group 5]]\n\nWithout support from Fiat, and despite new regulations that restricted engine power, the car would remain a serious competitor and proved able to beat works cars in several occasions when entered by an experienced private team with a talented driver. The last victory of the Stratos was in [[1981 World Rally Championship season|1981]], at the [[Tour de Corse|Tour de Corse Automobile]], another World Rally Championship event, with a victory by longtime Stratos privateer [[Bernard Darniche]].\n\nWhen the Fiat group favoured the Fiat 131 for rallying Lancia also built two Group 5 turbocharged 'silhouette' Stratos for closed-track endurance racing. These cars failed against the [[Porsche 935]]s on closed tracks but proved successful in hybrid events. Stratos won a record 5 times the [[Tour de France Automobile]] between 1973 and 1980, and also the 1974, 1976 and 1978 [[Giro d'Italia automobilistico]], an Italian counterpart of the Tour de France Automobile.

The Stratos also gained limited success in [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], with a car, driven by Christine Dacremont and [[Lella Lombardi]], finishing 20th in [[1976 24 Hours of Le Mans|1976]].\n[[File:AndyBentzaStratos1983.jpg|thumb|left|1983 Andy Bentza and his [[Rallycross|RX]] Lancia Stratos HF, the only 3.0 L Stratos]]\n\nAnother unique Group 5 car is the Lancia Stratos HF of Austrian [[Rallycross]] driver Andy Bentza. The car was first driven by his Memphis teammate Franz Wurz, father of Formula One pilot [[Alexander Wurz]]. In 1976 Wurz claimed the first ever [[FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers|European Rallycross title recognised by the FIA]] with the car, by then still featuring a 2.4 litre engine with first a 12 and later a 24 valve head. For the ERC series of 1977 Wurz was entrusted with an experimental 24 valve engine by Mike Parkes, equipped with a special [[crankshaft]] to bring the engine capacity up to just under 3000 cc. For 1978 Bentza took the Stratos over from Wurz, sold his own 2.4&nbsp;L 12V Stratos to compatriot Rene\u00e9 Vontsina, and won the GT Division title of the ERC. The one and only 3.0 litre Stratos worldwide was raced by Bentza till the end of 1983. After keeping the car for another 30 years Bentza has sold the Stratos to Alexander Wurz.

The HF stands for ''High Fidelity''. It was a very successful rally car, winning the [[World Rally Championship]] in 1974, 1975 and 1976.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lancia Stratos HF.jpg|thumb|left|Lancia Stratos HF Prototype]]\n\nLancia traditionally used the design house [[Pininfarina]] and had not used [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] before. Bertone desired to create an opportunity for a relationship with Lancia and knew that Lancia was looking for a replacement for the ageing [[Lancia Fulvia|Fulvia]] for use in [[Rallying|rally sports]]. Bertone decided to design an eye-catching model to show to Lancia.  Bertone used the running gear of a Fulvia Coup\u00e9 which belonged to one of his friends and built a running model around it. When Bertone himself appeared at the Lancia factory gates with the Stratos Zero he passed underneath the barrier, to great applause from the Lancia workers. After that Lancia and Bertone agreed to develop a new rally car based on the ideas of Bertone's designer [[Marcello Gandini]]. Gandini had already designed the [[Lamborghini Miura]] and was working on the [[Lamborghini Countach|Countach]] at the time. \n\nLancia presented the Bertone-designed Lancia Stratos HF prototype at the [[Turin Motor Show#1971|1971 Turin Motor Show]], a year after the announcement of the Stratos Zero concept car. The prototype Stratos HF (Chassis 1240) was fluorescent red in colour and featured a distinctive crescent-shaped wrap-around windshield providing maximum forward visibility with almost no rear visibility. The prototype had three different engines in its early development life: the Lancia Fulvia engine, the [[Lancia Beta]] engine and finally, for the 1971 public launch, the mid-mounted [[Ferrari Dino engine#V6|Dino Ferrari V6]] producing {{convert|190|hp|0|abbr=on}} in road trim. The use of this engine had been planned from the beginning of the project, but [[Enzo Ferrari]] was reluctant to sign off the use of this engine in a car he saw as a competitor to his own [[Dino (automobile)|Dino V6]].

In 1976 Wurz claimed the first ever [[FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers|European Rallycross title recognised by the FIA]] with the car, by then still featuring a 2.4 litre engine with first a 12 and later a 24 valve head. For the ERC series of 1977 Wurz was entrusted with an experimental 24 valve engine by Mike Parkes, equipped with a special [[crankshaft]] to bring the engine capacity up to just under 3000 cc. For 1978 Bentza took the Stratos over from Wurz, sold his own 2.4&nbsp;L 12V Stratos to compatriot Rene\u00e9 Vontsina, and won the GT Division title of the ERC. The one and only 3.0 litre Stratos worldwide was raced by Bentza till the end of 1983. After keeping the car for another 30 years Bentza has sold the Stratos to Alexander Wurz.

The selection process for the 1924 [[Summer Olympics]] consisted of six bids, and [[Paris]] was selected ahead of [[Amsterdam]], [[Barcelona]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Prague]], and [[Rome]].

[[Paavo Nurmi]] won the 1500 m and 5,000 m (which were held with only an hour between them) and the cross country run. [[Ville Ritola]] won the 10,000 m and the 3,000 m [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], while finishing second to Nurmi on the 5,000 m and cross country. [[Albin Stenroos]] won the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]], while the [[Finland|Finnish]] team (with Nurmi and Ritola) was victorious in the 3,000 m and cross country team events.\n* British runners [[Harold Abrahams]] and [[Eric Liddell]] won the 100 m and 400 m events, respectively. Their stories are depicted in the 1981 movie ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''. In addition, [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]] won the 800 m competition.\n* The [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] distance was fixed at {{convert|42.195|km|mi|abbr=on}}, from the distance run at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London.\n* The 1924 Olympics were the first to use the standard 50 m pool with marked lanes.\n* Swimmer [[Johnny Weissmuller]] won three gold medals in swimming and one bronze in [[water polo]].\n* [[Harold Osborn]] won gold medals and set Olympic records in both the high jump and the decathlon at the 1924 Olympics. His 6' 6\" high jump remained the Olympic record for 12 years, while his decathlon score of 7,710.775 points also set a world record and resulted in worldwide press coverage calling him the \"world\u2019s greatest athlete\".\n* [[Fencing (sport)|Fencer]] [[Roger Ducret]] of France won five medals, of which three were gold.\n* In gymnastics, 24 men scored a perfect 10. Twenty-three of them scored it in the now-discontinued event of [[rope climbing]]. Albert Seguin scored a 10 here and also a perfect 10 on side vault.\n* Unexpectedly, the national team of Uruguay won the gold medal in football.\n* The Olympic motto ''[[Olympic symbols|Citius, Altius, Fortius]]'' (Faster, Higher, Stronger) was used for the first time at the Olympics. It had been used before by the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]], a French sporting federation whose founding members included [[Pierre de Coubertin]].<ref>''The Official History of the Olympic Games and the IOC- Athens to Beijing, 1894\u20132008'': David Miller (2008)</ref> De Coubertin took the motto from his friend [[Henri Didon]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican priest]] who had coined during a speech before a Paris youth gathering of 1891.<ref name=motto>{{cite web|title=Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_268.pdf|publisher=International Olympics Committee|accessdate=23 August 2012|page=3|format=pdf|year=2002}}; \"Sport athl\u00e9tique\", 14 mars 1891: \"[...] dans une \u00e9loquente allocution il a souhait\u00e9 que ce drapeau les conduise 'souvent \u00e0 la victoire, \u00e0 la lutte toujours'.

[[Paavo Nurmi]] won the 1500 m and 5,000 m (which were held with only an hour between them) and the cross country run. [[Ville Ritola]] won the 10,000 m and the 3,000 m [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], while finishing second to Nurmi on the 5,000 m and cross country.

In addition, [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]] won the 800 m competition.\n* The [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] distance was fixed at {{convert|42.195|km|mi|abbr=on}}, from the distance run at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London.\n* The 1924 Olympics were the first to use the standard 50 m pool with marked lanes.\n* Swimmer [[Johnny Weissmuller]] won three gold medals in swimming and one bronze in [[water polo]].\n* [[Harold Osborn]] won gold medals and set Olympic records in both the high jump and the decathlon at the 1924 Olympics. His 6' 6\" high jump remained the Olympic record for 12 years, while his decathlon score of 7,710.775 points also set a world record and resulted in worldwide press coverage calling him the \"world\u2019s greatest athlete\".\n* [[Fencing (sport)|Fencer]] [[Roger Ducret]] of France won five medals, of which three were gold.\n* In gymnastics, 24 men scored a perfect 10. Twenty-three of them scored it in the now-discontinued event of [[rope climbing]]. Albert Seguin scored a 10 here and also a perfect 10 on side vault.\n* Unexpectedly, the national team of Uruguay won the gold medal in football.\n* The Olympic motto ''[[Olympic symbols|Citius, Altius, Fortius]]'' (Faster, Higher, Stronger) was used for the first time at the Olympics.

The basis for recognition and membership in the World Scout Conference includes adherence to the aims and principles of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, and independence from political involvement on the part of each member association.<ref name=\"World Scouting\"/>\n\nThe Conference meets every three years and is hosted by a member association.

The World Scout Committee represents World Scout Conference between the meetings of the full conference. The World Scout Committee is responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the World Scout Conference and for acting on its behalf between its meetings. The Committee meets twice a year, usually in [[Geneva]]. Its Steering Committee, consisting of the Chairman, two Vice-Chairmen, a Youth Advisor and the Secretary General, meet as needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/international/worldscouting.aspx|work=WOSM World Scouting|title=World Scout Committee|accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Committee has 21 members. Twelve, each from a different country, are elected for three-year terms by the World Scout Conference. The members, elected without regard to their nationality, represent the interests of the movement as a whole, not those of their country. The Secretary General, the Treasurer of WOSM and a representative member of the board of the World Scout Foundation and the chairmen of the regional Scout committees are ''ex-officio'' members of the Committee. The six Youth Advisors to the WSC are elected by the [[World Scout Youth Forum]] are participating in all of the WSC meetings and are also part of the governing structure between the meetings. \n\nThe World Scout Committee has set up work streams to address the top strategic priorities, as defined by the World Scout Conference, which at present include:\n* Youth involvement\n* Volunteers in Scouting\n* Scouting's profile (communications, partnerships, resources)\n\nStanding committees include:\n* Audit\n* Budget\n* Constitutions\n* Honours and Awards\n* ''Working With Others''- a consultative committee of the WOSM and the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS), composed of members of the World Committee/World Board of both organizations\n* 2007 Task Force for the 100th Anniversary of Scouting, composed of members of the World Scout Committee, World Scout Bureau, World Scout Foundation, and [[The Scout Association]] of the United Kingdom\n\n===Current members 2017-2020===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Name<ref name=\"Turpie Chair\">{{cite news |url=http://www.wsc2017.az/news/craig-turpie-is-the-chairperson-of-the-wsc-2017-2020/ |url-status=live\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818094009/http://www.wsc2017.az/news/craig-turpie-is-the-chairperson-of-the-wsc-2017-2020/ |location=Azerbaijan |date=18 August 2017 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2017 |publisher=World Scout Conference |title=Craig Turpie is the Chairperson of the WSC 2017-2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.azernews.az/sports/117736.html|title=World Scout Conference continues its work in Baku|last=Ismayilova|first=Laman|date=17 August 2018|work=AzerNews.az|location=[[Azerbaijan]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817095516/https://www.azernews.az/sports/117736.html|archivedate=17 August 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=17 August 2017}}</ref>\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Country\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Term to*\n|-\n|[[Craig Turpie]]\n|Chairman, United Kingdom\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Jemima Nartey]]\n|Vice-Chair, Ghana\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Andy Chapman (Scouting)|Andy Chapman]]\n|Vice-Chair, United States\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Mehdi Ben Khelil]]\n|Tunisia\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Peter Blatch]]\n|Australia\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Jo Deman]]\n|Belgium\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Janaprith Fernando]]\n|Sri Lanka\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Ilyas Ismayilli]]\n|Azerbaijan\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Sarah Rita Kattan]]\n|Lebanon\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Leonardo Morales Morales]] \n|Costa Rica\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Pia Melin Mortensen]]\n|Denmark\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Juan Reig]]\n|Spain\n|2020\n|-\n|[[Ahmad Alhendawi]]\n|Secretary General, WOSM<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scout.org/10thsgannouncement|title=Next Secretary General Announced|date=11 November 2016|publisher=World Organization of the Scout Movement|accessdate=11 November 2016}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n|Joseph Lau\n|Treasurer, Hong Kong\n|\n|-\n|[[H\u00e9ctor Robledo Cervantes]]\n|Chairman Elect WSF, M\u00e9xico\n|\n|}\n* Note: <small>The World Scout Conference in 2008 decided that, starting at the World Conference in 2011, elected members will serve for only three years, but be eligible for re-election for one additional term.</small>\n\n===Bronze Wolf Award===\nThe [[Bronze Wolf Award]] is the only distinction awarded by WOSM, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.

The WSB is administered by the secretary general, who is supported by a small staff of technical resource personnel. The bureau staff helps associations improve and broaden their Scouting by training professionals and volunteers, establishing finance policies and money-raising techniques, improving community facilities and procedures, and assisting in marshaling the national resources of each country behind Scouting.<ref name=\"World Scouting\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/international/worldscout.html|work=WOSM World Scouting|title=World Scouting|accessdate=2 February 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224111016/http://www.scouting.org/international/worldscout.html|archivedate=24 December 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe staff also helps arrange global events such as the [[World Scout Jamboree]]s, encourages regional events, and acts as a liaison between the Scouting Movement and other international organizations.

Baden-Powell used a fleur-de-lis badge awarded to British Army scouts and subsequently adopted and modified the badge for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts on the path to service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three parts of the Scout Promise: - service to others, duty to God and obedience to the Scout Law.<ref>{{cite web |title=The World Membership Badge |publisher=The Scout Association |date=16 May 2006 |url=http://members.scouts.org.uk/factsheets/FS260016.pdf}}</ref> The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the [[Scout Law]]. The bond at the base of the fleur-de-lis symbolizes the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement.\n\n==Recognition of non-national Scouting organizations==\nThe needs of Scout youth in unusual situations has created some interesting permutations, answerable directly to the World Scout Bureau. These permutations fall generally into three categories: \n* \"National\" Movements not operating within the boundaries of their original homelands, such as the Russian and Armenian exile groups;<ref name=Kroonenberg/> \n* Small, non-voting associations basically viewed by the BSIB as \"councils\", such as the [[Boy Scouts of the United Nations]] and the [[International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone]]<ref>{{cite book| last = Wilson| first = John S.| authorlink = J.

WOSM also organises the [[World Scout Moot]], a Jamboree for 17- to 26-year-olds, and has organised the [[World Scout Indaba]], a gathering for Scout leaders.

An office was established at 25, [[Buckingham Palace Road]], London, and the then International Commissioner of [[The Scout Association|The Boy Scouts Association]] of the United Kingdom, [[Hubert S. Martin]], was appointed as Honorary Director. The first task of the bureau was to co-ordinate the discussions and to prepare a second international conference in Paris in 1922.<ref name=constitution /><ref name=\"Colquhoun 1954\"/>  At the 1922 Paris conference The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement, its committee and BSIB were constituted by the founding member organizations.<ref name=\"Colquhoun 1954\" /> In 1961 The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement reconstituted the organization introducing the name '''World Organization of the Scout Movement''' (WOSM). The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement became the WOSM's World Scout Conference, its International Committee became the World Scout Committee and the Boy Scouts International Bureau became the WOSM's World Scout Bureau.<ref name=Kroonenberg>{{cite book |last=Kroonenberg |first=Piet J. |authorlink=Piet J.

The World Scout Conference is the general assembly of Scouting and is composed of six delegates from each of the member Scout associations. If a country has more than one association, the associations form a federation for coordination and world representation. The basis for recognition and membership in the World Scout Conference includes adherence to the aims and principles of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, and independence from political involvement on the part of each member association.<ref name=\"World Scouting\"/>\n\nThe Conference meets every three years and is hosted by a member association. At the World Scout Conference basic cooperative efforts are agreed upon and a plan of mutual coordination is adopted.<ref>[http://scout.org/en/our_organisation/governance/world_bureau/secretary_general/laszlo_nagy Laszlo Nagy (1921 - 2009) / Secretary General / World Bureau / Governance / Our Organisation / Home - World Organization of the Scout Movement<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926120551/http://scout.org/en/our_organisation/governance/world_bureau/secretary_general/laszlo_nagy |date=26 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Baden-Powell used a fleur-de-lis badge awarded to British Army scouts and subsequently adopted and modified the badge for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts on the path to service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three parts of the Scout Promise: - service to others, duty to God and obedience to the Scout Law.<ref>{{cite web |title=The World Membership Badge |publisher=The Scout Association |date=16 May 2006 |url=http://members.scouts.org.uk/factsheets/FS260016.pdf}}</ref> The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the [[Scout Law]].

These permutations fall generally into three categories: \n* \"National\" Movements not operating within the boundaries of their original homelands, such as the Russian and Armenian exile groups;<ref name=Kroonenberg/> \n* Small, non-voting associations basically viewed by the BSIB as \"councils\", such as the [[Boy Scouts of the United Nations]] and the [[International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone]]<ref>{{cite book| last = Wilson| first = John S.| authorlink = J.

The first idea to overcome this was to make a front wheel with a narrow hub, 60mm instead of 80mm. This increased the amount of space air had to flow between the wheel and the fork. However, by 1996, Quintana Roo had developed a fork with \"wide\" blades, further increasing the space between the wheel and the fork. This was the QR Illuminaero fork, made out of aluminum.

The bike was named after its [[drag coefficient]] (0.1) from wind tunnel testing. The downtube of the CD0.1 was offset 18mm in order to direct air away from the drag-heavy side of the bike (drive-side) and towards the clean side of the bike (non-drive). This resulted in increased stability in a crosswind, increased stiffness in the bottom bracket, and increased aerodynamics in the traditionally drag-heavy side of the aerodynamic drag-curve. It was hailed as \"the most innovative bike over the past decade\" and received the \"Gold Design Award\" at the 2009 Eurobike Show.\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n|last=Demerly\n|first=Tom\n|title=A Logical Progression\n|url=http://university.tri-sports.com/2010/07/13/a-logical-progression/\n|publisher=Trisports\n|accessdate=1 April 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, in 2011, Quintana Roo officially announced its Project Illicito, a new bike that improved on the already impressive aerodynamics of the CD0.1. The difference, though, between the two bikes was that Illicito featured a missing seat-stay and a massive chain-stay on the non-drive side of the bike. This non-traditional rear-end created a \"sail\" effect across certain degrees of [[yaw angle|yaw]], as the air would flow along the massive chain-stay. It was completely [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]]-illegal, hence the name \"Illicito.\" In 2011, the year that it was released, the Illicito received the \"Triathlon America Most Innovative Product\" award.\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=Illicito\n|url=http://www.quintanarootri.com/_bike.asp?content=Illicito-2014\n|publisher=Quintana Roo\n|accessdate=2 April 2014}}\n</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, Quintana Roo released the PRsix. Called \"the SuperBike Reconsidered,\" the PRsix featured a simplicity and ease of fit and maintenance not found on other \"superbikes,\" as it could be quickly assembled with only a pedal wrench and two sizes of hex wrench. The PRsix featured SHIFT+ technology, combining the SHIFT technology of the CD0.1 and Illicito with a \"[[External ballistics#General trends in drag or ballistic coefficient|boat tail]]\" tube-section that further increased the aerodynamic advantage of SHIFT technology. The bike was compatible with any standard diameter aerobar, as well as any brake produced by [[Shimano]], TRP, [[Magura GmbH|Magura]], or TriRig.\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=PRsix\n|url=http://www.quintanarootri.com/_bike.asp?content=PR6-2014\n|publisher=Quintana Roo\n|accessdate=2 April 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080828160931/http://www.rooworld.com/ Quintana Roo official site]\n\n{{American bicycle manufacturers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quintana Roo (Company)}}\n[[Category:Sporting goods manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Cycle manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Tennessee]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company |\n  name   = Quintana Roo |\n  logo   = 2016 Quintana Roo Logo.jpg |\n  type   = [[Subsidiary]]|\n  foundation     = {{start date and age|1987}} |\n  location       = [[Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]], United States |\n  key_people     = [[Dan Empfield]] |\n  industry       = [[Triathlon]] |\n  products       = Tri-specific [[Bicycle]]s and [[Wetsuit]]s |\n  revenue        = |\n  homepage       = [http://www.quintanarootri.com/ www.quintanarootri.com]\n|parent = [[American Bicycle Group]]}}\n\n'''Quintana Roo''' was the first company to create a triathlon-specific [[wetsuit]] over 25 years ago, and then a tri-specific [[bicycle]] two years later.

The mold that these bikes came from now forms the basis of Quintana Roo's current FIT Series of bikes.\n<ref>{{cite web\n|last=Empfield\n|first=Dan\n|title=Quintana Roo\n|url=http://www.slowtwitch.com/mainheadings/product2006/tribikes/tribikeqr.html\n|publisher=Slowtwitch\n|accessdate=1 April 2014}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Quintana Roo introduced the CD0.1, a bicycle designed with Quintana Roo's unique SHIFT technology. The bike was named after its [[drag coefficient]] (0.1) from wind tunnel testing. The downtube of the CD0.1 was offset 18mm in order to direct air away from the drag-heavy side of the bike (drive-side) and towards the clean side of the bike (non-drive). This resulted in increased stability in a crosswind, increased stiffness in the bottom bracket, and increased aerodynamics in the traditionally drag-heavy side of the aerodynamic drag-curve. It was hailed as \"the most innovative bike over the past decade\" and received the \"Gold Design Award\" at the 2009 Eurobike Show.\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n|last=Demerly\n|first=Tom\n|title=A Logical Progression\n|url=http://university.tri-sports.com/2010/07/13/a-logical-progression/\n|publisher=Trisports\n|accessdate=1 April 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, in 2011, Quintana Roo officially announced its Project Illicito, a new bike that improved on the already impressive aerodynamics of the CD0.1. The difference, though, between the two bikes was that Illicito featured a missing seat-stay and a massive chain-stay on the non-drive side of the bike. This non-traditional rear-end created a \"sail\" effect across certain degrees of [[yaw angle|yaw]], as the air would flow along the massive chain-stay. It was completely [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]]-illegal, hence the name \"Illicito.\" In 2011, the year that it was released, the Illicito received the \"Triathlon America Most Innovative Product\" award.\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=Illicito\n|url=http://www.quintanarootri.com/_bike.asp?content=Illicito-2014\n|publisher=Quintana Roo\n|accessdate=2 April 2014}}\n</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, Quintana Roo released the PRsix. Called \"the SuperBike Reconsidered,\" the PRsix featured a simplicity and ease of fit and maintenance not found on other \"superbikes,\" as it could be quickly assembled with only a pedal wrench and two sizes of hex wrench. The PRsix featured SHIFT+ technology, combining the SHIFT technology of the CD0.1 and Illicito with a \"[[External ballistics#General trends in drag or ballistic coefficient|boat tail]]\" tube-section that further increased the aerodynamic advantage of SHIFT technology. The bike was compatible with any standard diameter aerobar, as well as any brake produced by [[Shimano]], TRP, [[Magura GmbH|Magura]], or TriRig.\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=PRsix\n|url=http://www.quintanarootri.com/_bike.asp?content=PR6-2014\n|publisher=Quintana Roo\n|accessdate=2 April 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080828160931/http://www.rooworld.com/ Quintana Roo official site]\n\n{{American bicycle manufacturers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quintana Roo (Company)}}\n[[Category:Sporting goods manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Cycle manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Tennessee]]\n", "name_user": "65.34.196.38", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintana_Roo_(company)"}
