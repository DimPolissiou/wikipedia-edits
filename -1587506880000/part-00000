Marriages help cement relations within each '' 'ndrina'' and to expand membership.

In some contexts the '' 'ndrine'' have become more powerful than the ''locale'' on which they formally depend.<ref name=\"paoli29\" /> Other observers maintain that the '' 'ndrina'' is the basic organizational unit.

Marriages help cement relations within each '' 'ndrina'' and to expand membership. As a result, a few blood families constitute each group, hence \"a high number of people with the same last name often end up being prosecuted for membership of a given '' 'ndrina''.\" Indeed, since there is no limit to the membership of a single unit, bosses try to maximize descendants.<ref name=\"varese\" />\n\nAt the bottom of the chain of command are the ''picciotti d'onore'' or soldiers, who are expected to perform tasks with blind obedience until they are promoted to the next level of ''cammorista'', where they will be granted command over their own group of soldiers.

The ''Quintino'', also called ''Padrino'', is the second-highest level of command in a 'Ndrangheta clan (name ''Ndrina''), being made up of five privileged members of the crime family who report directly to the boss, the ''[[capobastone]]'' (head of command).<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 'Ndrangheta Looms Large |url=http://americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_286.html |website=americanmafia.com |access-date=10 February 2016 |last=La Sorte |first=Mike |date=December 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054929/http://americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_286.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n=== Power structure ===\nFor many years, the power apparatus of the single families were the sole ruling bodies within the two associations, and they have remained the real centers of power even after superordinate bodies were created in the [[Cosa Nostra]] beginning in the 1950s (the [[Sicilian Mafia Commission]]) and in the 'Ndrangheta a superordinate body was created only in 1991 as the result of negotiations to end years of inter-family violence.<ref name=\"paoli\">{{cite web |url=http://www.organized-crime.de/revpao01mafiandrangheta.htm |title=Review of: Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'' |publisher=Organized-crime.de |accessdate=19 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215127/http://www.organized-crime.de/revpao01mafiandrangheta.htm |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the Sicilian Mafia, the 'Ndrangheta managed to maintain a horizontal organizational structure up to the early 1990s, avoiding the establishment of a formal superordinate body.

By 53 BC, [[Rome]] had expanded to control an immense expanse of the Mediterranean.  This included [[Italy]] and its islands, [[Hispania|Spain]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Roman Greece|Greece]]; by the end of the Emperor [[Trajan]]'s reign, the [[Roman Empire]] had grown further to encompass parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], all of modern [[Germany]] west of the Rhine, [[Dacia]], [[Noricum]], [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], [[Armenia]], [[Illyria]], and [[Thrace]] (Shepard 1993).  As the empire grew, so did its need for metals.\n\n[[Central Italy]] itself was not rich in [[metal]] [[ores]], leading to necessary [[trade]] networks in order to meet the demand for metal.  Early Italians had some access to metals in the northern regions of the peninsula in [[Tuscany]] and [[Cisalpine Gaul]], as well as the islands [[Elba]] and [[Sardinia]].  With the conquest of [[Etruria]] in 275 BC and the subsequent acquisitions due to the [[Punic Wars]], Rome had the ability to stretch further into [[Transalpine Gaul]] and Iberia, both areas rich in [[minerals]].  At the height of the Empire, Rome exploited mineral resources from [[Tingitana]] in north western Africa to Egypt, [[Arabia]] to North Armenia, [[Galatia]] to [[Germania]], and [[Britannia]] to Iberia, encompassing all of the [[Mediterranean]] coast. Britannia, Iberia, Dacia, and [[Noricum]] were of special significance, as they were very rich in deposits and became major sites of resource exploitation (Shepard, 1993).\n\nThere is evidence that after the middle years of the Empire there was a sudden and steep decline in [[mineral extraction]].  This was mirrored in other trades and industries.\n\nOne of the most important Roman sources of information is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]].  Several books (XXXIII\u2013XXXVII) of his [[encyclopedia]] cover metals and metal ores, their occurrence, importance and development.\n\n== Types of metal used ==\n\nMany of the first [[metal]] artifacts that archaeologists have identified have been [[Prehistoric Iberia|tools]] or [[Prehistoric Britain|weapons]], as well as objects used as ornaments such as [[Migdale Hoard|jewellery]].  These early metal objects were made of the softer metals; [[copper]], [[gold]], and [[lead]] in particular, as the metals either as [[native metal]] or by thermal extraction from [[mineral]]s, and softened by minimal heat (Craddock, 1995).  While technology did advance to the point of creating surprisingly pure copper, most ancient metals are in fact [[alloys]], the most important being [[bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and [[tin]].  As metallurgical technology developed ([[hammering]], [[melting]], [[smelting]], [[roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]], [[cupellation]], [[molding (process)|moulding]], [[smithing]], etc.), more metals were intentionally included in the metallurgical repertoire.\n\nBy the height of the Roman Empire, metals in use included: [[silver]], [[zinc]], [[iron]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], lead, gold, copper, tin (Healy 1978).  As in the Bronze Age, metals were used based on many physical properties: aesthetics, [[hardness]], colour, taste/smell (for cooking wares), timbre (instruments), aversion to [[corrosion]], weight, and other factors.  Many alloys were also possible, and were intentionally made in order to change the properties of the metal e.g. the alloy of predominately tin with lead would harden the soft tin, to create [[pewter]], which would prove its utility as cooking and [[Pewter|tableware]].\n\n== Sources of ore ==\n[[File:Panor\u00e1mica de Las M\u00e9dulas.jpg|thumb|[[Las M\u00e9dulas]], remains of the most important gold mine in the Roman Empire.

Containing deposits of gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, iron, and mercury), it was very rich in resources.  From its acquisition during the [[Punic Wars]] to the Fall of Rome, [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] continued to produce a significant amount of Roman [[metals]] (Healy 1978, Shepard 1993).\n\nSimilarly, [[Britannia]] was also very rich in [[metals]].  Gold was mined at [[Dolaucothi]] in [[Wales]], copper and tin in [[Cornwall]], and lead in the [[Pennines]], [[Mendip Hills]] and [[Wales]].  Significant studies have been made on the [[iron production]] of [[Roman Britain]]; iron use in Europe was intensified by the Romans, and was part of the exchange of ideas between the cultures through [[Roman occupation of Britannia|Roman occupation]] (Aitchison, 1960).  It was the importance placed on iron by the Romans throughout the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] which completed the shift from the few cultures still using primarily [[bronze]] into the [[Iron Age]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Noricum]] is the ancient site of modern [[Austria]].  Exceedingly rich in gold and iron, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Strabo]], and [[Ovid]] all lauded its bountiful deposits.  Iron was its main commodity, but [[alluvial]] gold was also prospected.  By 15 BC, Noricum was officially made a [[province]] of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], and the [[metal]] trade saw prosperity well into the fifth century AD (Shepard 1993, Healy 1978).  Some scholars believe that the art of iron [[forging]] was not necessarily created, but well developed in this area and it was the population of Noricum which reminded Romans of the usefulness of iron (Aitchison, 1960).  For example, of the three forms of iron ([[wrought iron]], [[steel]], and soft), the forms which were exported were of the wrought iron (containing a small percentage of uniformly distributed [[slag]] material) and steel (carbonised iron) categories, as pure iron is too soft to function like wrought or steel iron (Sim 1999, Aitchison 1960).\n\n[[Dacia]], located in the area of [[Transylvania]], was conquered in 107 AD in order to capture the resources of the region for Rome.  The amount of gold that came into Roman possession actually brought down the [[Value (economics)|value]] of gold.  Iron was also of importance to the region.  The difference between the mines of [[Noricum]] and Dacia was the presence of a [[slave]] population as a workforce (Shepard 1993).\n\n== Technology ==\n[[File:Lingotesplomocarthagonova.jpg|thumb|Roman ingots of [[lead]] from the mines of [[Cartagena, Spain]], Archaeological Municipal Museum of Cartagena]]\nThe earliest metal manipulation was probably hammering (Craddock 1995, 1999), where copper ore was pounded into thin sheets. [[Beneficiation]], or the process of \u2019making better\u2019 could be carried out on the ore (if there were large enough pieces of metal separate from [[mineral]]) or after melting, where the [[prills]] of metal could be hand picked from the cooled slag. [[Melting]] beneficiated metal also allowed early [[metallurgists]] to use [[Molding (process)|moulds]] and [[Casting|casts]] to form shapes of [[molten metal]] (Craddock 1995).  Many of the metallurgical skills developed in the Bronze Age were still in use during Roman times.  Melting\u2014the process of using heat to separate slag and metal, [[smelting]]\u2014using a reduced oxygen heated environment to separate metal oxides into metal and carbon dioxide, [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]]\u2014process of using an oxygen rich environment to isolate sulphur oxide from metal oxide which can then be smelted, [[casting]]\u2014pouring liquid metal into a mould to make an object, hammering\u2014using blunt force to make a thin sheet which can be annealed or shaped, and [[cupellation]]\u2014separating metal alloys to isolate a specific metal\u2014were all techniques which were well understood (Zwicker 1985, Tylecote 1962, Craddock 1995).  However, the Romans provided few new technological advances other than the use of iron and the cupellation and [[Granulation (process)|granulation]] in the separation of [[gold alloys]] (Tylecote 1962).\n\nWhile [[native gold]] is common, the ore will sometimes contain small amounts of [[silver]] and copper.  The Romans utilised a sophisticated system to separate these precious metals.  The use of cupellation, a process developed before the rise of Rome, would extract copper from gold and silver, or an alloy called [[electrum]].  In order to separate the gold and silver, however, the Romans would granulate the alloy by pouring the liquid, molten metal into cold water, and then [[smelting|smelt]] the granules with [[salt]], separating the gold from the chemically altered [[silver chloride]] (Tylecote 1962).  They used a similar method to extract silver from lead. \n\nWhile Roman production became standardised in many ways, the evidence for distinct unity of [[furnace]] types is not strong, alluding to a tendency of the peripheries continuing with their own past furnace technologies.  In order to complete some of the more complex metallurgical techniques, there is a bare minimum of necessary components for Roman metallurgy: metallic ore, furnace of unspecified type with a form of [[oxygen]] source (assumed by Tylecote to be bellows) and a method of restricting said oxygen (a lid or cover), a source of [[fuel]] ([[charcoal]] from [[wood]] or occasionally [[peat]]), moulds and/or [[hammers]] and [[anvils]] for shaping, the use of [[crucibles]] for isolating metals (Zwicker 1985), and likewise cupellation hearths (Tylecote 1962).\n\n==Mechanisation==\n[[Image:Archscrew2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]\nThere is direct evidence that the Romans mechanised at least part of the extraction processes. They used water power from [[water wheels]] for grinding grains and sawing timber or stone, for example. A set of sixteen such overshot wheels is still visible at [[Barbegal]] near [[Arles]] dating from the 1st century AD or possibly earlier, the water being supplied by the main aqueduct to Arles. It is likely that the mills supplied flour for Arles and other towns locally. Multiple grain mills also existed on the [[Janiculum]] hill in Rome.\n \n[[Ausonius]] attests the use of a water mill for sawing stone in his poem ''[[Mosella]]'' from the 4th century AD. They could easily have adapted the technology to crush ore using [[tilt hammer]]s, and just such is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' dating to about 75 AD, and there is evidence for the method from [[Dolaucothi]] in [[South Wales]]. The Roman gold mines developed from c. 75 AD. The methods survived into the medieval period, as described and illustrated by [[Georgius Agricola]] in his ''[[De Re Metallica]]''.\n\nThey also used [[reverse overshot water-wheel]] for draining mines, the parts being prefabricated and numbered for ease of assembly. Multiple set of such wheels have been found in Spain at the Rio Tinto copper mines and a fragment of a wheel at Dolaucothi. An incomplete wheel from Spain is now on public show in the [[British Museum]].\n\n== Output ==\nThe invention and widespread application of [[hydraulic mining]], namely [[hushing]] and ground-sluicing, aided by the ability of the Romans to plan and execute mining operations on a large scale, allowed various base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale only rarely matched until the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>Wilson 2002, pp. 17\u201321, 25, 32</ref>\n\nThe most common fuel by far for smelting and forging operations, as well as heating purposes, was wood and particularly [[charcoal]], which is nearly twice as efficient.<ref>Cech 2010, p. 20</ref> In addition, [[coal]] was mined in some regions to a fairly large extent: Almost all major coalfields in Roman Britain were exploited by the late 2nd century AD, and a lively trade along the English [[North Sea]] coast developed, which extended to the continental [[Rhineland]], where [[bituminous coal]] was already used for the smelting of iron ore.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 322\u2013324</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|+ Annual metal production in metric tons\n|-\n|\n!

Like [[Samian ware]], moulds were created by making a model of the desired shape (whether through wood, [[wax]], or metal), which would then be pressed into a [[clay]] mould.  In the case of a metal or wax model, once dry, the [[ceramic]] could be heated and the wax or metal melted until it could be poured from the [[Molding (process)|mould]] (this process utilising wax is called the \u201c[[lost wax]]\u201c technique).  By pouring metal into the aperture, exact copies of an object could be cast.  This process made the creation of a line of objects quite uniform.  This is not to suggest that the creativity of individual artisans did not continue; rather, unique handcrafted pieces were normally the work of small, rural metalworkers on the peripheries of Rome using local techniques (Tylecote 1962).\n\nThere is archaeological evidence throughout the Empire demonstrating the large scale [[excavations]], smelting, and trade routes concerning metals.  With the Romans came the concept of [[mass production]]; this is arguably the most important aspect of Roman influence in the study of metallurgy.  Three particular objects produced en masse and seen in the [[archaeological record]] throughout the Roman Empire are brooches called [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], worn by both men and women (Bayley 2004), [[coins]], and [[ingots]] (Hughes 1980).  These cast objects can allow [[archaeologists]] to trace years of [[communication]], trade, and even historic/stylistic changes throughout the centuries of Roman power.\n\n==Social ramifications==\n\n===Slavery===\nWhen the cost of producing [[slaves]] became too high to justify [[slave]] [[labourers]] for the many [[Mining|mines]] throughout the [[empire]] around the second century, a system of [[indentured servitude]] was introduced for [[convicts]].  In 369 AD a law was reinstated due to the closure of many deep mines; the emperor [[Hadrian]] had previously given the control of mines to private employers, so that workers were hired rather than working out of force.  Through the institution of this system profits increased (Shepard 1993).  In the case of [[Noricum]], there is archaeological evidence of freemen labour in the [[metal trade]] and [[Mineral extraction|extraction]] through [[graffiti]] on mine walls.  In this province, many men were given [[Roman citizenship]] for their efforts contributing to the procurement of metal for the empire.  Both privately owned and government run mines were in operation simultaneously (Shepard 1993).\n\n===Economy===\nFrom the formation of the Roman Empire, Rome was an almost completely closed [[economy]], not reliant on [[imports]] although exotic goods from [[India]] and [[China]] (such as [[Gemstone|gems]], [[silk]] and [[spices]]) were highly prized (Shepard 1993).  Through the recovery of [[Roman coins]] and ingots throughout the [[ancient world]] (Hughes 1980), [[metallurgy]] has supplied the [[archaeologist]] with [[material culture]] through which to see the expanse of the [[Roman world]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[De Re Metallica]]\n* [[Georgius Agricola]]\n* [[Mining in Roman Britain]]\n* [[Naturalis Historia]]\n* [[Pliny the Elder]]\n* [[Roman engineering]]\n* [[Roman technology]]\n* [[Malvesa]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n; General\n{{refbegin|colwidth=33em}}\n* Aitchison, Leslie.  1960.

By 53 BC, [[Rome]] had expanded to control an immense expanse of the Mediterranean.  This included [[Italy]] and its islands, [[Hispania|Spain]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Roman Greece|Greece]]; by the end of the Emperor [[Trajan]]'s reign, the [[Roman Empire]] had grown further to encompass parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], all of modern [[Germany]] west of the Rhine, [[Dacia]], [[Noricum]], [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], [[Armenia]], [[Illyria]], and [[Thrace]] (Shepard 1993).  As the empire grew, so did its need for metals.\n\n[[Central Italy]] itself was not rich in [[metal]] [[ores]], leading to necessary [[trade]] networks in order to meet the demand for metal.  Early Italians had some access to metals in the northern regions of the peninsula in [[Tuscany]] and [[Cisalpine Gaul]], as well as the islands [[Elba]] and [[Sardinia]].  With the conquest of [[Etruria]] in 275 BC and the subsequent acquisitions due to the [[Punic Wars]], Rome had the ability to stretch further into [[Transalpine Gaul]] and Iberia, both areas rich in [[minerals]].  At the height of the Empire, Rome exploited mineral resources from [[Tingitana]] in north western Africa to Egypt, [[Arabia]] to North Armenia, [[Galatia]] to [[Germania]], and [[Britannia]] to Iberia, encompassing all of the [[Mediterranean]] coast. Britannia, Iberia, Dacia, and [[Noricum]] were of special significance, as they were very rich in deposits and became major sites of resource exploitation (Shepard, 1993).\n\nThere is evidence that after the middle years of the Empire there was a sudden and steep decline in [[mineral extraction]].  This was mirrored in other trades and industries.\n\nOne of the most important Roman sources of information is the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]].  Several books (XXXIII\u2013XXXVII) of his [[encyclopedia]] cover metals and metal ores, their occurrence, importance and development.\n\n== Types of metal used ==\n\nMany of the first [[metal]] artifacts that archaeologists have identified have been [[Prehistoric Iberia|tools]] or [[Prehistoric Britain|weapons]], as well as objects used as ornaments such as [[Migdale Hoard|jewellery]].  These early metal objects were made of the softer metals; [[copper]], [[gold]], and [[lead]] in particular, as the metals either as [[native metal]] or by thermal extraction from [[mineral]]s, and softened by minimal heat (Craddock, 1995).  While technology did advance to the point of creating surprisingly pure copper, most ancient metals are in fact [[alloys]], the most important being [[bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and [[tin]].  As metallurgical technology developed ([[hammering]], [[melting]], [[smelting]], [[roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]], [[cupellation]], [[molding (process)|moulding]], [[smithing]], etc.), more metals were intentionally included in the metallurgical repertoire.\n\nBy the height of the Roman Empire, metals in use included: [[silver]], [[zinc]], [[iron]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], lead, gold, copper, tin (Healy 1978).  As in the Bronze Age, metals were used based on many physical properties: aesthetics, [[hardness]], colour, taste/smell (for cooking wares), timbre (instruments), aversion to [[corrosion]], weight, and other factors.  Many alloys were also possible, and were intentionally made in order to change the properties of the metal e.g. the alloy of predominately tin with lead would harden the soft tin, to create [[pewter]], which would prove its utility as cooking and [[Pewter|tableware]].\n\n== Sources of ore ==\n[[File:Panor\u00e1mica de Las M\u00e9dulas.jpg|thumb|[[Las M\u00e9dulas]], remains of the most important gold mine in the Roman Empire.

Containing deposits of gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, iron, and mercury), it was very rich in resources.  From its acquisition during the [[Punic Wars]] to the Fall of Rome, [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] continued to produce a significant amount of Roman [[metals]] (Healy 1978, Shepard 1993).\n\nSimilarly, [[Britannia]] was also very rich in [[metals]].  Gold was mined at [[Dolaucothi]] in [[Wales]], copper and tin in [[Cornwall]], and lead in the [[Pennines]], [[Mendip Hills]] and [[Wales]].  Significant studies have been made on the [[iron production]] of [[Roman Britain]]; iron use in Europe was intensified by the Romans, and was part of the exchange of ideas between the cultures through [[Roman occupation of Britannia|Roman occupation]] (Aitchison, 1960).  It was the importance placed on iron by the Romans throughout the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] which completed the shift from the few cultures still using primarily [[bronze]] into the [[Iron Age]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Noricum]] is the ancient site of modern [[Austria]].  Exceedingly rich in gold and iron, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Strabo]], and [[Ovid]] all lauded its bountiful deposits.  Iron was its main commodity, but [[alluvial]] gold was also prospected.  By 15 BC, Noricum was officially made a [[province]] of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], and the [[metal]] trade saw prosperity well into the fifth century AD (Shepard 1993, Healy 1978).  Some scholars believe that the art of iron [[forging]] was not necessarily created, but well developed in this area and it was the population of Noricum which reminded Romans of the usefulness of iron (Aitchison, 1960).  For example, of the three forms of iron ([[wrought iron]], [[steel]], and soft), the forms which were exported were of the wrought iron (containing a small percentage of uniformly distributed [[slag]] material) and steel (carbonised iron) categories, as pure iron is too soft to function like wrought or steel iron (Sim 1999, Aitchison 1960).\n\n[[Dacia]], located in the area of [[Transylvania]], was conquered in 107 AD in order to capture the resources of the region for Rome.  The amount of gold that came into Roman possession actually brought down the [[Value (economics)|value]] of gold.  Iron was also of importance to the region.  The difference between the mines of [[Noricum]] and Dacia was the presence of a [[slave]] population as a workforce (Shepard 1993).\n\n== Technology ==\n[[File:Lingotesplomocarthagonova.jpg|thumb|Roman ingots of [[lead]] from the mines of [[Cartagena, Spain]], Archaeological Municipal Museum of Cartagena]]\nThe earliest metal manipulation was probably hammering (Craddock 1995, 1999), where copper ore was pounded into thin sheets. [[Beneficiation]], or the process of \u2019making better\u2019 could be carried out on the ore (if there were large enough pieces of metal separate from [[mineral]]) or after melting, where the [[prills]] of metal could be hand picked from the cooled slag. [[Melting]] beneficiated metal also allowed early [[metallurgists]] to use [[Molding (process)|moulds]] and [[Casting|casts]] to form shapes of [[molten metal]] (Craddock 1995).  Many of the metallurgical skills developed in the Bronze Age were still in use during Roman times.  Melting\u2014the process of using heat to separate slag and metal, [[smelting]]\u2014using a reduced oxygen heated environment to separate metal oxides into metal and carbon dioxide, [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]]\u2014process of using an oxygen rich environment to isolate sulphur oxide from metal oxide which can then be smelted, [[casting]]\u2014pouring liquid metal into a mould to make an object, hammering\u2014using blunt force to make a thin sheet which can be annealed or shaped, and [[cupellation]]\u2014separating metal alloys to isolate a specific metal\u2014were all techniques which were well understood (Zwicker 1985, Tylecote 1962, Craddock 1995).  However, the Romans provided few new technological advances other than the use of iron and the cupellation and [[Granulation (process)|granulation]] in the separation of [[gold alloys]] (Tylecote 1962).\n\nWhile [[native gold]] is common, the ore will sometimes contain small amounts of [[silver]] and copper.  The Romans utilised a sophisticated system to separate these precious metals.  The use of cupellation, a process developed before the rise of Rome, would extract copper from gold and silver, or an alloy called [[electrum]].  In order to separate the gold and silver, however, the Romans would granulate the alloy by pouring the liquid, molten metal into cold water, and then [[smelting|smelt]] the granules with [[salt]], separating the gold from the chemically altered [[silver chloride]] (Tylecote 1962).  They used a similar method to extract silver from lead. \n\nWhile Roman production became standardised in many ways, the evidence for distinct unity of [[furnace]] types is not strong, alluding to a tendency of the peripheries continuing with their own past furnace technologies.  In order to complete some of the more complex metallurgical techniques, there is a bare minimum of necessary components for Roman metallurgy: metallic ore, furnace of unspecified type with a form of [[oxygen]] source (assumed by Tylecote to be bellows) and a method of restricting said oxygen (a lid or cover), a source of [[fuel]] ([[charcoal]] from [[wood]] or occasionally [[peat]]), moulds and/or [[hammers]] and [[anvils]] for shaping, the use of [[crucibles]] for isolating metals (Zwicker 1985), and likewise cupellation hearths (Tylecote 1962).\n\n==Mechanisation==\n[[Image:Archscrew2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]\nThere is direct evidence that the Romans mechanised at least part of the extraction processes. They used water power from [[water wheels]] for grinding grains and sawing timber or stone, for example. A set of sixteen such overshot wheels is still visible at [[Barbegal]] near [[Arles]] dating from the 1st century AD or possibly earlier, the water being supplied by the main aqueduct to Arles. It is likely that the mills supplied flour for Arles and other towns locally. Multiple grain mills also existed on the [[Janiculum]] hill in Rome.\n \n[[Ausonius]] attests the use of a water mill for sawing stone in his poem ''[[Mosella]]'' from the 4th century AD. They could easily have adapted the technology to crush ore using [[tilt hammer]]s, and just such is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' dating to about 75 AD, and there is evidence for the method from [[Dolaucothi]] in [[South Wales]]. The Roman gold mines developed from c. 75 AD. The methods survived into the medieval period, as described and illustrated by [[Georgius Agricola]] in his ''[[De Re Metallica]]''.\n\nThey also used [[reverse overshot water-wheel]] for draining mines, the parts being prefabricated and numbered for ease of assembly. Multiple set of such wheels have been found in Spain at the Rio Tinto copper mines and a fragment of a wheel at Dolaucothi. An incomplete wheel from Spain is now on public show in the [[British Museum]].\n\n== Output ==\nThe invention and widespread application of [[hydraulic mining]], namely [[hushing]] and ground-sluicing, aided by the ability of the Romans to plan and execute mining operations on a large scale, allowed various base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale only rarely matched until the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>Wilson 2002, pp. 17\u201321, 25, 32</ref>\n\nThe most common fuel by far for smelting and forging operations, as well as heating purposes, was wood and particularly [[charcoal]], which is nearly twice as efficient.<ref>Cech 2010, p. 20</ref> In addition, [[coal]] was mined in some regions to a fairly large extent: Almost all major coalfields in Roman Britain were exploited by the late 2nd century AD, and a lively trade along the English [[North Sea]] coast developed, which extended to the continental [[Rhineland]], where [[bituminous coal]] was already used for the smelting of iron ore.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 322\u2013324</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|+ Annual metal production in metric tons\n|-\n|\n!

Like [[Samian ware]], moulds were created by making a model of the desired shape (whether through wood, [[wax]], or metal), which would then be pressed into a [[clay]] mould.  In the case of a metal or wax model, once dry, the [[ceramic]] could be heated and the wax or metal melted until it could be poured from the [[mould]] (this process utilising wax is called the \u201c[[lost wax]]\u201c technique).  By pouring metal into the aperture, exact copies of an object could be cast.  This process made the creation of a line of objects quite uniform.  This is not to suggest that the creativity of individual artisans did not continue; rather, unique handcrafted pieces were normally the work of small, rural metalworkers on the peripheries of Rome using local techniques (Tylecote 1962).\n\nThere is archaeological evidence throughout the Empire demonstrating the large scale [[excavations]], smelting, and trade routes concerning metals.  With the Romans came the concept of [[mass production]]; this is arguably the most important aspect of Roman influence in the study of metallurgy.  Three particular objects produced en masse and seen in the [[archaeological record]] throughout the Roman Empire are brooches called [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], worn by both men and women (Bayley 2004), [[coins]], and [[ingots]] (Hughes 1980).  These cast objects can allow [[archaeologists]] to trace years of [[communication]], trade, and even historic/stylistic changes throughout the centuries of Roman power.\n\n==Social ramifications==\n\n===Slavery===\nWhen the cost of producing [[slaves]] became too high to justify [[slave]] [[labourers]] for the many [[Mining|mines]] throughout the [[empire]] around the second century, a system of [[indentured servitude]] was introduced for [[convicts]].  In 369 AD a law was reinstated due to the closure of many deep mines; the emperor [[Hadrian]] had previously given the control of mines to private employers, so that workers were hired rather than working out of force.  Through the institution of this system profits increased (Shepard 1993).  In the case of [[Noricum]], there is archaeological evidence of freemen labour in the [[metal trade]] and [[Mineral extraction|extraction]] through [[graffiti]] on mine walls.  In this province, many men were given [[Roman citizenship]] for their efforts contributing to the procurement of metal for the empire.  Both privately owned and government run mines were in operation simultaneously (Shepard 1993).\n\n===Economy===\nFrom the formation of the Roman Empire, Rome was an almost completely closed [[economy]], not reliant on [[imports]] although exotic goods from [[India]] and [[China]] (such as [[Gemstone|gems]], [[silk]] and [[spices]]) were highly prized (Shepard 1993).  Through the recovery of [[Roman coins]] and ingots throughout the [[ancient world]] (Hughes 1980), [[metallurgy]] has supplied the [[archaeologist]] with [[material culture]] through which to see the expanse of the [[Roman world]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[De Re Metallica]]\n* [[Georgius Agricola]]\n* [[Mining in Roman Britain]]\n* [[Naturalis Historia]]\n* [[Pliny the Elder]]\n* [[Roman engineering]]\n* [[Roman technology]]\n* [[Malvesa]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n; General\n{{refbegin|colwidth=33em}}\n* Aitchison, Leslie.  1960.
