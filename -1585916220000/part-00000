He entered the Jesuits on July 30 of that year.<ref name=regis/> He later said his inspiration for becoming a Jesuit was Rev. [[John Corridan]] (1911\u20131984), whose populist activism later provided the inspiration for the film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954). He trained for the priesthood in the Philippines, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1954 and a master\u2019s degree in 1955 from [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines#Defunct_institutions|Berchmans College]] in [[Cebu City]].{{efn|During these years he became acquainted with Philippine first lady [[Imelda Marcos]]: \"I knew Mrs. Marcos pretty well.

Amda Seyon's royal chronicle states that Sabr ad-Din proclaimed:\n\n: \"I wish to be King of all Ethiopia; I will rule the Christians according to their law and I will destroy their churches...I will nominate governors in all the provinces of Ethiopia, as does the King of [[Axum|Zion]]...I will transform the churches into mosques. I will subjugate and convert the King of the Christians to my religion, I will make him a provincial governor, and if he refuses to be converted I will hand him over to one of the shepherds, called Warjeke [i.e. [[Werji people|Werjih]]], that he may be made a keeper of camels. As for the Queen [[Jan Mengesha|Jan Mangesha]], his wife, I will employ her to grind corn. I will make my residence at Marade [i.e. [[Tegulet]]], the capital of his kingdom.<ref>Pankhurst, Richard K.P. ''The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles.'' Addis Ababa: Oxford University Press, Inc., 1967, p. 15.</ref>\n\nIn fact, after his first incursion, Sabr ad-Din appointed governors for nearby and neighboring provinces such as [[Fetegar]] and Alamal\u00e9 (i.e. Aymellel, part of the \"[[Gurage|Gurag\u00e9]] country\"), as well as far-off provinces in the north like [[Damot]], [[Amhara province|Amhara]], [[Angot]], [[Inderta]], [[Begemder]], and [[Gojjam]]. He also threatened to plant ''[[khat]]'' at the capital, a stimulant used by Muslims but forbidden to [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Christians]].<ref>Pankhurst, ''Borderlands'', p. 42.</ref>\n\nSabr ad-Din's rebellion in early 1332 , with its religious support and ambitious goals, was therefore seen as a ''[[jihad]]'' rather than an attempt at independence, and it was consequently immediately joined by the nearby Muslim province of Dewaro (the first known mention of the province), under the governor Haydera, and the western province of [[Hadiya Zone|Hadiya]] under the vassal local ruler Ameno. Sabr ad-Din divided his troops into three parts, sending a division north-westwards to attack [[Amhara province|Amhara]], one northwards to attack Angot, and another, under his personal command, westward to take [[Shewa]].<ref name=\"PankBord43\">Pankhurst, ''Borderlands'', p. 43.</ref>\n\nAmda Seyon subsequently mobilized his soldiers to meet the threat, endowing them with gifts of gold, silver, and lavish clothing \u2013 so much so that the chronicler explains that \"in his reign gold and silver abounded like stones and fine clothes were as common as the leaves of the trees or the grass in the fields.\"<ref>Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Royal Chronicles'', p. 16.</ref> Despite the extravagance he bestowed on his men, many chose not to fight due to the inhospitability of Ifat's mountainous and arid terrain and the complete absence of roads. Nevertheless, they advanced on [[Ethiopian calendar|24 Yakatit]], and an attachment was able to find the rebellious governor and put him to flight. Once the remainder of [[Amda Seyon I|Amda Seyon's]] army arrived, they destroyed the capital of Ifat [[zeila]] and killed many soldiers at the [[Battle of ziela|battle of Zeila]]. But Sabr ad-Din once again escaped. Amda Seyon's forces then grouped together for a final attack, destroying one of his camps, killing many men, women, and children, taking the rest prisoner, as well as looting it of its gold, silver, and its \"fine clothes and jewels without number.\"<ref name=\"PankBord43\" />\n\nSabr ad-Din subsequently sued for peace, appealing to Queen Jan Mengesha, who refused his peace offer and expressed Amda Seyon's determination not to return to his capital until he had searched Sabr ad-Din out. Upon hearing this, Sabr ad-Din realized that his rebellion futile and surrendered himself to Amda Seyon's camp.<ref name=\"PankBord43\" /> Amda Seyon's courtiers demanded that Sabr ad-Din be executed, but he instead granted him relative clemency and had the rebellious governor imprisoned. Amda Seyon then appointed the governor's brother, [[Jamal ad-Din I]], as his successor in Ifat. Just as the Ifat rebellion had been quelled, however, the neighboring provinces of Adal and [[Mora, Ethiopia|Mora]] just north of Ifat rose against the Emperor. Amda Seyon soon also put down this rebellion.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Borderlands'', p. 44.</ref><br />\n\n=== After the era of [[Amda Seyon I]]===\n\nthe Muslim rulers of Ifat continued their campaign against the Christian Emperor. His son, Emperor Sayfa Arad appointed Ahmad, also known as Harb Arad ibn Ali as the sultan of Ifat, and put Ali's father and relatives in prison.<ref name=\"rp4950\" /> Sayfa Arad was close to Ahmad and supported his rule, however Ahmad was killed in an Ifat uprising. Ahmad's son [[Haqq ad-Din II]] then came to power in Ifat. Internal ruling family struggle in Ifat expelled grandfather Ali's son named Mola Asfah who gathered forces and attacked Ahmad's son. A series of battles affirmed Sultan Haqq ad-Din II position of power.<ref name=\"rp4950\" /> The new Sultan moved away from previous capital of Ifat, to a new town of Wahal. From there, he ceaselessly fought with the Emperor, in over twenty battles through 1370, according to Maqrizi's chronicle written in 1435. The Ifat Sultan Haqq ad-Din II died in a battle in 1376.<ref name=\"rp4950\">Richard Pankhurst [https://books.google.com/books?id=zpYBD3bzW1wC&pg=PA49 The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century - Google Books\"] The Red Sea Press, 1997. p. 49-50</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Mordechai Abir, the continued warfare between Ifat Sultanate and the Ethiopian Emperor was a part of the larger geopolitical conflict, where Egypt had arrested Coptic Church's Patriarch Marcos in 1352.

Amda Seyon's royal chronicle states that Sabr ad-Din proclaimed:\n\n: \"I wish to be King of all Ethiopia; I will rule the Christians according to their law and I will destroy their churches...I will nominate governors in all the provinces of Ethiopia, as does the King of [[Axum|Zion]]...I will transform the churches into mosques. I will subjugate and convert the King of the Christians to my religion, I will make him a provincial governor, and if he refuses to be converted I will hand him over to one of the shepherds, called Warjeke [i.e. [[Werji people|Werjih]]], that he may be made a keeper of camels. As for the Queen [[Jan Mengesha|Jan Mangesha]], his wife, I will employ her to grind corn. I will make my residence at Marade [i.e. [[Tegulet]]], the capital of his kingdom.<ref>Pankhurst, Richard K.P. ''The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles.'' Addis Ababa: Oxford University Press, Inc., 1967, p. 15.</ref>\n\nIn fact, after his first incursion, Sabr ad-Din appointed governors for nearby and neighboring provinces such as [[Fetegar]] and Alamal\u00e9 (i.e. Aymellel, part of the \"[[Gurage|Gurag\u00e9]] country\"), as well as far-off provinces in the north like [[Damot]], [[Amhara province|Amhara]], [[Angot]], [[Inderta]], [[Begemder]], and [[Gojjam]]. He also threatened to plant ''[[khat]]'' at the capital, a stimulant used by Muslims but forbidden to [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Christians]].<ref>Pankhurst, ''Borderlands'', p. 42.</ref>\n\nSabr ad-Din's rebellion in early 1332 , with its religious support and ambitious goals, was therefore seen as a ''[[jihad]]'' rather than an attempt at independence, and it was consequently immediately joined by the nearby Muslim province of Dewaro (the first known mention of the province), under the governor Haydera, and the western province of [[Hadiya Zone|Hadiya]] under the vassal local ruler Ameno. Sabr ad-Din divided his troops into three parts, sending a division north-westwards to attack [[Amhara province|Amhara]], one northwards to attack Angot, and another, under his personal command, westward to take [[Shewa]].<ref name=\"PankBord43\">Pankhurst, ''Borderlands'', p. 43.</ref>\n\nAmda Seyon subsequently mobilized his soldiers to meet the threat, endowing them with gifts of gold, silver, and lavish clothing \u2013 so much so that the chronicler explains that \"in his reign gold and silver abounded like stones and fine clothes were as common as the leaves of the trees or the grass in the fields.\"<ref>Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Royal Chronicles'', p. 16.</ref> Despite the extravagance he bestowed on his men, many chose not to fight due to the inhospitability of Ifat's mountainous and arid terrain and the complete absence of roads. Nevertheless, they advanced on [[Ethiopian calendar|24 Yakatit]], and an attachment was able to find the rebellious governor and put him to flight. Once the remainder of [[Amda Seyon I|Amda Seyon's]] army arrived, they destroyed the capital of Ifat [[zeila]] and killed many soldiers at the [[Battle of ziela|battle of Zeila]]. But Sabr ad-Din once again escaped. Amda Seyon's forces then grouped together for a final attack, destroying one of his camps, killing many men, women, and children, taking the rest prisoner, as well as looting it of its gold, silver, and its \"fine clothes and jewels without number.\"<ref name=\"PankBord43\" />\n\nSabr ad-Din subsequently sued for peace, appealing to Queen Jan Mengesha, who refused his peace offer and expressed Amda Seyon's determination not to return to his capital until he had searched Sabr ad-Din out. Upon hearing this, Sabr ad-Din realized that his rebellion futile and surrendered himself to Amda Seyon's camp.<ref name=\"PankBord43\" /> Amda Seyon's courtiers demanded that Sabr ad-Din be executed, but he instead granted him relative clemency and had the rebellious governor imprisoned. Amda Seyon then appointed the governor's brother, [[Jamal ad-Din I]], as his successor in Ifat. Just as the Ifat rebellion had been quelled, however, the neighboring provinces of Adal and [[Mora, Ethiopia|Mora]] just north of Ifat rose against the Emperor. Amda Seyon soon also put down this rebellion.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Borderlands'', p. 44.</ref><br />\n\n=== After the era of [[Amda Seyon I]]===\n\nthe Muslim rulers of Ifat continued their campaign against the Christian Emperor. His son, Emperor Sayfa Arad appointed Ahmad, also known as Harb Arad ibn Ali as the sultan of Ifat, and put Ali's father and relatives in prison.<ref name=\"rp4950\" /> Sayfa Arad was close to Ahmad and supported his rule, however Ahmad was killed in an Ifat uprising. Ahmad's son [[Haqq ad-Din II]] then came to power in Ifat. Internal ruling family struggle in Ifat expelled grandfather Ali's son named Mola Asfah who gathered forces and attacked Ahmad's son. A series of battles affirmed Sultan Haqq ad-Din II position of power.<ref name=\"rp4950\" /> The new Sultan moved away from previous capital of Ifat, to a new town of Wahal. From there, he ceaselessly fought with the Emperor, in over twenty battles through 1370, according to Maqrizi's chronicle written in 1435. The Ifat Sultan Haqq ad-Din II died in a battle in 1376.<ref name=\"rp4950\">Richard Pankhurst [https://books.google.com/books?id=zpYBD3bzW1wC&pg=PA49 The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century - Google Books\"] The Red Sea Press, 1997. p. 49-50</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Mordechai Abir, the continued warfare between Ifat Sultanate and the Ethiopian Emperor was a part of the larger geopolitical conflict, where Egypt had arrested Coptic Church's Patriarch Marcos in 1352. This arrest led to retaliatory arrest and imprisonment of all Egyptian merchants in Ethiopia. In 1361, the Egyptian Sultan al-Malik al-Salih released the Patriarch and then sought amicable relations with Ethiopian Emperor. The actions of the Ifat Sultanate and Muslim kingdoms in the Horn of Africa, states Abir, were linked to the Muslim-Christian conflicts between Egypt and Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Abir2013p25\">{{cite book|author=Mordechai Abir|title=Ethiopia and the Red Sea: The Rise and Decline of the Solomonic Dynasty and Muslim European Rivalry in the Region |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fArBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA25 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-28090-0|pages=25\u201327}}</ref>\n\n===The end of Ifat sultanate===\nIn 1376, Sultan [[Sa'ad ad-Din II|Sa'ad ad-Din Abdul Muhammad]], also called Sa'ad ad-Din II, succeeded his brother and came to power, who continued to attack the Abyssinian Christian army.
