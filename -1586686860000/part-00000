{"title_page": "List of Impact Wrestling pay-per-view events", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of live pay-per-view events promoted by [[Impact Wrestling]]''' (formerly known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling). This list only includes the three-hour, live [[professional wrestling]] events held on Sundays that were built up to by Impact Wrestling, predominantly with its weekly television program ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|of the same name]]''. Impact Wrestling first began producing these events in 2004 under the TNA name and held them monthly until January 2013, when they switched to a schedule with four events per year. Initially, all events were held at the [[Impact Zone]], later changed to have several events a year being held elsewhere. The major and most heavily promoted events are [[Bound for Glory (wrestling pay-per-view)|Bound for Glory]], [[Slammiversary]] and [[TNA Lockdown|Lockdown]]. These events are also a major revenue source for the promotion.\n\n==History==\nFrom its inception, Impact Wrestling's only television programming was a two-hour weekly show shown on pay-per-view under the TNA brand. The first one was held on June 19, 2002 in Huntsville, Alabama. The last of these shows aired on September 8, 2004. TNA began airing their [[television program]] ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'' (which premiered June 4, 2004) as its primary program. After ''Impact!'' began, TNA felt that they had a fanbase that would support monthly, live, three-hour pay-per-view events. On November 7, 2004, TNA aired the first of these events, [[Victory Road (2004)|Victory Road]]. These events were produced monthly and the event of each month was given a different name.

This list only includes the three-hour, live [[professional wrestling]] events held on Sundays that were built up to by Impact Wrestling, predominantly with its weekly television program ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|of the same name]]''. Impact Wrestling first began producing these events in 2004 under the TNA name and held them monthly until January 2013, when they switched to a schedule with four events per year. Initially, all events were held at the [[Impact Zone]], later changed to have several events a year being held elsewhere. The major and most heavily promoted events are [[Bound for Glory (wrestling pay-per-view)|Bound for Glory]], [[Slammiversary]] and [[TNA Lockdown|Lockdown]]. These events are also a major revenue source for the promotion.\n\n==History==\nFrom its inception, Impact Wrestling's only television programming was a two-hour weekly show shown on pay-per-view under the TNA brand. The first one was held on June 19, 2002 in Huntsville, Alabama. The last of these shows aired on September 8, 2004. TNA began airing their [[television program]] ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'' (which premiered June 4, 2004) as its primary program. After ''Impact!'' began, TNA felt that they had a fanbase that would support monthly, live, three-hour pay-per-view events. On November 7, 2004, TNA aired the first of these events, [[Victory Road (2004)|Victory Road]]. These events were produced monthly and the event of each month was given a different name. Several changes and switches were made to the event names throughout the years.<ref name=\"VR2011\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/news/item/2355-Victory-Road-PPV-Moving-To-March|title=Victory Road PPV Moving to March|date=2011-01-12|publisher=TNA Wrestling|accessdate=2011-01-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116044638/http://www.tnawrestling.com/news/item/2355-Victory-Road-PPV-Moving-To-March|archivedate=2011-01-16}}</ref>\n\nTNA also held some pay-per-view events in co-operation with Japanese and Mexican promotions from 2007\u20132009, 2011, 2013 and 2019. Those promotions were [[Inoki Genome Federation]] (IGF), [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW), [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|AAA]] and [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC).\n\nThe monthly event schedule was changed in January 2013, with all but four events cancelled.

John, a pacifist, had left the Liberals to stand unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in 1918. He was a prominent Welsh Nationalist.\n*The Liberal candidate was again [[Sir Robert Thomas, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Thomas]], the former [[Wrexham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wrexham]] MP who had fought here at the 1922 general election. Thomas was a ship and insurance broker. Thomas had been allied to Lloyd George and had stood as a National Liberal last time. Even though the Liberals nationally had been divided between followers of Asquith and Lloyd George, the local Liberals managed to unite behind Thomas.\n*Even though the Coalition Government between the National Liberals and the Unionists had ended, the local Unionists chose not to contest the seat in 1922. However, for the by-election, they decided to intervene and field their own candidate, '''Richard Owen Roberts'''. Roberts had stood for the Unionists at Anglesey in 1910. He was a Barrister and sat on the London County Council for Lewisham East.\n\n==Campaign==\nLabour's campaign was supported by visits from national figures such as [[Arthur Henderson]], and a host of Labour MPs from south Wales such as [[David Watts Morgan]], Tom Griffiths, [[David Grenfell]] and T. I. Mardy Jones, as well as prominent Welsh nationalist figures such as future Liberal MP [[William John Gruffydd]] and Principal Thomas Rees. John called for Welsh Home Rule, even though it was not Labour party policy.\n\n==Result==\nThe Liberal party gained the seat from Labour and the Unionists trailed a poor third;\n[[File:Sir Robert Thomas.jpg|thumb|120px|Robert Thomas]]\n{{Election box begin | title=Anglesey by-election, 1923<ref name=\"Craig, F.

I. Mardy Jones, as well as prominent Welsh nationalist figures such as future Liberal MP [[William John Gruffydd]] and Principal Thomas Rees. John called for Welsh Home Rule, even though it was not Labour party policy.\n\n==Result==\nThe Liberal party gained the seat from Labour and the Unionists trailed a poor third;\n[[File:Sir Robert Thomas.jpg|thumb|120px|Robert Thomas]]\n{{Election box begin | title=Anglesey by-election, 1923<ref>F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow 1949</ref>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link|\n |party =       Liberal Party (UK)\n |candidate =   [[Sir Robert Thomas, 1st Baronet|Robert Thomas]]\n |votes =       11,116\n |percentage =  53.3\n |change =      +7.5\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n |party =       Labour Party (UK) \n |candidate =   [[Edward John (Welsh politician)|Edward John]]\n |votes =       6,368\n |percentage =  30.5\n |change =      -23.7\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n |party =       Unionist Party (UK) \n |candidate =   Richard Owen Roberts\n |votes =       3,385\n |percentage =  16.2\n |change =      ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election box majority|\n |votes =       4,748\n |percentage =  22.8\n |change =      ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election box turnout|\n |votes =       20,869\n |percentage =  76.4\n |change =      -4.1\n}}\n{{Election box registered electors|\n |reg. electors = 27,320\n}}\n{{Election box gain with party link|\n |winner = Liberal Party (UK)\n |loser = Labour Party (UK)\n |swing = +15.6\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\nThe good Liberal result spurred moves towards Liberal reunion at a national level. Within days, the two Liberal groups in the House of Lords decided to accept Viscount Grey as their leader in the Lords.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSir Robert Thomas sat for the constituency until retiring in 1929. The Liberal Party held the constituency until 1951.\nThe result at the following General election;\n{{Election box begin |title=[[1923 United Kingdom general election|General election 1923]]: Anglesey<ref>F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow 1949</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate unopposed with party link|\n  |party      = Liberal Party (UK)\n  |candidate  = [[Sir Robert Thomas, 1st Baronet|Robert Thomas]]\n}}\n{{Election box registered electors|\n |reg. electors = 28,135\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link no swing|\n  |winner    = Liberal Party (UK)\n  |loser     = Labour Party (UK)\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nJohn did not stand again. Roberts did not stand again and became a County Court Judge in 1924.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of United Kingdom by-elections]]\n* [[United Kingdom by-election records]]\n\n==References==\n* ''Who's Who'': www.ukwhoswho.com\n* ''Debrett's House of Commons 1922''\n* ''Trial By Ballot'' by Ivor RM Davies\n* ''By-Elections in British Politics'' by Cook and Ramsden\n* ''[[Welsh History Review]]'', Vol. 14, nos. 1-4 1988-89; E.T.

The manga was originally serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Super Jump]]'' starting in 1991, with the first [[tank\u014dbon|collected volume]] released the following year. Parts of the manga were adapted into a six-episode [[original video animation]] (OVA) series produced by Shueisha and [[KSS (company)|KSS]] in 1995, which was subsequently released through [[ADV Films]] in North America in December 1996. ADV's license of the series expired in 2007, however in November 2007, [[Media Blasters]] acquired the license to it. Media Blasters has confirmed that the dub produced by ADV was kept. In 2012, Media Blasters lost the ''Golden Boy'' license and the license was acquired by [[Discotek Media]].\n\nKintaro, despite having met the requirements for a law degree, left [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo University]] without graduating. ''Golden Boy'' depicts his living the life of a free spirit, roaming Japan from town to town, job to job. During his travels, Kintaro meets several women whose lives he dramatically changes, despite poor first impressions. He constantly observes and studies the people and events around him, recording his findings in a notebook he carries on his belt.\n\nThe ''Golden Boy'' OVA has been positively received by English-language reviewers, but it is widely known for its mature content: while the OVA is not strictly a [[hentai]] animation, it does feature instances of partial female nudity, orgasms, and female masturbation. In contrast, the manga becomes almost pornographic starting in the second volume.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=3938 | title = ''Golden Boy'' Manga-ka does live porn | date = 2003-07-23|accessdate = 2006-09-20|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2010 19th issue of ''[[Business Jump]]'', it was announced that a sequel to the ''Golden Boy'' manga was in the works.<ref name=mangasequel>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-08-31/golden-boy-manga-returns-in-new-series-in-september|title=Golden Boy Manga Returns In New Series In September|publisher= Anime News Network|date=2010-08-31|accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> [[Tatsuya Egawa]] stated that the sequel involved Kintaro taking on the entertainment world for his next job.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe beginning of each volume and episode of ''Golden Boy'' places Kintaro opposite a young, beautiful woman, whose interest or disdain for him serves as the basis of the plot. Some of these women initially dismiss Kintaro as an idiotic and clumsy pervert, and either give him or accept from him some challenge to prove their superiority. Kintaro invariably lusts after these women, but he is principally driven by his desire to be of actual service to them and to thereby learn more about the world. Despite his outward appearances, Kintaro is an incredibly clever and resourceful individual, and consistently exceeds what the women in his encounters thought possible, winning their hearts despite his outward awkwardness. But due to chance, necessity or a sense of honor, Kintaro never takes advantage of these newfound feelings. As the manga series progresses it introduces fewer women over multiple chapter arcs, such as a shoplifting schoolgirl, and goes back to women from earlier in the series that he's affected.\n\nKintaro is a [[freeter]], and has done various jobs as he quests around Japan in pursuit of knowledge. His ventures include computer programming, housekeeping, teaching, the culinary arts, and most of all, studying. Kintaro is also often seen demonstrating the skills he's learned in previous chapters to overcome challenges faced in the current one.  He's also adept in [[martial arts]], but does not fight unless he's angered, and ordinarily just takes a beating.\n\nMuch of the humor derives from situational elements, such as encounters between Kintaro and the women gone awry, and interactions between Kintaro's [[libido]] and imagination. Recurring gags include Kintaro's [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for toilets (especially those recently used by beautiful women), his exaggerated facial expressions, and comical entries in his notebook. The notebook entries include explicit drawings of the women he encounters and bits of wisdom such as \"'[[C (programming language)|C]]' [[Baseball metaphors for sex|base]] is not sex\", and \"The human head cannot turn 360 degrees.\" Regarding the series, Tatsuya Egawa writes: \"Before leaving kindergarten, I wrote these words in my notebook: 'I really like to study.' Often I wonder when it was that our schools forgot the true meaning of 'study.' Something which is now so often misunderstood by teachers and parents. Learning ought to be both stimulating and entertaining.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Tatsuya| last=Egawa | coauthors= | title=GOLDEN BOY Volume 1 | publisher=Shueisha | isbn=4-08-858721-9}} (unofficial translation)</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{nihongo|'''Kintaro Oe'''|\u5927\u6c5f \u9326\u592a\u90ce|\u014ce Kintar\u014d}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mitsuo Iwata]]|[[Doug Smith (voice actor)|Doug Smith]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Madame President'''|\u5973\u793e\u9577|Joshach\u014d}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Hiromi Tsuru]]|[[Tiffany Grant]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Naoko Katsuda'''|\u52dd\u7530 \u5948\u7dd2\u5b50|Katsuda Naoko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Y\u016bko Minaguchi]]|[[Allison Keith]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Noriko'''|\u7d00\u5b50}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yuri Shiratori]]|[[Kim Sevier]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Ayuko Hayami'''|\u901f\u6c34 \u9b8e\u5b50|Hayami Ayuko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kikuko Inoue]]|[[Sue Ulu]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Reiko Terayama'''|\u5bfa\u5c71 \u9e97\u5b50|Terayama Reiko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sakiko Tamagawa]]|[[Laura Chapman]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Chie'''|\u77e5\u7d75}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mika Kanai]]|[[Yvonne Aguirre]]}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:50%; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Vol. !!

The series was licensed in North America by [[ADV Films]] and was released on VHS in both subtitled and dubbed editions, later releasing on two [[DVD]] volumes in April 23 and June 18, 2002, and a complete series release in May 25, 2004.

The manga was originally serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Super Jump]]'' starting in 1991, with the first [[tank\u014dbon|collected volume]] released the following year. Parts of the manga were adapted into a six episode [[original video animation]] (OVA) series produced by Shueisha and [[KSS (company)|KSS]] in 1995, which was subsequently released through [[ADV Films]] in North America in December 1996. ADV's license of the series expired in 2007, however, and in November 2007, [[Media Blasters]] acquired the license to it. Media Blasters has confirmed that the dub produced by ADV was kept. In 2012, Media Blasters lost the ''Golden Boy'' license and the license was acquired by [[Discotek Media]].\n\nKintaro, despite having met the requirements for a law degree, left [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo University]] without graduating. ''Golden Boy'' depicts his living the life of a free spirit, roaming Japan from town to town, job to job. During his travels, Kintaro meets several women whose lives he dramatically changes, despite poor first impressions. He constantly observes and studies the people and events around him, recording his findings in a notebook he carries on his belt.\n\nThe ''Golden Boy'' OVA has been positively received by English-language reviewers, but it is widely known for its mature content: while the OVA is not strictly a [[hentai]] animation, it does feature instances of partial female nudity, orgasms, and female masturbation. In contrast, the manga becomes almost pornographic starting in the second volume.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=3938 | title = ''Golden Boy'' Manga-ka does live porn | date = 2003-07-23|accessdate = 2006-09-20|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2010 19th issue of ''[[Business Jump]]'', it was announced that a sequel to the ''Golden Boy'' manga was in the works.<ref name=mangasequel>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-08-31/golden-boy-manga-returns-in-new-series-in-september|title=Golden Boy Manga Returns In New Series In September|publisher= Anime News Network|date=2010-08-31|accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> [[Tatsuya Egawa]] stated that the sequel involved Kintaro taking on the entertainment world for his next job.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe beginning of each volume and episode of ''Golden Boy'' places Kintaro opposite a young, beautiful woman, whose interest or disdain for him serves as the basis of the plot. Some of these women initially dismiss Kintaro as an idiotic and clumsy pervert, and either give him or accept from him some challenge to prove their superiority. Kintaro invariably lusts after these women, but he is principally driven by his desire to be of actual service to them and to thereby learn more about the world. Despite his outward appearances, Kintaro is an incredibly clever and resourceful individual, and consistently exceeds what the women in his encounters thought possible, winning their hearts despite his outward awkwardness. But due to chance, necessity or a sense of honor, Kintaro never takes advantage of these newfound feelings. As the manga series progresses it introduces fewer women over multiple chapter arcs, such as a shoplifting schoolgirl, and goes back to women from earlier in the series that he's affected.\n\nKintaro is a [[freeter]], and has done various jobs as he quests around Japan in pursuit of knowledge. His ventures include computer programming, housekeeping, teaching, the culinary arts, and most of all, studying. Kintaro is also often seen demonstrating the skills he's learned in previous chapters to overcome challenges faced in the current one.  He's also adept in [[martial arts]], but does not fight unless he's angered, and ordinarily just takes a beating.\n\nMuch of the humor derives from situational elements, such as encounters between Kintaro and the women gone awry, and interactions between Kintaro's [[libido]] and imagination. Recurring gags include Kintaro's [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for toilets (especially those recently used by beautiful women), his exaggerated facial expressions, and comical entries in his notebook. The notebook entries include explicit drawings of the women he encounters and bits of wisdom such as \"'[[C (programming language)|C]]' [[Baseball metaphors for sex|base]] is not sex\", and \"The human head cannot turn 360 degrees.\" Regarding the series, Tatsuya Egawa writes: \"Before leaving kindergarten, I wrote these words in my notebook: 'I really like to study.' Often I wonder when it was that our schools forgot the true meaning of 'study.' Something which is now so often misunderstood by teachers and parents. Learning ought to be both stimulating and entertaining.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Tatsuya| last=Egawa | coauthors= | title=GOLDEN BOY Volume 1 | publisher=Shueisha | isbn=4-08-858721-9}} (unofficial translation)</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{nihongo|'''Kintaro Oe'''|\u5927\u6c5f \u9326\u592a\u90ce|\u014ce Kintar\u014d}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mitsuo Iwata]]|[[Doug Smith (voice actor)|Doug Smith]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Madame President'''|\u5973\u793e\u9577|Joshach\u014d}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Hiromi Tsuru]]|[[Tiffany Grant]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Naoko Katsuda'''|\u52dd\u7530 \u5948\u7dd2\u5b50|Katsuda Naoko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Y\u016bko Minaguchi]]|[[Allison Keith]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Noriko'''|\u7d00\u5b50}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yuri Shiratori]]|[[Kim Sevier]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Ayuko Hayami'''|\u901f\u6c34 \u9b8e\u5b50|Hayami Ayuko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kikuko Inoue]]|[[Sue Ulu]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Reiko Terayama'''|\u5bfa\u5c71 \u9e97\u5b50|Terayama Reiko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sakiko Tamagawa]]|[[Laura Chapman]]}}\n{{nihongo|'''Chie'''|\u77e5\u7d75}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mika Kanai]]|[[Yvonne Aguirre]]}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:50%; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Vol. !!

The tradition was started in 2003 and has been one of the premier skateboarding contests in the USA.\n\nIn the '''King of the Road''' (Ryder Jennings) contest, a group of pre-invited teams of professional skaters are each given a book<ref>http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/king-of-the-road-2014-book/</ref> containing a series of challenges. Points are awarded at the completion of each challenge. The teams compete at the same time over a two-week period, in which they travel across the U.S. to complete as many challenges as possible.\n\nKOTR has been held annually since its inception, with the exceptions of 2008, 2009 and 2018. In 2011, Thrasher and [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] hosted an addition KOTR competition in [[China]], with the participation of the four biggest Chinese skateboard deck companies.<ref>http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/king-of-the-road-china/</ref>\n\n==King of the Road 2003==\n\n===Teams===\n\n'''Team Deluxe'''\n*          [[Dan Drehobl]]\n*         [[Darrell Stanton]]\n*          [[JT Aultz]]\n*          Ernie Torres\n*          [[Tony Trujillo]]\n\n'''Team Tum Yeto'''\n*         [[Ethan Fowler]]\n*          [[Gareth Stehr]]\n*          [[Diego Bucchieri]]\n*          [[Johnny Layton]]\n*          [[Adrian Mallory]]\n\n'''Team Volcom'''\n*          [[Rune Glifberg]]\n*          [[Caswell Berry]]\n*          [[Dustin Dollin]]\n*          [[Dennis Busenitz]]\n*          [[Javier Sarmiento]]\n\n'''Team eS'''\n*          [[Eric Koston]]\n*          [[Rick McCrank]]\n*          [[Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)|Paul Rodriguez]]\n*          [[PJ Ladd]]\n*          [[Alexis Sablone]]\n\n===Final Standings===\n\n::1st Place: Deluxe\n::2nd Place: Tum Yeto\n::3rd Place: Volcom\n::4th Place: eS\n\n==King of the Road 2004==\n\n===Teams===\n\n::'''Team Almost'''\n*          [[Daewon Song]]\n*          [[Greg Lutzka]]\n*          Chris Haslam\n*          [[Ryan Sheckler]]\n*          Cooper Wilt\n::'''Team Girl'''\n*          [[Eric Koston]]\n*          Mike Carroll\n*          Rick Howard\n*          Brian Anderson\n*          Jereme Rogers\n::'''Team Real'''\n*          Peter Ramondetta\n*          Dennis Busenitz\n*          Tony Trujillo\n*          Darrell Stanton\n*          Ernie Torres\n*          Isaac Alvidrez\n\n::'''Team Zero'''<!-- </nowiki></nowiki> -->\n*          Jamie Thomas\n*          Jon Allie\n*          Tommy Sandoval\n*          [[Chris Cole (skateboarder)|Chris Cole]]\n*          James Brockman\n*          Jared Green\n\n===Final Standings===\n\n::1st Place: Zero\n::2nd Place: Girl\n::3rd Place: Almost\n::4th Place: Real\n\n==King of the Road 2005==\n\n===Teams===\n\n'''Team Zero'''\n\n*           Jamie Thomas\n*           Chris Cole \n*           Garrett Hill\n*           John Rattray\n*           Tommy Sandoval\n\n'''Team Habitat'''\n*           Fred Gall\n*           Silas Baxter-Neal\n*           Stefan Janoski\n*           Kerry Getz\n*           Danny Garcia\n\n'''Team Flip'''\n*           Geoff Rowley\n*           Bastien Salabanzi\n*           [[Shane Cross]]\n*           Arto Saari\n*           Alex Chalmers\n\n'''Team Element'''\n*           Jeremy Wray\n*           Mike Vallely\n*           Brent Atchley\n*           Tosh Townend\n*           Colt Cannon\n\n===Final Standings===\n::          First Place : Zero 4,180 points\n::          Second Place : Habitat 3,470\n::          Third Place : Flip 3,460\n::          Fourth Place : Element 2,680\n\n==King of the Road 2006==\n\n===Teams===\n\n'''Team Zero'''\n*          Jamie Thomas\n*          Chris Cole\n*          Tommy Sandoval\n*          John Rattray\n*          James Brockman\n\n'''Team Darkstar'''\n*          Chet Thomas\n*          Paul Machnau\n*          Gailea Momolu\n*          Paul Trep\n*          Adam Dyet\n\n'''Team Baker'''\n*          [[Andrew Reynolds (skateboarder)|Andrew Reynolds]]\n*          Erik Ellington\n*          Jim Greco\n*          Bryan Herman\n*          Leo Romero\n\n'''Team Toy Machine'''\n*          [[Ed Templeton]]\n*          Billy Marks\n*          Josh Harmony\n*          Johnny Layton\n*          Matt Bennett\n\n===Final Standings===\n\n::1st Place: Zero -

The tradition was started in 2003 and has been one of the premier skateboarding contests in the USA.\n\nIn the '''King of the Road''' (Ryder Jennings) contest, a group of pre-invited teams of professional skaters are each given a book<ref>http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/king-of-the-road-2014-book/</ref> containing a series of challenges. Points are awarded at the completion of each challenge.

{"title_page": "Solar analog", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Solar twins|the musical group|Solar Twins (band)|a star that likely came from the same stellar nursery as the Sun|Solar sibling}}\n'''Solar-type star''', '''solar analogs''' (also '''analogues'''), and '''solar twins''' are stars that are particularly similar to the [[Sun]].  The [[stellar classification]] is a hierarchy with solar twin being most like the Sun followed by solar analog and then solar-type.<ref name=soderblum_king1998 /> Observations of these stars are important for understanding better the properties of the Sun in relation to other stars and the habitability of planets.<ref name=\"Lowell\"/>\n\n== By similarity to the Sun ==\nDefining the three categories by their similarity to the Sun reflects the evolution of astronomical observational techniques. Originally, solar-type was the closest that similarity to the Sun could be defined. Later, more precise measurement techniques and improved observatories allowed for greater precision of key details like temperature, enabling the creation of a solar analog category for stars that were particularly similar to the Sun. Later still, continued improvements in precision allowed for the creation of a solar-twin category for near-perfect matches.\n\nSimilarity to the Sun allows for checking derived quantities\u2014such as temperature, which is derived from the color index\u2014against the Sun, the only star whose temperature is confidently known. For stars that are not similar to the Sun, this cross-checking cannot be done.<ref name=soderblum_king1998/>\n\n=== Solar-type ===\n[[Image:Compare sun tau ceti.png|right|thumb|320px|The Sun (left) compared to the similar but slightly smaller and less active [[Tau Ceti]] (right).]]\nThese stars are broadly similar to the Sun. They are [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars with a [[B\u2212V color]] between 0.48 and 0.80, the Sun having a B\u2212V color of 0.65. Alternatively, a definition based on [[spectral type]] can be used, such as [[F-type main-sequence star|F8V]] through [[K-type main-sequence star|K2V]], which would correspond to B\u2212V color of 0.50 to 1.00.<ref name=soderblum_king1998/> This definition fits approximately 10% of stars,<ref>[https://owlcation.com/stem/Different-Types-of-Stars-in-the-Universe Owlcation STEM, Astronomy, Different Types of Stars in the Universe, June 13, 2016]</ref> so a list of solar-type stars would be quite extensive.<ref>[http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/startype.html Atlas of the Universe, The Classification of Stars]</ref>\n\nSolar-type stars show highly correlated behavior between their rotation rates and their chromospheric activity (e.g. Calcium H & K line emission) and coronal activity (e.g. X-ray emission)<ref>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19950048251 NASA, Chromospheric variations in main-sequence stars, Jan. 01, 1995]</ref> Because solar-type stars spin down during their main-sequence lifetimes due to [[magnetic braking]], these correlations allow rough ages to be derived. Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008)<ref name=apj687_1264/> have estimated the ages for the 108 solar-type (F8V\u2013K2V) main-sequence stars within 52 light-years (16 parsecs) of the Sun based on their chromospheric activity (as measured via Ca, H, and K emission lines).\n\nThe following table shows a sample of solar-type stars within 50 light years that nearly satisfy the criteria for solar analogs (B\u2212V color between 0.48 and 0.80), based on current measurements (the Sun is listed for comparison):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|+ Sample of solar-type stars\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Identifier\n!colspan=\"2\"| [[J2000]] coordinates<ref name=SIMBAD/>\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Distance<ref name=SIMBAD/><br>(ly)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| [[Stellar classification|Stellar<br>class]]<ref name=SIMBAD/>\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Temperature<br>(K)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Metallicity<br>(dex)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Age<br>([[Gigayear|Gyr]])\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Notes\n|-\n!

Qualities considered include variability, mass, age, metallicity, and close companions.<ref name=Turnbull2002/>{{efn|habstar or habitability, is currently defined as an area, such as a planet or a moon, where [[liquid]] water can exist for at least a short duration of time.<ref>[http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm Sol Company, solstation.com, Stars and Habitable Planets, 2012]</ref><ref>[https://www.britannica.com/science/habitable-zone Britannica, Habitable zone, By Jack J.

Stable orbits in binary systems take one of two forms: S-Type (satellite or circumstellar) orbits around one of the stars, and P-Type (planetary or circumbinary) orbits around the entire binary pair. [[Eccentric Jupiter]]s may also disrupt the orbits of planets in habitable zones.<ref name = \"Turnbull2002\" />\n\nMetallicity of at least 40% solar ([Fe/H] = \u22120.4) is required for the formation of an Earth-like terrestrial planet. High metallicity strongly correlates to the formation of [[hot Jupiter]]s, but these are not absolute bars to life, as some [[gas giant]]s end up orbiting within the habitable zone themselves, and could potentially host Earth-like moons.<ref name = \"Turnbull2002\" />\n\nOne example of such a star is {{CelestialRefAll|HD 70642}}, a G5V, at temperature of 5533K, but is much younger than the sun, at 1.9 billion years old.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3041220.stm | work=BBC News | title=Solar System 'twin' found | date=2003-07-03}}</ref>\n\nAnother such example would be [[HIP 11915]], which has a planetary system containing a [[HIP 11915 b|Jupiter-like planet]] orbiting at a similar distance that the planet [[Jupiter]] does in the Solar System.<ref name=\"JupiterTwin\">{{cite web|title=Jupiter Twin Discovered Around Solar Twin |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1529/|website=eso.org/|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> To strengthen the similarities, the star is class G5V, has a temperature of 5750 K, has a sun-like mass and radius, and is only 500 million years younger than the Sun.

The [[stellar classification]] is a hierarchy with solar twin being most like the Sun followed by solar analog and then solar-type.<ref name=soderblum_king1998 /> Observations of these stars are important for understanding better the properties of the Sun in relation to other stars and the habitability of planets.<ref name=\"Lowell\"/>\n\n== By similarity to the Sun ==\nDefining the three categories by their similarity to the Sun reflects the evolution of astronomical observational techniques. Originally, solar-type was the closest that similarity to the Sun could be defined. Later, more precise measurement techniques and improved observatories allowed for greater precision of key details like temperature, enabling the creation of a solar analog category for stars that were particularly similar to the Sun. Later still, continued improvements in precision allowed for the creation of a solar-twin category for near-perfect matches.\n\nSimilarity to the Sun allows for checking derived quantities\u2014such as temperature, which is derived from the color index\u2014against the Sun, the only star whose temperature is confidently known. For stars that are not similar to the Sun, this cross-checking cannot be done.<ref name=soderblum_king1998/>\n\n=== Solar-type ===\n[[Image:Compare sun tau ceti.png|right|thumb|320px|The Sun (left) compared to the similar but slightly smaller and less active [[Tau Ceti]] (right).]]\nThese stars are broadly similar to the Sun. They are [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars with a [[B\u2212V color]] between 0.48 and 0.80, the Sun having a B\u2212V color of 0.65. Alternatively, a definition based on [[spectral type]] can be used, such as [[F-type main-sequence star|F8V]] through [[K-type main-sequence star|K2V]], which would correspond to B\u2212V color of 0.50 to 1.00.<ref name=soderblum_king1998/> This definition fits approximately 10% of stars,<ref>[https://owlcation.com/stem/Different-Types-of-Stars-in-the-Universe Owlcation STEM, Astronomy, Different Types of Stars in the Universe, June 13, 2016]</ref> so a list of solar-type stars would be quite extensive.<ref>[http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/startype.html Atlas of the Universe, The Classification of Stars]</ref>\n\nSolar-type stars show highly correlated behavior between their rotation rates and their chromospheric activity (e.g. Calcium H & K line emission) and coronal activity (e.g. X-ray emission)<ref>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19950048251 NASA, Chromospheric variations in main-sequence stars, Jan. 01, 1995]</ref> Because solar-type stars spin down during their main-sequence lifetimes due to [[magnetic braking]], these correlations allow rough ages to be derived. Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008)<ref name=apj687_1264/> have estimated the ages for the 108 solar-type (F8V\u2013K2V) main-sequence stars within 52 light-years (16 parsecs) of the Sun based on their chromospheric activity (as measured via Ca, H, and K emission lines).\n\nThe following table shows a sample of solar-type stars within 50 light years that nearly satisfy the criteria for solar analogs (B\u2212V color between 0.48 and 0.80), based on current measurements: (The Sun is listed for comparison.)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|+ Sample of solar-type stars\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Identifier\n!colspan=\"2\"| [[J2000]] Coordinates<ref name=SIMBAD/>\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Distance<ref name=SIMBAD/><br>(ly)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| [[Stellar classification|Stellar<br>Class]]<ref name=SIMBAD/>\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Temperature<br>(K)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Metallicity<br>(dex)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Age<br>([[Gigayear|Gyr]])\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Notes\n|-\n!

Qualities considered include variability, mass, age, metallicity, and close companions.<ref name=Turnbull2002/>{{efn|habstar or habitability, is currently defined as an area, such as a planet or a moon, where [[liquid]] water can exist for at least a short duration of time.<ref>[http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm Sol Company, solstation.com, Stars and Habitable Planets, 2012]</ref><ref>[https://www.britannica.com/science/habitable-zone Britannica, Habitable zone, By Jack J.

Stable orbits in binary systems take one of two forms: S-Type (satellite or circumstellar) orbits around one of the stars, and P-Type (planetary or circumbinary) orbits around the entire binary pair. [[Eccentric Jupiter]]s may also disrupt the orbits of planets in habitable zones.<ref name = \"Turnbull2002\" />\n\nMetallicity of at least 40% solar ([Fe/H] = \u22120.4) is required for the formation of an Earth-like terrestrial planet. High metallicity strongly correlates to the formation of [[hot Jupiter]]s, but these are not absolute bars to life, as some [[gas giant]]s end up orbiting within the habitable zone themselves, and could potentially host Earth-like moons.<ref name = \"Turnbull2002\" />\n\nOne example of such a star is {{CelestialRefAll|HD 70642}}, a G5V, at temperature of 5533K, but is much younger than the sun, at 1.9 billion years old.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3041220.stm | work=BBC News | title=Solar System 'twin' found | date=2003-07-03}}</ref>\n\nAnother such example would be [[HIP 11915]], which has a planetary system containing a [[HIP 11915 b|Jupiter-like planet]] orbiting at a similar distance that the planet [[Jupiter]] does in the Solar System.<ref name=\"JupiterTwin\">{{cite web|title=Jupiter Twin Discovered Around Solar Twin |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1529/|website=eso.org/|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> To strengthen the similarities, the star is class G5V, has a temperature of 5750 K, has a sun-like mass and radius, and is only 500 million years younger than the Sun.

It is a member of the [[Rugby Group]] and though originally a major boys' public school in the [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]], it is now co-educational, enrolling pupils at 11+, 13+ and 16+ stages of education. Over 880 pupils attend Haileybury, of whom more than 550 board.\n\n== History ==\nThe previous institution at Haileybury was the [[East India Company College|East India College]] (EIC), the training establishment founded in 1806 for administrators of the [[East India Company|Honourable East India Company]]. The EIC was initially based at [[Hertford Castle]], but substantial grounds in Hertford Heath were acquired for future development. [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], the architect of [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London, was appointed principal architect. The buildings comprise four ranges which enclose an area known as ''Quad'', the second largest academic [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in Britain after [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Country Life, Volume 203|year=2009|page=28}}</ref> In the wake of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the East India Company was nationalised, and its College closed in January 1858.  In 1862, a public school opened on the site that retained many connections with the EIC. Many of the houses were named after Old Boys or Principals of the EIC, and Haileybury's primary purpose during the second half of the 19th century was to provide soldiers and administrators for the [[British Empire]], in particular, [[British India]].\n\nThe Chapel dome was added by [[Arthur Blomfield|Sir Arthur Blomfield]] and completed in 1877. Further Victorian additions were designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John William Simpson]]. The ''Memorial Hall'', the school's dining hall, was opened by the future [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and acts as a monument to former pupils who gave their lives in the [[First World War]]. During the past 40&nbsp;years, its use has been extended to commemorate deaths of OHs in all military conflicts.\n\nThe dining hall contains one of the largest unsupported domes in Europe. Until the 1990s, the entire school of over 700 pupils dined there at a single sitting, all brought to silence for grace by the beating of a massive brass [[howitzer]] shell, captured from a German gun emplacement during the [[First World War]] and then converted into a [[gong]]. A gilded plaster boss in the centre of this dome represents an oak tree being struck by lightning. Known as ''Little Lightning Oak,'' this decoration represents the massive oak tree that stands on the lawn in front of ''Terrace'', the promenade visible in this photograph. This tree was struck by lightning and all but destroyed, re-sprouted.\n\nAs well as the wooden tablets surrounding the exterior of the dining hall, there are other memorials to the school's 1,436 war casualties. In memory of Haileyburians who died in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], a war memorial [[obelisk]], made of portland stone and decorated with bronze, was erected on the main axis of the school's entrance front in 1903. It is known in the school as ''Obelisk'' and was designed by former pupil, [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in the First World War, also designed by Sir Reginald, was unveiled by [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|{{Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George}}]] on 7 July 1923. Known as the ''[[Cross of Sacrifice]]'' this simple stone structure serves as a prototype for war memorials found in every [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Commonwealth War Cemetery]] and other war memorials around the world.\n\nSeventeen former pupils of Haileybury and its antecedents have received the [[Victoria Cross]], and three the [[George Cross]]. Amongst independent schools whose pupils have been awarded the Victoria Cross, Haileybury is in the top three, alongside [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Harrow School|Harrow]].\n\nIn 1942, Haileybury and the [[Imperial Service College]] (which had itself subsumed the [[United Services College]]) merged to become '''Haileybury and Imperial Service College''', now often referred to simply as Haileybury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|title=The story of Haileybury|website=Haileybury|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812041706/http://www.haileybury.com/the-school/a-brief-history|archive-date=12 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, reforming headmaster [[David Jewell]] took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold War austerity. [[Stuart Westley]], Master of Haileybury until July 2009, was responsible for making the school fully co-educational.<ref>''The Times'', Obituaries, July 2006</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nHaileybury serves as a co-educational school for 11- to 18-year-olds.  Girls' houses comprise [[John Russell Colvin|Colvin]], [[James Cosmo Melvill|Melvill]], [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]], Alban's, and Hailey. The seven boys' houses consist of [[George Frederick Edmonstone|Edmonstone]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Lawrence]], [[Henry Bartle Frere|Bartle Frere]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], [[Joseph Batten|Batten]], [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|Thomason]], and [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet|Trevelyan]]. There is also a boarding house for the Lower School (Years 7 and 8) called Highfield. The [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] Theatre functions as a modern auditorium with a fully equipped stage and back-stage. In 1997, the college chapel [[Pipe organ|organ]] was re-built by German organ builder, [[Klais Orgelbau|Klais]].\n\n==Sport==\nHaileybury is traditionally strong in [[rugby union]] and [[cricket]] and retains honours boards with every rugby and cricket first team since 1863. Sports for girls include hockey, netball, lacrosse, tennis and cricket, with newly developed teams in football and rugby union. In addition to rugby and cricket, boys play hockey, football and tennis. Boys and girls represent the school in athletics, squash, swimming, [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]], cross country, badminton, biathlon, basketball, rowing and sailing. The school previously contained [[fives]] courts, although this ceases to be the case.\n\n==Related schools==\n=== Haileybury Almaty ===\n{{main|Haileybury Almaty}}\nIn 2006/2007, Haileybury advised on the building of a Haileybury in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]] where all English GCSEs are taught and the curriculum is taught similarly under the guidance of Haileybury. The school, opened in September 2008, is known as Haileybury Almaty.\n\nThe pupils are made up mostly of Kazakhstan citizens. They are all required to speak English. Academic year 2010\u201311 saw the first batch of pupils pass their IGCSE exams. Since August 2011, Haileybury Almaty has opened a [[Sixth form|6th form]]. In 2016, 11 pupils graduated from the 6th form with one getting admission to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College, Cambridge University]], and 6 securing places in [[University College London|University College, London]] (UCL). A second school, in the Kazakhstan capital [[Astana]], was opened in September 2011.<ref>\n{{cite news \n | title = UK public school for Kazakhstan\n | publisher = [[BBC]]\n | date = 25 January 2007\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6297881.stm\n | accessdate = 12 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Haileybury Astana ===\n{{main|Haileybury Astana}}\nFollowing the foundation of Haileybury Almaty, a sister school was opened in 2008 in [[Astana]], the capital city of [[Kazakhstan]]. Haileybury Astana provides education for boys and girls from the two to eighteen years of age under the leadership of Jonathan Ullmer MBE. It is an [[IB World School]] and also operates the [[International Primary Curriculum]] (IPC).\n\nThe School has grown rapidly since it was opened by the [[President of Kazakhstan]]. In 2017, the new IB Centre was opened by the Minister of Education. By 2018, the school had close to 650 pupils.\n\n=== Haileybury Turnford ===\n{{main|Haileybury Turnford}}\nIn September 2015, Turnford School in [[Turnford, Hertfordshire|Turnford]], Hertfordshire converted to [[Academy (English school)|academy status]] and was renamed Haileybury Turnford. Haileybury College acts as the main sponsor of the school, and this is the first state-funded school to have links with Haileybury.\n\n== Model United Nations ==\n[[Model United Nations]] (MUN) is a popular extra-curricular activity pupils in the senior school. Throughout the year, groups of pupils are chosen to form delegations which meet two times per week outside of school hours to practise writing and debating resolutions. These pupils then travel to several MUN conferences in the UK and mainland Europe to debate their resolutions.\n\nHaileybury hosts their own Model United Nations Conferences conference every year (HMUN)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileyburymun.co.uk/|title=Haileybury MUN|website=haileyburymun.co.uk}}</ref> for nearly 900 pupils, making it largest MUN conference in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haileybury.com/news/uks-largest-model-united-nations-conference-to-be-held-at-haileybury|title=UK's largest Model United Nations conference to be held at Haileybury|date=14 March 2012}}</ref> The conference is typically held the weekend before the Easter holiday.\n\n== Notable former pupils ==\nPast pupils are known as [[:Category:People educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Old Haileyburians]].\n\nFor details of notable alumni see [[List of people educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Victoria Crosses by School]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.haileybury.com/ Haileybury web site]\n\n{{Schools in Hertfordshire|independent}}\n{{Listed buildings in Hertfordshire}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haileybury And Imperial Service College}}\n[[Category:Boarding schools in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1862]]\n[[Category:Independent schools in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:International Baccalaureate schools in England]]\n[[Category:Member schools of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]\n[[Category:Racquets venues]]\n[[Category:1862 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Arthur Blomfield buildings]]\n[[Category:Schools cricket]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=December 2019}}\n{{About|the school in England|the institution which occupied the same site from 1809 to 1858|East India Company College|the College's Australian counterpart|Haileybury, Melbourne}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox school\n | name                    = Haileybury and Imperial Service College\n | image                   = [[File:Haileybury crest.png]]\n | coordinates             = {{coord|51.7787|-0.033333|type:edu_region:GB_dim:100|format=dec|display=inline,title}}\n | motto                   = ''Sursum Corda''\n | motto_translation       = Lift up your Hearts\n | established             = 1862<br>Predecessor colleges were founded as follows:<br /> [[East India Company College]] \u2013 1806;<br /> [[Imperial Service College]] \u2013 1845;<br /> [[United Services College]] \u2013 1874''\n | closed                  = \n | type                    = [[Public school (United Kingdom)#Twentieth century | Public school]]<br>[[Independent school (UK)|Independent school]]<br>Boarding and day school\n | religion                = [[Church of England]]\n | president               = [[Bishop of St Albans]]\n | head_label              = Master\n | head                    = Martin Collier\n | r_head_label            = \n | r_head                  = \n | chair_label             = [[Visitor]]\n | chair                   = [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]\n | chairman_label          = Chairman of the Council\n | chairman                = Alan Pilgrim\n | founder                 = [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]]\n | specialist              = \n | address                 = \n | city                    = [[Hertford Heath]]\n | county                  = [[Hertfordshire]]\n | country                 = England\n | postcode                = SG13 7NU\n | local_authority         = \n | urn                     = 117607\n | ofsted                  = \n | staff                   = \n | enrolment               = c. 880 pupils\n | gender                  = Mixed (previously boys-only)\n | lower_age               = 11\n | upper_age               = 18\n | houses                  = 13\n | school_colors           = Magenta {{color box | #8B008B}}\n | slogan                  = Fear God, Honour the King\n | publication             = The Haileyburian<br>Hearts & Wings\n | free_label_1            = Alumni\n | free_1                  = [[:Category:People educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Old Haileyburians (OHs)]]\n | free_label_2            = School hymn\n | free_2                  = [[Lift Up Your Hearts!]]\n | free_label_3            = \n | free_3                  = \n | website                 = {{url|haileybury.com}}\n}}\n\n[[Image:Haileybury College.jpg|thumb|300px|Haileybury College]]\n'''Haileybury''' is an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] near [[Hertford]] in England.

It is known in the school as ''Obelisk'' and was designed by former pupil, [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]. The memorial on Terrace, originally built to commemorate those lost in the First World War, also designed by Sir Reginald, was unveiled by [[Alexander Godley|General Sir Alexander Godley]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|{{Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George}}]] on 7 July 1923.
