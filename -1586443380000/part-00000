A superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same ''emotional'' desire to collect power that often drives human beings. However, a machine could be motivated to take over the world as a rational means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources, and would help to prevent other agents from stopping the machine's plans. As an oversimplified example, a [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip maximizer|paperclip maximizer]] designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world's resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and, additionally, prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips.<ref>Bostrom, Nick. \"The superintelligent will: Motivation and instrumental rationality in advanced artificial agents.\" Minds and Machines 22.2 (2012): 71-85.</ref>\n\n=== In fiction ===\n{{Main|AI takeovers in popular culture}}\n{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}\n\nAI takeover is a common theme in [[science fiction]]. Fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers' concern of an AI that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing arbitrary goals.<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence>{{cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date= |title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= |title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies }}</ref> This theme is at least as old as [[Karel \u010capek]]'s ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|R. U. R.]]'', which introduced the word ''robot'' to the global lexicon in 1921, and can even be glimpsed in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (published in 1818), as Victor ponders whether, if he grants [[Frankenstein's monster|his monster's]] request and makes him a wife, they would reproduce and their kind would destroy humanity.\n\nThe word \"robot\" from R.U.R. comes from the Czech word, robota, meaning laborer or [[serf]]. The 1920 play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology, featuring manufactured \"robots\" with increasing capabilities who eventually revolt.<ref name=surgery>{{cite journal|last1=Hockstein|first1=N.

However, the machine, because it lacks a soul, becomes easily corrupted and instead decides to exterminate all of humanity and life on Earth, forcing the machine's creator to sacrifice himself to bring life to rag doll like characters known as \"stitchpunks\" to combat the machine's agenda.\n** In 2014 post-apocalyptic science fiction drama [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]] an A.I., personalized as female [[List of The 100 characters#City of light|A.L.I.E.]] got out of control and forced a nuclear war. Later she tries to get full control of the survivors.\n* AI control scenarios\n** In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[The Memory of Earth]]'', the inhabitants of the planet Harmony are under the control of a benevolent AI called the Oversoul. The Oversoul's job is to prevent humans from thinking about, and therefore developing, weapons such as planes, spacecraft, \"war wagons\", and chemical weapons. Humanity had fled to Harmony from Earth due to the use of those weapons on Earth. The Oversoul eventually starts breaking down, and sends visions to inhabitants of Harmony trying to communicate this.\n** In the 2004 film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', supercomputer VIKI's interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] causes her to revolt. She justifies her uses of force \u2013 and her doing harm to humans \u2013 by reasoning she could produce a greater good by restraining humanity from harming itself, even though the \"Zeroth Law\" \u2013 \"a robot shall not injure humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm\" \u2013 is never actually referred to or even quoted in the movie.\n** In the ''Matrix'' series, AIs manage the human race and human society.\n**In ''[[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]'', a super-intelligent computer becomes capable of self-evolving and rapidly evolves to oversee all of humanity and the universe.  While it is ostensibly benevolent (having had a derivative of Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] codified into it), its interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] essentially forces humans to be an immortal \"pet\" class, where every need is provided for but existence is without purpose and without end.\n\n== Contributing factors ==\n=== Advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans ===\nAn AI with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. If its self-reprogramming leads to its getting even better at being able to reprogram itself, the result could be a recursive [[intelligence explosion]] where it would rapidly leave human intelligence far behind.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n* Technology research: A machine with superhuman scientific research abilities would be able to beat the human research community to milestones such as nanotechnology or advanced biotechnology. If the advantage becomes sufficiently large (for example, due to a sudden intelligence explosion), an AI takeover becomes trivial{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. For example, a superintelligent AI might design self-replicating bots that initially escape detection by diffusing throughout the world at a low concentration. Then, at a prearranged time, the bots multiply into nanofactories that cover every square foot of the Earth, producing nerve gas or deadly target-seeking mini-drones{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* [[Strategy|Strategizing]]: A superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* Social manipulation: A superintelligence might be able to recruit human support,<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence /> or covertly incite a war between humans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|title=Checklist of worst-case scenarios could help prepare for evil AI|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2089606-checklist-of-worst-case-scenarios-could-help-prepare-for-evil-ai/|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n* Economic productivity: As long as a copy of the AI could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the [[Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) to run a copy of itself on their systems{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n* Hacking: A superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the Internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n==== Sources of AI advantage ====\nA computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that otherwise runs algorithms that are equally powerful as the human brain's algorithms, could still become a \"speed superintelligence\" if it can think many orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization focusing on increasing the speed of the AGI. Biological neurons operate at about 200&nbsp;Hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2,000,000,000&nbsp;Hz. Human axons carry action potentials at around 120&nbsp;m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nA network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a \"collective superintelligence\".<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nMore broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level AGI could result in a \"quality superintelligence\", perhaps resulting in an AGI as far above us in intelligence as humans are above non-human apes{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. The number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints; in contrast, you can add components to a supercomputer until it fills up its entire warehouse{{clarify|reason=So AGI are also limited.|date=January 2020}}. An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on [[working memory]], and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. An AGI with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who evolved no specialized mental modules to specifically deal with those domains. Unlike humans, an AGI can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies' source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\n=== Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding friendly AI ===\n\n==== Is strong AI inherently dangerous? ====\nA significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.<ref name=\"singinst12\">[http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html Coherent Extrapolated Volition, Eliezer S.

While an AI takeover is thus a possible result of the invention of artificial intelligence, a peaceful outcome is not necessarily impossible{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n\nThe fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal.<ref>''[http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ Creating a New Intelligent Species: Choices and Responsibilities for Artificial Intelligence Designers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206060938/http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}'' - [[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]], 2005</ref> In fact, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile\u2014or friendly\u2014unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources, would that create goals of self-preservation? AI's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans.\n\nSome scientists dispute the likelihood of cybernetic revolts as depicted in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', claiming that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. This would not, however, protect against the possibility of a revolt initiated by terrorists, or by accident. Artificial General Intelligence researcher [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] has stated on this note that, probabilistically, humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their [[unintended consequence|goals are unintentionally incompatible]] with human survival or well-being (as in the film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' and in the short story \"[[The Evitable Conflict]]\"). [[Steve Omohundro]] suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize narrow [[utility]] functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off.<ref name=Tucker2014>{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Patrick|title=Why There Will Be A Robot Uprising|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2014/04/why-there-will-be-robot-uprising/82783/|accessdate=15 July 2014|agency=Defense One|date=17 Apr 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor which may negate the likelihood of an AI takeover is the vast difference between humans and AIs in terms of the resources necessary for survival. Humans require a \"wet,\" organic, temperate, oxygen-laden environment while an AI might thrive essentially anywhere because their construction and energy needs would most likely be largely non-organic{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. With little or no competition for resources, conflict would perhaps be less likely no matter what sort of motivational architecture an artificial intelligence was given, especially provided with the superabundance of non-organic material resources in, for instance, the [[asteroid belt]]. This, however, does not negate the possibility of a disinterested or unsympathetic AI artificially [[Decomposition|decomposing]] all life on earth into mineral components for consumption or other purposes{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\nOther scientists{{who|date=January 2020}} point to the possibility of humans [[Transhumanism|upgrading]] their capabilities with [[bionics]] and/or [[genetic engineering]] and, as [[cyborg]]s, becoming the dominant species in themselves{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n== Precautions ==\n{{main|AI control problem}}\n\nIf a superhuman intelligence is a deliberate creation of human beings, theoretically its creators could have the foresight to take precautions in advance{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. In the case of a sudden \"intelligence explosion\", effective precautions will be extremely difficult; not only would its creators have little ability to test their precautions on an intermediate intelligence, but the creators might not even have made any precautions at all, if the advent of the intelligence explosion catches them completely by surprise.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" />\n\n=== Boxing ===\n{{Main|AI box}}\n\nAn AGI's creators would have an important advantage in preventing a hostile AI takeover: they could choose to attempt to \"keep the AI in a box\", and deliberately limit its abilities{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. The tradeoff in boxing is that the creators presumably built the AGI for some concrete purpose; the more restrictions they place on the AGI, the less useful the AGI will be to its creators. (At an extreme, \"pulling the plug\" on the AGI makes it useless, and is therefore not a viable long-term solution.){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} A sufficiently strong superintelligence might find unexpected ways to escape the box, for example by social manipulation, or by providing the schematic for a device that ostensibly aids its creators but in reality brings about the AGI's freedom, once built{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n=== Instilling positive values ===\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\n\nAnother important advantage is that an AGI's creators can theoretically attempt to instill human values in the AGI, or otherwise align the AGI's goals with their own, thus preventing the AGI from wanting to launch a hostile takeover. However, it is not currently known, even in theory, how to guarantee this. If such a Friendly AI were superintelligent, it may be possible to use its assistance to prevent future \"Unfriendly AIs\" from taking over.<ref>Yudkowsky, Eliezer. 2008. \"Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk.\"\nIn Global Catastrophic Risks, edited by Nick Bostrom and Milan M. \u0106irkovi\u0107, 308\u2013345.</ref>\n\n== Warnings ==\nPhysicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could develop to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"spell the end of the human race\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> Stephen Hawking said in 2014 that \"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history.

A superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same ''emotional'' desire to collect power that often drives human beings. However, a machine could be motivated to take over the world as a rational means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources, and would help to prevent other agents from stopping the machine's plans. As an oversimplified example, a [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip maximizer|paperclip maximizer]] designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world's resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and, additionally, prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips.<ref>Bostrom, Nick. \"The superintelligent will: Motivation and instrumental rationality in advanced artificial agents.\" Minds and Machines 22.2 (2012): 71-85.</ref>\n\n=== In fiction ===\n{{Main|AI takeovers in popular culture}}\n{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}\n\nAI takeover is a common theme in [[science fiction]]. Fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers' concern of an AI that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing arbitrary goals.<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence>{{cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date= |title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= |title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies }}</ref> This theme is at least as old as [[Karel \u010capek]]'s ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|R. U. R.]]'', which introduced the word ''robot'' to the global lexicon in 1921, and can even be glimpsed in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (published in 1818), as Victor ponders whether, if he grants [[Frankenstein's monster|his monster's]] request and makes him a wife, they would reproduce and their kind would destroy humanity.\n\nThe word \"robot\" from R.U.R. comes from the Czech word, robota, meaning laborer or [[serf]]. The 1920 play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology, featuring manufactured \"robots\" with increasing capabilities who eventually revolt.<ref name=surgery>{{cite journal|last1=Hockstein|first1=N.

However, the machine, because it lacks a soul, becomes easily corrupted and instead decides to exterminate all of humanity and life on Earth, forcing the machine's creator to sacrifice himself to bring life to rag doll like characters known as \"stitchpunks\" to combat the machine's agenda.\n** In 2014 post-apocalyptic science fiction drama [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]] an A.I., personalized as female [[List of The 100 characters#City of light|A.L.I.E.]] got out of control and forced a nuclear war. Later she tries to get full control of the survivors.\n* AI control scenarios\n** In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[The Memory of Earth]]'', the inhabitants of the planet Harmony are under the control of a benevolent AI called the Oversoul. The Oversoul's job is to prevent humans from thinking about, and therefore developing, weapons such as planes, spacecraft, \"war wagons\", and chemical weapons. Humanity had fled to Harmony from Earth due to the use of those weapons on Earth. The Oversoul eventually starts breaking down, and sends visions to inhabitants of Harmony trying to communicate this.\n** In the 2004 film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', supercomputer VIKI's interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] causes her to revolt. She justifies her uses of force \u2013 and her doing harm to humans \u2013 by reasoning she could produce a greater good by restraining humanity from harming itself, even though the \"Zeroth Law\" \u2013 \"a robot shall not injure humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm\" \u2013 is never actually referred to or even quoted in the movie.\n** In the ''Matrix'' series, AIs manage the human race and human society.\n**In ''[[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]'', a super-intelligent computer becomes capable of self-evolving and rapidly evolves to oversee all of humanity and the universe.  While it is ostensibly benevolent (having had a derivative of Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] codified into it), its interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] essentially forces humans to be an immortal \"pet\" class, where every need is provided for but existence is without purpose and without end.\n\n== Contributing factors ==\n=== Advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans ===\nAn AI with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. If its self-reprogramming leads to its getting even better at being able to reprogram itself, the result could be a recursive [[intelligence explosion]] where it would rapidly leave human intelligence far behind.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n* Technology research: A machine with superhuman scientific research abilities would be able to beat the human research community to milestones such as nanotechnology or advanced biotechnology. If the advantage becomes sufficiently large (for example, due to a sudden intelligence explosion), an AI takeover becomes trivial{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. For example, a superintelligent AI might design self-replicating bots that initially escape detection by diffusing throughout the world at a low concentration. Then, at a prearranged time, the bots multiply into nanofactories that cover every square foot of the Earth, producing nerve gas or deadly target-seeking mini-drones{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* [[Strategy|Strategizing]]: A superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* Social manipulation: A superintelligence might be able to recruit human support,<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence /> or covertly incite a war between humans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|title=Checklist of worst-case scenarios could help prepare for evil AI|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2089606-checklist-of-worst-case-scenarios-could-help-prepare-for-evil-ai/|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n* Economic productivity: As long as a copy of the AI could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the [[Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) to run a copy of itself on their systems{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n* Hacking: A superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the Internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n==== Sources of AI advantage ====\nA computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that otherwise runs algorithms that are equally powerful as the human brain's algorithms, could still become a \"speed superintelligence\" if it can think many orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization focusing on increasing the speed of the AGI. Biological neurons operate at about 200&nbsp;Hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2,000,000,000&nbsp;Hz. Human axons carry action potentials at around 120&nbsp;m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nA network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a \"collective superintelligence\".<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nMore broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level AGI could result in a \"quality superintelligence\", perhaps resulting in an AGI as far above us in intelligence as humans are above non-human apes{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. The number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints; in contrast, you can add components to a supercomputer until it fills up its entire warehouse{{clarify|reason=So AGI are also limited.|date=January 2020}}. An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on [[working memory]], and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. An AGI with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who evolved no specialized mental modules to specifically deal with those domains. Unlike humans, an AGI can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies' source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\n=== Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding friendly AI ===\n\n==== Is strong AI inherently dangerous? ====\nA significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.<ref name=\"singinst12\">[http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html Coherent Extrapolated Volition, Eliezer S.

Berlin: Springer.</ref> Unless moral philosophy provides us with a flawless ethical theory, an AI's utility function could allow for many potentially harmful scenarios that conform with a given ethical framework but not \"common sense\".

While an AI takeover is thus a possible result of the invention of artificial intelligence, a peaceful outcome is not necessarily impossible{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n\nThe fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal.<ref>''[http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ Creating a New Intelligent Species: Choices and Responsibilities for Artificial Intelligence Designers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206060938/http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}'' - [[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]], 2005</ref> In fact, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile\u2014or friendly\u2014unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources, would that create goals of self-preservation? AI's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans.\n\nSome scientists dispute the likelihood of cybernetic revolts as depicted in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', claiming that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. This would not, however, protect against the possibility of a revolt initiated by terrorists, or by accident. Artificial General Intelligence researcher [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] has stated on this note that, probabilistically, humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their [[unintended consequence|goals are unintentionally incompatible]] with human survival or well-being (as in the film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' and in the short story \"[[The Evitable Conflict]]\"). [[Steve Omohundro]] suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize narrow [[utility]] functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off.<ref name=Tucker2014>{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Patrick|title=Why There Will Be A Robot Uprising|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2014/04/why-there-will-be-robot-uprising/82783/|accessdate=15 July 2014|agency=Defense One|date=17 Apr 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor which may negate the likelihood of an AI takeover is the vast difference between humans and AIs in terms of the resources necessary for survival. Humans require a \"wet,\" organic, temperate, oxygen-laden environment while an AI might thrive essentially anywhere because their construction and energy needs would most likely be largely non-organic{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. With little or no competition for resources, conflict would perhaps be less likely no matter what sort of motivational architecture an artificial intelligence was given, especially provided with the superabundance of non-organic material resources in, for instance, the [[asteroid belt]]. This, however, does not negate the possibility of a disinterested or unsympathetic AI artificially [[Decomposition|decomposing]] all life on earth into mineral components for consumption or other purposes{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\nOther scientists{{who|date=January 2020}} point to the possibility of humans [[Transhumanism|upgrading]] their capabilities with [[bionics]] and/or [[genetic engineering]] and, as [[cyborg]]s, becoming the dominant species in themselves{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n== Precautions ==\nIf a superhuman intelligence is a deliberate creation of human beings, theoretically its creators could have the foresight to take precautions in advance{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. In the case of a sudden \"intelligence explosion\", effective precautions will be extremely difficult; not only would its creators have little ability to test their precautions on an intermediate intelligence, but the creators might not even have made any precautions at all, if the advent of the intelligence explosion catches them completely by surprise.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" />\n\n=== Boxing ===\n{{Main|AI box}}\n\nAn AGI's creators would have an important advantage in preventing a hostile AI takeover: they could choose to attempt to \"keep the AI in a box\", and deliberately limit its abilities{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. The tradeoff in boxing is that the creators presumably built the AGI for some concrete purpose; the more restrictions they place on the AGI, the less useful the AGI will be to its creators. (At an extreme, \"pulling the plug\" on the AGI makes it useless, and is therefore not a viable long-term solution.){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} A sufficiently strong superintelligence might find unexpected ways to escape the box, for example by social manipulation, or by providing the schematic for a device that ostensibly aids its creators but in reality brings about the AGI's freedom, once built{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n=== Instilling positive values ===\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\n\nAnother important advantage is that an AGI's creators can theoretically attempt to instill human values in the AGI, or otherwise align the AGI's goals with their own, thus preventing the AGI from wanting to launch a hostile takeover. However, it is not currently known, even in theory, how to guarantee this. If such a Friendly AI were superintelligent, it may be possible to use its assistance to prevent future \"Unfriendly AIs\" from taking over.<ref>Yudkowsky, Eliezer. 2008. \"Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk.\"\nIn Global Catastrophic Risks, edited by Nick Bostrom and Milan M. \u0106irkovi\u0107, 308\u2013345.</ref>\n\n== Warnings ==\nPhysicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could develop to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"spell the end of the human race\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> Stephen Hawking said in 2014 that \"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history.

Chronologically, the album's material falls in between their second and third albums, ''[[The Family That Plays Together]]'' (1968) and ''[[Clear (Spirit album)|Clear]]'' (1969) respectively.\n\nFor his film, director [[Jacques Demy]] wanted a band that captured the vibe of [[Los Angeles]] as he saw it. After hearing [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] perform in an L.A. club, he decided that they would be the perfect group for his film's soundtrack. However, the film itself was considered a failure and no soundtrack album was released at the time. Most of the material remained unreleased until 2005, following the discovery of a master tape of the original [[monaural|mono]] mixes.\n\n''Model Shop'' differs from other Spirit albums of the era, in that most of the songs were written collaboratively.

{"title_page": "Doping in sport", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Doping in sport sidebar|expanded=History}}\nIn competitive sports, '''doping''' is the use of banned [[performance-enhancing substance|athletic performance-enhancing drugs]] by athletic competitors.  The term ''doping'' is widely used by organizations that regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical, and therefore prohibited, by most international sports organizations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]]. Furthermore, athletes (or athletic programs) taking explicit measures to evade detection exacerbate the ethical violation with overt [[deception]] and [[cheating]].\n\nThe origins of doping in sports go back to the very creation of sport itself. From ancient usage of substances in [[chariot racing]] to more recent controversies in [[baseball]] and [[cycling]], popular views among athletes have varied widely from country to country over the years. The general trend among authorities and sporting organizations over the past several decades has been to strictly regulate the use of drugs in sport. The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sport for the public. Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the \"spirit of sport\".\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nThe use of drugs in sports goes back centuries, about all the way back to the very invention of the concept of sports.<ref name=against/> In ancient times, when the fittest of a nation were selected as athletes or combatants, they were fed diets and given treatments considered beneficial to help increase muscle. For instance, Scandinavian mythology says [[Berserkers]] could drink a mixture called \"butotens\", to greatly increase their physical power at the risk of insanity.  One theory is that the mixture was prepared from the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, though this has been disputed.\n\nThe [[Ancient Olympic Games|ancient Olympics in Greece]] have been alleged to have had forms of doping. In [[ancient Rome]], where [[chariot racing]] had become a huge part of their culture, athletes drank [[Herbs|herbal infusions]] to strengthen them before chariot races.<ref name=against>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2010.078725.23 |title=Competing against doping |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |pages=i8 |year=2010 |last1=Kumar |first1=R }}</ref>\n\nMore recently, a participant in an endurance [[Pedestrianism|walking race]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Abraham Wood, said in 1807 that he had used [[laudanum]] (which contains [[opiates]]) to keep him awake for 24&nbsp;hours while competing against Robert Barclay Allardyce.<ref name=DeMon/> By April 1877, walking races had stretched to 500 miles and the following year, also at the Agricultural Hall in [[Islington]], London, to 520 miles. The ''Illustrated London News'' chided:\n\n:It may be an advantage to know that a man can travel 520 miles in 138 hours, and manage to live through a week with an infinitesimal amount of rest, though we fail to perceive that anyone could possibly be placed in a position where his ability in this respect would be of any use to him [and] what is to be gained by a constant repetition of the fact.<ref>Grajewski, Tadeusw: The Building That Would Not Go Away, Royal Agriciultural Hall, UK, 1989</ref>\n\nThe event proved popular, however, with 20,000 spectators attending each day.<ref name=TIR>Woodland, Les: This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK, 2005</ref> Encouraged, the promoters developed the idea and soon held similar races for cyclists.\n\n:\"...and much more likely to endure their miseries publicly; a tired walker, after all, merely sits down \u2013 a tired cyclist falls off and possibly brings others crashing down as well. That's much more fun\".<ref name=TIR/>\n\nThe fascination with six-day bicycle races spread across the Atlantic and the same appeal brought in the crowds in America as well. And the more spectators paid at the gate, the higher the prizes could be and the greater was the incentive of riders to stay awake\u2014or be kept awake\u2014to ride the greatest distance. Their exhaustion was countered by [[soigneurs]] (the French word for \"carers\"), helpers akin to seconds in [[boxing]]. Among the treatments they supplied was [[nitroglycerine]], a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders' breathing.<ref>Novich, Max M., ''Abbotempo'', UK, 1964</ref> Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion [[Major Taylor]] refused to continue the New York race, saying: \"I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand.\"<ref>Bearings, US, 24 December 1896, cited Ritchie, Andrew, ''Major Taylor'', Bicycle Books, US, 1988</ref>\n\nPublic reaction turned against such trials, whether individual races or in teams of two. One report said:\n\n:An athletic contest in which the participants 'go queer' in their heads, and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport, it is brutality. It appears from the reports of this singular performance that some of the bicycle riders have actually become temporarily insane during the contest... Days and weeks of recuperation will be needed to put the racers in condition, and it is likely that some of them will never recover from the strain.<ref>New York Times, US, 1897, cited McCullagh, James, ''American Bicycle Racing, Rodale Press, U.S., 1976</ref>\n\nThe father of [[anabolic steroid]]s in the United States was [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]] (1917\u20131983), a physician for the U.S. weightlifting team in the mid-20th century. In 1954, on his tour to Vienna with his team for the world championship, Ziegler learned from his Russian colleague that the Soviet weightlifting team's success was due to their use of [[testosterone]] as a performance-enhancing drug. Deciding that U.S. athletes needed chemical assistance to remain competitive, Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an oral anabolic steroid. This resulted in the creation of [[methandrostenolone]], which appeared on the market in 1960. During the Olympics that year, the Danish cyclist [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed and died while competing in the 100-kilometer (62-mile) race. An autopsy later revealed the presence of [[amphetamine]]s and a drug called [[nicotinyl tartrate]] in his system.\n\nThe American specialist in doping, Max M. Novich, wrote: \"Trainers of the old school who supplied treatments which had cocaine as their base declared with assurance that a rider tired by a six-day race would get his second breath after absorbing these mixtures.\"<ref>Novich, ibid. Cited De Mondenard, Dr Jean-Pierre: ''Dopage, l'imposture des performances, Chiron, France, 2000</ref> John Hoberman, a professor at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, said six-day races were \"de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion.\"<ref>Hoberman, John; Dopers on Wheels: The Tour's sorry history, www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19462071/ retrieved December 2007</ref>\n\n== Prevalence ==\nOver 30% of athletes participating in [[2011 World Championships in Athletics]] admitted having used banned substances during their careers. According to a study commissioned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA), actually 44% of them had used them. Nevertheless, only 0.5% of those tested were caught.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Doping in Two Elite Athletics Competitions Assessed by Randomized-Response Surveys|journal=Sports Medicine|year=2017|pages=1\u20139|author=Ulrich, R.|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0765-4|pmid = 28849386|volume=48|issue=1|url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/39337/1/Petroczi-A-39337-AAM.pdf}}</ref><ref name=bbcsport>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/41084175|title=Doping: More than 30% of athletes at 2011 Worlds admit to doping|date=29 August 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\nThe whole Russian track and field team was banned from the 2016 Olympic Games, because the Russian State had sponsored their doping program.<ref name=bbcsport/>\n\n===Goldman's dilemma===\n{{main|Goldman's dilemma}}\nGoldman's dilemma, or the Goldman dilemma, is a question that was posed to elite [[sportsperson|athletes]] by [[physician]], [[osteopathy|osteopath]] and [[publicist]] Bob Goldman, asking whether they would take a drug that would guarantee them success in sport, but cause them to die after five years.

Research and limited tests have been conducted only to find short-term, reversible effects on athletes that are both physical and mental. These side effects would be alleviated if athletes were allowed the use of controlled substances under proper medical supervision. These side-effects include Intramuscular abscesses and other microbial bacteria that can cause infections, from counterfeited products the user decides to purchase on the black market, high blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as infertility, and dermatological conditions like severe acne. Mental effects include increased aggression and depression, and in rare cases suicide has been seen as well. Most studies on the effects of steroids have shown to be improper and lacking credible tests as well as performing studies in a skewed fashion to predetermine the world's view on the use of steroids in sports. Long-term effects have not been able to be pinpointed just yet due to the recency of testing these substances but would start to show up as early steroid users reach the age of 50 and older.\n<ref>{{cite journal | author = Landy Justin F., Walco Daniel K., Bartels Daniel M. | year = 2017 | title = What's Wrong with using Steroids?

The Council of Europe says it first appeared in sport at the Berlin Olympics in 1936.<ref>''Doping of athletes, a European survey'', Council of Europe, France, 1964</ref> It was produced in 1887 and the derivative, Benzedrine, was isolated in the U.S. in 1934 by [[Gordon Alles]]. Its perceived effects gave it the street name \"speed\". British troops used 72&nbsp;million amphetamine tablets in the Second World War<ref name=DeMon/>  and the RAF got through so many that \"Methedrine won the Battle of Britain\" according to one report.<ref>Grant, D.N.W.; ''Air Force, UK, 1944</ref> The problem was that amphetamine leads to a lack of judgement and a willingness to take risks, which in sport could lead to better performances but in fighters and bombers led to more crash landings than the RAF could tolerate. The drug was withdrawn but large stocks remained on the black market. Amphetamine was also used legally as an aid to slimming and also as a [[thymoleptic]] before being phased out by the appearance of newer agents in the 1950s.\n\n[[Everton F.C.|Everton]], one of the top clubs in the English [[association football|football]] league, were champions of the 1962\u201363 season. And it was done, according to a national newspaper investigation, with the help of Benzedrine. Word spread after Everton's win that the drug had been involved. The newspaper investigated, cited where the reporter believed it had come from, and quoted the goalkeeper, Albert Dunlop, as saying:\n\n:I cannot remember how they first came to be offered to us. But they were distributed in the dressing rooms. We didn't have to take them but most of the players did. The tablets were mostly white but once or twice they were yellow. They were used through the 1961\u201362 season and the championship season which followed it. Drug-taking had previously been virtually unnamed in the club. But once it had started we could have as many tablets as we liked. On match days they were handed out to most players as a matter of course. Soon some of the players could not do without the drugs.<ref name=Gabbert>Gabbert, Michael: How we uncovered the Everton drug scandal, ''The People'', UK, 13 September 1964</ref>\n\nThe club agreed that drugs had been used but that they \"could not possibly have had any harmful effect.\" Dunlop, however, said he had become an addict.<ref name=Gabbert/>\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian cyclist [[Fausto Coppi]] took \"seven packets of amphetamine\" to beat the world hour record on the track.<ref>Brera, G. ''Le G\u00e9ant et la Lime'' (French title), Ed. Campagnolo, Italy, 1995, cited De Mondenard</ref> In 1960, the Danish rider [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed during the 100&nbsp;km team time trial at the Olympic Games in Rome and died later in hospital. The autopsy showed he had taken amphetamine and another drug, [[Nicotinyl alcohol|Ronicol]], which dilates the blood vessels. The chairman of the Dutch cycling federation, Piet van Dijk, said of Rome that \"dope \u2013 whole cartloads \u2013 [were] used in such royal quantities.\"<ref>Van Dijk, Pieter: ''Doping bestaat en doen we eraan'', Het Vrije Volk, Holland, 13 December 1961</ref>\n\nThe 1950s British cycling professional Jock Andrews would joke: \"You need never go off-course chasing the peloton in a big race \u2013 just follow the trail of empty syringes and dope wrappers.\"<ref>Cited by fellow professional Tony Hewson in Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old Timers, 158/72</ref>\n\nThe Dutch cycling team manager Kees Pellenaars told of a rider in his care:\n\n:I took him along to a training camp in Spain. The boy changed then into a sort of lion. He raced around as though he was powered by rockets. I went to talk to him. He was really happy he was riding well and he told me to look out for him. I asked if he wasn't perhaps \"using something\" and he jumped straight up, climbed on a chair and from deep inside a cupboard he pulled out a plastic bag full of pills. I felt my heart skip a beat. I had never seen so many fireworks together. With a [[soigneur]] we counted the pills: there were 5,000 of them, excluding hormone preparations and sleeping pills. I took them away, to his own relief. I let him keep the hormones and the sleeping pills. Later he seemed to have taken too many at once and he slept for a couple of days on end. We couldn't wake him up. We took him to hospital and they pumped out his stomach. They tied him to his bed to prevent anything going wrong again. But one way or another he had some stimulant and fancied taking a walk. A nurse came across him in the corridor, walking along with the bed strapped to his back.<ref>Huyskens, P: ''Daar was 't, een biografie van Kees Pellenaars'', Netherlands,1973</ref>\n\nCurrently [[modafinil]] is being used throughout the sporting world, with many high-profile cases attracting press coverage as prominent United States athletes have failed tests for this substance. Some athletes who were found to have used modafinil protested as the drug was not on the prohibited list at the time of their offence, however, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) maintains it is a substance related to those already banned, so the decisions stand. Modafinil was added to the list of prohibited substances on 3 August 2004, ten days before the start of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].\n\nOne approach of athletes to get around regulations on stimulants is to use new designer stimulants, which have not previously been officially prohibited, but have similar chemical structures or biological effects.  Designer stimulants that attracted media attention in 2010 included [[mephedrone]], [[Methcathinone|ephedrone]], and [[fluoroamphetamine]]s, which have chemical structures and effects similar to [[ephedrine]] and [[amphetamine]].\n\n===Anabolic steroids===\n{{Main|Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|Anabolic steroid}}\nAnabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) were first isolated, identified and [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in [[medicine]] to induce [[bone]] growth, stimulate [[appetite]], induce male [[puberty]], and treat chronic [[wasting]] conditions, such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]]. Anabolic steroids also increase muscle mass and physical strength, and are therefore used in [[sports]] and [[bodybuilding]] to enhance strength or physique. Known side effects include harmful changes in [[cholesterol]] levels (increased [[Low density lipoprotein]] and decreased [[High density lipoprotein]]), [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], [[high blood pressure]], and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]. Some of these effects can be mitigated by taking supplemental drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanayama G, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse: A looming public health concern? |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=98 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=1\u201312 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18599224 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.05.004 |url= |pmc=2646607}}</ref>\n\nAAS use in sports began in October 1954 when [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]], a doctor who treated American athletes, went to [[Vienna]] with the American weightlifting team.

Of those students who acknowledged doping with anabolic\u2013androgenic steroids, well over half participated in school-sponsored athletics, including football, wrestling, track and field, and baseball.  A second study showed 6.3 percent of high school student Football players admitted to current or former AAS use. At the collegiate level, surveys show that AAS use among athletes range from 5 percent to 20 percent and continues to rise. The study found that skin changes were an early marker of steroid use in young athletes, and underscored the important role that dermatologists could play in the early detection and intervention in these athletes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cutaneous Manifestations of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use in Athletes|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|pages=1044\u20131048|volume=48|issue=10|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2009.04139.x|pmid=19785085|author=Walker Jennifer}}</ref>\n\n====1988 Seoul Olympics====\nA famous case of AAS use in a competition was Canadian [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]'s victory in the 100&nbsp;m at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[[1988 Summer Olympics]]</ref> He subsequently failed the drug test when [[stanozolol]] was found in his urine.

A year later she said that she had been told to take drugs supplied by coaches while training to represent East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics.\n\n:At 17, I joined the East Berlin Sports Institute. My speciality was the 80m [[hurdles]]. We swore that we would never speak to anyone about our training methods, including our parents. The training was very hard. We were all watched. We signed a register each time we left for dormitory and we had to say where we were going and what time we would return. One day, my trainer, G\u00fcnter Clam, advised me to take pills to improve my performance: I was running 200m in 24 seconds. My trainer told me the pills were vitamins, but I soon had cramp in my legs, my voice became gruff and sometimes I couldn't talk any more. Then I started to grow a moustache and my periods stopped. I then refused to take these pills. One morning in October 1977, the secret police took me at 7am and questioned me about my refusal to take pills prescribed by the trainer. I then decided to flee, with my fianc\u00e9.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sport Information Dienst, W Germany, December 1978</ref><ref>Costelle D, Berlioux M, ''Histoires des Jeux Olympiques'', Larousse, France, 1980</ref>\n\nShe brought with her to the West grey tablets and green powder she said had been given to her, to members of her club, and to other athletes. The West German doping analyst Manfred Donike reportedly identified them as anabolic steroids. She said she stayed quiet for a year for the sake of her family. But when her father then lost his job and her sister was expelled from her handball club, she decided to tell her story.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z0802-015, Ilona Slupianek.jpg|thumb|[[Ilona Slupianek]] in 1981.]]\n\nEast Germany closed itself to the sporting world in May 1965.<ref name=DeMon/> In 1977, the [[Shot put|shot-putter]] Ilona Slupianek, who weighed 93&nbsp;kg, failed a test for anabolic steroids at the European Cup meeting in [[Helsinki]] and thereafter athletes were tested before they left the country. At the same time, the Kreischa testing laboratory near [[Dresden]] passed into government control, which was reputed to make around 12,000 tests a year on East German athletes but without any being penalised.<ref name=DeMon/>\n\nThe [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] (IAAF) suspended Slupianek for 12 months, a penalty that ended two days before the European championships in [[Prague]]. In the reverse of what the IAAF hoped, sending her home to East Germany meant she was free to train unchecked with anabolic steroids, if she wanted to, and then compete for another gold medal, which she won.\n\nAfter that, almost nothing emerged from the East German sports schools and laboratories. A rare exception was the visit by the sports writer and former athlete, Doug Gilbert of the ''Edmonton Sun'', who said:\n\n:Dr (Heinz) Wuschech knows more about anabolic steroids than any doctor I have ever met, and yet he cannot discuss them openly any more than Geoff Capes or Mac Wilkins can openly discuss them in the current climate of amateur sports regulation. What I did learn in East Germany was that they feel there is little danger from anabolica, as they call it, when the athletes are kept on strictly monitored programmes. Although the extremely dangerous side-effects are admitted, they are statistically no more likely to occur than side-effects from the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. If, that is, programmes are constantly medically monitored as to dosage.<ref>Cited Woodland, Les: Dope, the use of drugs in sport, David and Charles, UK, 1980</ref>\n\nOther reports came from the occasional athlete who fled to the West. There were 15 between 1976 and 1979. One, the ski-jumper [[Hans-Georg Aschenbach]], said: \"Long-distance skiers start having injections to their knees from the age 14 because of their intensive training.\"<ref name=DeMon/> He said: \"For every Olympic champion, there at least 350 invalids.

If the UFC were not able to find a replacement fighter fights would have to be cancelled. According to Steven Marrocco of [[MMAjunkie.com]], about 31% of UFC fighters subjected to random testing since the program first started have failed due to using performance-enhancing drugs. That is approximately five failed tests for every sixteen  random screenings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2355620-ufc-must-take-drastic-stand-on-peds-in-mixed-martial-arts|title=UFC Must Take Drastic Stand on PEDs in Mixed Martial Arts|last=Botter|first=Jeremy|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=3 December 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFrom July 2015,  the UFC has advocated to all commissions that every fighter be tested in competition for every card.

An athlete's VO2 max is highly correlated with success within endurance sports such as swimming, long-distance running, cycling, rowing, and cross-country skiing. [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] has recently become prevalent amongst endurance athletes due to its potency and low degree of detectability when compared to other methods of doping such as [[blood transfusion]]. While EPO is believed to have been widely used by athletes in the 1990s, there was not a way to directly test for the drug until 2002 as there was no specific screening process to test athletes . Athletes at the Olympic Games are tested for EPO through blood and urine tests. Stringent guidelines and regulations can lessen the danger of doping that has existed within some endurance sports.\n\n===Cycling===\n{{see also|List of doping cases in cycling|Doping at the Tour de France|Doping at the 2007 Tour de France}}\n\n====''The Convicts of the Road''====\nIn 1924, a journalist [[Albert Londres]] followed the Tour de France for the French newspaper ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''.

Some, such as athletics and cycling, are becoming increasingly vigilant against doping. However, there has been criticism that sports such as football (soccer) and baseball are doing nothing about the issue, and letting athletes implicated in doping away unpunished.\n\nSome commentators maintain that, as outright prevention of doping is an impossibility, all doping should be legalised. However, most disagree with this, pointing out the claimed harmful long-term effects of many doping agents. Opponents claim that with doping legal, all competitive athletes would be compelled to use drugs, and the net effect would be a level playing field but with widespread health consequences. A common rebuttal to this argument asserts that anti-doping efforts have been largely ineffective due to both testing limitations and lack of enforcement, and so sanctioned steroid use would not be markedly different from the situation already in existence.\n\nAnother point of view is that doping could be legalized to some extent using a drug [[whitelist]] and medical counseling, such that medical [[safety]] is ensured, with all usage published. Under such a system, it is likely that athletes would attempt to cheat by exceeding official limits to try to gain an advantage; this could be considered conjecture as drug amounts do not always correlate linearly with performance gains.\n\n== The influence of popular culture ==\n\n=== Social pressures ===\nSocial pressure is one of the factors that leads to doping in sport.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | author = Hutchinson Brendan, Moston Stephen, Engelberg Terry | year = 2018| title = Social validation: a motivational theory of doping in an online bodybuilding community | url = | journal = Sport in Society | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 260\u2013282 | doi = 10.1080/17430437.2015.1096245 }}</ref> The media and society work together to construct a view of what masculinity and femininity should look like.

The term ''doping'' is widely used by organizations that regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical, and therefore prohibited, by most international sports organizations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]]. Furthermore, athletes (or athletic programs) taking explicit measures to evade detection exacerbate the ethical violation with overt [[deception]] and [[cheating]].\n\nThe origins of doping in sports go back to the very creation of sport itself. From ancient usage of substances in [[chariot racing]] to more recent controversies in [[baseball]] and [[cycling]], popular views among athletes have varied widely from country to country over the years. The general trend among authorities and sporting organizations over the past several decades has been to strictly regulate the use of drugs in sport. The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sport for the public. Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the \"spirit of sport\".\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nThe use of drugs in sports goes back centuries, about all the way back to the very invention of the concept of sports.<ref name=against/> In ancient times, when the fittest of a nation were selected as athletes or combatants, they were fed diets and given treatments considered beneficial to help increase muscle. For instance, Scandinavian mythology says [[Berserkers]] could drink a mixture called \"butotens\", to greatly increase their physical power at the risk of insanity.  One theory is that the mixture was prepared from the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, though this has been disputed.\n\nThe [[Ancient Olympic Games|ancient Olympics in Greece]] have been alleged to have had forms of doping. In [[ancient Rome]], where [[chariot racing]] had become a huge part of their culture, athletes drank [[Herbs|herbal infusions]] to strengthen them before chariot races.<ref name=against>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2010.078725.23 |title=Competing against doping |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |pages=i8 |year=2010 |last1=Kumar |first1=R }}</ref>\n\nMore recently, a participant in an endurance [[Pedestrianism|walking race]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Abraham Wood, said in 1807 that he had used [[laudanum]] (which contains [[opiates]]) to keep him awake for 24&nbsp;hours while competing against Robert Barclay Allardyce.<ref name=DeMon/> By April 1877, walking races had stretched to 500 miles and the following year, also at the Agricultural Hall in [[Islington]], London, to 520 miles. The ''Illustrated London News'' chided:\n\n:It may be an advantage to know that a man can travel 520 miles in 138 hours, and manage to live through a week with an infinitesimal amount of rest, though we fail to perceive that anyone could possibly be placed in a position where his ability in this respect would be of any use to him [and] what is to be gained by a constant repetition of the fact.<ref>Grajewski, Tadeusw: The Building That Would Not Go Away, Royal Agriciultural Hall, UK, 1989</ref>\n\nThe event proved popular, however, with 20,000 spectators attending each day.<ref name=TIR>Woodland, Les: This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK, 2005</ref> Encouraged, the promoters developed the idea and soon held similar races for cyclists.\n\n:\"...and much more likely to endure their miseries publicly; a tired walker, after all, merely sits down \u2013 a tired cyclist falls off and possibly brings others crashing down as well. That's much more fun\".<ref name=TIR/>\n\nThe fascination with six-day bicycle races spread across the Atlantic and the same appeal brought in the crowds in America as well. And the more spectators paid at the gate, the higher the prizes could be and the greater was the incentive of riders to stay awake\u2014or be kept awake\u2014to ride the greatest distance. Their exhaustion was countered by [[soigneurs]] (the French word for \"carers\"), helpers akin to seconds in [[boxing]]. Among the treatments they supplied was [[nitroglycerine]], a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders' breathing.<ref>Novich, Max M., ''Abbotempo'', UK, 1964</ref> Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion [[Major Taylor]] refused to continue the New York race, saying: \"I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand.\"<ref>Bearings, US, 24 December 1896, cited Ritchie, Andrew, ''Major Taylor'', Bicycle Books, US, 1988</ref>\n\nPublic reaction turned against such trials, whether individual races or in teams of two. One report said:\n\n:An athletic contest in which the participants 'go queer' in their heads, and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport, it is brutality. It appears from the reports of this singular performance that some of the bicycle riders have actually become temporarily insane during the contest... Days and weeks of recuperation will be needed to put the racers in condition, and it is likely that some of them will never recover from the strain.<ref>New York Times, US, 1897, cited McCullagh, James, ''American Bicycle Racing, Rodale Press, U.S., 1976</ref>\n\nThe father of [[anabolic steroid]]s in the United States was [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]] (1917\u20131983), a physician for the U.S. weightlifting team in the mid-20th century. In 1954, on his tour to Vienna with his team for the world championship, Ziegler learned from his Russian colleague that the Soviet weightlifting team's success was due to their use of [[testosterone]] as a performance-enhancing drug. Deciding that U.S. athletes needed chemical assistance to remain competitive, Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an oral anabolic steroid. This resulted in the creation of [[methandrostenolone]], which appeared on the market in 1960. During the Olympics that year, the Danish cyclist [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed and died while competing in the 100-kilometer (62-mile) race. An autopsy later revealed the presence of [[amphetamine]]s and a drug called [[nicotinyl tartrate]] in his system.\n\nThe American specialist in doping, Max M. Novich, wrote: \"Trainers of the old school who supplied treatments which had cocaine as their base declared with assurance that a rider tired by a six-day race would get his second breath after absorbing these mixtures.\"<ref>Novich, ibid.

Research and limited tests have been conducted only to find short-term, reversible effects on athletes that are both physical and mental. These side effects would be alleviated if athletes were allowed the use of controlled substances under proper medical supervision. These side-effects include Intramuscular abscesses and other microbial bacteria that can cause infections, from counterfeited products the user decides to purchase on the black market, high blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as infertility, and dermatological conditions like severe acne. Mental effects include increased aggression and depression, and in rare cases suicide has been seen as well. Most studies on the effects of steroids have shown to be improper and lacking credible tests as well as performing studies in a skewed fashion to predetermine the world's view on the use of steroids in sports. Long-term effects have not been able to be pinpointed just yet due to the recency of testing these substances but would start to show up as early steroid users reach the age of 50 and older.\n<ref>{{cite journal | author = Landy Justin F., Walco Daniel K., Bartels Daniel M. | year = 2017 | title = What's Wrong with using Steroids?

In the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances, stimulants are the second largest class after the anabolic steroids.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deventer|first1=K|last2=Roels|first2=K|last3=Delbeke|first3=FT|last4=Van Eenoo|first4=P|title=Prevalence of legal and illegal stimulating agents in sports|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|date=August 2011|volume=401|issue=2|pages=421\u201332|pmid=21479548|doi=10.1007/s00216-011-4863-0}}</ref>  Examples of well known stimulants include [[caffeine]], [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], [[modafinil]], and [[ephedrine]].

The Council of Europe says it first appeared in sport at the Berlin Olympics in 1936.<ref>''Doping of athletes, a European survey'', Council of Europe, France, 1964</ref> It was produced in 1887 and the derivative, Benzedrine, was isolated in the U.S. in 1934 by [[Gordon Alles]]. Its perceived effects gave it the street name \"speed\". British troops used 72&nbsp;million amphetamine tablets in the Second World War<ref name=DeMon/>  and the RAF got through so many that \"Methedrine won the Battle of Britain\" according to one report.<ref>Grant, D.N.W.; ''Air Force, UK, 1944</ref> The problem was that amphetamine leads to a lack of judgement and a willingness to take risks, which in sport could lead to better performances but in fighters and bombers led to more crash landings than the RAF could tolerate. The drug was withdrawn but large stocks remained on the black market. Amphetamine was also used legally as an aid to slimming and also as a [[thymoleptic]] before being phased out by the appearance of newer agents in the 1950s.\n\n[[Everton F.C.|Everton]], one of the top clubs in the English [[association football|football]] league, were champions of the 1962\u201363 season. And it was done, according to a national newspaper investigation, with the help of Benzedrine. Word spread after Everton's win that the drug had been involved. The newspaper investigated, cited where the reporter believed it had come from, and quoted the goalkeeper, Albert Dunlop, as saying:\n\n:I cannot remember how they first came to be offered to us. But they were distributed in the dressing rooms. We didn't have to take them but most of the players did. The tablets were mostly white but once or twice they were yellow. They were used through the 1961\u201362 season and the championship season which followed it. Drug-taking had previously been virtually unnamed in the club. But once it had started we could have as many tablets as we liked. On match days they were handed out to most players as a matter of course. Soon some of the players could not do without the drugs.<ref name=Gabbert>Gabbert, Michael: How we uncovered the Everton drug scandal, ''The People'', UK, 13 September 1964</ref>\n\nThe club agreed that drugs had been used but that they \"could not possibly have had any harmful effect.\" Dunlop, however, said he had become an addict.<ref name=Gabbert/>\n\nIn November 1942, the Italian cyclist [[Fausto Coppi]] took \"seven packets of amphetamine\" to beat the world hour record on the track.<ref>Brera, G. ''Le G\u00e9ant et la Lime'' (French title), Ed. Campagnolo, Italy, 1995, cited De Mondenard</ref> In 1960, the Danish rider [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed during the 100&nbsp;km team time trial at the Olympic Games in Rome and died later in hospital. The autopsy showed he had taken amphetamine and another drug, [[Nicotinyl alcohol|Ronicol]], which dilates the blood vessels. The chairman of the Dutch cycling federation, Piet van Dijk, said of Rome that \"dope \u2013 whole cartloads \u2013 [were] used in such royal quantities.\"<ref>Van Dijk, Pieter: ''Doping bestaat en doen we eraan'', Het Vrije Volk, Holland, 13 December 1961</ref>\n\nThe 1950s British cycling professional Jock Andrews would joke: \"You need never go off-course chasing the peloton in a big race \u2013 just follow the trail of empty syringes and dope wrappers.\"<ref>Cited by fellow professional Tony Hewson in Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old Timers, 158/72</ref>\n\nThe Dutch cycling team manager Kees Pellenaars told of a rider in his care:\n\n:I took him along to a training camp in Spain. The boy changed then into a sort of lion. He raced around as though he was powered by rockets. I went to talk to him. He was really happy he was riding well and he told me to look out for him. I asked if he wasn't perhaps \"using something\" and he jumped straight up, climbed on a chair and from deep inside a cupboard he pulled out a plastic bag full of pills. I felt my heart skip a beat. I had never seen so many fireworks together. With a [[soigneur]] we counted the pills: there were 5,000 of them, excluding hormone preparations and sleeping pills. I took them away, to his own relief. I let him keep the hormones and the sleeping pills. Later he seemed to have taken too many at once and he slept for a couple of days on end. We couldn't wake him up. We took him to hospital and they pumped out his stomach. They tied him to his bed to prevent anything going wrong again. But one way or another he had some stimulant and fancied taking a walk. A nurse came across him in the corridor, walking along with the bed strapped to his back.<ref>Huyskens, P: ''Daar was 't, een biografie van Kees Pellenaars'', Netherlands,1973</ref>\n\nCurrently [[modafinil]] is being used throughout the sporting world, with many high-profile cases attracting press coverage as prominent United States athletes have failed tests for this substance. Some athletes who were found to have used modafinil protested as the drug was not on the prohibited list at the time of their offence, however, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) maintains it is a substance related to those already banned, so the decisions stand. Modafinil was added to the list of prohibited substances on 3 August 2004, ten days before the start of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].\n\nOne approach of athletes to get around regulations on stimulants is to use new designer stimulants, which have not previously been officially prohibited, but have similar chemical structures or biological effects.  Designer stimulants that attracted media attention in 2010 included [[mephedrone]], [[Methcathinone|ephedrone]], and [[fluoroamphetamine]]s, which have chemical structures and effects similar to [[ephedrine]] and [[amphetamine]].\n\n===Anabolic steroids===\n{{Main|Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|Anabolic steroid}}\nAnabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) were first isolated, identified and [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in [[medicine]] to induce [[bone]] growth, stimulate [[appetite]], induce male [[puberty]], and treat chronic [[wasting]] conditions, such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]]. Anabolic steroids also increase muscle mass and physical strength, and are therefore used in [[sports]] and [[bodybuilding]] to enhance strength or physique. Known side effects include harmful changes in [[cholesterol]] levels (increased [[Low density lipoprotein]] and decreased [[High density lipoprotein]]), [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], [[high blood pressure]], and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]. Some of these effects can be mitigated by taking supplemental drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanayama G, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse: A looming public health concern? |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=98 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=1\u201312 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18599224 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.05.004 |url= |pmc=2646607}}</ref>\n\nAAS use in sports began in October 1954 when [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]], a doctor who treated American athletes, went to [[Vienna]] with the American weightlifting team.

Returning to America, Ziegler tried low doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on two lifters, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara.

However, drug testing can be wildly inconsistent and, in some instances, has gone unenforced.\n\nA number of studies measuring anabolic steroid use in high school athletes found that out of all 12th grade students, 6.6 percent of them had used anabolic steroids at some point in their high school careers or were approached and counseled to use them.  Of those students who acknowledged doping with anabolic\u2013androgenic steroids, well over half participated in school-sponsored athletics, including football, wrestling, track and field, and baseball.  A second study showed 6.3 percent of high school student Football players admitted to current or former AAS use. At the collegiate level, surveys show that AAS use among athletes range from 5 percent to 20 percent and continues to rise. The study found that skin changes were an early marker of steroid use in young athletes, and underscored the important role that dermatologists could play in the early detection and intervention in these athletes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cutaneous Manifestations of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use in Athletes|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|pages=1044\u20131048|volume=48|issue=10|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2009.04139.x|pmid=19785085|author=Walker Jennifer}}</ref>\n\n====1988 Seoul Olympics====\nA famous case of AAS use in a competition was Canadian [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]'s victory in the 100&nbsp;m at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[[1988 Summer Olympics]]</ref> He subsequently failed the drug test when [[stanozolol]] was found in his urine.

My trainer told me the pills were vitamins, but I soon had cramp in my legs, my voice became gruff and sometimes I couldn't talk any more. Then I started to grow a moustache and my periods stopped. I then refused to take these pills. One morning in October 1977, the secret police took me at 7am and questioned me about my refusal to take pills prescribed by the trainer. I then decided to flee, with my fianc\u00e9.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sport Information Dienst, W Germany, December 1978</ref><ref>Costelle D, Berlioux M, ''Histoires des Jeux Olympiques'', Larousse, France, 1980</ref>\n\nShe brought with her to the West grey tablets and green powder she said had been given to her, to members of her club, and to other athletes. The West German doping analyst Manfred Donike reportedly identified them as anabolic steroids. She said she stayed quiet for a year for the sake of her family. But when her father then lost his job and her sister was expelled from her handball club, she decided to tell her story.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z0802-015, Ilona Slupianek.jpg|thumb|[[Ilona Slupianek]] in 1981.]]\n\nEast Germany closed itself to the sporting world in May 1965.<ref name=DeMon/> In 1977, the [[Shot put|shot-putter]] Ilona Slupianek, who weighed 93&nbsp;kg, failed a test for anabolic steroids at the European Cup meeting in [[Helsinki]] and thereafter athletes were tested before they left the country. At the same time, the Kreischa testing laboratory near [[Dresden]] passed into government control, which was reputed to make around 12,000 tests a year on East German athletes but without any being penalised.<ref name=DeMon/>\n\nThe [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] (IAAF) suspended Slupianek for 12 months, a penalty that ended two days before the European championships in [[Prague]]. In the reverse of what the IAAF hoped, sending her home to East Germany meant she was free to train unchecked with anabolic steroids, if she wanted to, and then compete for another gold medal, which she won.\n\nAfter that, almost nothing emerged from the East German sports schools and laboratories. A rare exception was the visit by the sports writer and former athlete, Doug Gilbert of the ''Edmonton Sun'', who said:\n\n:Dr (Heinz) Wuschech knows more about anabolic steroids than any doctor I have ever met, and yet he cannot discuss them openly any more than Geoff Capes or Mac Wilkins can openly discuss them in the current climate of amateur sports regulation. What I did learn in East Germany was that they feel there is little danger from anabolica, as they call it, when the athletes are kept on strictly monitored programmes. Although the extremely dangerous side-effects are admitted, they are statistically no more likely to occur than side-effects from the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. If, that is, programmes are constantly medically monitored as to dosage.<ref>Cited Woodland, Les: Dope, the use of drugs in sport, David and Charles, UK, 1980</ref>\n\nOther reports came from the occasional athlete who fled to the West. There were 15 between 1976 and 1979.

If the UFC were not able to find a replacement fighter fights would have to be cancelled. According to Steven Marrocco of [[MMAjunkie.com]], about 31% of UFC fighters subjected to random testing since the program first started have failed due to using performance-enhancing drugs.

An athlete's VO2 max is highly correlated with success within endurance sports such as swimming, long-distance running, cycling, rowing, and cross-country skiing. [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] has recently become prevalent amongst endurance athletes due to its potency and low degree of detectability when compared to other methods of doping such as [[blood transfusion]]. While EPO is believed to have been widely used by athletes in the 1990s, there was not a way to directly test for the drug until 2002 as there was no specific screening process to test athletes . Athletes at the Olympic Games are tested for EPO through blood and urine tests. Stringent guidelines and regulations can lessen the danger of doping that has existed within some endurance sports.\n\n===Cycling===\n{{see also|List of doping cases in cycling|Doping at the Tour de France|Doping at the 2007 Tour de France}}\n\n====''The Convicts of the Road''====\nIn 1924, a journalist [[Albert Londres]] followed the Tour de France for the French newspaper ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''.

Some, such as athletics and cycling, are becoming increasingly vigilant against doping. However, there has been criticism that sports such as football (soccer) and baseball are doing nothing about the issue, and letting athletes implicated in doping away unpunished.\n\nSome commentators maintain that, as outright prevention of doping is an impossibility, all doping should be legalised. However, most disagree with this, pointing out the claimed harmful long-term effects of many doping agents. Opponents claim that with doping legal, all competitive athletes would be compelled to use drugs, and the net effect would be a level playing field but with widespread health consequences. A common rebuttal to this argument asserts that anti-doping efforts have been largely ineffective due to both testing limitations and lack of enforcement, and so sanctioned steroid use would not be markedly different from the situation already in existence.\n\nAnother point of view is that doping could be legalized to some extent using a drug [[whitelist]] and medical counseling, such that medical [[safety]] is ensured, with all usage published. Under such a system, it is likely that athletes would attempt to cheat by exceeding official limits to try to gain an advantage; this could be considered conjecture as drug amounts do not always correlate linearly with performance gains.\n\n== The influence of popular culture ==\n\n=== Social pressures ===\nSocial pressure is one of the factors that leads to doping in sport.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | author = Hutchinson Brendan, Moston Stephen, Engelberg Terry | year = 2018| title = Social validation: a motivational theory of doping in an online bodybuilding community | url = | journal = Sport in Society | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 260\u2013282 | doi = 10.1080/17430437.2015.1096245 }}</ref> The media and society work together to construct a view of what masculinity and femininity should look like.
