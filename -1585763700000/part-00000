Dodge]] and his survey crew plotted the site now known as Cheyenne in [[Dakota Territory]] (later [[Wyoming Territory]]). This site was chosen as the point at which the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] crossed Crow Creek, a tributary of the [[South Platte River]]. The city was not named by Dodge, as his memoirs state, but rather by friends who accompanied him to the area Dodge called \"Crow Creek Crossing\".<ref name=city>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheyennecity.org/index.aspx?nid=133|title=History of Cheyenne|publisher=City of Cheyenne|accessdate=June 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124836/http://www.cheyennecity.org/index.aspx?NID=133|archive-date=April 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>  It was named for the American Indian [[Cheyenne]] tribe, one of the most famous and prominent [[Great Plains]] tribes closely allied with the [[Arapaho]].\n\nThe construction of the Union Pacific Railroad brought hopes of prosperity to the region when it reached Cheyenne on November 13, 1867. The population at the time numbered over 4,000, and grew rapidly.<ref name=city/> This rapid growth earned the city the nickname \"Magic City of the Plains\".<ref name=city/>\n\nIn 1867, [[Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming)|Fort D. A. Russell]] was established, three miles (5&nbsp;km) west of the city. The fort was later renamed [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base]].\n\nThe [[Wyoming State Capitol]] was constructed between 1886 and 1890, with further improvements being completed in 1917.\n\nThe [[Wyoming Stock Growers Association]] met at The Cheyenne Club, which allegedly acted as an interim government for the territory. Many of the WSGA's rules and regulations became state laws.\n\nThe [[Cheyenne Regional Airport]] was opened in 1920, initially serving as a stop for [[airmail]]. It soon developed into a civil-military airport, serving [[DC-3]]s and various military craft. During World War II, hundreds of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]], [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24s]], and [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBYs]] were outfitted and upgraded at the airfield. Today, it serves a number of military functions, as well as a high-altitude testbed for civilian craft.<ref name=LOC>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheyenneairport.com/history.asp|title=Cheyenne Regional Airport History|publisher=Cheyenne Regional Airport|accessdate=September 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002191812/http://www.cheyenneairport.com/history.asp|archive-date=October 2, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geography===\n[[File:Cheyenne Wyoming.jpg|thumb|right|Late-June 2003 view from the [[International Space Station]].]]\nLying near the southeast corner of the state, Cheyenne is one of the [[geographic centers of the United States|least centrally located]] state capitals in the nation (together with cities such as [[Carson City, Nevada]]; [[Juneau, Alaska]]; and [[Topeka, Kansas]]).\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|24.63|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|24.52|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.11|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nCheyenne, like most of the rest of Wyoming, has a [[Semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climate|cool semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''BSk''), and is part of USDA [[Hardiness zone]] 5b, with the suburbs falling in zone 5a.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=June 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|archive-date=February 27, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Winters are cold and moderately long, but relatively dry, with December, the coldest month, having a normal mean temperature of {{convert|27.7|\u00b0F|1}}, highs that fail to breach freezing occur 35 days per year, and lows dip to the {{convert|0|\u00b0F|0}} mark on 9.2 mornings.<ref name= NOAA /> However, the cold is often interrupted, with [[chinook wind]]s blowing downslope from the Rockies that can bring warm conditions, bringing the high above {{convert|50|\u00b0F|0}} on twenty days from December to February.<ref name= NOAA/>\n\nSnowfall is greatest in March and April, seasonally averaging {{convert|60|in|mm|}}, historically ranging from {{convert|13.1|in|mm|}} between July 1965 and June 1966 up to {{convert|121.5|in|mm|}} between July 1979 and June 1980, yet thick snow cover rarely stays.<ref name = \"NOAA \"/> Summers are warm, with a high [[diurnal temperature range]]; July averages {{convert|69.4|\u00b0F|1}}, and highs reach {{convert|90|\u00b0F|0}} on an average twelve afternoons annually.

Dodge]] and his survey crew plotted the site now known as Cheyenne in [[Dakota Territory]] (later [[Wyoming Territory]]). This site was chosen as the point at which the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] crossed Crow Creek, a tributary of the [[South Platte River]]. The city was not named by Dodge, as his memoirs state, but rather by friends who accompanied him to the area Dodge called \"Crow Creek Crossing\".<ref name=city>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheyennecity.org/index.aspx?nid=133|title=History of Cheyenne|publisher=City of Cheyenne|accessdate=June 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124836/http://www.cheyennecity.org/index.aspx?NID=133|archive-date=April 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>  It was named for the American Indian [[Cheyenne]] tribe, one of the most famous and prominent [[Great Plains]] tribes closely allied with the [[Arapaho]].\n\nThe construction of the Union Pacific Railroad brought hopes of prosperity to the region when it reached Cheyenne on November 13, 1867. The population at the time numbered over 4,000, and grew rapidly.<ref name=city/> This rapid growth earned the city the nickname \"Magic City of the Plains\".<ref name=city/>\n\nIn 1867, [[Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming)|Fort D. A. Russell]] was established, three miles (5&nbsp;km) west of the city. The fort was later renamed [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base]].\n\nThe [[Wyoming State Capitol]] was constructed between 1886 and 1890, with further improvements being completed in 1917.\n\nThe [[Wyoming Stock Growers Association]] met at The Cheyenne Club, which allegedly acted as an interim government for the territory. Many of the WSGA's rules and regulations became state laws.\n\nThe [[Cheyenne Regional Airport]] was opened in 1920, initially serving as a stop for [[airmail]]. It soon developed into a civil-military airport, serving [[DC-3]]s and various military craft. During World War II, hundreds of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]], [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24s]], and [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBYs]] were outfitted and upgraded at the airfield.
