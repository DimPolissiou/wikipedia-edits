[[Nanotechnology]], a relatively new field of [[science]] and [[engineering]], has shown promise to have a significant impact on the energy industry. Nanotechnology is defined as any technology that contains particles with one dimension under 100 nanometers in length. For scale, a single [[virus]] particle is about 100 nanometers wide.\n\nPeople in the fields of science and engineering have already begun developing ways of utilizing nanotechnology for the development of [[consumer]] products.  Benefits already observed from the design of these products are an increased efficiency of [[lighting]] and [[heating]], increased electrical storage capacity, and a decrease in the amount of [[pollution]] from the use of energy.  Benefits such as these make the investment of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in the [[research and development]] of nanotechnology a top priority.\n\n== Nanomaterials in Energy ==\nAccording to Dr. Wade Adams from Rice University, energy will be the most pressing problem facing humanity in the next 50 years and nanotechnology has potential to solve this issue.<ref>{{Citation|title=TEDxHouston 2011 - Wade Adams - Nanotechnology and Energy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GFst2IQBEM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>\n\nAn important sub-field of nanotechnology related to energy is [[nanofabrication]], the process of designing and creating devices on the nanoscale. The ability to create devices smaller than 100 nanometers opens many doors for the development of new ways to capture, store, and transfer energy.  Improvements in the precision of nanofabrication technologies are critical to solving many energy related problems that the world is currently facing.<ref name=\"Marshall 2018 p.70\">{{Cite book|last=Marshall|first=Hazell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ePEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=he+inherent+level+of+control+that+nanofabrication+could+give+scientists+and+engineers+would+be+critical+in+providing+the+capability+of+solving+many+of+the+problems+that+the+world+is+facing+today+related+to+the+current+generation+of+energy+technologies.&source=bl&ots=2NKteAu6BA&sig=ACfU3U2qLWbpJXvXeA9RLGClyumuk2D25A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVi7a9q4zpAhVIITQIHXkQDN4Q6AEwAHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=he%20inherent%20level%20of%20control%20that%20nanofabrication%20could%20give%20scientists%20and%20engineers%20would%20be%20critical%20in%20providing%20the%20capability%20of%20solving%20many%20of%20the%20problems%20that%20the%20world%20is%20facing%20today%20related%20to%20the%20current%20generation%20of%20energy%20technologies.&f=false|title=Environmental Nanotechnology|date=2018-11-21|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|isbn=978-1-83947-357-9|language=en |page=70}}</ref>\n\n=== Graphene-based Materials ===\nThere is enormous interest in the use of graphene-based materials for energy storage.

A family of graphene-related materials, called \"graphenes\" by the research community, consists of structural or chemical derivatives of graphene.<ref name=\"Pumera 2011\" /> The most important chemically derived graphene is graphene oxide (defined as single layer of graphite oxide),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Yanwu|last2=Murali|first2=Shanthi|last3=Cai|first3=Weiwei|last4=Li|first4=Xuesong|last5=Suk|first5=Ji Won|last6=Potts|first6=Jeffrey R.|last7=Ruoff|first7=Rodney S.|date=2010|title=Graphene and Graphene Oxide: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201001068|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=22|issue=35|pages=3906\u20133924|doi=10.1002/adma.201001068|issn=1521-4095}}</ref> which is usually prepared from graphite by oxidization to graphite oxide and consequent exfoliation.

They utilize silicon nanoparticles in order to absorb a greater range of [[wavelength]]s from the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This can be done by putting many identical and equally spaced silicon rods on the surface. Also, the height and length of spacing have to be optimized for reaching the best results. This arrangement of silicon particles allows solar energy to be reabsorbed by many different particles, exciting electrons and resulting in much of the energy being converted to heat. Researchers from Kyoto University have shown that these nano-scale semiconductors can increase efficiency by at least 40%, compared to the regular solar cells.<ref>{{Citation|title=How Nanotechnology is boosting Solar energy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2vvTPc30fE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Nanocellulose\u2010based Material ===\n[[Cellulose]] is the most abundant natural [[polymer]] on earth.

That means 2D nanomaterials can be easily modified and engineered on [[Nanostructure|nanostructures]]. 2D nanomaterials have a special structural feature which is interlayer space. Interlayer space provides a unique engineering option toward tuning their [[energy storage]] and catalytic properties. The interlayer space can also be manipulated for nonlayered materials and it can be called 2D nanofluidic channels. Also, 2D nanomaterials can be engineered into porous structures, then it can be used in energy stroage and catalytic applications by applying\u00a0facile charge and mass transport. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Yue|last2=Peng|first2=Lele|last3=Fang|first3=Zhiwei|last4=Yan|first4=Chunshuang|last5=Zhang|first5=Xiao|last6=Yu|first6=Guihua|date=2018|title=Structural Engineering of 2D Nanomaterials for Energy Storage and Catalysis|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/adma.201706347|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=30|issue=15|pages=1706347|doi=10.1002/adma.201706347|via=}}</ref>\n\n2D nanomaterials also have a few challenges. First, it happens on the property modification point of view. There are some side effects, such as activity and [[structural stability]], when a 2D structure is engineered. For example, creating some [[Defect|defects]] can increase [[Active site|active sites]] for a higher catalytic performance, but side reactions also happens and it may damage the catalyst structure. Another example is that interlayer expansion can lower ion [[diffusion barrier]] on the host, but it also can potentially lower the structural stability. Then, an equilibrium point between performance and stability has to be determined. The second one is mechanism understanding point of view. The fundamental rule of designing structure is not clear. For example, [[heterostructures]] are the main structures of catalyst in interlayer space and energy storage device, but these structures may lack interpretation on the [[catalytic reaction]] or charge storage mechanisms. A deeper understanding of 2D nanomaterial design must be required, because fundamental knowledge can provide a reasonable and efficient design. Third, it comes from the practical application. There is a huge gap between lab-scale and industry-scale. The reason is 2D nanomaterials suffer from both intrinsic instability during storage and processing. For example, porous 2D nanomaterials structures have intrinsic lower packing densities and it is hard to pack them into dense films. The processes are still being developed for transferring  from lab-scale to industry-scale. <ref name=\":2\" /> \n== Applications ==\n\n=== Lithium-Sulfur\u2013based High-performance Batteries ===\nThe Li-ion battery is currently one of the most popular electrochemical energy storage systems and has been widely used in areas from portable electronics to electric vehicles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodenough|first=John B.|last2=Kim|first2=Youngsik|date=2010-02-09|title=Challenges for Rechargeable Li Batteries\u2020|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm901452z|journal=Chemistry of Materials|volume=22|issue=3|pages=587\u2013603|doi=10.1021/cm901452z|issn=0897-4756}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bruce|first=Peter\u2005G.|last2=Scrosati|first2=Bruno|last3=Tarascon|first3=Jean-Marie|date=2008-04-07|title=Nanomaterials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.200702505|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=47|issue=16|pages=2930\u20132946|doi=10.1002/anie.200702505|issn=1433-7851}}</ref> However, the [[Gravimetry|gravimetric]] energy density of Li-ion batteries is limited and less than that of fossil fuels.

With cerium oxide nanoparticle additives in fuel, trace amounts of these toxic particles can be emitted within the exhaust. Cerium oxide additives in diesel fuel have been shown to cause lung inflammation and increased bronchial alveolar lavage fluid in rats.<ref name=\":3\" /> This is concerning, especially in areas with high road traffic, where these particles are likely to accumulate and cause adverse health effects. Naturally occurring nanoparticles created by the incomplete combustion of diesel fuels are also large contributors to toxicity of diesel fumes. More research needs to be conducted to determine whether the addition of artificial nanoparticles to fuels decreases the net amount of toxic particle emissions due to combustion.<ref name=\":3\" />\n== Economic Benefits ==\nThe relatively recent shift toward using nanotechnology with respect to the capture, transfer, and storage of energy has and will continue to have many positive economic impacts on society.  The control of materials that nanotechnology offers to scientists and engineers of consumer products is one of the most important aspects of nanotechnology.  This allows for an improved efficiency of products across the board.\n\nA major issue with current energy generation is the loss of efficiency from the generation of heat as a by-product of the process.  A common example of this is the heat generated by the [[internal combustion engine]].  The internal combustion engine loses about 64% of the energy from [[gasoline]] as heat and an improvement of this alone could have a significant economic impact.  However, improving the internal combustion engine in this respect has proven to be extremely difficult without sacrificing performance.  Improving the efficiency of [[fuel cell]]s through the use of nanotechnology appears to be more plausible by using molecularly tailored [[catalyst]]s, polymer membranes, and improved fuel storage.\n\nIn order for a fuel cell to operate, particularly of the [[hydrogen]] variant, a [[Noble metal|noble-metal]] catalyst (usually [[platinum]], which is very expensive) is needed to separate the [[electron]]s from the [[proton]]s of the hydrogen atoms.  However, catalysts of this type are extremely sensitive to [[carbon monoxide]] reactions.  In order to combat this, [[alcohol]]s or [[hydrocarbon]]s compounds are used to lower the [[carbon monoxide]] concentration in the system.  This adds an additional cost to the device.  Using nanotechnology, catalysts can be designed through nanofabrication that are much more resistant to carbon monoxide reactions, which improves the efficiency of the process and may be designed with cheaper materials to additionally lower costs.\n\nFuel cells that are currently designed for [[transportation]] need rapid start-up periods for the practicality of consumer use.  This process puts a lot of strain on the traditional polymer electrolyte membranes, which decreases the life of the membrane requiring frequent replacement.  Using nanotechnology, engineers have the ability to create a much more durable polymer membrane, which addresses this problem.  Nanoscale polymer membranes are also much more efficient in ionic [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  This improves the efficiency of the system and decreases the time between replacements, which lowers costs.\n\nAnother problem with contemporary fuel cells is the storage of the [[fuel]].  In the case of hydrogen fuel cells, storing the hydrogen in gaseous rather than liquid form improves the efficiency by 5%.  However, the materials that we currently have available to us significantly limit fuel storage due to low stress tolerance and costs.  Scientists have come up with an answer to this by using a nanoporous [[styrene]] material (which is a relatively inexpensive material) that when super-cooled to around -196<sup>o</sup>C, naturally holds on to hydrogen atoms and when heated again releases the hydrogen for use.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Nanotechnology]]\n* [[Energy]]\n* [[Fuel Cell]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* http://www.conserv.com/\n* http://www.daisanalytic.com\n* http://www.appliednanoworks.com/\n* http://www.mphasetech.com/\n* http://www.azonano.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1123\n* http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node9.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401085359/http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node9.html |date=1 April 2007 }}\n* http://www.wifinotes.com/nanotechnology/energy-applications-of-nanotechnology.html\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Energy Applications Of Nanotechnology}}\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n[[Category:Energy technology]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2011}}\n{{Nanotechnology implications}}\n\n{{main|List of nanotechnology applications}}\n\nAs the world's [[energy]] demand continues to grow, the development of more efficient and sustainable technologies for generating and storing energy is becoming increasingly important. [[Nanotechnology]], a relatively new field of [[science]] and [[engineering]], has shown promise to have a significant impact on the energy industry. Nanotechnology is defined as any technology that contains particles with one dimension under 100 nanometers in length. For scale, a single [[virus]] particle is about 100 nanometers wide.\n\nPeople in the fields of science and engineering have already begun developing ways of utilizing nanotechnology for the development of [[consumer]] products.  Benefits already observed from the design of these products are an increased efficiency of [[lighting]] and [[heating]], increased electrical storage capacity, and a decrease in the amount of [[pollution]] from the use of energy.  Benefits such as these make the investment of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in the [[research and development]] of nanotechnology a top priority.\n\n== Nanomaterials in Energy ==\nAccording to Dr. Wade Adams from Rice University, energy will be the most pressing problem facing humanity in the next 50 years and nanotechnology has potential to solve this issue.<ref>{{Citation|title=TEDxHouston 2011 - Wade Adams - Nanotechnology and Energy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GFst2IQBEM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>\n\nAn important sub-field of nanotechnology related to energy is [[nanofabrication]], the process of designing and creating devices on the nanoscale.

That means 2D nanomaterials can be easily modified and engineered on [[Nanostructure|nanostructures]]. 2D nanomaterials have a special structural feature which is interlayer space. Interlayer space provides a unique engineering option toward tuning their [[energy storage]] and catalytic properties. The interlayer space can also be manipulated for nonlayered materials and it can be called 2D nanofluidic channels. Also, 2D nanomaterials can be engineered into porous structures, then it can be used in energy stroage and catalytic applications by applying\u00a0facile charge and mass transport. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Yue|last2=Peng|first2=Lele|last3=Fang|first3=Zhiwei|last4=Yan|first4=Chunshuang|last5=Zhang|first5=Xiao|last6=Yu|first6=Guihua|date=2018|title=Structural Engineering of 2D Nanomaterials for Energy Storage and Catalysis|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/adma.201706347|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=30|issue=15|pages=1706347|doi=10.1002/adma.201706347|via=}}</ref>\n\n2D nanomaterials also have a few challenges. First, it happens on the property modification point of view. There are some side effects, such as activity and [[structural stability]], when a 2D structure is engineered. For example, creating some [[Defect|defects]] can increase [[Active site|active sites]] for a higher catalytic performance, but side reactions also happens and it may damage the catalyst structure. Another example is that interlayer expansion can lower ion [[diffusion barrier]] on the host, but it also can potentially lower the structural stability. Then, an equilibrium point between performance and stability has to be determined. The second one is mechanism understanding point of view. The fundamental rule of designing structure is not clear. For example, [[heterostructures]] are the main structures of catalyst in interlayer space and energy storage device, but these structures may lack interpretation on the [[catalytic reaction]] or charge storage mechanisms. A deeper understanding of 2D nanomaterial design must be required, because fundamental knowledge can provide a reasonable and efficient design. Third, it comes from the practical application. There is a huge gap between lab-scale and industry-scale. The reason is 2D nanomaterials suffer from both intrinsic instability during storage and processing. For example, porous 2D nanomaterials structures have intrinsic lower packing densities and it is hard to pack them into dense films. The processes are still being developed for transferring  from lab-scale to industry-scale. <ref name=\":2\" /> \n<br />\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Lithium-Sulfur\u2013based High-performance Batteries ===\nThe Li-ion battery is currently one of the most popular electrochemical energy storage systems and has been widely used in areas from portable electronics to electric vehicles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodenough|first=John B.|last2=Kim|first2=Youngsik|date=2010-02-09|title=Challenges for Rechargeable Li Batteries\u2020|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm901452z|journal=Chemistry of Materials|volume=22|issue=3|pages=587\u2013603|doi=10.1021/cm901452z|issn=0897-4756}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bruce|first=Peter\u2005G.|last2=Scrosati|first2=Bruno|last3=Tarascon|first3=Jean-Marie|date=2008-04-07|title=Nanomaterials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.200702505|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=47|issue=16|pages=2930\u20132946|doi=10.1002/anie.200702505|issn=1433-7851}}</ref> However, the [[Gravimetry|gravimetric]] energy density of Li-ion batteries is limited and less than that of fossil fuels.

Nanotechnology could improve combustion by designing specific catalysts with maximized surface area. In 2005, scientists at the [[University of Toronto]] developed a spray-on nanoparticle substance that, when applied to a surface, instantly transforms it into a solar collector.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Plastic |publisher=National Geographic |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0114_050114_solarplastic.html <!-- not at archive.org -->}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Economic Benefits ==\nThe relatively recent shift toward using nanotechnology with respect to the capture, transfer, and storage of energy has and will continue to have many positive economic impacts on society.  The control of materials that nanotechnology offers to scientists and engineers of consumer products is one of the most important aspects of nanotechnology.  This allows for an improved efficiency of products across the board.\n\nA major issue with current energy generation is the loss of efficiency from the generation of heat as a by-product of the process.  A common example of this is the heat generated by the [[internal combustion engine]].  The internal combustion engine loses about 64% of the energy from [[gasoline]] as heat and an improvement of this alone could have a significant economic impact.  However, improving the internal combustion engine in this respect has proven to be extremely difficult without sacrificing performance.  Improving the efficiency of [[fuel cell]]s through the use of nanotechnology appears to be more plausible by using molecularly tailored [[catalyst]]s, polymer membranes, and improved fuel storage.\n\nIn order for a fuel cell to operate, particularly of the [[hydrogen]] variant, a [[Noble metal|noble-metal]] catalyst (usually [[platinum]], which is very expensive) is needed to separate the [[electron]]s from the [[proton]]s of the hydrogen atoms.  However, catalysts of this type are extremely sensitive to [[carbon monoxide]] reactions.  In order to combat this, [[alcohol]]s or [[hydrocarbon]]s compounds are used to lower the [[carbon monoxide]] concentration in the system.  This adds an additional cost to the device.  Using nanotechnology, catalysts can be designed through nanofabrication that are much more resistant to carbon monoxide reactions, which improves the efficiency of the process and may be designed with cheaper materials to additionally lower costs.\n\nFuel cells that are currently designed for [[transportation]] need rapid start-up periods for the practicality of consumer use.  This process puts a lot of strain on the traditional polymer electrolyte membranes, which decreases the life of the membrane requiring frequent replacement.  Using nanotechnology, engineers have the ability to create a much more durable polymer membrane, which addresses this problem.  Nanoscale polymer membranes are also much more efficient in ionic [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  This improves the efficiency of the system and decreases the time between replacements, which lowers costs.\n\nAnother problem with contemporary fuel cells is the storage of the [[fuel]].  In the case of hydrogen fuel cells, storing the hydrogen in gaseous rather than liquid form improves the efficiency by 5%.  However, the materials that we currently have available to us significantly limit fuel storage due to low stress tolerance and costs.  Scientists have come up with an answer to this by using a nanoporous [[styrene]] material (which is a relatively inexpensive material) that when super-cooled to around -196<sup>o</sup>C, naturally holds on to hydrogen atoms and when heated again releases the hydrogen for use.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Nanotechnology]]\n* [[Energy]]\n* [[Fuel Cell]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* http://www.conserv.com/\n* http://www.daisanalytic.com\n* http://www.appliednanoworks.com/\n* http://www.mphasetech.com/\n* http://www.azonano.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1123\n* http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node9.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401085359/http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node9.html |date=1 April 2007 }}\n* http://www.wifinotes.com/nanotechnology/energy-applications-of-nanotechnology.html\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Energy Applications Of Nanotechnology}}\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n[[Category:Energy technology]]\n", "name_user": "RileyMankin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIncreasing the Efficiency of Energy Production", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_applications_of_nanotechnology"}

The Prophet ordered them to go to the (herd of milch) camels of charity and to drink their milk and applying processed urine on skin for medical relief until they recovered.\"\n\nSunan al-Nasa\u2019i (4035)\n\nAccording to this hadith, Islamic scholars give their opinions on the ruling of medicating using camel\u2019s urine.\n\nIs Camel\u2019s Urine Considered Najis?\n\nThere are two opinions regarding this matter according to Islamic scholars. The first opinion by Imam Malik, Imam Ahmad and part of the salaf (the first three generations of Muslims) states that camel\u2019s urine is not considered as najis (things that are considered unclean ritually). This opinion is also supported by some scholars of Mazhab Syafie which are Ibn Munzir, Ibn Hibban and others.\n\nThe second opinion is that camel\u2019s urine is considered to be najis and this is the opinion of Imam Syafie himself and the majority of Islamic scholars.\n\nThe ruling on medicating using camel\u2019s urine\n\nFirst, Islamic scholars agree that medicating with anything that is prohibited such as alcoholic beverages (liquor) is prohibited. This is in accordance to a famous hadith narrated by Ummu Salamah, that states that the Prophet PBUH said:\n\n\u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0652 \u0634\u0650\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652\n\n\u201cIndeed, Allah didn\u2019t provide a remedy for you from what has been prohibited for you,\u201d\n\nSunan al-Baihaqi (1209)\n\nIn times when there are only alcoholic beverages available and the only way to survive and stay alive is by drinking it then it is permitted to drink it, but only in the amount needed to avoid death. (See Majmu\u2019ah al-Fawaid al-Bahiyyah, 1/60). This is referring to the Islamic legal maxim:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0636\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0627\u062a \u062a\u0628\u064a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0638\u0648\u0631\u0627\u062a\n\n\u201cExigent (desperate) circumstances permits what is prohibited.\u201d\n\nSecondly, the Mazhab al-Syafie permits the usage of najis other than things that are intoxicating for medical purposes. Majority of Islamic scholars holds this opinion. (See al-Majmu\u2019, 9/50)\n\nThe ruling on medicating using camel\u2019s urine\n\nImam Nawawi said the ruling on medicating using camel\u2019s urine is permitted according to the Prophet\u2019s PBUH commands to \u2018Urainah tribe in the narration stated before. (See al- Majmu\u2019, 9/51)\n\nThere are also opinions that said that it is prohibited to medicate using camel\u2019s urine, but the opinions are weak. (See Raudhah al-Thalibin, 3/285)\n\nRequirements to medicate using camel\u2019s urine\n\nImam Nawawi set a few conditions to medicate using camel\u2019s urine. (See al- Majmu\u2019, 9/51)\n\nHe must be knowledgeable in medicine If he has no knowledge in medicine, he must consult with Muslim experts in the field Imam Baghawi added, it\u2019s sufficient to consult one Muslim medical expert Benefits of camel\u2019s urine\n\nCamel\u2019s urine is believed to have medical benefits as proven from the story of the Bedouins in the hadith mentioned above.\n\nOther than the hadith, there are other evidences proving the medical benefits of camel\u2019s urine. Camel\u2019s urine is also high in calcium. (See al-sunnah al-Muthaharah, 79, al-Tib al-arabi, 1/278, and al-I\u2019jaz al-Ilmi fi Sunnah Nabawiyah, 833)\n\nGuidelines from the Ministry of Health Malaysia regarding camel\u2019s urine\n\nMinistry of Health Malaysia and World Health Organization (WHO) have ordered pilgrims of hajj and umrah to not drink camel\u2019s milk or urine and not to enter or visit camel\u2019s farm to avoid getting infected with Mers-Cov virus. Until 15 October 2018, Saudi Arabia health authorities recorded an increase of this virus\u2019 infection [1]. Recently, three deaths are reported due to this infection.\n\nConclusion\n\nAccording to above statements, we hold the opinion that camel\u2019s urine has medicinal benefits as stated in the hadith previously. The following are some inferences that can be drawn:\n\nThe original ruling for drinking camel\u2019s urine without a medical reason is prohibited Medicating using camel\u2019s urine is permitted Before any medication using camel\u2019s urine, a medical and pharmaceutical expert must be consulted Drinking camel\u2019s milk mixed with camel\u2019s urine without a medical reason is prohibited in fear of virus infection.\n\nIts a huge misconceptions in society in regarding use of camel urine. In simple words it has been advised to the particular people for their treatment of skin disease . Firstly to drink camel milk and Secondly applying processed urine on skin for medical relief until they recovered.\n\nIslam is a religion based on facts and practicality. Superstitious and illogical behaviour is highly condemned in the practice of Islam. And fabricating the principles of Islam and teachings of prophet Muhammad pbuh are major sin.\".<ref name=\"bukhari\" />\n\n== Usage and claimed benefits ==\n[[Bachtiar Nasir]], an Islamic cleric, advocated for and defended the consumption of camel urine, quoting the hadith.<ref name=\"Persio2018\">{{cite web |last1=Persio |first1=Sofia Lotto |title=An Islamist leader encouraged his Instagram followers to drink camel urine, sparking debate in Indonesia |url=https://www.newsweek.com/islamist-leader-drinks-camel-urine-video-saudi-arabia-sparking-debate-775698 |website=[[Newsweek]] |accessdate=28 September 2019 |date=9 January 2018}}</ref> According to [[Abu Yusuf]], the urine of camel may be used for medical treatment.<ref name=\"alden\">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=John Alden|title=The Word of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAj-DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA98|accessdate=25 October 2016|year=1994|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-79076-6|page=98|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408182755/https://books.google.com/books?id=rAj-DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA98|archivedate=8 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Yemen]], it is used for treating ailments, though it has been widely denounced.<ref name=\"JB2013\"/> Some salons are said use it as a treatment for [[hair loss]].<ref name=\"JB2013\"/> The camel urine from a virgin camel is priced at twenty dollars per liter, with herders claiming that it has curative powers.
