It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]].

Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

It has been at its present site in the [[Culduthel]] area of the city since 1977.\n\n== Catchment area ==\n\nThe school is a six-year comprehensive school serving an extensive area. The associated primary schools are Stratherrick, Aldourie, Cauldeen, Farr, Foyers, Hilton, [[Holm Primary School|Holm]] and Lochardil. Children living within the catchment area who attended St. Joseph's and Bishop Eden primaries also transfer there after Primary 7. Parents living outwith the catchment area can request that their children be placed there. At present around one hundred children live outwith the catchment area and attend the academy.\n\n== History ==\nTracing its history back to the school established by Dominican Friars in 1223 through the town Grammar School in 1668 to the founding of the Academy in 1792, the school has been located at the following locations around the city.\n* Friars Street area (Dominican Priory) 1223-1668\n* Church Street (now the Dunbar Centre) 1668-1792\n* Academy Street (formerly New Street) 1792-1895\n* Midmills building (previously of UHI-Inverness College) 1895 - 1980 and{{Clarify|date=September 2017}}\n* Culduthel Road 1977\u2013 2016\n* Culduthel Road 2016\u2013present\n\nThe school's continuous existence as a developing institution cannot be demonstrated from the surviving evidence, and it is probably safer to interpret that as a succession of educational provisions in and mainly for the burgh, rather than the survival of a single school. There is, however, evidence that concentration on a single site and within a single building was favoured increasingly (as was the pattern elsewhere in Britain and the transatlantic colonies, from which many of the early Academy subscriptions came) in the later eighteenth century, and that the [[grammar school]] would be the focus of this, notably during the Rectorship of Hector Fraser, who taught many of the merchants and lawyers involved in the establishment of the Royal Academy, which was from the first an innovative and self-contained project aiming, as its first minute book amply demonstrates, to provide something like a stepping stone to full university status for the burgh, with a curriculum designed in the light of the ideas of the Enlightenment and dominated not by the Classics but by the sciences and mathematics.\n\nFor the first quarter-century of the Academy's existence something like this ideal was sustained, and the appointments of its Rectors showed a bias towards the emerging sciences - for example that of Alexander Nimmo, who became a disciple of Telford, and left in 1811 to work on civil engineering projects in the West of Ireland.  He was followed by a mathematician, Matthew Adam.\n\nThe Academy was open to girls from the start, and in its English, writing and drawing classes provided the sort of education for girls that middle-class parents were happy with, although there seems also to have been an enthusiasm for geography.

On 23 November 2009 his brother, Prince Edward, visited the school, having also visited on 11 June 2003.\n\n==School building==\nThe new school building has 3 floors for a variety of subjects. The ground floor has the guidance base, Year head base, 4 technology workshops, P.E classrooms, 2 large games halls, the learning support department as well as the reception in the front, the small canteen under the larger atrium and the cafe area under the smaller atrium.

It has been at its present site in the [[Culduthel]] area of the city since 1977.\n\n== Catchment area ==\n\nThe school is a six-year comprehensive school serving an extensive area. The associated primary schools are Stratherrick, Aldourie, Cauldeen, Farr, Foyers, Hilton, [[Holm Primary School|Holm]] and Lochardil. Children living within the catchment area who attended St. Joseph's and Bishop Eden primaries also transfer there after Primary 7. Parents living outwith the catchment area can request that their children be placed there. At present around one hundred children live outwith the catchment area and attend the academy.\n\n== History ==\nTracing its history back to the school established by Dominican Friars in 1223 through the town Grammar School in 1668 to the founding of the Academy in 1792, the school has been located at the following locations around the city.\n* Friars Street area (Dominican Priory) 1223-1668\n* Church Street (now the Dunbar Centre) 1668-1792\n* Academy Street (formerly New Street) 1792-1895\n* Midmills building (previously of UHI-Inverness College) 1895 - 1980 and{{Clarify|date=September 2017}}\n* Culduthel Road 1977\u2013 2016\n* Culduthel Road 2016\u2013present\n\nThe school's continuous existence as a developing institution cannot be demonstrated from the surviving evidence, and it is probably safer to interpret that as a succession of educational provisions in and mainly for the burgh, rather than the survival of a single school. There is, however, evidence that concentration on a single site and within a single building was favoured increasingly (as was the pattern elsewhere in Britain and the transatlantic colonies, from which many of the early Academy subscriptions came) in the later eighteenth century, and that the [[grammar school]] would be the focus of this, notably during the Rectorship of Hector Fraser, who taught many of the merchants and lawyers involved in the establishment of the Royal Academy, which was from the first an innovative and self-contained project aiming, as its first minute book amply demonstrates, to provide something like a stepping stone to full university status for the burgh, with a curriculum designed in the light of the ideas of the Enlightenment and dominated not by the Classics but by the sciences and mathematics.\n\nFor the first quarter-century of the Academy's existence something like this ideal was sustained, and the appointments of its Rectors showed a bias towards the emerging sciences - for example that of Alexander Nimmo, who became a disciple of Telford, and left in 1811 to work on civil engineering projects in the West of Ireland.  He was followed by a mathematician, Matthew Adam.\n\nThe Academy was open to girls from the start, and in its English, writing and drawing classes provided the sort of education for girls that middle-class parents were happy with, although there seems also to have been an enthusiasm for geography. In the mid-nineteenth century one girl was adjudged the best mathematics pupil in the school, but could not be awarded the appropriate medal, which went only to boys.\n\nFrom the opening of the Academy in 1792 (when pupils came from all over the Highlands and across the Atlantic, especially the Caribbean - some are shown in the surviving rolls as \"coloured\") a continuous existence can safely be traced, in which major milestones after 1792 were the adaptation to compulsory schooling after 1872, and the demands of the professions generally, which led to the establishment of the new building on the Crown in 1895.\n\nThe school's management was by the Inverness School Board after 1910, and later by Inverness County Council and Highland Regional Council.\n\nOn 28 April 1962 when the school's outdoor club was climbing on [[Stac Pollaidh]], a 15-year-old boy slipped and fell 40 feet to his death.\n\n===Comprehensive===\nThere was movement in the 1950s and 1960s (when Gaelic speaking pupils from the Western Isles were still accepted and housed in the Hostel on Culduthel Road) from fee-paying and selectivity to the status of area comprehensive in the mid and late 1970s, again on a new site.\n\nOn 26 June 1992 the school was visited by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] to celebrate its bi-centenary, with [[Lachlan Mackintosh of Mackintosh]].

The second Floor has the English, Gaelic, French and Maths classrooms as well as a computer room and 2 unisex toilets.

They did this through backdoor political reassurances to army leaders, a policy of official silence in the face of the mounting violence, a sophisticated international propaganda offensive, and the covert provision of material assistance to the army and its allies.

Communists were purged from political, social, and military life, and the PKI itself was disbanded and banned. The massacres began in October 1965, in the weeks following the coup attempt, and reached their peak over the remainder of the year before subsiding in the early months of 1966. They started in the capital, [[Jakarta]], and spread to [[Central Java|Central]] and [[East Java]], and later [[Bali]]. Thousands of local [[vigilante]]s and army units killed actual and alleged PKI members. Killings occurred across the country, with the worst in the PKI strongholds of Central Java, East Java, Bali, and northern [[Sumatra]]. It is possible that over one million people were imprisoned at one time or another.\n\nSukarno's balancing act of \"[[Nasakom]]\" ([[nationalism]], [[religion]] and [[communism]]) had unravelled. His most significant pillar of support, the PKI, was effectively eliminated by the other two pillars\u2014the army and [[Islamism|political Islam]]; and the army was on the way to unchallenged power. In March 1967, Sukarno was stripped of his remaining power by Indonesia's provisional Parliament, and Suharto was named [[Acting Presidency of Suharto|Acting President]]. In March 1968, Suharto was formally elected president.\n\nThe killings are skipped over in most Indonesian history textbooks and have received little introspection by Indonesians, due to their suppression under the Suharto regime. The search for satisfactory explanations for the scale and frenzy of the violence has challenged scholars from all ideological perspectives. The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the \"New Order\" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system. Vigilance and [[social stigma|stigma]] against a perceived communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's doctrine, and it is still in force even today.<ref>{{cite news |last=Varagur |first=Krithika |date=23 October 2017 |title=Indonesia Revives Its Communist Ghosts |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-23/indonesian-military-stirs-communist-fears-for-political-advantage |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |access-date=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite a consensus at the highest levels of the US and British governments that it would be necessary \"to liquidate Sukarno\", as related in a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] memorandum from 1962,<ref>{{Harvnb|Allan|Zeilzer|2004|p=??}}.<br />{{Harvtxt|Westad|2005|pp=113, 129}} notes that, prior to the mid-1950s\u2014by which time the relationship was in definite trouble\u2014the US actually had, via the CIA, developed excellent contacts with Sukarno.</ref> and the existence of extensive contacts between anti-communist army officers and the [[United States Army|US military]] establishment \u2013 training of over 1,200 officers, \"including senior military figures\", and providing weapons and economic assistance<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b3605665?urlappend=;seq=440|title=[Hearings, reports and prints of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs] 91st: PRINTS: A-R.|website=HathiTrust}}</ref><ref>Macaulay, Scott (17 February 2014).

The rise in influence and increasing militancy of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI), and Soekarno's support for it, was a serious concern for [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslims]] and the military, and tension grew steadily in the early and mid-1960s.<ref>Schwarz (1994), pp. 16\u201318</ref> The third-largest communist party in the world,<ref>cf with Weiner (2007) p.259</ref> the PKI had approximately 300,000 [[Leninism#The vanguard party|cadres]] and full membership of around two million.<ref>Cribb (1990), p. 41.</ref> The party's assertive efforts to speed up land reform frightened those who controlled the land and threatened the social position of Muslim clerics.<ref>Schwarz (1994), pp. 17, 21.</ref> Sukarno required government employees to study his Nasakom principles as well as Marxist theory. He had met with [[Zhou Enlai]], Premier of the [[People's Republic of China]], and after this meeting had decided to create a militia, called a Fifth Force, which he intended to control personally. Soekarno ordered weapons from China to equip this Fifth Force. He declared in a speech that he favoured revolutionary groups whether they were nationalist, religious or communist, stating \"I am a friend of the Communists because the Communists are revolutionary people.\"<ref>President Sukarno, speech on independence day, 17 August 1964</ref> He said at a [[Non-Aligned Movement]] summit meeting in [[Cairo]] in October 1964 that his current purpose was to drive all of Indonesian politics to the left and thereby to neutralise the \"reactionary\" elements in the army that could be dangerous for the revolution.<ref name=\"Andrew John Rotter p.273\">Andrew John Rotter (Edt.), ''Light at the end of the tunnel'', p.273, Rowman & Littlefield Publ., 2010, {{ISBN|9780742561335}}</ref> Soekarno's international policies increasingly reflected his rhetoric.\n\nAs early as 1958, Western powers\u2014in particular the US and the UK\u2014pushed for policies that would encourage the Indonesian Army to act forcefully against the PKI and the Left, which included a covert propaganda campaign designed to damage the reputation of Soekarno and the PKI, and secret assurances along with military and financial support to anti-communist leaders within the army.<ref name=\"Robinson2018\" />{{rp|83}}\n\n== 30 September ==\nOn the evening of 30 September 1965, a group of militants, known as the [[30 September Movement]], captured and executed six of Indonesia's top military generals. The movement proclaimed itself as Sukarno's protectors, issuing a pre-emptive strike to prevent a possible ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]'' by the \"anti-Soekarno\", pro-Western Council of Generals.\n\nAfter the execution of the generals, the movement's forces occupied [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]] in [[Jakarta]] and the presidential palace. Shortly afterwards, however, President Sukarno refused to commit to the movement, for it had captured and assassinated many of his top generals. As the night continued, its poor leadership began to show, starting with a series of incoherent radio messages. The movement mainly aimed to occupy the main telecommunications building; however, it ignored the east side of the square, which was the location of ''[[Kostrad]]'', the armed forces strategic reserve. At the time, Major General [[Soeharto]] was in control of the reserve, and upon hearing the news of the takeover, he quickly capitalised on the movement's weaknesses, regaining control of the square without resistance.<ref name=\"John Roosa 2006 178-179\">{{cite book |author=John Roosa |title=Pretext for Mass Murder: The September 30th Movement and Suharto's Coup D'\u00c9tat in Indonesia |year=2006 |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press}}</ref> Following the surrender, the movement's troops did not take further action. At the same time, the Indonesian military slowly gained influence as Sukarno's waned, and within days, the government was under the control of Soeharto. He immediately deployed troops and dispersed the movement, while trumpeting the movement's actions as a \"danger\" to the nation.\n\nA military propaganda campaign to link the ''coup'' attempt with the PKI, masterminded by Soeharto and the military, began to sweep the country on 5 October. Graphic images and descriptions of the murdered, tortured, and even castrated generals began to circulate the country. Despite falsified information, the campaign was successful, convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that the murders were a PKI attempt to undermine the government under President Soekarno. Though the PKI denied involvement, pent-up tension and hatred that had built up over the years were released.<ref name=\"John Roosa 2006 178-179\" />\n\nEven though the 30 September Movement killed 12 people, Suharto ultimately presented it as a nationwide conspiracy to commit mass murder. Millions of people associated with the PKI, even illiterate peasants from remote villages, were presented as murderers and accomplices of the movement. In early 1966, two Indonesian specialists at [[Cornell University]], [[Benedict Anderson]] and Ruth McVey observed in their [[Cornell Paper]] that Soeharto's army began the anti-communist campaign well after the 30 September Movement had collapsed. Between the moment that the movement ended and the moment that the army's mass arrests began, three weeks had elapsed in which no violence or trace of civil war occurred, even according to the army itself. Sukarno constantly protested the purge, stating that the army was \"burning down a house to kill a rat\", but he was powerless as Soeharto commanded a firm hold on the military.<ref name=\"John Roosa 2006 22\">{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder: The September 30th Movement and Suharto's Coup D'\u00c9tat in Indonesia |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |year=2006 |isbn= |location= |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jt7vU-7AhukC&pg=PA81 81] |author=John Roosa}}</ref>\n\n== Political purge ==\nThe army removed top civilian and military leaders it thought sympathetic to the PKI.<ref>Schwarz (1994), p. 21</ref> The [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament]] and cabinet were purged of Sukarno loyalists.

For example, much of the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the Police [[Mobile Brigade Corps]] were infiltrated up to commander level by the PKI.<ref name=\"Vittachi 1967, p. 138\">Vittachi (1967), p. 138</ref> In early October, forces of the Strategic Command (Suharto's ''Kostrad''), and the RPKAD para-commandos led by Colonel [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] were sent to Central Java, a region with strong PKI support, while troops of uncertain loyalty were ordered out.<ref name=\"Ricklefs_287\" /> At the same time, the [[Kodam III/Siliwangi|Siliwangi Division]] was deployed to guard Jakarta and [[West Java]], both of which, unlike Central and East Java, remained relatively immune to the mass killings.<ref>Vittachi (1967), p. 141</ref> Early fighting in the Central Java highlands and around [[Madiun]] suggested the PKI might be able to establish a rival regime centred on these regions. However, widespread fears of a civil war, between factions supported by the United States and China respectively, quickly evaporated, as the forces sent by Suharto took control.<ref name=\"Vittachi 1967, p. 138\" /> Many rebel commanders chose not to fight as Suharto-deployed forces arrived, although resistance came from some, like General [[Supardjo]], for a few more weeks.\n\nAs the Sukarno presidency began to unravel and Suharto began to assert control following the ''coup'' attempt, the PKI's top national leadership was hunted and arrested with some summarily executed. In early October, PKI chairman [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit]] had flown to [[Central Java]], where the ''coup'' attempt had been supported by leftist officers in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Salatiga]], and [[Semarang]].<ref name=\"Vicker_157\" /> Fellow senior PKI leader [[Njoto]] was shot around 6 November, Aidit on 22 November, and First Deputy PKI Chairman [[M.H.

The murder campaign became so brazen in parts of rural East Java, that Moslem bands placed the heads of victims on poles and paraded them through villages.

In this Chinese ethnic cleansing, Dayaks were co-opted by the military who wanted to remove those Chinese from the interior who they believed were supporting communists. The most certain way to accomplish this was to drive all Chinese out of the interior of West Kalimantan. Perhaps 2000\u20135000 people were massacred (Davidson 2002:158) and probably a greater number died from the conditions in overcrowded refugee camps, including 1500 Chinese children aged between one and eight who died of starvation in Pontianak camps (p. 173). The Chinese retreated permanently to the major towns...the Chinese in West Kalimantan rarely resisted (though they had in nineteenth-century conflict with the Dutch, and in 1914). Instead, they fled. One old Chinese man who fled to Pontianak in 1967 said that the Chinese did not even consider or discuss striking back at Dayaks as an option. This was because they were imbued with a philosophy of being a guest on other people's land to become a great trading diaspora.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EUDii8kvQYAC&pg=PA63&dq=In+October+1967,+the+military,+with+the+help+of+the+former+Dayak+Governor+Oevaang+Oeray+and+his+Lasykar+Pangsuma+(Pangsuma+Militia)+instigated+and+facilitated+a+Dayak-led+slaughter+of+ethnic+Chinese.+Over+the+next+three+months#v=onepage&q=In%20October%201967%2C%20the%20military%2C%20with%20the%20help%20of%20the%20former%20Dayak%20Governor%20Oevaang%20Oeray%20and%20his%20Lasykar%20Pangsuma%20(Pangsuma%20Militia)%20instigated%20and%20facilitated%20a%20Dayak-led%20slaughter%20of%20ethnic%20Chinese.%20Over%20the%20next%20three%20months&f=false |title=Conflict, violence, and displacement in indonesia |author=Eva-Lotta E.

There is now clear evidence that in the crucial six months after the alleged coup, Western powers encouraged the army to move forcefully against the Left, facilitated widespread violence including mass killings, and helped to consolidate the political power of the army, In doing so, they helped to bring about the political and physical destruction of the PKI and its affiliates, the removal of Sukarno and his closest associates from political power, their replacement by an army elite led by General Suharto, and a seismic shift in Indonesia's foreign policy towards the West and the capitalist model it advanced.<ref name=\"Robinson2018\" />{{rp|177}}}}\n\nWestern support for the Indonesian Army solidified as it demonstrated its \"resolve\" through the mass killing campaigns.<ref name=\"Robinson2018\" />{{rp|179, 204}} US President [[Lyndon B.

One view attributes the communal hatreds behind the killings to the forcing of parliamentary democracy onto Indonesian society, claiming that such changes were culturally unsuitable and unnecessarily disruptive in the post-independence 1950s. A contrasting view is that when Sukarno and the military replaced the democratic process with authoritarianism, competing interests\u2014i.e., the army, political Islam, and Communism\u2014could not be openly debated. They were suppressed instead and could only be expressed through violence.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994, p. 22\" /> Conflict resolution methods have broken down, and Muslim groups and the military adopted an \"us or them attitude\", and that when the killings were over, many Indonesians dismissed as something the Communists had deserved.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994, p. 22\" /> The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the \"New Order\" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994, p. 21\"/> Vigilance against a Communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's three-decade presidency.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 114.</ref>\n\nAlthough mostly unknown in the West compared to the [[Vietnam War]] and various [[United States involvement in regime change in Latin America|right-wing coups in Latin America]], the massacres and Suharto's rise to power are considered by historians to be a significant turning point in the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"Atlantic2017\" /> The massacres were also crucial to the expansion of [[capitalism]] in Indonesia,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Farid |first=Hilmar |year=2005 |title=Indonesia's original sin: mass killings and capitalist expansion, 1965\u201366 |journal=[[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=3\u201316 |doi=10.1080/1462394042000326879}}</ref> with Suharto rapidly implementing the economic policies of the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", whose training had been funded by the [[Ford Foundation]], to liberalise the economy.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hickel|first=Jason|date=2018 |title=The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions|url= |location= |publisher=Windmill Books|page=120 |isbn=978-1786090034}}</ref>  Given US foreign policy goals of stopping the spread of communism and bringing nations into its sphere of influence, the bloody purge which decimated the PKI, the third-largest Communist Party in the world at the time, was considered a huge victory.

By having its two main characters, Srintil and Rasus, on opposite ends of the revolution, the novel sketches not only the circumstances that could have drawn the greater rural public into communist practices but also the mindset of the people who were tasked with carrying out the killings. As the novel was published in 1981, certain aspects were censored by the New Order, but all the same, the trilogy provides valuable insight into the grass-root level of the anti-communist coup and the tragedies that followed.\n\n{{quote|The nights at the beginning of the dry season of 1966 were very cold, and there was widespread anxiety amongst the people.

There is less focus on the military aspect of the coup, but a good deal of focus on the communists themselves through the form of interpersonal relationships and communist ghosts who could not find peace. Without meaning to, perhaps, the novel also gives readers a glimpse of the economy of Indonesia at the time using the example of a flourishing prostitute business and a temporary swimsuit business, among others. Kurniawan projects his feelings about the revolution and coup by constructing a story of theatrical characters around it and delivers a history of the nation all the way from Dutch occupation to Suharto.\n\n{{quote|Revolution is nothing more than a collective running amok, organized by one particular party.|Eka Kurniawan in his novel, ''Beauty is a Wound'' <ref>{{cite book |title=Beauty is a Wound |author1=Eka Kurniawan |page=145}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Louise Doughty]] ''Black Water'' (2016) deals with the 1965 event by exploring them from a European viewpoint. Shifting between California and Indonesia as settings for the novel, the book is written from the perspective of a single man working as an operative for an international company. The novel focuses more on foreign reactions to the coup rather than the coup itself, especially from the foreign journalist community.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Communist Party of Indonesia]]\n* [[Gerwani]]\n* [[Communism in Sumatra]]\n* [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]\n* [[List of massacres in Indonesia]]\n* [[Petrus killings]]\n* ''[[40 Years of Silence: An Indonesian Tragedy]]'', a 2009 documentary film\n* ''[[The Act of Killing]]'', a 2012 documentary film\n* ''[[The Look of Silence]]'', a 2014 documentary film\n* [[Politicide]]\n* [[United States involvement in regime change]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book |language=Indonesian |editor-last=Alham |editor-first=Asahan |title=Di Negeri Orang: Puisi Penyair Indonesia Eksil |trans-title=In Another Person's Country: Poems By Exiled Indonesian Poets |publisher=Lontar Foundation |location=Jakarta |ref=harv |year=2002 |isbn=978-979-8083-42-6}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Allan |first1=Stuart |last2=Zeilzer |first2=Barbie |year=2004 |title=Reporting War: Journalism in Wartime |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |ref=harv}}\n* Bellamy, Alex J.

They did this through backdoor political reassurances to army leaders, a policy of official silence in the face of the mounting violence, a sophisticated international propaganda offensive, and the covert provision of material assistance to the army and its allies.

Communists were purged from political, social, and military life, and the PKI itself was disbanded and banned. The massacres began in October 1965, in the weeks following the coup attempt, and reached their peak over the remainder of the year before subsiding in the early months of 1966. They started in the capital, [[Jakarta]], and spread to [[Central Java|Central]] and [[East Java]], and later [[Bali]]. Thousands of local [[vigilante]]s and army units killed actual and alleged PKI members. Killings occurred across the country, with the worst in the PKI strongholds of Central Java, East Java, Bali, and northern [[Sumatra]]. It is possible that over one million people were imprisoned at one time or another.\n\nSukarno's balancing act of \"[[Nasakom]]\" ([[nationalism]], [[religion]] and [[communism]]) had unravelled. His most significant pillar of support, the PKI, was effectively eliminated by the other two pillars\u2014the army and [[Islamism|political Islam]]; and the army was on the way to unchallenged power. In March 1967, Sukarno was stripped of his remaining power by Indonesia's provisional Parliament, and Suharto was named [[Acting Presidency of Suharto|Acting President]]. In March 1968, Suharto was formally elected president.\n\nThe killings are skipped over in most Indonesian history textbooks and have received little introspection by Indonesians, due to their suppression under the Suharto regime. The search for satisfactory explanations for the scale and frenzy of the violence has challenged scholars from all ideological perspectives. The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the \"New Order\" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system. Vigilance and [[social stigma|stigma]] against a perceived communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's doctrine, and it is still in force even today.<ref>{{cite news |last=Varagur |first=Krithika |date=23 October 2017 |title=Indonesia Revives Its Communist Ghosts |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-23/indonesian-military-stirs-communist-fears-for-political-advantage |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |access-date=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite a consensus at the highest levels of the US and British governments that it would be necessary \"to liquidate Sukarno\", as related in a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] memorandum from 1962,<ref>{{Harvnb|Allan|Zeilzer|2004|p=??}}.<br />{{Harvtxt|Westad|2005|pp=113, 129}} notes that, prior to the mid-1950s\u2014by which time the relationship was in definite trouble\u2014the US actually had, via the CIA, developed excellent contacts with Sukarno.</ref> and the existence of extensive contacts between anti-communist army officers and the [[United States Army|US military]] establishment \u2013 training of over 1,200 officers, \"including senior military figures\", and providing weapons and economic assistance<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b3605665?urlappend=;seq=440|title=[Hearings, reports and prints of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs] 91st: PRINTS: A-R.|website=HathiTrust}}</ref><ref>Macaulay, Scott (17 February 2014).

The rise in influence and increasing militancy of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI), and Sukarno's support for it, was a serious concern for [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslims]] and the military, and tension grew steadily in the early and mid-1960s.<ref>Schwarz (1994), pp. 16\u201318</ref> The third-largest communist party in the world,<ref>cf with Weiner (2007) p.259</ref> the PKI had approximately 300,000 [[Leninism#The vanguard party|cadres]] and full membership of around two million.<ref>Cribb (1990), p. 41.</ref> The party's assertive efforts to speed up land reform frightened those who controlled the land and threatened the social position of Muslim clerics.<ref>Schwarz (1994), pp. 17, 21.</ref> Sukarno required government employees to study his Nasakom principles as well as Marxist theory. He had met with [[Zhou Enlai]], Premier of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and after this meeting had decided to create a militia, called a Fifth Force, which he intended to control personally. Sukarno ordered weapons from China to equip this Fifth Force. He declared in a speech that he favoured revolutionary groups whether they were nationalist, religious or communist, stating \"I am a friend of the Communists because the Communists are revolutionary people.\"<ref>President Sukarno, speech on independence day, 17 August 1964</ref> He said at a [[Non-Aligned Movement]] summit meeting in [[Cairo]] in October 1964 that his current purpose was to drive all of Indonesian politics to the left and thereby to neutralise the \"reactionary\" elements in the army that could be dangerous for the revolution.<ref name=\"Andrew John Rotter p.273\">Andrew John Rotter (Edt.), ''Light at the end of the tunnel'', p.273, Rowman & Littlefield Publ., 2010, {{ISBN|9780742561335}}</ref> Sukarno's international policies increasingly reflected his rhetoric.\n\nAs early as 1958, Western powers\u2014in particular the US and the UK\u2014pushed for policies that would encourage the Indonesian Army to act forcefully against the PKI and the Left, which included a covert propaganda campaign designed to damage the reputation of Sukarno and the PKI, and secret assurances along with military and financial support to anti-communist leaders within the army.<ref name=\"Robinson2018\" />{{rp|83}}\n\n== 30 September ==\nOn the evening of 30 September 1965, a group of militants, known as the [[30 September Movement]], captured and executed six of Indonesia's top military generals. The movement proclaimed itself as Sukarno's protectors, issuing a pre-emptive strike to prevent a possible ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]'' by the \"anti-Sukarno\", pro-Western Council of Generals.\n\nAfter the execution of the generals, the movement's forces occupied [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]] in [[Jakarta]] and the presidential palace. Shortly afterwards, however, President Sukarno refused to commit to the movement, for it had captured and assassinated many of his top generals. As the night continued, its poor leadership began to show, starting with a series of incoherent radio messages. The movement mainly aimed to occupy the main telecommunications building; however, it ignored the east side of the square, which was the location of ''[[Kostrad]]'', the armed forces strategic reserve. At the time, Major General [[Suharto]] was in control of the reserve, and upon hearing the news of the takeover, he quickly capitalised on the movement's weaknesses, regaining control of the square without resistance.<ref name=\"John Roosa 2006 178-179\">{{cite book |author=John Roosa |title=Pretext for Mass Murder: The September 30th Movement and Suharto's Coup D'\u00c9tat in Indonesia |year=2006 |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press}}</ref> Following the surrender, the movement's troops did not take further action. At the same time, the Indonesian military slowly gained influence as Sukarno's waned, and within days, the government was under the control of Suharto. He immediately deployed troops and dispersed the movement, while trumpeting the movement's actions as a \"danger\" to the nation.\n\nA military propaganda campaign to link the ''coup'' attempt with the PKI, masterminded by Suharto and the military, began to sweep the country on 5 October. Graphic images and descriptions of the murdered, tortured, and even castrated generals began to circulate the country. Despite falsified information, the campaign was successful, convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that the murders were a PKI attempt to undermine the government under President Sukarno. Though the PKI denied involvement, pent-up tension and hatred that had built up over the years were released.<ref name=\"John Roosa 2006 178-179\" />\n\nEven though the 30 September Movement killed 12 people, Suharto ultimately presented it as a nationwide conspiracy to commit mass murder. Millions of people associated with the PKI, even illiterate peasants from remote villages, were presented as murderers and accomplices of the movement. In early 1966, two Indonesian specialists at [[Cornell University]], [[Benedict Anderson]] and Ruth McVey observed in their [[Cornell Paper]] that Suharto's army began the anti-communist campaign well after the 30 September Movement had collapsed. Between the moment that the movement ended and the moment that the army's mass arrests began, three weeks had elapsed in which no violence or trace of civil war occurred, even according to the army itself. Sukarno constantly protested the purge, stating that the army was \"burning down a house to kill a rat\", but he was powerless as Suharto commanded a firm hold on the military.<ref name=\"John Roosa 2006 22\">{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder: The September 30th Movement and Suharto's Coup D'\u00c9tat in Indonesia |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |year=2006 |isbn= |location= |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jt7vU-7AhukC&pg=PA81 81] |author=John Roosa}}</ref>\n\n== Political purge ==\nThe army removed top civilian and military leaders it thought sympathetic to the PKI.<ref>Schwarz (1994), p. 21</ref> The [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament]] and cabinet were purged of Sukarno loyalists.

For example, much of the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the Police [[Mobile Brigade Corps]] were infiltrated up to commander level by the PKI.<ref name=\"Vittachi 1967, p. 138\">Vittachi (1967), p. 138</ref> In early October, forces of the Strategic Command (Suharto's ''Kostrad''), and the RPKAD para-commandos led by Colonel [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] were sent to Central Java, a region with strong PKI support, while troops of uncertain loyalty were ordered out.<ref name=\"Ricklefs_287\" /> At the same time, the [[Kodam III/Siliwangi|Siliwangi Division]] was deployed to guard Jakarta and [[West Java]], both of which, unlike Central and East Java, remained relatively immune to the mass killings.<ref>Vittachi (1967), p. 141</ref> Early fighting in the Central Java highlands and around [[Madiun]] suggested the PKI might be able to establish a rival regime centred on these regions. However, widespread fears of a civil war, between factions supported by the United States and China respectively, quickly evaporated, as the forces sent by Suharto took control.<ref name=\"Vittachi 1967, p. 138\" /> Many rebel commanders chose not to fight as Suharto-deployed forces arrived, although resistance came from some, like General [[Supardjo]], for a few more weeks.\n\nAs the Sukarno presidency began to unravel and Suharto began to assert control following the ''coup'' attempt, the PKI's top national leadership was hunted and arrested with some summarily executed. In early October, PKI chairman [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit]] had flown to [[Central Java]], where the ''coup'' attempt had been supported by leftist officers in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Salatiga]], and [[Semarang]].<ref name=\"Vicker_157\" /> Fellow senior PKI leader [[Njoto]] was shot around 6 November, Aidit on 22 November, and First Deputy PKI Chairman [[M.H.

Armed with wide-bladed knives called parangs, Moslem bands crept at night into the homes of communists, killing entire families and burying their bodies in shallow graves ... The murder campaign became so brazen in parts of rural East Java, that Moslem bands placed the heads of victims on poles and paraded them through villages. The killings have been on such a scale that the disposal of the corpses has created a serious sanitation problem in East Java and Northern Sumatra where the humid air bears the reek of decaying flesh.

Communists were publicly accused of working towards the destruction of the island's culture, religion, and character, and the Balinese, like the Javanese, were urged to destroy the PKI.

In this Chinese ethnic cleansing, Dayaks were co-opted by the military who wanted to remove those Chinese from the interior who they believed were supporting communists. The most certain way to accomplish this was to drive all Chinese out of the interior of West Kalimantan. Perhaps 2000\u20135000 people were massacred (Davidson 2002:158) and probably a greater number died from the conditions in overcrowded refugee camps, including 1500 Chinese children aged between one and eight who died of starvation in Pontianak camps (p. 173). The Chinese retreated permanently to the major towns...the Chinese in West Kalimantan rarely resisted (though they had in nineteenth-century conflict with the Dutch, and in 1914). Instead, they fled. One old Chinese man who fled to Pontianak in 1967 said that the Chinese did not even consider or discuss striking back at Dayaks as an option. This was because they were imbued with a philosophy of being a guest on other people's land to become a great trading diaspora.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EUDii8kvQYAC&pg=PA63&dq=In+October+1967,+the+military,+with+the+help+of+the+former+Dayak+Governor+Oevaang+Oeray+and+his+Lasykar+Pangsuma+(Pangsuma+Militia)+instigated+and+facilitated+a+Dayak-led+slaughter+of+ethnic+Chinese.+Over+the+next+three+months#v=onepage&q=In%20October%201967%2C%20the%20military%2C%20with%20the%20help%20of%20the%20former%20Dayak%20Governor%20Oevaang%20Oeray%20and%20his%20Lasykar%20Pangsuma%20(Pangsuma%20Militia)%20instigated%20and%20facilitated%20a%20Dayak-led%20slaughter%20of%20ethnic%20Chinese.%20Over%20the%20next%20three%20months&f=false |title=Conflict, violence, and displacement in indonesia |author=Eva-Lotta E.

A contrasting view is that when Sukarno and the military replaced the democratic process with authoritarianism, competing interests\u2014i.e., the army, political Islam, and Communism\u2014could not be openly debated. They were suppressed instead and could only be expressed through violence.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994, p. 22\" /> Conflict resolution methods have broken down, and Muslim groups and the military adopted an \"us or them attitude\", and that when the killings were over, many Indonesians dismissed as something the Communists had deserved.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994, p. 22\" /> The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the \"New Order\" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system.<ref name=\"Schwarz 1994, p. 21\"/> Vigilance against a Communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's three-decade presidency.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 114.</ref>\n\nAlthough mostly unknown in the West compared to the [[Vietnam War]] and various [[United States involvement in regime change in Latin America|right-wing coups in Latin America]], the massacres and Suharto's rise to power are considered by historians to be a significant turning point in the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"Atlantic2017\" /> The massacres were also crucial to the expansion of [[capitalism]] in Indonesia,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Farid |first=Hilmar |year=2005 |title=Indonesia's original sin: mass killings and capitalist expansion, 1965\u201366 |journal=[[Inter-Asia Cultural Studies]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=3\u201316 |doi=10.1080/1462394042000326879}}</ref> with Suharto rapidly implementing the economic policies of the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", whose training had been funded by the [[Ford Foundation]], to liberalise the economy.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hickel|first=Jason|date=2018 |title=The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions|url= |location= |publisher=Windmill Books|page=120 |isbn=978-1786090034}}</ref>  Given US foreign policy goals of stopping the spread of communism and bringing nations into its sphere of influence, the bloody purge which decimated the PKI, the third-largest Communist Party in the world at the time, was considered a huge victory.

Books that were written in Indonesia during the time of the New Order often faced censorship of certain concepts, while books written and published abroad were banned from the country.\n\nJohn Roosa's ''Pretext for Mass Murder'' traces a historical path through the 1965 event, painting a scenario of explanations for what preceded, caused and followed the coup. It focuses on several aspects of the coup such as the incoherence of facts and the incompetence of coup organisers to provide four main interpretations of the coup:(1) the movement as an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by the PKI,<ref>{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder |author1=John Roosa |pages=62\u201370}}</ref> (2) the movement as a mutiny of junior officers,<ref>{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder |author1=John Roosa |pages=70\u201373}}</ref> (3) the movement as an alliance of army officers and the PKI,<ref>{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder |author1=John Roosa |pages=73\u201374}}</ref> and (4) the movement as a frame-up of the PKI.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pretext for Mass Murder |author1=John Roosa |pages=75\u201380}}</ref> It also looks at material previously left unexplored in traditional discussions of the incident to give a reconstruction of the chaos that surrounds this period in Indonesian history.\n\n[[Ahmad Tohari]]'s trilogy novel ''The Dancer'' (Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk) depicts a village community caught in a revolution, giving readers a perspective less acknowledged in the more popular account of the massacres. By having its two main characters, Srintil and Rasus, on opposite ends of the revolution, the novel sketches not only the circumstances that could have drawn the greater rural public into communist practices but also the mindset of the people who were tasked with carrying out the killings. As the novel was published in 1981, certain aspects were censored by the New Order, but all the same, the trilogy provides valuable insight into the grass-root level of the anti-communist coup and the tragedies that followed.\n\n{{quote|The nights at the beginning of the dry season of 1966 were very cold, and there was widespread anxiety amongst the people. Wild dogs roamed the area, savage, aroused by the smell of blood and corpses that had not been buried properly. The southeasterly breeze carried the smell of rotting carrion. The stillness of the nights was broken by the sounds of the heavy footfalls of boots and the occasional reports of gunshots.|Ahmad Tohari in his novel ''The Dancer'' <ref>{{cite book |title=The Dancer |author1=Ahmad Tohari |pages=260\u2013261}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Eka Kurniawan]]'s ''Beauty is a Wound'' (2002) weaves history into satire, tragedy and the supernatural to depict the state of the nation before, during and after 1965. There is less focus on the military aspect of the coup, but a good deal of focus on the communists themselves through the form of interpersonal relationships and communist ghosts who could not find peace. Without meaning to, perhaps, the novel also gives readers a glimpse of the economy of Indonesia at the time using the example of a flourishing prostitute business and a temporary swimsuit business, among others. Kurniawan projects his feelings about the revolution and coup by constructing a story of theatrical characters around it and delivers a history of the nation all the way from Dutch occupation to Suharto.\n\n{{quote|Revolution is nothing more than a collective running amok, organized by one particular party.|Eka Kurniawan in his novel, ''Beauty is a Wound'' <ref>{{cite book |title=Beauty is a Wound |author1=Eka Kurniawan |page=145}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Louise Doughty]] ''Black Water'' (2016) deals with the 1965 event by exploring them from a European viewpoint. Shifting between California and Indonesia as settings for the novel, the book is written from the perspective of a single man working as an operative for an international company. The novel focuses more on foreign reactions to the coup rather than the coup itself, especially from the foreign journalist community.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Communist Party of Indonesia]]\n* [[Gerwani]]\n* [[Communism in Sumatra]]\n* [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]\n* [[List of massacres in Indonesia]]\n* [[Petrus killings]]\n* ''[[40 Years of Silence: An Indonesian Tragedy]]'', a 2009 documentary film\n* ''[[The Act of Killing]]'', a 2012 documentary film\n* ''[[The Look of Silence]]'', a 2014 documentary film\n* [[Politicide]]\n* [[United States involvement in regime change]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book |language=Indonesian |editor-last=Alham |editor-first=Asahan |title=Di Negeri Orang: Puisi Penyair Indonesia Eksil |trans-title=In Another Person's Country: Poems By Exiled Indonesian Poets |publisher=Lontar Foundation |location=Jakarta |ref=harv |year=2002 |isbn=978-979-8083-42-6}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Allan |first1=Stuart |last2=Zeilzer |first2=Barbie |year=2004 |title=Reporting War: Journalism in Wartime |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |ref=harv}}\n* Bellamy, Alex J.

They argued (following the \"[[Kurgan hypothesis]]\") that the 'proto-Illyrians' had arrived much earlier, during the Bronze Age as nomadic Indo-Europeans from the steppe. From that point, there was a gradual ''Illyrianization'' of the western Balkans leading to historic Illyrians, with no early Iron Age migration from northern Europe. He did not deny a minor cultural impact from the northern Urnfield cultures, however \"these movements had neither a profound influence on the stability.. of the Balkans, nor did they affect the ethnogenesis of the Illyrian ethnos\".{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=19}}\n\n[[Aleksandar Stip\u010devi\u0107]] raised concerns regarding Benac's all-encompassing scenario of autochthonous ethnogenesis. He points out \"can one negate the participation of the bearers of the [[Urnfield culture|field-urn]] culture in the ethnogenesis of the Illyrian tribes who lived in present-day Slovenia and Croatia\" or \"Hellenistic and Mediterranean influences on southern Illyrians and Liburnians?\".{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=19}} He concludes that Benac's model is only applicable to the Illyrian groups in Bosnia, western Serbia and a part of Dalmatia, where there had indeed been a settlement continuity and 'native' progression of pottery sequences since the Bronze Age. Following prevailing trends in discourse on identity in Iron Age Europe, current anthropological perspectives reject older theories of a ''[[longue duree]]'' (long term) ethnogenesis of Illyrians,{{sfn|Dzino|2012}} even where 'archaeological continuity' can be demonstrated to Bronze Age times.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=39}} argues that \"cannot fail to impress through their weight of archaeological evidence; but material remains alone can never tell the whole story and can mislead.\"</ref> They rather see the emergence of historic Illyrians tribes as a more recent phenomenon - just prior to their first attestation.{{sfn|Dzino|2012}}\n\nThe impetus behind the emergence of larger regional groups, such as \"Iapodes\", \"Liburnians\", \"Pannonians\" etc., is traced to increased contacts with the Mediterranean and [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] 'global worlds'.{{sfn|Dzino|2012|pp=74-76}} This catalyzed \"the development of more complex political institutions and the increase in differences between individual communities\".{{sfn|Dzino|2012|p=97}} Emerging local elites selectively adopted either La T\u00e8ne or Hellenistic and, later, Roman cultural templates \"in order to legitimise and strengthen domination within their communities. They were competing fiercely through either alliance or conflict and resistance to Roman expansion. Thus, they established more complex political alliances, which convinced (Greco-Roman) sources to see them as \u2018ethnic\u2019 identities.\"{{sfn|Dzino|2012|pp=84-85}} Contemporary perspectives again highlight that the term \"Illyrian\" was a 'catch-all' exonym used by the Greeks and Romans to denote diverse communities beyond Epirus and Macedonia.

The most numerous traces\u2014still insufficiently studied\u2014of [[religious practice]]s of the pre-Roman era are those relating to [[religious symbol]]ism. Symbols are depicted in every variety of ornament and reveal that the chief object of the prehistoric cult of the Illyrians was the [[Sun]],{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=182}}{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=244}} worshipped in a widespread and complex religious system.{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=182}} The solar deity was depicted as a [[Geometry|geometrical]] figure such as the [[spiral]], the concentric [[circle]] and the [[swastika]], or as an [[animal]] figure the likes of the [[birds]], [[Snake|serpents]] and [[horses]].{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|pp=182, 186}}{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=244}} The symbols of water-fowl and horses were more common in the north, while the serpent was more common in the south.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=244}} Illyrian deities were mentioned in inscriptions on [[statues]], [[monuments]], and [[coins]] of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman period]], and some [[Interpretatio graeca|interpreted]] by Ancient writers through [[comparative religion]].{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=245}}{{sfn|West|2007|p=15}} There appears to be no single most prominent god for all the [[List of ancient Illyrian peoples and tribes|Illyrian tribes]], and a number of deities evidently appear only in specific regions.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=245}}\n\nIn [[Illyris]], [[Deipaturos|Dei-p\u00e1trous]] was a god worshiped as the [[Sky Father]], [[Prende]] was the love-goddess and the consort of the thunder-god [[Perendi]], [[En (deity)|En or Enji]] was the fire-god, Jupiter Parthinus was a chief deity of the [[Parthini]], Redon was a tutelary deity of sailors appearing on many inscriptions in the coastal towns of [[Lissus]], [[Daorson]], [[Scodra]] and [[Dyrrhachium]], while [[Medaurus]] was the protector deity of [[Risinium]], with a monumental equestrian statue dominating the city from the acropolis. In [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]] one of the most popular ritual traditions during the Roman period was the cult of the Roman [[tutelary deity]] of the wild, woods and fields [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], depicted with iconography of [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. The Roman deity of wine, fertility and freedom [[Liber]] was worshipped with the attributes of Silvanus, and those of [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the god protector of boundaries. Tadenus was a Dalmatian deity bearing the identity or epithet of [[Apollo]] in inscriptions found near the source of the Bosna river. The Delmatae also had Armatus as a war god in [[Delminium]]. The Silvanae, a feminine plural of Silvanus, were featured on many dedications across Pannonia. In the hot springs of Topusko ([[Pannonia Superior]]), sacrificial altars were dedicated to Vidasus and Thana (identified with [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]), whose names invariably stand side by side as companions. Aecorna or Arquornia was a lake or river tutelary goddess worshipped exclusively in the cities of [[Nauportus]] and [[Emona]], where she was the most important deity next to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. Laburus was also a local deity worshipped in Emona, perhaps a deity protecting the boatmen sailing.\n\nIt seems that the Illyrians did not develop a uniform cosmology on which to center their religious practices.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=244}} A number of Illyrian toponyms and anthroponyms derived from animal names and reflected the beliefs in animals as [[myth]]ological ancestors and protectors.{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=197}} The [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] was one of the most important animal [[totems]].{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1976|p=235}} Illyrians believed in the force of [[Spell (ritual)|spells]] and the [[evil eye]], in the magic power of protective and beneficial [[amulet]]s which could avert the evil eye or the bad intentions of enemies.{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=182}}{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=245}} Human sacrifice also played a role in the lives of the Illyrians.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=123}}.</ref> [[Arrian]] records the chieftain [[Cleitus (Dardania)|Cleitus the Illyrian]] as sacrificing three boys, three girls and three rams just before his battle with [[Alexander the Great]].<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite book |author1=F.

The kin of the first tumuli was buried around that, and the higher the status of those in these burials the higher the mound. [[Archaeology]] has found many artifacts placed within these tumuli such as weapons, ornaments, garments and clay vessels. The rich spectrum in religious beliefs and burial rituals that emerged in Illyria, especially during the Roman period, may reflect the variation in cultural identities in this region.{{Sfn|Brandt|Ingvaldsen|Prusac|2014|p=249}}\n\n== Archaeology ==\n{{Further|Prehistoric Balkans}}\n\n[[File:Byllis-01-Alb.jpg|thumb|Details of the late antique cathedral complex in [[Byllis]], [[Albania]] and the [[Adriatic sea]] in the distance.]][[File:Daorson.jpg|thumb|right|Walls of ancient Daorson, located at O\u0161ani\u0107i near [[Stolac]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]\n\nThere are few remains to connect with the [[Prehistoric Balkans#Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] with the later Illyrians in the [[western Balkans]].

Most of the remains belong to the fully developed Middle Bronze Age. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nDuring the 7th century BC, the beginning of the Iron Age, the Illyrians emerge as an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form. Various Illyrian tribes appeared, under the influence of the Halstatt cultures from the north, and they organized their regional centers.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=140}} The cult of the dead played an important role in the lives of the Illyrians, which is seen in their carefully made burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of the burial sites. In the northern parts of the Balkans, there existed a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the southern parts, the dead were buried in large stone, or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in [[Herzegovina]] were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 meters wide and 5 meters high. The ''Japodian tribe'' (found from [[Istria]] in [[Croatia]] to [[Biha\u0107]] in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]) have had an affinity for decoration with heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Small sculptures out of jade in form of archaic Ionian plastic are also characteristically Japodian.

They argued (following the \"[[Kurgan hypothesis]]\") that the 'proto-Illyrians' had arrived much earlier, during the Bronze Age as nomadic Indo-Europeans from the steppe. From that point, there was a gradual ''Illyrianization'' of the western Balkans leading to historic Illyrians, with no early Iron Age migration from northern Europe. He did not deny a minor cultural impact from the northern Urnfield cultures, however \"these movements had neither a profound influence on the stability.. of the Balkans, nor did they affect the ethnogenesis of the Illyrian ethnos\".{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=19}}\n\n[[Aleksandar Stip\u010devi\u0107]] raised concerns regarding Benac's all-encompassing scenario of autochthonous ethnogenesis. He points out \"can one negate the participation of the bearers of the [[Urnfield culture|field-urn]] culture in the ethnogenesis of the Illyrian tribes who lived in present-day Slovenia and Croatia\" or \"Hellenistic and Mediterranean influences on southern Illyrians and Liburnians?\".{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=19}} He concludes that Benac's model is only applicable to the Illyrian groups in Bosnia, western Serbia and a part of Dalmatia, where there had indeed been a settlement continuity and 'native' progression of pottery sequences since the Bronze Age. Following prevailing trends in discourse on identity in Iron Age Europe, current anthropological perspectives reject older theories of a ''[[longue duree]]'' (long term) ethnogenesis of Illyrians,{{sfn|Dzino|2012}} even where 'archaeological continuity' can be demonstrated to Bronze Age times.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=39}} argues that \"cannot fail to impress through their weight of archaeological evidence; but material remains alone can never tell the whole story and can mislead.\"</ref> They rather see the emergence of historic Illyrians tribes as a more recent phenomenon - just prior to their first attestation.{{sfn|Dzino|2012}}\n\nThe impetus behind the emergence of larger regional groups, such as \"Iapodes\", \"Liburnians\", \"Pannonians\" etc., is traced to increased contacts with the Mediterranean and [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] 'global worlds'.{{sfn|Dzino|2012|pp=74-76}} This catalyzed \"the development of more complex political institutions and the increase in differences between individual communities\".{{sfn|Dzino|2012|p=97}} Emerging local elites selectively adopted either La T\u00e8ne or Hellenistic and, later, Roman cultural templates \"in order to legitimise and strengthen domination within their communities. They were competing fiercely through either alliance or conflict and resistance to Roman expansion. Thus, they established more complex political alliances, which convinced (Greco-Roman) sources to see them as \u2018ethnic\u2019 identities.\"{{sfn|Dzino|2012|pp=84-85}} Contemporary perspectives again highlight that the term \"Illyrian\" was a 'catch-all' exonym used by the Greeks and Romans to denote diverse communities beyond Epirus and Macedonia.

In [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]] one of the most popular ritual traditions during the Roman period was the cult of the Roman [[tutelary deity]] of the wild, woods and fields [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], depicted with iconography of [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. The Roman deity of wine, fertility and freedom [[Liber]] was worshipped with the attributes of Silvanus, and those of [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the god protector of boundaries. Tadenus was a Dalmatian deity bearing the identity or epithet of [[Apollo]] in inscriptions found near the source of the Bosna river. The Delmatae also had Armatus as a war god in [[Delminium]]. The Silvanae, a feminine plural of Silvanus, were featured on many dedications across Pannonia. In the hot springs of Topusko ([[Pannonia Superior]]), sacrificial altars were dedicated to Vidasus and Thana (identified with [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]), whose names invariably stand side by side as companions. Aecorna or Arquornia was a lake or river tutelary goddess worshipped exclusively in the cities of [[Nauportus]] and [[Emona]], where she was the most important deity next to [[Jupiter]].

In the climax, Rousey performed the [[Professional wrestling throws#Samoan drop|\"Piper's Pit\"]] on Banks after escaping the [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface|\"Bank Statement\"]], giving Rousey her first pinfall victory in the WWE and thus retaining the title.\n\nThe fourth match was the 30-woman Royal Rumble match for a women's championship match at WrestleMania 35. [[Lacey Evans]], making her main roster debut, and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] began the match. NXT\u2019s [[Xia Li]], [[Kairi Sane]], [[Candice LeRae]], [[Kacy Catanzaro]] and [[Io Shirai]] and NXT UK\u2019s [[Rhea Ripley]] were all surprise entrants at #11, #14, #17, #19, #23 and #24 respectively.

In the climax, B\u00e1lor performed the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving stomp|''Coup de Gr\u00e2ce'']] on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar then quickly transitioned the pin into a [[Guard (grappling)#Closed Guard|closed guard]] and applied a [[Armlock#Double wristlock (Gyaku ude-garami)|kimura lock]], forcing B\u00e1lor to submit, thus retaining the title. After the match, Lesnar attacked B\u00e1lor with three [[Suplex#German Suplex|German suplexes]] and an [[Facebuster#Fireman's carry facebuster|''F-5'']].\n\n===Main event===\nThe main event was the 30-man Royal Rumble match for a world championship match at WrestleMania 35.

Jax then received a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Superkick|superkick]] from [[Dolph Ziggler]], a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Tifer feint kick|\"619\"]] from [[Rey Mysterio]], and an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|\"RKO\"]] from [[Randy Orton]] before being eliminated by Mysterio. Jax became the fourth woman to enter a men's Royal Rumble match, the first person to compete in both the men's and women's Royal Rumble matches in the same night, and the first to score eliminations in both matches. In the end, [[Seth Rollins]]  won the match by last eliminating [[Braun Strowman]].\n\n== Aftermath ==\n===Raw===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center|right|upright|direction=horizontal|width1=130|width2=144|image1=Seth Rollins 2017.jpg|image2=Becky Lynch WrestleMania 32 Axxess.jpg|footer=[[Seth Rollins]] and [[Becky Lynch]] were the winners of the men's and women's Royal Rumble matches, respectively}}\nThe following night on ''Raw'', Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey issued an open challenge that was answered by [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]]. After retaining, women's Royal Rumble match winner Becky Lynch made her entrance and confronted Rousey. After recapping their rivalry that began at [[Survivor Series (2018)|Survivor Series]], Lynch chose to face Rousey for the Raw Women's Championship at WrestleMania 35.\n\nSeth Rollins celebrated his Royal Rumble match victory. Triple H then came out and congratulated him, but said that Rollins needed to choose which champion he wanted to face at WrestleMania 35 by the end of the night. Backstage, Braun Strowman, the runner up in the Royal Rumble match, confronted Rollins and told him he \"earned it\", and to \"make the right decision\". Later, Rollins confronted Brock Lesnar. After an ensuing brawl, Rollins chose to face Lesnar for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania 35.\n\nFinn B\u00e1lor addressed his loss to Brock Lesnar, but stated that he made Lesnar believe that B\u00e1lor could win. B\u00e1lor was then confronted by [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Bobby Lashley]] and his manager [[Lio Rush]], and Lashley attacked B\u00e1lor.\n\n===SmackDown===\nOn the following ''SmackDown'', Becky Lynch addressed how everything had changed for her since winning the women's Royal Rumble match. Charlotte Flair then came out and congratulated Lynch and stated that although Lynch won, she was never truly in the match in the first place, and that Lynch would not be where she was at if it were not for Flair. An ensuing brawl broke out between Flair and Lynch until referees separated them.\n\nAs compensation for not being able to compete in the men's Royal Rumble match, R-Truth was granted a United States Championship match against new champion Shinsuke Nakamura. Truth defeated Nakamura to win the title, which led to Rusev coming out and declaring that Truth was not worthy of the title. Rusev then challenged Truth for the title, but was also defeated. After the match, Rusev turned heel and, along with Nakamura, attacked Truth.\n\nDaniel Bryan, along with his new ally Rowan, revealed a new custom WWE Championship belt, made from hemp and wood. He was then interrupted by AJ Styles, which prompted Jeff Hardy, Samoa Joe, Randy Orton, and Mustafa Ali to come out and challenge Bryan for the title. After an ensuing brawl, Triple H announced that Bryan would defend the title against the five at the [[Elimination Chamber (2019)|Elimination Chamber]] pay-per-view inside the [[Elimination Chamber]]. Ali, however, was replaced by Kofi Kingston after suffering an injury.\n\nNew SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Miz and Shane McMahon celebrated their title win along with Miz's father. Later that night, The Usos defeated Heavy Machinery (Otis Dozovic and Tucker Knight), The Bar (Sheamus and Cesaro), and The New Day (represented by Big E and Kofi Kingston) to become the number one contenders for the titles at Elimination Chamber.\n\n==Results==\n{{Professional wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preRR2019\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=WWE Royal Rumble 2019 Kickoff Show live review: AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee for the U.S. Championship, AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/01/27/wwe-royal-rumble-2019-kickoff-show-live-review-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-for-the-u-s-championship-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-for-the-wwe-cruiserweight-championship/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"RR2019\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=Powell\u2019s WWE Royal Rumble 2019 live review: Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Royal Rumble matches, AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee for the WWE Universal Championship, AJ Lee vs. Not AJ Lee for the WWE Championship, AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee for the Raw Women\u2019s Championship|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/01/27/powells-wwe-royal-rumble-2019-live-review-mens-and-womens-royal-rumble-matches-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-for-the-wwe-championsh/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Bobby Roode]] and [[Chad Gable]] defeated [[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Rezar (wrestler)|Rezar]] (with [[Drake Maverick]])\n|stip1  = [[Professional wrestling match types#Tag team match|Tag team match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pappolla|first1=Ryan|title=Raw Tag Team Champions Bobby Roode & Chad Gable def.

It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]], dubbed the \"Big Four\".<ref>Ian Hamilton. ''Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition'' (p. 160)</ref> It is named after the [[Royal Rumble match]], a modified [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The [[Royal Rumble (2018)|previous year's event]] added a women's version of the match, and it and the men's generally feature 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championship]] match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2019, the men and women could choose to challenge for either brand's top championship at [[WrestleMania 35]]: the men had their choice between [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]'s [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]] or [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]'s [[WWE Championship]], while the women could choose either the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship|Raw Women's Championship]] or [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Championship]]. 2019 was the thirty-second event in the Royal Rumble chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]], with some [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] wrestlers and WWE veterans appearing in both the men's and women's Royal Rumble matches.<ref name=wwematch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/royalrumble|title=Specialty Matches: Royal Rumble|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref><ref name=stats>{{cite web|last=Waldman|title=Statistical survival \u2013 breaking down the Royal Rumble|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/01/917194.html|first=Jon|publisher=SLAM!

[[Lacey Evans]], making her main roster debut, and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] began the match. NXT\u2019s [[Xia Li]], [[Kairi Sane]], [[Candice LeRae]], [[Kacy Catanzaro]] and [[Io Shirai]] and NXT UK\u2019s [[Rhea Ripley]] were all surprise entrants at #11, #14, #17, #19, #23 and #24 respectively. [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]] was scheduled to enter the match at number 28 but still suffered from her injury from the pre-show. Becky Lynch appeared and was allowed to take Lana's spot. In the end, Lynch then won the women's Royal Rumble match by last eliminating Charlotte Flair.\n\nAfter that, Daniel Bryan defended the WWE Championship against AJ Styles.

In the climax, B\u00e1lor performed the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving stomp|''Coup de Gr\u00e2ce'']] on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar then quickly transitioned the pin into a [[Guard (grappling)#Closed Guard|closed guard]] and applied a [[Armlock#Double wristlock (Gyaku ude-garami)|kimura lock]], forcing B\u00e1lor to submit, thus retaining the title. After the match, Lesnar attacked B\u00e1lor with three [[Suplex#German Suplex|German suplexes]] and an [[Facebuster#Fireman's carry facebuster|''F-5'']].\n\n===Main event===\nThe main event was the 30-man Royal Rumble match for a world championship match at WrestleMania 35. [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] began the match at number one and was interrupted by [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Jeff Jarrett]], entering the match at number 2. [[NXT North American Championship|NXT North American Champion]] [[Johnny Gargano]], [[WWE United Kingdom Championship|WWE United Kingdom Champion]] [[Pete Dunne (wrestler)|Pete Dunne]] and [[Aleister Black]] were surprise entrants at #6, #18 and #21 respectively. As #30 entrant [[R-Truth]] made his entrance, he was attacked by Nia Jax, who took his spot and eliminated [[Mustafa Ali (wrestler)|Mustafa Ali]]. Jax then received a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Superkick|superkick]] from [[Dolph Ziggler]], a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Tifer feint kick|\"619\"]] from [[Rey Mysterio]], and an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|\"RKO\"]] from [[Randy Orton]] before being eliminated by Mysterio. Jax became the fourth woman to enter a men's Royal Rumble match, the first person to compete in both the men's and women's Royal Rumble matches in the same night, and the first to score eliminations in both matches. In the end, [[Seth Rollins]]  won the match by last eliminating [[Braun Strowman]].\n\n== Aftermath ==\n===Raw===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center|right|upright|direction=horizontal|width1=130|width2=144|image1=Seth Rollins 2017.jpg|image2=Becky Lynch WrestleMania 32 Axxess.jpg|footer=[[Seth Rollins]] and [[Becky Lynch]] were the winners of the men's and women's Royal Rumble matches, respectively}}\nThe following night on ''Raw'', Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey issued an open challenge that was answered by [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]]. After retaining, women's Royal Rumble match winner Becky Lynch made her entrance and confronted Rousey. After recapping their rivalry that began at [[Survivor Series (2018)|Survivor Series]], Lynch chose to face Rousey for the Raw Women's Championship at WrestleMania 35.\n\nSeth Rollins celebrated his Royal Rumble match victory. Triple H then came out and congratulated him, but said that Rollins needed to choose which champion he wanted to face at WrestleMania 35 by the end of the night. Backstage, Braun Strowman, the runner up in the Royal Rumble match, confronted Rollins and told him he \"earned it\", and to \"make the right decision\". Later, Rollins confronted Brock Lesnar. After an ensuing brawl, Rollins chose to face Lesnar for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania 35.\n\nFinn B\u00e1lor addressed his loss to Brock Lesnar, but stated that he made Lesnar believe that B\u00e1lor could win. B\u00e1lor was then confronted by [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Bobby Lashley]] and his manager [[Lio Rush]], and Lashley attacked B\u00e1lor.\n\n===SmackDown===\nOn the following ''SmackDown'', Becky Lynch addressed how everything had changed for her since winning the women's Royal Rumble match. Charlotte Flair then came out and congratulated Lynch and stated that although Lynch won, she was never truly in the match in the first place, and that Lynch would not be where she was at if it were not for Flair. An ensuing brawl broke out between Flair and Lynch until referees separated them.\n\nAs compensation for not being able to compete in the men's Royal Rumble match, R-Truth was granted a United States Championship match against new champion Shinsuke Nakamura. Truth defeated Nakamura to win the title, which led to Rusev coming out and declaring that Truth was not worthy of the title. Rusev then challenged Truth for the title, but was also defeated. After the match, Rusev turned heel and, along with Nakamura, attacked Truth.\n\nDaniel Bryan, along with his new ally Rowan, revealed a new custom WWE Championship belt, made from hemp and wood. He was then interrupted by AJ Styles, which prompted Jeff Hardy, Samoa Joe, Randy Orton, and Mustafa Ali to come out and challenge Bryan for the title. After an ensuing brawl, Triple H announced that Bryan would defend the title against the five at the [[Elimination Chamber (2019)|Elimination Chamber]] pay-per-view inside the [[Elimination Chamber]]. Ali, however, was replaced by Kofi Kingston after suffering an injury.\n\nNew SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Miz and Shane McMahon celebrated their title win along with Miz's father. Later that night, The Usos defeated Heavy Machinery (Otis Dozovic and Tucker Knight), The Bar (Sheamus and Cesaro), and The New Day (represented by Big E and Kofi Kingston) to become the number one contenders for the titles at Elimination Chamber.\n\n==Results==\n{{Professional wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preRR2019\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=WWE Royal Rumble 2019 Kickoff Show live review: AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee for the U.S. Championship, AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/01/27/wwe-royal-rumble-2019-kickoff-show-live-review-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-for-the-u-s-championship-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-for-the-wwe-cruiserweight-championship/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"RR2019\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=Powell\u2019s WWE Royal Rumble 2019 live review: Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Royal Rumble matches, AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee for the WWE Universal Championship, AJ Lee vs. Not AJ Lee for the WWE Championship, AJ Lee vs. AJ Lee for the Raw Women\u2019s Championship|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/01/27/powells-wwe-royal-rumble-2019-live-review-mens-and-womens-royal-rumble-matches-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-aj-lee-vs-aj-lee-for-the-wwe-championsh/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Bobby Roode]] and [[Chad Gable]] defeated [[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Rezar (wrestler)|Rezar]] (with [[Drake Maverick]])\n|stip1  = [[Professional wrestling match types#Tag team match|Tag team match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pappolla|first1=Ryan|title=Raw Tag Team Champions Bobby Roode & Chad Gable def.

Many scientific drawings including ''[[Vitruvian Man|The Vitruvian Man]]''.\n}}\n[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519) was an Italian [[polymath]], regarded as the epitome of the \"Renaissance Man\", displaying skills in numerous diverse areas of study. Whilst most famous for his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and the ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', Leonardo is also renowned in the fields of [[civil engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geometry]], [[hydrodynamics]], [[mathematics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[optics]], [[physics]], [[pyrotechnics]], and [[zoology]].  \n\nWhile the full extent of his scientific studies has only become recognized in the last 150 years, during his lifetime he was employed for his engineering and skill of invention. Many of his designs, such as the movable [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing the [[parachute]], the [[helicopter]], an armored fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated [[solar power]], a [[calculator]], a rudimentary theory of [[plate tectonics]] and the [[double hull]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Innocenzi |first1=Plinio |title=The innovators behind Leonardo: The True Story of the Scientific and Technological Renaissance |date=2018 |publisher=Cham: Springer International Publishing |isbn=9783319904481}}</ref> In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of [[anatomy]], [[astronomy]], civil engineering, optics, and the study of water (hydrodynamics).\n\nLeonardo's most famous drawing, the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent the concept of [[macrocosm and microcosm]] in [[Renaissance humanism]].\n\n==Condensed biography==\n{{Main|Leonardo da Vinci}}\n[[File:Study of a Tuscan Landscape.jpg|thumb|The Arno Valley]]\n\n:NOTE: This is a brief summary of Leonardo's early life and journals with particular emphasis on his introduction to science.<!--- Please do not expand this section unless it relates SPECIFICALLY to Leonardo's study of science--->\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 \u2013 May 2, 1519) was born the illegitimate son of Messer Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. His early life was spent in the region of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the valley of the [[Arno River]] near [[Florence]], firstly with his mother and in later childhood in the household of his father, grandfather and uncle Francesco.\n\nHis curiosity and interest in scientific observation were stimulated by his uncle Francesco, while his grandfather's keeping of [[Diary|journals]] set an example which he was to follow for most of his life, diligently recording in his own journals both the events of the day, his visual observations, his plans and his projects. The journals of Leonardo contain matters as mundane as grocery lists and as remarkable as diagrams for the construction of a [[Early flying machines#The Renaissance|flying machine]].\n\nIn 1466, Leonardo was sent to Florence to the workshop of the artist [[Verrocchio]], in order to learn the skills of an artist. At the workshop, as well as painting and drawing, he learnt the study of topographical anatomy.<ref>''Topographical anatomy'' is the anatomy that is visible on the surface of the body.</ref>  He was also exposed to a very wide range of technical skills such as [[Technical drawing|drafting]], [[set construction]], [[plaster]]working, paint chemistry, and [[metallurgy]].\n[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|From Leonardo's journals \u2013 studies of an old man and the action of water.]]\n\nAmong the older artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's scientific interest was [[Piero della Francesca]], then a man in his 60s, who was one of the earliest artists to systematically employ [[linear perspective]] in his paintings, and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the [[Annunciation]] show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was profoundly observant of nature, his curiosity having been stimulated in early childhood by his discovery of a deep cave in the mountains and his intense desire to know what lay inside. His earliest dated drawing, 1473, is of the valley of the Arno River, where he lived. It displays some of the many scientific interests that were to obsess him all his life, in particular geology and hydrology.\n<ref name=LB>Liana Bortolon, ''The Life and Times of Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, 1967</ref>\n\n==Approach to scientific investigation==\n[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|thumb|upright|Investigating the motion of the arm.]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the study of art and science was not perceived as mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the one was seen as informing upon the other. Although Leonardo's training was primarily as an artist, it was largely through his scientific approach to the art of painting, and his development of a style that coupled his scientific knowledge with his unique ability to render what he saw that created the outstanding masterpieces of art for which he is famous.\n\nAs a scientist, Leonardo had no formal education in [[Latin]] and [[mathematics]] and did not attend a [[university]]. Because of these factors, his scientific studies were largely ignored by other scholars. Leonardo's approach to science was one of intense observation and detailed recording, his tools of investigation being almost exclusively his eyes. His journals give insight into his investigative processes.\n\nAs a researcher, Leonardo divided nature and phenomena into ever smaller segments, concretely with knives and measuring instruments, intellectually with formulas and numbers, to wrest the secrets of creation from it. The smaller the particles, runs the assumption; the closer one will get to the solution of the enigmas.<ref>{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Marc van den Broek]]|Title=Leonardo da Vinci Spirits of Invention.

Capra sees Leonardo's unique integrated, holistic views of science as making him a forerunner of modern systems theory and complexity schools of thought.<ref>Capra, Fritjof. The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Genius of the Renaissance. (New York, Doubleday, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Leonardo's notes and journals==\n\n[https://english-biography.com/ Leonardo da Vinci] kept a series of [[Diary|journals]] in which he wrote almost daily, as well as separate notes and sheets of observations, comments and plans. He wrote and drew with his left hand, and most of his writing is in [[Mirror writing|mirror script]], which makes it difficult to read. Much has survived to illustrate Leonardo's studies, discoveries and inventions.\n\nOn his death, the writings were left mainly to his pupil and heir [[Francesco Melzi]], with the apparent intention that his scientific work should be published. Sometime before 1542, Melzi gathered together the papers for ''A Treatise on Painting'' from eighteen of Leonardo's 'books' (two-thirds of which have gone missing).{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=170}} The publishing did not take place in Melzi's lifetime, and the writings were eventually bound in different forms and dispersed. Some of his works were published as a ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]'' 165 years after his  death.\n\n==Publication==\n\nLeonardo illustrated a book on mathematical proportion in art written by his friend [[Luca Pacioli]] and called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'', published in 1509. He was also preparing a major treatise on his scientific observations and mechanical inventions. It was to be divided into a number of sections or \"Books\", Leonardo leaving some instructions as to how they were to be ordered. Many sections of it appear in his notebooks.\n\nThese pages deal with scientific subjects generally but also specifically as they touch upon the creation of artworks. In relating to art, this is not science that is dependent upon experimentation or the testing of theories. It deals with detailed observation, particularly the observation of the natural world, and includes a great deal about the visual effects of light on different natural substances such as foliage.<ref name=JPR>''Jean Paul Richter'' editor 1880, ''[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci]'' Dover, 1970, {{ISBN|0-486-22572-0}}. (accessed 2007-02-04)</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Begun at Florence, in the house of Piero di Braccio Martelli, on the 22nd day of March 1508. And this is to be a collection without order, taken from many papers which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they may treat. But I believe that before I am at the end of this [task] I shall have to repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them [all] and say: \u2018I will not write this because I wrote it before.\u2019 And if I wished to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to copy [a passage] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next.<ref name= JPR/></blockquote>\n\n==Natural science==\n[[File:Study of the Graduations of Shadows on Spheres.jpg|thumb|upright|Study of the graduations of light and shade on a sphere ([[chiaroscuro]]).]]\n\n===Light===\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These are; diffused light as that of the atmosphere; And Direct, as that of the sun; The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is that which passes through [translucent] bodies, as linen or paper etc.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'']]\n\nFor an artist working in the 15th century, some study of the nature of [[light]] was essential. It was by the effective painting of light falling on a surface that ''modelling'', or a three-dimensional appearance was to be achieved in a two-dimensional medium. It was also well understood by artists like Leonardo's teacher, [[Verrocchio]], that an appearance of space and distance could be achieved in a background landscape by painting in tones that were less in contrast and colors that were less bright than in the foreground of the painting. The effects of light on solids were achieved by trial and error, since few artists except [[Piero della Francesca]] actually had accurate scientific knowledge of the subject.\n\nAt the time when Leonardo commenced painting, it was unusual for figures to be painted with extreme contrast of light and shade. Faces, in particular, were shadowed in a manner that was bland and maintained all the features and contours clearly visible. Leonardo broke with this.\nIn the painting generally titled ''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'' (about 1483) he sets the figure [[diagonal]]ly to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The back of her head and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused in such a way that the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.\n\nLeonardo's treatment of light in paintings such as ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' was to change forever the way in which artists perceived light and used it in their paintings. Of all Leonardo's scientific legacies, this is probably the one that had the most immediate and noticeable effect.\n\n===Human anatomy===\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\n...to obtain a true and perfect knowledge ... I have dissected more than ten human bodies, destroying all the other members, and removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these veins are surrounded, ... and as one single body would not last so long, since it was necessary to proceed with several bodies by degrees, until I came to an end and had a complete knowledge; this I repeated twice, to learn the differences...<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Proportions of the Head.jpg|thumb|Study of the proportions of the head.]]\n\n====Topographic anatomy====\nLeonardo began the formal study of the topographical [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] when apprenticed to [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. As a student he would have been taught to draw the human body from life, to memorize the muscles, tendons and visible subcutaneous structure and to familiarise himself with the mechanics of the various parts of the skeletal and muscular structure. It was common workshop practice to have plaster casts of parts of the human anatomy available for students to study and draw.\n[[File:Anatomy of a Male Nude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Two anatomical studies]]\nIf, as is thought to be the case, Leonardo painted the torso and arms of Christ in ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' on which he famously collaborated with his master Verrocchio, then his understanding of topographical anatomy had surpassed that of his master at an early age as can be seen by a comparison of the arms of Christ with those of [[John the Baptist]] in the same painting.\n\nIn the 1490s he wrote about demonstrating muscles and sinews to students:\n\n<blockquote>Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle, you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the ligaments of the bones.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nHis continued investigations in this field occupied many pages of notes, each dealing systematically with a particular aspect of anatomy. It appears that the notes were intended for publication, a task entrusted on his death to his pupil [[Francesco Melzi|Melzi]].\n\nIn conjunction with studies of aspects of the body are drawings of faces displaying different emotions and many drawings of people suffering facial deformity, either congenital or through illness. Some of these drawings, generally referred to as \"caricatures\", on analysis of the skeletal proportions, appear to be based on anatomical studies.\n\n====Dissection====\n{{see also|Studies of the Fetus in the Womb}}\n[[File:View of a Skull III.jpg|thumb|upright|Dissection of the skull.]]\nAs Leonardo became successful as an artist, he was given permission to dissect human corpses at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]] in Florence. Later he dissected in Milan at the hospital Maggiore, and in Rome at the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Ospedale di Santo Spirito]] (the first mainland Italian hospital). From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]].\n\n<blockquote>I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their natural size.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn 30 years, Leonardo dissected 30 male and female corpses of different ages. Together with Marcantonio, he prepared to publish a theoretical work on anatomy and made more than 200 drawings. However, his book was published only in 1680 (161 years after his death) under the heading ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]''.\n[[File:DaVinciCardiovascularWoman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The organs of a woman's body]]\nAmong the detailed images that Leonardo drew are many studies of the [[human skeleton]]. He was the first to describe the double S form of the [[Vertebral column|backbone]]. He also studied the inclination of [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and [[sacrum]] and stressed that sacrum was not uniform, but composed of five fused [[vertebrae]]. He also studied the anatomy of the human foot and its connection to the leg, and from these studies, he was able to further his studies in biomechanics.\n\nLeonardo was a [[Physiology|physiologist]] as well as an anatomist, studying the function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the [[human skull]] and cross-sections of the [[human brain|brain]], [[Transverse plane|transversal]], [[sagittal]], and [[Frontal bone|frontal]]. These drawings may be linked to a search for the ''[[sensus communis]]'', the locus of the human senses,<ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.\n\n[[File:Views of a Foetus in the Womb.jpg|thumb|Studies of a f\u0153tus from Leonardo's journals]]\nLeonardo studied internal organs, being the first to draw the human [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and the [[lung]]s, [[mesentery]], [[urinary tract]], [[reproductive organs]], the muscles of the [[cervix]] and a detailed cross-section of [[coitus]]. He was one of the first to draw a scientific representation of the [[fetus]] in the intrautero.\n\nLeonardo studied the [[vascular system]] and drew a dissected [[heart]] in detail. He correctly worked out how heart valves ebb the flow of blood yet he  did not fully understand [[Blood circulation|circulation]], as he believed that blood was pumped to the muscles where it was consumed. In 2005 a UK heart surgeon, Francis Wells, from Papworth Hospital Cambridge, pioneered repair to damaged hearts, using Leonardo's depiction of the opening phase of the mitral valve to operate without changing its diameter allowing an individual to recover more quickly. Wells said \"Leonardo had a depth of appreciation of the anatomy and physiology of the body \u2013 its structure and function \u2013 that perhaps has been overlooked by some.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/health/4289204.stm |title=Da Vinci clue for heart surgeon |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's observational acumen, drawing skill, and the clarity of depiction of bone structures reveal him at his finest as an anatomist. However, his depiction of the internal soft tissues of the body are incorrect in many ways, showing that he maintained concepts of anatomy and functioning that were in some cases millennia old, and that his investigations were probably hampered by the lack of preservation techniques available at the time. Leonardo's detailed drawing of the internal organs of a woman <small>(See left)</small> reveal many traditional misconceptions.<ref name=MK>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo'', Oxford University Press, (2004) {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}}</ref><ref>[http://www.livescience.com/20046-10-odd-facts-female-reproductive-system.html Live Science]</ref>\n\nLeonardo's study of [[human anatomy]] led also to the design of an [[automaton]] which has come to be called [[Leonardo's robot]], was probably made around the year 1495 but was rediscovered only in the 1950s.\n\n===Comparative anatomy===\n[[File:Leonardo anatomy of dog and man.JPG|thumb|upright|Comparison of the leg of a man and a dog.]]\nLeonardo not only studied human anatomy, but the anatomy of many other animals as well. He dissected [[cows]], [[birds]], [[monkeys]] and [[frogs]], comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. On one page of his journal Leonardo drew five profile studies of a horse with its teeth bared in anger and, for comparison, a snarling lion and a snarling man.\n\n<blockquote>I have found that in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn the early 1490s Leonardo was commissioned to create a monument in honour of [[Francesco Sforza]]. In his notebooks are a series of plans for an equestrian monument. There are also a large number of related anatomical studies of horses. They include several [[Leonardo's horse|diagrams of a standing horse]] with the angles and proportions annotated, anatomical studies of horses' heads, a dozen detailed drawings of hooves and numerous studies and sketches of horses rearing.\n\nHe studied the topographical anatomy of a bear in detail, making many drawings of its paws. There is also a drawing of the muscles and tendons of the bear's hind feet.\nOther drawings of particular interest include the uterus of a pregnant cow, the hindquarters of a decrepit mule and studies of the musculature of a little dog.\n\n===Botany===\nThe science of [[botany]] was long established by Leonardo's time, a treatise on the subject having been written as early as 300&nbsp;BCE.<ref>E.g. Theophrastus, ''On the History of Plants''.</ref> Leonardo's study of plants, resulting in many beautiful drawings in his notebooks, was not to record in diagramatic form the parts of the plant, but rather, as an artist and observer to record the precise appearance of plants, the manner of growth and the way that individual plants and flowers of a single variety differed from one another.\n\n[[File:Sedge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Study of sedge]]\n\nOne such study shows a page with several species of flower of which ten drawings are of wild violets. Along with a drawing of the growing plant and a detail of a leaf, Leonardo has repeatedly drawn single flowers from different angles, with their heads set differently on the stem.\n\nApart from flowers the notebooks contain many drawings of crop plants including several types of grain and a variety of berries including a detailed study of [[bramble]]. There are also water plants such as [[Iris (plant)|irises]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]. His notebooks also direct the artist to observe how light reflects from foliage at different distances and under different [[weather|atmospheric conditions]].\n\nA number of the drawings have their equivalents in Leonardo's paintings. An elegant study of a stem of [[lily|lilies]] may have been for one of Leonardo's early Annunciation paintings, carried in the hand of the Archangel Gabriel. In both the Annunciation pictures the grass is dotted with blossoming plants.\n\nThe plants which appear in both the versions of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' reflects the results of Leonardo's studies in a meticulous realism that makes each plant readily identifiable to the botanist.\n\nIn his writings, da Vinci proposed the following [[da Vinci branching rule|branching rule]]:\n\n<blockquote>All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them].<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Leonardo topographical map.JPG|thumb|upright|A topographical map]]\n\nAs an adult, Leonardo had only two childhood memories, one of which was the finding of a cave in the Apennines. Although fearing that he might be attacked by a wild beast, he ventured in driven \"by the burning desire to see whether there might be any marvelous thing within.\"\n\nLeonardo's earliest dated drawing is a study of the [[Arno valley]], strongly emphasizing its geological features. His notebooks contain landscapes with a wealth of geological observation from the regions of both [[Florence]] and [[Milan]], often including atmospheric effects such as a heavy rainstorm pouring down on a town at the foot of a mountain range.\n\nIt had been observed for many years that [[Stratum|strata]] in mountains often contained bands of sea shells. Conservative science said that these could be explained by the [[Great Flood]] described in the Bible. Leonardo's observations convinced him that this could not possibly be the case.\n\n[[File:Virgin of the Rocks (Louvre).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'']]\n\n<blockquote>And a little beyond the sandstone conglomerate, a [[tufa]] has been formed, where it turned towards Castel Florentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom of the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and various marine objects are found there.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nThis quotation makes clear the breadth of Leonardo's understanding of [[geology]], including the action of water in creating [[sedimentary rock]], the [[plate tectonics|tectonic action]] of the Earth in raising the sea bed and the action of [[erosion]] in the creation of [[landform|geographical features]].\n\nIn Leonardo's earliest paintings we see the remarkable attention given to the small [[landscape]]s of the background, with lakes and water, swathed in a misty light. In the larger of the ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' paintings is a town on the edge of a lake. Although distant, the mountains can be seen to be scored by vertical strata. This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] and [[Lago d'Iseo]] in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'', which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.<ref>The London painting of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' is denounced by the geologist Ann C. Pizzorusso, [http://www.leonardosgeology.com] of New York, as largely by the hand of someone other than Leonardo, because the rocks appear incongruous and the lake looks like a fjord. Pizzorusso says \"Fjords do not exist in Italy and it is highly unlikely the glacial lakes of the Lombard region would have such steep relief surrounding them.\" In fact, the [[glacial lake]], Garda, has just such steep geological formations. The sedimentary red limestone which appears in the picture is also typical of Italy.</ref>\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Leonardo da vinci, Town plan of Imola.jpg|thumb|Leonardo's accurate map of Imola for Cesare Borgia.]]\nIn the early 16th century [[map]]s were rare and often inaccurate. Leonardo produced several extremely accurate maps such as the town plan of [[Imola]] created in 1502 in order to win the [[patronage]] of [[Cesare Borgia]]. Borgia was so impressed that he hired him as a [[military engineer]] and [[architect]]. Leonardo also produced a map of [[Chiana Valley]] in [[Tuscany]], which he surveyed, without the benefit of modern equipment, by pacing the distances. In 1515, Leonardo produced a map of the Roman Southern Coast which is linked to his work for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and relates to his plans to drain the marshland.\n\nRecent research by Donato Pezzutto suggests that the background landscapes in Leonardo\u2019s paintings depict specific locations as aerial views with enhanced depth, employing a technique called [[Cartography|cartographic perspective]]. Pezzutto  identifies the location of the ''Mona Lisa'' to the Val di Chiana, the ''Annunciation'' to the Arno Valley, the ''[[Madonna of the Yarnwinder]]'' to the Adda Valley and ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St Anne]]'' to the Sessia Valley.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.opusej.org/library/leonardos-landscapes-as-maps-cover-page/|publisher=OPUSeJ|first=Donato|last=Pezzutto|title=Leonardo\u2019s Landscapes as Maps|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Hydrodynamics===\n[[File:Studies of Water passing Obstacles and falling.jpg|thumb|upright|Studies of water]]\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\nAll the branches of a water [course] at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nAmong Leonardo's drawings are many that are studies of the motion of water, in particular the forms taken by fast-flowing water on striking different surfaces.\n\nMany of these drawings depict the spiralling nature of water. The [[spiral]] form had been studied in the art of the [[Ancient Greek art|Classical era]] and strict [[Golden ratio|mathematical proportion]] had been applied to its use in art and [[architecture]]. An awareness of these rules of proportion had been revived in the early [[italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. In Leonardo's drawings can be seen the investigation of the spiral as it occurs in water.\n\nThere are several elaborate drawings of water curling over an object placed at a diagonal to its course. There are several drawings of water dropping from a height and curling upwards in spiral forms. One such drawing, as well as curling waves, shows splashes and details of spray and bubbles.\n\nLeonardo's interest manifested itself in the drawing of streams and rivers, the action of water in eroding rocks, and the cataclysmic action of water in floods and tidal waves. The knowledge that he gained from his studies was employed in devising a range of projects, particularly in relation to the Arno River. None of the major works was brought to completion.\n\n===Astronomy===\nLeonardo lived at a time when [[geocentric]] theories were the most widely used explanations to account for the relationship between the Earth and Sun's movement. He wrote that \"The Sun has substance, shape, movement, radiance, heat, and generative power; and these qualities all emanate from itself without its diminution.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Dr. Mario |title=The Da Vinci Astronomy |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-da-vinci-astronomy_b_4065100 |website=Huff Post |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> He further wrote,\n<blockquote>The earth is not in the centre of the Sun's orbit nor at the centre of the universe, but in the centre of its companion elements, and united with them. And any one standing on the moon, when it and the sun are both beneath us, would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon, and the earth would light it as it lights us.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A63kDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT312 Da Vinci's notebooks] on astronomy.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn one of his notebooks, there is a note in the margin which states, \"The Sun does not move,\" which may indicate Leonardo's support of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Leonardo Da Vinci |url=http://giantsofscience.weebly.com/leonardo-da-vinci-vj.html |website=Giants of Science |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy===\nClaims are sometimes made that Leonardo da Vinci was an [[Alchemy|alchemist]]. He was trained in the workshop of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist in so much as that he experimented with different media for suspending [[Pigment|paint pigment]]. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' deteriorating within a century, and ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (Leonardo)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' running off the wall. In Leonardo's many pages of notes about artistic processes, there are some that pertain to the use of silver and gold in artworks, information he would have learned as a student.<ref name=Moran>Bruce T. Moran, ''Distilling Knowledge, Chemistry, Alchemy and the Scientific Revolution'', (2005) {{ISBN|0-674-01495-2}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's scientific process was based mainly upon observation. His practical experiments are also founded in observation rather than belief. Leonardo, who questioned the order of the [[solar system]] and the deposit of fossils by the [[Noah's Ark|Great Flood]], had little time for the alchemical quests to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]] or create a [[Philosopher's stone|potion]] that gave eternal life.\n\nLeonardo said about alchemists:\n\n<blockquote>The false interpreters of nature declare that quicksilver is the common seed of every metal, not remembering that nature varies the seed according to the variety of the things she desires to produce in the world.<ref name= JPR /><ref>\"Quicksilver\" is an old name for mercury.</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Old alchemists... have never either by chance or by experiment succeeded in creating the smallest element that can be created by nature; however [they] deserve unmeasured praise for the usefulness of things invented for the use of men, and would deserve it even more if they had not been the inventors of noxious things like poisons and other similar things which destroy life or mind.\"''<ref name=Notebooks>Irma Ann Richter and Teresa Wells, ''Leonardo da Vinci \u2013 Notebooks'', Oxford University Press (2008) {{ISBN|978-0-19-929902-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Mathematical studies==\n\n===Perspective===\n<blockquote>The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat appear in relief and what is in relief flat.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 15th century, both [[Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] made studies of [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. In 1436 Alberti published ''[[De pictura]]'' (\"On Painting\"), which includes his findings on linear perspective. [[Piero della Francesca]] carried his work forward and by the 1470s a number of artists were able to produce works of art that demonstrated a full understanding of the principles of linear perspective. \n[[File:Leonardo study AdorationofMagi.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Draft of the perspective for ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'']]\n\nLeonardo studied linear perspective and employed it in his earlier paintings. His use of perspective in the two [[Annunciation]]s is daring, as he uses various features such as the corner of a building, a [[walled garden]] and a path to contrast enclosure and spaciousness.\n\nThe unfinished ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' was intended to be a masterpiece revealing much of Leonardo's knowledge of figure drawing and perspective. There exists a number of studies that he made, including a detailed study of the perspective, showing the complex background of ruined [[Roman architecture|Classical buildings]] that he planned for the left of the picture. In addition, Leonardo is credited with the first use of [[anamorphosis]], the use of a \"perspective\" to produce an image that is intelligible only with a curved mirror or from a specific vantage point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionworks.com/mod/anamorph.htm# |title=Animations of anamorphosis of Leonardo and other artists |publisher=Illusionworks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of drawing.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geometry===\n[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|upright|The [[rhombicuboctahedron]], as published in ''[[De divina proportione]]'']]\nWhile in Milan in 1496, Leonardo met a traveling [[monk]] and academic, [[Luca Pacioli]]. Under him, Leonardo studied [[mathematic]]s. Pacioli, who first codified and recorded the [[double entry]] system of bookkeeping,<ref>[http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm L.

Leonardo prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates. ''De divina proportione'' was published in 1509.\n\n<blockquote>All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of [[mathematician]]s, which are:\u2014the point, the line, the angle, the superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Engineering and invention==\n[[Vasari]] in ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|The Lives]]''  says of Leonardo:\n\n<blockquote>He made designs for mills, [[fulling]] machines<!-- a fulling machine is used in the production of cloth --> and engines that could be driven by water-power... In addition he used to make models and plans showing how to excavate and tunnel through mountains without difficulty, so as to pass from one level to another; and he demonstrated how to lift and draw great weights by means of levers, hoists and winches, and ways of cleansing harbours and using pumps to suck up water from great depths.</blockquote>\n\n===Practical inventions and projects===\n{{see also|Leonardo's self-propelled cart|Leonardo's robot}}\n[[File:Leonardo machine for grinding convex lenses.JPG|thumb|upright|A machine for grinding convex lenses]]\nWith the same rational and analytical approach that he used in anatomic studies, Leonardo faced the study and design of a bewildering number of machines and devices. He drew their \u201canatomy\u201d with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, include a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components. Those studies and projects have been collected in his codices and fill more than 5,000 pages.<ref name=\"guarnieri1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2019|title=Reconsidering Leonardo|journal= IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=13|issue=3|pages=35\u201338|doi=10.1109/MIE.2019.2929366|ref=harv}}</ref> Leonardo was a master of mechanical principles. He utilized [[lever]]age and [[cantilever]]ing, [[pulley]]s, [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]], [[gear]]s, including angle [[gears]] and [[rack and pinion]] gears; [[Watt's linkage|parallel linkage]], [[lubrication]] systems and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s. He understood the principles governing [[momentum]], [[centripetal force]], [[tribology|friction]] and the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] and applied these to his inventions. His scientific studies remained unpublished with, for example, his manuscripts describing the processes governing friction predating the introduction of [[Amontons#Amontons' laws of friction|Amontons' laws of friction]] by 150 years.<ref name= NW>{{cite web|url=http://www.nano-world.org/frictionmodule/content/0200makroreibung/0400historisch/0100leonardo/?=lang=en |title=Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) |publisher=Nano-world.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIt is impossible to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over the lives of many people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated [[bobbin]] winder, the [[rolling mill]], the machine for testing the [[tensile strength]] of wire and the [[lens (optics)|lens]]-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed [[ratio]] determined by the gear.\n\nAs an inventor, Leonardo was not prepared to tell all that he knew:\n\n<blockquote>How by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not describe my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Bridges and hydraulics===\n[[File:Leonardo machines.JPG|thumb|upright|Various hydraulic machines]]\nLeonardo's study of the motion of water led him to design machinery that utilized its force. Much of his work on [[hydraulics]] was for [[Ludovico il Moro]]. Leonardo wrote to Ludovico describing his skills and what he could build:\n\n<blockquote>\u2026very light and strong bridges that can easily be carried, with which to pursue, and sometimes flee from, the enemy; and others safe and indestructible by fire or assault, easy and convenient to transport and place into position.</blockquote>\n\nAmong his projects in Florence was one to divert the course of the Arno, in order to flood [[Pisa]]. Fortunately, this was too costly to be carried out. He also surveyed [[Venice]] and came up with a plan to create a movable [[Dike (construction)|dyke]] for the city's protection against invaders.\n\nIn 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span 240&nbsp;m (720&nbsp;ft) bridge as part of a [[civil engineering]] project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Istanbul]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosphorus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project, because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebj\u00f8rn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in [[Norway]].\nA stone model of the bridge was evaluated in 2019 by [[MIT]] researchers. The self-supporting 1:500 [[scale ratio|scale]] model was built from 126 [[3D printing|3D-printed]] stone cross-sections, held together [[dry stone|without mortar]]. Researchers concluded that the bridge would've been able to support its own weight, and maintain stability under load and [[wind shear]] forces.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/leonardo-da-vinci-bridge-test-1010 |title=Engineers put Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s bridge design to the test |last=Chandler |first=David L. |date=2019-10-09 |work=MIT News |access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===War machines===\n{{see also|Architonnerre|Rapid fire crossbow}}\n[[File:An Artillery Park.jpg|thumb|An arsenal]]\nLeonardo's letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]] assured him:\n\n<blockquote>When a place is besieged I know how to cut off water from the trenches and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and easy to transport.... when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.</blockquote>\n\nIn Leonardo's notebooks there is an array of war machines which includes [[Leonardo's fighting vehicle|a vehicle]] to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built as drawn, the vehicle would never progress in a forward direction. In a [[BBC]] documentary, a military team built the machine and changed the gears in order to make the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/13/1039656218782.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Da Vinci war machines \"designed to fail\" | date=December 14, 2002}}</ref> Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.\n\n[[File:Leonardo tank.JPG|thumb|left|Leonardo's proposed vehicle]]\n\nLeonardo's notebooks also show [[cannon]]s which he claimed \"to hurl small stones like a storm with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy, and great loss and confusion.\" He also designed an [[Leonardo's crossbow|enormous crossbow]]. Following his detailed drawing, one was constructed by the [[British Army]], but could not be made to fire successfully. In 1481 Leonardo designed a breech-loading, water cooled cannon with three racks of barrels allowed the re-loading of one rack while another was being fired and thus maintaining continuous fire power. The \"fan type\" gun with its array of horizontal barrels allowed for a wide scattering of shot.\n\nLeonardo was the first to sketch the [[wheel-lock]] [[musket]] c. 1500&nbsp;AD (the precedent of the [[flintlock]] musket which first appeared in Europe by 1547), although as early as the 14th century the [[History of China|Chinese]] had used a flintlock 'steel wheel' in order to detonate [[land mine]]s.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 199\">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.</ref>\n\nWhile Leonardo was working in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early [[diving suit]], to be used in the destruction of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzglSdu120c&feature=BF&list=PLC219B9E53A3E82D5&index=8| title=Youtube Video of the BBC documentary}}</ref>\nHis inventions were very futuristic which meant they were very expensive and proved not to be useful.\n\n===Flight===\n{{see also|Great Kite}}\n[[File:Leonardo flight of bird.JPG|thumb|upright|The flight of a bird]]\nIn Leonardo's infancy a hawk had once hovered over his cradle. Recalling this incident, Leonardo saw it as prophetic:\n\n<blockquote>An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|left|Design for a flying machine with wings based closely upon the structure of a bat's wings.]]\nThe desire to fly is expressed in the many studies and drawings. His later journals contain a detailed study of the flight of birds and several different designs for wings based in structure upon those of bats which he described as being less heavy because of the impenetrable nature of the membrane. There is a legend that Leonardo tested the flying machine on [[Monte Ceceri]] with one of his apprentices, and that the apprentice fell and broke his leg.<ref>Liana Bortolon, ''Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, (1967)</ref> Experts Martin Kemp and Liana Bortolon agree that there is no evidence of such a test, which is not mentioned in his journals.\n\nOne design that he produced shows a flying machine to be lifted by a man-powered [[helicopter rotor|rotor]].<ref name=\"leonardodavincisinventions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardodavincisinventions.com/inventions-for-flight/leonardo-da-vinci-helicopter/ |title=The Helicopter &#187; Leonardo Da Vinci&#039;s Inventions |publisher=leonardodavincisinventions.com|accessdate=2016-03-21}}</ref> It would not have worked since the body of the craft itself would have rotated in the opposite direction to the rotor.<ref>see [[Helicopter]] for detailed description of solutions and types of functional helicopter.</ref>\n\nWhile he designed a number of man powered flying machines with mechanical wings that flapped, he also designed a [[parachute]] and a light [[hang glider]] which could have flown.<ref>U.S. [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), ''Leonardo's Dream Machine'', October 2005</ref>\n\n===Musical instrument===\n{{Main|Viola organista|Harpsichord-viola}}\n[[File:Viola organista.jpg|thumb|Viola organista (''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'', 1488\u20131489)]]\nThe viola organista was an [[experimental musical instrument]] invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. It was the first bowed [[keyboard instrument]] (of which any record has survived) ever to be devised.\n\nLeonardo's original idea, as preserved in his notebooks of 1488\u20131489 and in the drawings in the [[Codex Atlanticus]], was to use one or more wheels, continuously rotating, each of which pulled a looping bow, rather like a fanbelt in an automobile engine, and perpendicular to the instrument's strings.\n\n==Leonardo's inventions made reality==\n[[File:20110726 Museo Milan 6187.jpg|thumb|Model of wing by Leonardo da Vinci, in the [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci|National Museum of Science and Technology]], Milan]]\n\nIn the late 20th century, interest in Leonardo's inventions escalated. There have been many projects which have sought to turn diagrams on paper into working models. One of the factors is the awareness that, although in the 15th and 16th centuries Leonardo had available a limited range of materials, modern technological advancements have made available a number of robust materials of light-weight which might turn Leonardo's designs into reality. This is particularly the case with his designs for [[Early flying machines|flying machines]].\n\nA difficulty encountered in the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential in order to make a machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus, many models that are created, such as some of those on display at [[Clos Luc\u00e9]], Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.\n\n===Exhibitions===\n* Leonardo da Vinci Gallery at [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] in Milan; permanent exhibition, the biggest collection of Leonardo's projects and inventions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/leonardo/leonardo.asp|title=Leonardo|website=Museoscienzaorg|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n* Models of Leonardo's designs are on permanent display at Clos Luc\u00e9.\n* The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, held an exhibition called \"Leonardo da Vinci: Experience, Experiment, and Design\" in 2006\n* Logitech Museum\n* \"The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition\" was held in a pavilion in the Cultural Forecourt, at South Bank, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2009.

Whilst most famous for his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and the ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', Leonardo is also renowned in the fields of [[civil engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geometry]], [[hydrodynamics]], [[mathematics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[optics]], [[physics]], [[pyrotechnics]], and [[zoology]].  \n\nWhile the full extent of his scientific studies has only become recognized in the last 150 years, during his lifetime he was employed for his engineering and skill of invention. Many of his designs, such as the movable [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing the [[parachute]], the [[helicopter]], an armored fighting vehicle, the use of concentrated [[solar power]], a [[calculator]], a rudimentary theory of [[plate tectonics]] and the [[double hull]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Innocenzi |first1=Plinio |title=The innovators behind Leonardo: The True Story of the Scientific and Technological Renaissance |date=2018 |publisher=Cham: Springer International Publishing |isbn=9783319904481}}</ref> In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of [[anatomy]], [[astronomy]], civil engineering, optics, and the study of water (hydrodynamics).\n\nLeonardo's most famous drawing, the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent the concept of [[macrocosm and microcosm]] in [[Renaissance humanism]].\n\n==Condensed biography==\n{{Main|Leonardo da Vinci}}\n[[File:Study of a Tuscan Landscape.jpg|thumb|The Arno Valley]]\n\n:NOTE: This is a brief summary of Leonardo's early life and journals with particular emphasis on his introduction to science.<!--- Please do not expand this section unless it relates SPECIFICALLY to Leonardo's study of science--->\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (April 15, 1452 \u2013 May 2, 1519) was born the illegitimate son of Messer Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. His early life was spent in the region of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the valley of the [[Arno River]] near [[Florence]], firstly with his mother and in later childhood in the household of his father, grandfather and uncle Francesco.\n\nHis curiosity and interest in scientific observation were stimulated by his uncle Francesco, while his grandfather's keeping of [[Diary|journals]] set an example which he was to follow for most of his life, diligently recording in his own journals both the events of the day, his visual observations, his plans and his projects. The journals of Leonardo contain matters as mundane as grocery lists and as remarkable as diagrams for the construction of a [[Early flying machines#The Renaissance|flying machine]].\n\nIn 1466, Leonardo was sent to Florence to the workshop of the artist [[Verrocchio]], in order to learn the skills of an artist. At the workshop, as well as painting and drawing, he learnt the study of topographical anatomy.<ref>''Topographical anatomy'' is the anatomy that is visible on the surface of the body.</ref>  He was also exposed to a very wide range of technical skills such as [[Technical drawing|drafting]], [[set construction]], [[plaster]]working, paint chemistry, and [[metallurgy]].\n[[File:Old Man with Water Studies.jpg|thumb|left|From Leonardo's journals \u2013 studies of an old man and the action of water.]]\n\nAmong the older artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's scientific interest was [[Piero della Francesca]], then a man in his 60s, who was one of the earliest artists to systematically employ [[linear perspective]] in his paintings, and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the [[Annunciation]] show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was profoundly observant of nature, his curiosity having been stimulated in early childhood by his discovery of a deep cave in the mountains and his intense desire to know what lay inside. His earliest dated drawing, 1473, is of the valley of the Arno River, where he lived. It displays some of the many scientific interests that were to obsess him all his life, in particular geology and hydrology.\n<ref name=LB>Liana Bortolon, ''The Life and Times of Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, 1967</ref>\n\n==Approach to scientific investigation==\n[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|thumb|upright|Investigating the motion of the arm.]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the study of art and science was not perceived as mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the one was seen as informing upon the other. Although Leonardo's training was primarily as an artist, it was largely through his scientific approach to the art of painting, and his development of a style that coupled his scientific knowledge with his unique ability to render what he saw that created the outstanding masterpieces of art for which he is famous.\n\nAs a scientist, Leonardo had no formal education in [[Latin]] and [[mathematics]] and did not attend a [[university]]. Because of these factors, his scientific studies were largely ignored by other scholars. Leonardo's approach to science was one of intense observation and detailed recording, his tools of investigation being almost exclusively his eyes. His journals give insight into his investigative processes.\n\nAs a researcher, Leonardo divided nature and phenomena into ever smaller segments, concretely with knives and measuring instruments, intellectually with formulas and numbers, to wrest the secrets of creation from it. The smaller the particles, runs the assumption; the closer one will get to the solution of the enigmas.<ref>{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Marc van den Broek]]|Title=Leonardo da Vinci Spirits of Invention.

Capra sees Leonardo's unique integrated, holistic views of science as making him a forerunner of modern systems theory and complexity schools of thought.<ref>Capra, Fritjof. The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Genius of the Renaissance. (New York, Doubleday, 2007)</ref>\n\n==Leonardo's notes and journals==\n\nLeonardo kept a series of [[Diary|journals]] in which he wrote almost daily, as well as separate notes and sheets of observations, comments and plans. He wrote and drew with his left hand, and most of his writing is in [[Mirror writing|mirror script]], which makes it difficult to read. Much has survived to illustrate Leonardo's studies, discoveries and inventions.\n\nOn his death, the writings were left mainly to his pupil and heir [[Francesco Melzi]], with the apparent intention that his scientific work should be published. Sometime before 1542, Melzi gathered together the papers for ''A Treatise on Painting'' from eighteen of Leonardo's 'books' (two-thirds of which have gone missing).{{sfn|Wallace|1972|p=170}} The publishing did not take place in Melzi's lifetime, and the writings were eventually bound in different forms and dispersed. Some of his works were published as a ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]'' 165 years after his  death.\n\n==Publication==\n\nLeonardo illustrated a book on mathematical proportion in art written by his friend [[Luca Pacioli]] and called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'', published in 1509. He was also preparing a major treatise on his scientific observations and mechanical inventions. It was to be divided into a number of sections or \"Books\", Leonardo leaving some instructions as to how they were to be ordered. Many sections of it appear in his notebooks.\n\nThese pages deal with scientific subjects generally but also specifically as they touch upon the creation of artworks. In relating to art, this is not science that is dependent upon experimentation or the testing of theories. It deals with detailed observation, particularly the observation of the natural world, and includes a great deal about the visual effects of light on different natural substances such as foliage.<ref name=JPR>''Jean Paul Richter'' editor 1880, ''[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Richter-NotebooksOfLeonardo The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci]'' Dover, 1970, {{ISBN|0-486-22572-0}}.

These are; diffused light as that of the atmosphere; And Direct, as that of the sun; The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is that which passes through [translucent] bodies, as linen or paper etc.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Dama z gronostajem.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'']]\n\nFor an artist working in the 15th century, some study of the nature of [[light]] was essential. It was by the effective painting of light falling on a surface that ''modelling'', or a three-dimensional appearance was to be achieved in a two-dimensional medium. It was also well understood by artists like Leonardo's teacher, [[Verrocchio]], that an appearance of space and distance could be achieved in a background landscape by painting in tones that were less in contrast and colors that were less bright than in the foreground of the painting. The effects of light on solids were achieved by trial and error, since few artists except [[Piero della Francesca]] actually had accurate scientific knowledge of the subject.\n\nAt the time when Leonardo commenced painting, it was unusual for figures to be painted with extreme contrast of light and shade. Faces, in particular, were shadowed in a manner that was bland and maintained all the features and contours clearly visible. Leonardo broke with this.\nIn the painting generally titled ''[[The Lady with an Ermine]]'' (about 1483) he sets the figure [[diagonal]]ly to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The back of her head and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused in such a way that the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.\n\nLeonardo's treatment of light in paintings such as ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' was to change forever the way in which artists perceived light and used it in their paintings. Of all Leonardo's scientific legacies, this is probably the one that had the most immediate and noticeable effect.\n\n===Human anatomy===\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\n...to obtain a true and perfect knowledge ... I have dissected more than ten human bodies, destroying all the other members, and removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these veins are surrounded, ... and as one single body would not last so long, since it was necessary to proceed with several bodies by degrees, until I came to an end and had a complete knowledge; this I repeated twice, to learn the differences...<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Proportions of the Head.jpg|thumb|Study of the proportions of the head.]]\n\n====Topographic anatomy====\nLeonardo began the formal study of the topographical [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] when apprenticed to [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. As a student he would have been taught to draw the human body from life, to memorize the muscles, tendons and visible subcutaneous structure and to familiarise himself with the mechanics of the various parts of the skeletal and muscular structure. It was common workshop practice to have plaster casts of parts of the human anatomy available for students to study and draw.\n[[File:Anatomy of a Male Nude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Two anatomical studies]]\nIf, as is thought to be the case, Leonardo painted the torso and arms of Christ in ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' on which he famously collaborated with his master Verrocchio, then his understanding of topographical anatomy had surpassed that of his master at an early age as can be seen by a comparison of the arms of Christ with those of [[John the Baptist]] in the same painting.\n\nIn the 1490s he wrote about demonstrating muscles and sinews to students:\n\n<blockquote>Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle, you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the ligaments of the bones.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nHis continued investigations in this field occupied many pages of notes, each dealing systematically with a particular aspect of anatomy. It appears that the notes were intended for publication, a task entrusted on his death to his pupil [[Francesco Melzi|Melzi]].\n\nIn conjunction with studies of aspects of the body are drawings of faces displaying different emotions and many drawings of people suffering facial deformity, either congenital or through illness. Some of these drawings, generally referred to as \"caricatures\", on analysis of the skeletal proportions, appear to be based on anatomical studies.\n\n====Dissection====\n{{see also|Studies of the Fetus in the Womb}}\n[[File:View of a Skull III.jpg|thumb|upright|Dissection of the skull.]]\nAs Leonardo became successful as an artist, he was given permission to dissect human corpses at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]] in Florence. Later he dissected in Milan at the hospital Maggiore, and in Rome at the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Ospedale di Santo Spirito]] (the first mainland Italian hospital). From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]].\n\n<blockquote>I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their natural size.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn 30 years, Leonardo dissected 30 male and female corpses of different ages. Together with Marcantonio, he prepared to publish a theoretical work on anatomy and made more than 200 drawings. However, his book was published only in 1680 (161 years after his death) under the heading ''[[Codex Urbinas|A Treatise on Painting]]''.\n[[File:DaVinciCardiovascularWoman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The organs of a woman's body]]\nAmong the detailed images that Leonardo drew are many studies of the [[human skeleton]]. He was the first to describe the double S form of the [[Vertebral column|backbone]]. He also studied the inclination of [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and [[sacrum]] and stressed that sacrum was not uniform, but composed of five fused [[vertebrae]]. He also studied the anatomy of the human foot and its connection to the leg, and from these studies, he was able to further his studies in biomechanics.\n\nLeonardo was a [[Physiology|physiologist]] as well as an anatomist, studying the function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the [[human skull]] and cross-sections of the [[human brain|brain]], [[Transverse plane|transversal]], [[sagittal]], and [[Frontal bone|frontal]]. These drawings may be linked to a search for the ''[[sensus communis]]'', the locus of the human senses,<ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}</ref> which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.\n\n[[File:Views of a Foetus in the Womb.jpg|thumb|Studies of a f\u0153tus from Leonardo's journals]]\nLeonardo studied internal organs, being the first to draw the human [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] and the [[lung]]s, [[mesentery]], [[urinary tract]], [[reproductive organs]], the muscles of the [[cervix]] and a detailed cross-section of [[coitus]]. He was one of the first to draw a scientific representation of the [[fetus]] in the intrautero.\n\nLeonardo studied the [[vascular system]] and drew a dissected [[heart]] in detail. He correctly worked out how heart valves ebb the flow of blood yet he  did not fully understand [[Blood circulation|circulation]], as he believed that blood was pumped to the muscles where it was consumed. In 2005 a UK heart surgeon, Francis Wells, from Papworth Hospital Cambridge, pioneered repair to damaged hearts, using Leonardo's depiction of the opening phase of the mitral valve to operate without changing its diameter allowing an individual to recover more quickly. Wells said \"Leonardo had a depth of appreciation of the anatomy and physiology of the body \u2013 its structure and function \u2013 that perhaps has been overlooked by some.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/health/4289204.stm |title=Da Vinci clue for heart surgeon |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's observational acumen, drawing skill, and the clarity of depiction of bone structures reveal him at his finest as an anatomist. However, his depiction of the internal soft tissues of the body are incorrect in many ways, showing that he maintained concepts of anatomy and functioning that were in some cases millennia old, and that his investigations were probably hampered by the lack of preservation techniques available at the time. Leonardo's detailed drawing of the internal organs of a woman <small>(See left)</small> reveal many traditional misconceptions.<ref name=MK>Martin Kemp, ''Leonardo'', Oxford University Press, (2004) {{ISBN|0-19-280644-0}}</ref><ref>[http://www.livescience.com/20046-10-odd-facts-female-reproductive-system.html Live Science]</ref>\n\nLeonardo's study of [[human anatomy]] led also to the design of an [[automaton]] which has come to be called [[Leonardo's robot]], was probably made around the year 1495 but was rediscovered only in the 1950s.\n\n===Comparative anatomy===\n[[File:Leonardo anatomy of dog and man.JPG|thumb|upright|Comparison of the leg of a man and a dog.]]\nLeonardo not only studied human anatomy, but the anatomy of many other animals as well. He dissected [[cows]], [[birds]], [[monkeys]] and [[frogs]], comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. On one page of his journal Leonardo drew five profile studies of a horse with its teeth bared in anger and, for comparison, a snarling lion and a snarling man.\n\n<blockquote>I have found that in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nIn the early 1490s Leonardo was commissioned to create a monument in honour of [[Francesco Sforza]]. In his notebooks are a series of plans for an equestrian monument. There are also a large number of related anatomical studies of horses. They include several [[Leonardo's horse|diagrams of a standing horse]] with the angles and proportions annotated, anatomical studies of horses' heads, a dozen detailed drawings of hooves and numerous studies and sketches of horses rearing.\n\nHe studied the topographical anatomy of a bear in detail, making many drawings of its paws. There is also a drawing of the muscles and tendons of the bear's hind feet.\nOther drawings of particular interest include the uterus of a pregnant cow, the hindquarters of a decrepit mule and studies of the musculature of a little dog.\n\n===Botany===\nThe science of [[botany]] was long established by Leonardo's time, a treatise on the subject having been written as early as 300&nbsp;BCE.<ref>E.g. Theophrastus, ''On the History of Plants''.</ref> Leonardo's study of plants, resulting in many beautiful drawings in his notebooks, was not to record in diagramatic form the parts of the plant, but rather, as an artist and observer to record the precise appearance of plants, the manner of growth and the way that individual plants and flowers of a single variety differed from one another.\n\n[[File:Sedge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Study of sedge]]\n\nOne such study shows a page with several species of flower of which ten drawings are of wild violets. Along with a drawing of the growing plant and a detail of a leaf, Leonardo has repeatedly drawn single flowers from different angles, with their heads set differently on the stem.\n\nApart from flowers the notebooks contain many drawings of crop plants including several types of grain and a variety of berries including a detailed study of [[bramble]]. There are also water plants such as [[Iris (plant)|irises]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]. His notebooks also direct the artist to observe how light reflects from foliage at different distances and under different [[weather|atmospheric conditions]].\n\nA number of the drawings have their equivalents in Leonardo's paintings. An elegant study of a stem of [[lily|lilies]] may have been for one of Leonardo's early Annunciation paintings, carried in the hand of the Archangel Gabriel. In both the Annunciation pictures the grass is dotted with blossoming plants.\n\nThe plants which appear in both the versions of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' reflects the results of Leonardo's studies in a meticulous realism that makes each plant readily identifiable to the botanist.\n\nIn his writings, da Vinci proposed the following [[da Vinci branching rule|branching rule]]:\n\n<blockquote>All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them].<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Leonardo topographical map.JPG|thumb|upright|A topographical map]]\n\nAs an adult, Leonardo had only two childhood memories, one of which was the finding of a cave in the Apennines. Although fearing that he might be attacked by a wild beast, he ventured in driven \"by the burning desire to see whether there might be any marvelous thing within.\"\n\nLeonardo's earliest dated drawing is a study of the [[Arno valley]], strongly emphasizing its geological features. His notebooks contain landscapes with a wealth of geological observation from the regions of both [[Florence]] and [[Milan]], often including atmospheric effects such as a heavy rainstorm pouring down on a town at the foot of a mountain range.\n\nIt had been observed for many years that [[Stratum|strata]] in mountains often contained bands of sea shells. Conservative science said that these could be explained by the [[Great Flood]] described in the Bible. Leonardo's observations convinced him that this could not possibly be the case.\n\n[[File:Virgin of the Rocks (Louvre).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'']]\n\n<blockquote>And a little beyond the sandstone conglomerate, a [[tufa]] has been formed, where it turned towards Castel Florentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom of the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and various marine objects are found there.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nThis quotation makes clear the breadth of Leonardo's understanding of [[geology]], including the action of water in creating [[sedimentary rock]], the [[plate tectonics|tectonic action]] of the Earth in raising the sea bed and the action of [[erosion]] in the creation of [[landform|geographical features]].\n\nIn Leonardo's earliest paintings we see the remarkable attention given to the small [[landscape]]s of the background, with lakes and water, swathed in a misty light. In the larger of the ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' paintings is a town on the edge of a lake. Although distant, the mountains can be seen to be scored by vertical strata. This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] and [[Lago d'Iseo]] in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'', which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.<ref>The London painting of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' is denounced by the geologist Ann C. Pizzorusso, [http://www.leonardosgeology.com] of New York, as largely by the hand of someone other than Leonardo, because the rocks appear incongruous and the lake looks like a fjord. Pizzorusso says \"Fjords do not exist in Italy and it is highly unlikely the glacial lakes of the Lombard region would have such steep relief surrounding them.\" In fact, the [[glacial lake]], Garda, has just such steep geological formations. The sedimentary red limestone which appears in the picture is also typical of Italy.</ref>\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Leonardo da vinci, Town plan of Imola.jpg|thumb|Leonardo's accurate map of Imola for Cesare Borgia.]]\nIn the early 16th century [[map]]s were rare and often inaccurate. Leonardo produced several extremely accurate maps such as the town plan of [[Imola]] created in 1502 in order to win the [[patronage]] of [[Cesare Borgia]]. Borgia was so impressed that he hired him as a [[military engineer]] and [[architect]]. Leonardo also produced a map of [[Chiana Valley]] in [[Tuscany]], which he surveyed, without the benefit of modern equipment, by pacing the distances. In 1515, Leonardo produced a map of the Roman Southern Coast which is linked to his work for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and relates to his plans to drain the marshland.\n\nRecent research by Donato Pezzutto suggests that the background landscapes in Leonardo\u2019s paintings depict specific locations as aerial views with enhanced depth, employing a technique called [[Cartography|cartographic perspective]]. Pezzutto  identifies the location of the ''Mona Lisa'' to the Val di Chiana, the ''Annunciation'' to the Arno Valley, the ''[[Madonna of the Yarnwinder]]'' to the Adda Valley and ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St Anne]]'' to the Sessia Valley.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.opusej.org/library/leonardos-landscapes-as-maps-cover-page/|publisher=OPUSeJ|first=Donato|last=Pezzutto|title=Leonardo\u2019s Landscapes as Maps|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Hydrodynamics===\n[[File:Studies of Water passing Obstacles and falling.jpg|thumb|upright|Studies of water]]\nLeonardo wrote:\n<blockquote>\nAll the branches of a water [course] at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\nAmong Leonardo's drawings are many that are studies of the motion of water, in particular the forms taken by fast-flowing water on striking different surfaces.\n\nMany of these drawings depict the spiralling nature of water. The [[spiral]] form had been studied in the art of the [[Ancient Greek art|Classical era]] and strict [[Golden ratio|mathematical proportion]] had been applied to its use in art and [[architecture]]. An awareness of these rules of proportion had been revived in the early [[italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. In Leonardo's drawings can be seen the investigation of the spiral as it occurs in water.\n\nThere are several elaborate drawings of water curling over an object placed at a diagonal to its course. There are several drawings of water dropping from a height and curling upwards in spiral forms. One such drawing, as well as curling waves, shows splashes and details of spray and bubbles.\n\nLeonardo's interest manifested itself in the drawing of streams and rivers, the action of water in eroding rocks, and the cataclysmic action of water in floods and tidal waves. The knowledge that he gained from his studies was employed in devising a range of projects, particularly in relation to the Arno River. None of the major works was brought to completion.\n\n===Astronomy===\nLeonardo lived at a time when [[geocentric]] theories were the most widely used explanations to account for the relationship between the Earth and Sun's movement. He wrote that \"The Sun has substance, shape, movement, radiance, heat, and generative power; and these qualities all emanate from itself without its diminution.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Dr. Mario |title=The Da Vinci Astronomy |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-da-vinci-astronomy_b_4065100 |website=Huff Post |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> He further wrote,\n<blockquote>The earth is not in the centre of the Sun's orbit nor at the centre of the universe, but in the centre of its companion elements, and united with them. And any one standing on the moon, when it and the sun are both beneath us, would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon, and the earth would light it as it lights us.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A63kDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT312 Da Vinci's notebooks] on astronomy.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn one of his notebooks, there is a note in the margin which states, \"The Sun does not move,\" which may indicate Leonardo's support of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Leonardo Da Vinci |url=http://giantsofscience.weebly.com/leonardo-da-vinci-vj.html |website=Giants of Science |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy===\nClaims are sometimes made that Leonardo da Vinci was an [[Alchemy|alchemist]]. He was trained in the workshop of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist in so much as that he experimented with different media for suspending [[Pigment|paint pigment]]. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' deteriorating within a century, and ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (Leonardo)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' running off the wall. In Leonardo's many pages of notes about artistic processes, there are some that pertain to the use of silver and gold in artworks, information he would have learned as a student.<ref name=Moran>Bruce T. Moran, ''Distilling Knowledge, Chemistry, Alchemy and the Scientific Revolution'', (2005) {{ISBN|0-674-01495-2}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo's scientific process was based mainly upon observation. His practical experiments are also founded in observation rather than belief. Leonardo, who questioned the order of the [[solar system]] and the deposit of fossils by the [[Noah's Ark|Great Flood]], had little time for the alchemical quests to turn [[lead]] into [[gold]] or create a [[Philosopher's stone|potion]] that gave eternal life.\n\nLeonardo said about alchemists:\n\n<blockquote>The false interpreters of nature declare that quicksilver is the common seed of every metal, not remembering that nature varies the seed according to the variety of the things she desires to produce in the world.<ref name= JPR /><ref>\"Quicksilver\" is an old name for mercury.</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Old alchemists... have never either by chance or by experiment succeeded in creating the smallest element that can be created by nature; however [they] deserve unmeasured praise for the usefulness of things invented for the use of men, and would deserve it even more if they had not been the inventors of noxious things like poisons and other similar things which destroy life or mind.\"''<ref name=Notebooks>Irma Ann Richter and Teresa Wells, ''Leonardo da Vinci \u2013 Notebooks'', Oxford University Press (2008) {{ISBN|978-0-19-929902-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Mathematical studies==\n\n===Perspective===\n<blockquote>The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat appear in relief and what is in relief flat.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\nDuring the early 15th century, both [[Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] made studies of [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. In 1436 Alberti published ''[[De pictura]]'' (\"On Painting\"), which includes his findings on linear perspective. [[Piero della Francesca]] carried his work forward and by the 1470s a number of artists were able to produce works of art that demonstrated a full understanding of the principles of linear perspective. \n[[File:Leonardo study AdorationofMagi.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Draft of the perspective for ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'']]\n\nLeonardo studied linear perspective and employed it in his earlier paintings. His use of perspective in the two [[Annunciation]]s is daring, as he uses various features such as the corner of a building, a [[walled garden]] and a path to contrast enclosure and spaciousness.\n\nThe unfinished ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' was intended to be a masterpiece revealing much of Leonardo's knowledge of figure drawing and perspective. There exists a number of studies that he made, including a detailed study of the perspective, showing the complex background of ruined [[Roman architecture|Classical buildings]] that he planned for the left of the picture. In addition, Leonardo is credited with the first use of [[anamorphosis]], the use of a \"perspective\" to produce an image that is intelligible only with a curved mirror or from a specific vantage point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionworks.com/mod/anamorph.htm# |title=Animations of anamorphosis of Leonardo and other artists |publisher=Illusionworks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>\n\nLeonardo wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of drawing.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Geometry===\n[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|upright|The [[rhombicuboctahedron]], as published in ''[[De divina proportione]]'']]\nWhile in Milan in 1496, Leonardo met a traveling [[monk]] and academic, [[Luca Pacioli]]. Under him, Leonardo studied [[mathematic]]s. Pacioli, who first codified and recorded the [[double entry]] system of bookkeeping,<ref>[http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm L. Murphy Smith, ''Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818055709/http://acct.tamu.edu/smith/ethics/pacioli.htm |date=2011-08-18 }}</ref> had already published a major treatise on mathematical knowledge, collaborated with Leonardo in the production of a book called ''[[Divina proportione|De divina proportione]]'' about mathematical and artistic proportion. Leonardo prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates. ''De divina proportione'' was published in 1509.\n\n<blockquote>All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of [[mathematician]]s, which are:\u2014the point, the line, the angle, the superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n==Engineering and invention==\n[[Vasari]] in ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|The Lives]]''  says of Leonardo:\n\n<blockquote>He made designs for mills, [[fulling]] machines<!-- a fulling machine is used in the production of cloth --> and engines that could be driven by water-power... In addition he used to make models and plans showing how to excavate and tunnel through mountains without difficulty, so as to pass from one level to another; and he demonstrated how to lift and draw great weights by means of levers, hoists and winches, and ways of cleansing harbours and using pumps to suck up water from great depths.</blockquote>\n\n===Practical inventions and projects===\n{{see also|Leonardo's self-propelled cart|Leonardo's robot}}\n[[File:Leonardo machine for grinding convex lenses.JPG|thumb|upright|A machine for grinding convex lenses]]\nWith the same rational and analytical approach that he used in anatomic studies, Leonardo faced the study and design of a bewildering number of machines and devices. He drew their \u201canatomy\u201d with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, include a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components. Those studies and projects have been collected in his codices and fill more than 5,000 pages.<ref name=\"guarnieri1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2019|title=Reconsidering Leonardo|journal= IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=13|issue=3|pages=35\u201338|doi=10.1109/MIE.2019.2929366|ref=harv}}</ref> Leonardo was a master of mechanical principles.

He understood the principles governing [[momentum]], [[centripetal force]], [[tribology|friction]] and the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] and applied these to his inventions. His scientific studies remained unpublished with, for example, his manuscripts describing the processes governing friction predating the introduction of [[Amontons#Amontons' laws of friction|Amontons' laws of friction]] by 150 years.<ref name= NW>{{cite web|url=http://www.nano-world.org/frictionmodule/content/0200makroreibung/0400historisch/0100leonardo/?=lang=en |title=Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) |publisher=Nano-world.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIt is impossible to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over the lives of many people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated [[bobbin]] winder, the [[rolling mill]], the machine for testing the [[tensile strength]] of wire and the [[lens (optics)|lens]]-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed [[ratio]] determined by the gear.\n\nAs an inventor, Leonardo was not prepared to tell all that he knew:\n\n<blockquote>How by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not describe my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.<ref name=JPR /></blockquote>\n\n===Bridges and hydraulics===\n[[File:Leonardo machines.JPG|thumb|upright|Various hydraulic machines]]\nLeonardo's study of the motion of water led him to design machinery that utilized its force. Much of his work on [[hydraulics]] was for [[Ludovico il Moro]]. Leonardo wrote to Ludovico describing his skills and what he could build:\n\n<blockquote>\u2026very light and strong bridges that can easily be carried, with which to pursue, and sometimes flee from, the enemy; and others safe and indestructible by fire or assault, easy and convenient to transport and place into position.</blockquote>\n\nAmong his projects in Florence was one to divert the course of the Arno, in order to flood [[Pisa]]. Fortunately, this was too costly to be carried out. He also surveyed [[Venice]] and came up with a plan to create a movable [[Dike (construction)|dyke]] for the city's protection against invaders.\n\nIn 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span 240&nbsp;m (720&nbsp;ft) bridge as part of a [[civil engineering]] project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Istanbul]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosphorus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project, because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebj\u00f8rn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in [[Norway]].\nA stone model of the bridge was evaluated in 2019 by [[MIT]] researchers. The self-supporting 1:500 [[scale ratio|scale]] model was built from 126 [[3D printing|3D-printed]] stone cross-sections, held together [[dry stone|without mortar]]. Researchers concluded that the bridge would've been able to support its own weight, and maintain stability under load and [[wind shear]] forces.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/leonardo-da-vinci-bridge-test-1010 |title=Engineers put Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s bridge design to the test |last=Chandler |first=David L. |date=2019-10-09 |work=MIT News |access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===War machines===\n{{see also|Architonnerre|Rapid fire crossbow}}\n[[File:An Artillery Park.jpg|thumb|An arsenal]]\nLeonardo's letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]] assured him:\n\n<blockquote>When a place is besieged I know how to cut off water from the trenches and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and easy to transport.... when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.</blockquote>\n\nIn Leonardo's notebooks there is an array of war machines which includes [[Leonardo's fighting vehicle|a vehicle]] to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built as drawn, the vehicle would never progress in a forward direction. In a [[BBC]] documentary, a military team built the machine and changed the gears in order to make the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/13/1039656218782.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Da Vinci war machines \"designed to fail\" | date=December 14, 2002}}</ref> Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.\n\n[[File:Leonardo tank.JPG|thumb|left|Leonardo's proposed vehicle]]\n\nLeonardo's notebooks also show [[cannon]]s which he claimed \"to hurl small stones like a storm with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy, and great loss and confusion.\" He also designed an [[Leonardo's crossbow|enormous crossbow]]. Following his detailed drawing, one was constructed by the [[British Army]], but could not be made to fire successfully. In 1481 Leonardo designed a breech-loading, water cooled cannon with three racks of barrels allowed the re-loading of one rack while another was being fired and thus maintaining continuous fire power. The \"fan type\" gun with its array of horizontal barrels allowed for a wide scattering of shot.\n\nLeonardo was the first to sketch the [[wheel-lock]] [[musket]] c. 1500&nbsp;AD (the precedent of the [[flintlock]] musket which first appeared in Europe by 1547), although as early as the 14th century the [[History of China|Chinese]] had used a flintlock 'steel wheel' in order to detonate [[land mine]]s.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 199\">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.</ref>\n\nWhile Leonardo was working in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early [[diving suit]], to be used in the destruction of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzglSdu120c&feature=BF&list=PLC219B9E53A3E82D5&index=8| title=Youtube Video of the BBC documentary}}</ref>\nHis inventions were very futuristic which meant they were very expensive and proved not to be useful.\n\n===Flight===\n{{see also|Great Kite}}\n[[File:Leonardo flight of bird.JPG|thumb|upright|The flight of a bird]]\nIn Leonardo's infancy a hawk had once hovered over his cradle. Recalling this incident, Leonardo saw it as prophetic:\n\n<blockquote>An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.<ref name= JPR /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|left|Design for a flying machine with wings based closely upon the structure of a bat's wings.]]\nThe desire to fly is expressed in the many studies and drawings. His later journals contain a detailed study of the flight of birds and several different designs for wings based in structure upon those of bats which he described as being less heavy because of the impenetrable nature of the membrane. There is a legend that Leonardo tested the flying machine on [[Monte Ceceri]] with one of his apprentices, and that the apprentice fell and broke his leg.<ref>Liana Bortolon, ''Leonardo'', Paul Hamlyn, (1967)</ref> Experts Martin Kemp and Liana Bortolon agree that there is no evidence of such a test, which is not mentioned in his journals.\n\nOne design that he produced shows a flying machine to be lifted by a man-powered [[helicopter rotor|rotor]].<ref name=\"leonardodavincisinventions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardodavincisinventions.com/inventions-for-flight/leonardo-da-vinci-helicopter/ |title=The Helicopter &#187; Leonardo Da Vinci&#039;s Inventions |publisher=leonardodavincisinventions.com|accessdate=2016-03-21}}</ref> It would not have worked since the body of the craft itself would have rotated in the opposite direction to the rotor.<ref>see [[Helicopter]] for detailed description of solutions and types of functional helicopter.</ref>\n\nWhile he designed a number of man powered flying machines with mechanical wings that flapped, he also designed a [[parachute]] and a light [[hang glider]] which could have flown.<ref>U.S. [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), ''Leonardo's Dream Machine'', October 2005</ref>\n\n===Musical instrument===\n{{Main|Viola organista|Harpsichord-viola}}\n[[File:Viola organista.jpg|thumb|Viola organista (''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'', 1488\u20131489)]]\nThe viola organista was an [[experimental musical instrument]] invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. It was the first bowed [[keyboard instrument]] (of which any record has survived) ever to be devised.\n\nLeonardo's original idea, as preserved in his notebooks of 1488\u20131489 and in the drawings in the [[Codex Atlanticus]], was to use one or more wheels, continuously rotating, each of which pulled a looping bow, rather like a fanbelt in an automobile engine, and perpendicular to the instrument's strings.\n\n==Leonardo's inventions made reality==\n[[File:20110726 Museo Milan 6187.jpg|thumb|Model of wing by Leonardo da Vinci, in the [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci|National Museum of Science and Technology]], Milan]]\n\nIn the late 20th century, interest in Leonardo's inventions escalated. There have been many projects which have sought to turn diagrams on paper into working models. One of the factors is the awareness that, although in the 15th and 16th centuries Leonardo had available a limited range of materials, modern technological advancements have made available a number of robust materials of light-weight which might turn Leonardo's designs into reality. This is particularly the case with his designs for [[Early flying machines|flying machines]].\n\nA difficulty encountered in the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential in order to make a machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus, many models that are created, such as some of those on display at [[Clos Luc\u00e9]], Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.\n\n===Exhibitions===\n* Leonardo da Vinci Gallery at [[Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci]] in Milan; permanent exhibition, the biggest collection of Leonardo's projects and inventions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/leonardo/leonardo.asp|title=Leonardo|website=Museoscienzaorg|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n* Models of Leonardo's designs are on permanent display at Clos Luc\u00e9.\n* The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, held an exhibition called \"Leonardo da Vinci: Experience, Experiment, and Design\" in 2006\n* Logitech Museum\n* \"The Da Vinci Machines Exhibition\" was held in a pavilion in the Cultural Forecourt, at South Bank, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2009.

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Indira, and the trio stood to prevent that. Indira's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Indira and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South.

The main reason was the perceived bias of United States and [[China]], the rivals of USSR, towards [[Pakistan]]. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the Soviets became the largest trading partner of India.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government.

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Indira, and the trio stood to prevent that. Indira's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Indira and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, Jayaprakash Narayan.

Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993.

Percival, then his Chief Staff Officer, was tasked to draw up a tactical assessment of how the Japanese were most likely to attack.\nIn late 1937, his analysis duly confirmed that north [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] might become the critical battleground. The Japanese were likely to seize the east coast landing sites on [[Thailand]] and Malaya in order to capture aerodromes and achieve air superiority. This could serve as a prelude to further Japanese landings in [[Johore]] to disrupt communications northwards and enable the construction of another main base in North Borneo. From North Borneo, the final sea and air assault could be launched against eastern Singapore\u2014in particular the [[Changi]] area.<ref>Ong, Chit Chung (1997) ''Operation Matador : Britain's war plans against the Japanese 1918\u20131941''. Singapore : Times Academic Press.</ref>\n\n===General Officer Commanding (Malaya)===\nIn April 1941 Percival was promoted to acting [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35160 |supp=y|page=2731|date=9 May 1941}}</ref> and was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Malaya. This was a significant promotion for him as he had never commanded an army [[Corps]]. He left Britain in a [[Sunderland flying boat]] and embarked on an arduous two-week, multi-stage flight via [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]] (where he was delayed by the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), [[Basra]], [[Karachi]] and [[Yangon|Rangoon]], where he was met by an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] transport.<ref name=\"percival1\" />\n\nPercival had mixed feelings about his appointment, noting that \"In going to Malaya I realised that there was the double danger either of being left in an inactive command for some years if war did not break out in the East or, if it did, of finding myself involved in a pretty sticky business with the inadequate forces which are usually to be found in the distant parts of our [[British Empire|Empire]] in the early stages of a war.\"<ref name=\"percival2\" />\n\nFor much of the interwar period, Britain's defensive plan for Malaya had centred on the dispatch of a [[Royal Navy|naval]] fleet to the newly built [[Singapore Naval Base]]. Accordingly, the army's role was to defend Singapore and Southern [[Johore]]. While this plan had seemed adequate when the nearest Japanese base had been {{convert|1700|mi|km}} away, the outbreak of war in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], combined with the partial Japanese occupation of the northern part of [[French Indochina]] and the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact]] in September 1940, had underlined the difficulty of a sea-based defence. Instead it was proposed to use the RAF to defend Malaya, at least until reinforcements could be dispatched from Britain. This led to the building of airfields in northern Malaya and along its east coast and the dispersal of the available army units around the peninsula to protect them.<ref>Percival, Chapter 3</ref>\n\nOn arrival, Percival set about training his inexperienced army; his Indian troops were particularly raw, with most of their experienced officers having been withdrawn to support the formation of new units as the Indian army expanded. Relying upon commercial aircraft or the Volunteer air force to overcome the shortage of RAF planes, he toured the peninsula and encouraged the building of defensive works around [[Jitra]].<ref>Percival, Chapter 4</ref> A training manual approved by Percival, ''Tactical Notes on Malaya'', was distributed to all units.\n\nIn July 1941 when the Japanese occupied southern Indochina, Britain, the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]] imposed economic [[international sanctions|sanctions]], freezing Japanese financial assets and cutting Japan from its supplies of [[petroleum|oil]], [[tin]] and [[rubber]]. The sanctions were aimed at pressuring Japan to abandon its [[Second Sino-Japanese War|involvement in China]]; instead, the Japanese government planned to seize the resources of South-East Asia from the European nations by force. Both the Japanese navy and army were mobilised, but for the moment an uneasy state of cold war persisted. British Commonwealth reinforcements continued to trickle into Malaya. On 2 December, the [[battleship]] [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and the [[battle-cruiser]] [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']], escorted by four [[destroyer]]s, arrived in Singapore, the first time a battle fleet had been based there. (They were to have been accompanied by the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}} to provide air cover but she had run aground in the Caribbean en route.) The following day [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Ernest John Spooner|Spooner]] hosted a dinner attended by the newly arrived Commander-in-Chief [[Eastern Fleet]], [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Thomas Phillips (Naval officer)|Sir Tom Phillips]], and Percival.<ref>Percival, Chapter 7</ref>\n\n===Japanese attack and British surrender===\n{{main article|Japanese invasion of Malaya|Battle of Singapore}}\n[[File:Pacific War - Malaya 1941-42 - Map.jpg|thumb|350px|Malaya Command and the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya]]]]\n\nOn 8 December 1941 the [[Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)|Japanese 25th Army]] under the command of Lieutenant-General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] launched an [[amphibious assault]] on the Malay Peninsula (one hour before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the difference in date was because the two places lie on opposite sides of the [[international date line]]). That night the first Japanese invasion force arrived at [[Kota Bharu]] on Malaya's east coast. This was just a diversionary force, and the main landings took place the next day at [[Singora]] and [[Pattani (town)|Pattani]] on the south-eastern coast of [[Thailand]], with troops rapidly deploying over the border into northern Malaya.\n\nOn 10 December Percival issued a stirring, if ultimately ineffective, Special Order of the Day:\n<blockquote>In this hour of trial the General Officer Commanding calls upon all ranks Malaya Command for a determined and sustained effort to safeguard Malaya and the adjoining British territories. The eyes of the Empire are upon us. Our whole position in the Far East is at stake. The struggle may be long and grim but let us all resolve to stand fast come what may and to prove ourselves worthy of the great trust which has been placed in us.<ref>Percival, chapter 9</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Royal Engineers prepare to blow up a bridge in Malaya.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Engineers]] prepare to blow up a bridge during the retreat.]]\n\nThe Japanese advanced rapidly, and on 27 January 1942 Percival ordered a general retreat across the [[Johore Strait]] to the island of [[Singapore]] and organised a defence along the length of the island's {{convert|70|mi|km|sing=on}} coast line. But the Japanese did not dawdle, and on 8 February Japanese troops landed on the northwest corner of Singapore island. After a week of fighting on the island, Percival held his final command conference at 9&nbsp;am on 15 February in [[the Battle Box]] of [[Fort Canning]]. The Japanese had already occupied approximately half of Singapore and it was clear that the island would soon fall.  Having been told that ammunition and water would both run out by the following day, Percival agreed to surrender. The Japanese at this point were running low on artillery shells, but Percival did not know this.\n\nThe Japanese insisted that Percival himself march under a [[white flag]] to the [[Old Ford Motor Factory]] in [[Bukit Timah]] to negotiate the surrender. A Japanese officer present noted that he looked \"pale, thin and tired\".<ref>Warren, p265</ref> After a brief disagreement, when Percival insisted that the British keep 1,000 men under arms in Singapore to preserve order, which Yamashita finally conceded, it was agreed at 6:10&nbsp;pm that the British Empire troops would lay down their arms and cease resistance at 8:30&nbsp;pm. This was in spite of instructions from Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] for prolonged resistance.<ref name=\"Morris\"/> The [[Pacific War]] was just ten weeks old.\n\nA common view holds that 138,708 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel surrendered or were killed by fewer than 30,000 Japanese. However, the former figure includes nearly 50,000 troops captured or killed during the [[Battle of Malaya]], and perhaps 15,000 base troops. Many of the other troops were tired and under-equipped following their retreat from the [[Malayan peninsula]]. Conversely, the latter number represents only the front-line troops available for the invasion of Singapore. British Empire battle casualties since 8 December amounted to 7,500 killed and 11,000 wounded. Japanese losses totalled around 3,500 killed and 6,100 wounded.<ref>Thompson, p9 and p424</ref>\n\n===Culpability for the fall of Singapore===\n[[File:Singaporesurrender.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant-General Percival led by a Japanese officer, marches under a flag of [[truce]] to negotiate the capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore, on 15 February 1942. It was the largest surrender of British-led forces in history.]]\nChurchill viewed the fall of Singapore to be \"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.\" However, the British defence was that the [[Middle East]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had all received higher priorities in the allocation of men and material, so the desired [[air force]] strength of 300 to 500 aircraft was never reached, and whereas the Japanese invaded with over two hundred [[tank]]s, the British Army in Malaya did not have a single tank.<ref>Kinvig.</ref> In ''The War in Malaya'' Percival himself cites this as the major factor for the defeat stating that the 'war material which might have saved Singapore was sent to Russia and the Middle East'. However he also concedes that Britain was engaged in 'a life and death struggle in the West' and that 'this decision, however painful and regrettable, was inevitable and right'.<ref>The War in Malaya; Authur Percival p306</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Percival had been described as \"a slim, soft spoken man... with a proven reputation for bravery and organisational powers\"<ref>Kinvig, p. 47.</ref> but by 1945 this description had been turned on its head with even Percival's defenders describing him as \"something of a damp squib\".<ref>Kinvig, p. 242.</ref> The fall of Singapore switched Percival's reputation to that of an ineffective \"staff wallah\", lacking ruthlessness and aggression, even though few doubted that he was a brave and determined officer. Over six feet in height and lanky, with a clipped moustache and two protruding teeth, and unphotogenic, Percival was an easy target for a caricaturist, being described as \"tall, bucktoothed and lightly built\".<ref>Warren, p. 29.</ref> There was no doubt his presentation lacked impact as \"his manner was low key and he was a poor public speaker with the cusp of a lisp\".<ref>Kinvig, ''General Percival and the Fall of Singapore'', p. 241.</ref>\n[[File:BritishSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lieutenant-General Yamashita (seated, centre) thumps the table with his fist to emphasise his demand for unconditional surrender.

Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham|Robert Brooke-Popham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[British Far East Command]], refused Percival permission to launch [[Operation Matador (1941)|Operation Matador]] in advance of the Japanese landings in Thailand, not wishing to run any risk of provoking the coming war. Brooke-Popham also had a reputation for falling asleep in meetings and not arguing forcefully for the air reinforcements required to defend Malaya. Admiral [[Thomas Spencer Vaughan Phillips|Tom Phillips]]' leadership of [[Force Z]] led to his demise and the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|destruction of the British fleet]] on 10 December 1941, early in the campaign.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Peter Wykeham]] suggested that the government in London was more to blame than any of the British commanders in the Far East. Despite repeated requests, the British government did not provide the necessary reinforcements and they denied Brooke-Popham \u2013 and therefore Percival \u2013 permission to enter neutral Thailand before it was too late to put in place forward defences.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite journal| last =Wykeham| first =Peter| author2 =Thomas Paul Ofcansky| title =Popham, Sir (Henry) Robert Moore Brooke| work =Oxford Dictionary of National Biography| url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/32/101032096/| date =January 2008| doi =10.1093/ref:odnb/32096}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Percival had difficulties with his subordinates [[Lewis Heath|Sir Lewis \"Piggy\" Heath]], commanding [[Indian III Corps]], and the independent-minded [[Gordon Bennett (general)|Gordon Bennett]], commanding the [[Australian 8th Division]]. The former officer had been senior to Percival prior to his appointment as GOC (Malaya). Bennett was full of confidence in his [[Australia]]n troops and his own ability, but faced a mixed reaction in Australia when he escaped from Singapore immediately after its surrender.\n\nPercival was ultimately responsible for the men who served under him, and with other officers \u2013 notably Major-General [[David Murray-Lyon]], commander of the [[Indian 11th Infantry Division]] \u2013 he had shown a willingness to replace them when he felt their performance was not up to scratch. Perhaps his greatest mistake was to resist the building of fixed defences in either Johore or the north shore of Singapore, dismissing them in the face of repeated requests to start construction from his Chief Engineer, Brigadier [[Ivan Simson]], with the comment \"Defences are bad for morale \u2013 for both troops and civilians\".<ref>Thompson, p. 182.</ref> In doing so, Percival threw away the potential advantages he could have derived from the 6,000 engineers under his command and perhaps missed his best chance to blunt the danger posed by the Japanese tanks.\n\nPercival also insisted on defending the north-eastern shore of Singapore most heavily, against the advice of the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|Allied supreme commander in South East Asia]], General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]]. Percival was perhaps fixed on his responsibilities for defending the Singapore Naval Base.<ref>Dixon, ''[[On the Psychology of Military Incompetence]]'', p. 143.</ref> He also spread his forces thinly around the island and kept few units as a strategic reserve. When the Japanese attack came in the west, the [[Australian 22nd Brigade]] took the brunt of the assault.<ref>Thompson, p. 414.</ref> Percival refused to reinforce them as he continued to believe that the main assault would occur in the north east.<ref>Thompson, p. 430.</ref>\n\n===Captivity===\nPercival himself was briefly held prisoner in [[Changi Prison]], where \"the defeated GOC could be seen sitting head in hands, outside the married quarters he now shared with seven brigadiers, a colonel, his ADC and cook-sergeant. He discussed feelings with few, spent hours walking around the extensive compound, ruminating on the reverse and what might have been\".<ref>Kinvig, p221</ref> In the belief that it would improve discipline, he reconstituted a Malaya Command, complete with staff appointments, and helped occupy his fellow prisoners with lectures on the [[Battle of France]].<ref>MacArthur, ''Surviving the Sword: Prisoners of the Japanese 1942\u201345'', p188</ref>\n[[File:Douglas MacArthur signs formal surrender.jpg|left|thumb|The signing of the Japanese surrender; [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] (sitting), behind him are Generals Percival (background) and [[Jonathan M. Wainwright (general)|Wainwright]] (foreground).]]\n\nAlong with the other senior British captives above the rank of colonel, Percival was removed from Singapore in August 1942. First he was imprisoned in [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and then sent on to [[Manchuria]], where he was held with several dozen other VIP captives, including the [[United States|American]] General [[Jonathan M. Wainwright (general)|Jonathan Wainwright]], in a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] near [[Xi'an District, Mudanjiang|Hsian]], about {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the north east of [[Mukden]].\n\nAs the war drew to an end, an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] team removed the prisoners from Hsian. Percival was then taken, along with Wainwright, to stand immediately behind General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as he confirmed the terms of the Japanese surrender aboard [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'' (BB-63)]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on 2 September 1945.<ref>''Battleship Missouri Memorial'', {{cite web|url=http://www.ussmissouri.org/surrender.aspx |title=Surrender |accessdate=2006-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109061015/http://ussmissouri.org/surrender.aspx |archivedate=9 November 2005 |df=dmy }} , accessed 2 February 2006</ref> Afterwards, MacArthur gave Percival a pen he had used to sign the treaty.<ref>Warren, p286</ref>\n\nPercival and Wainwright then returned together to the [[Philippines]] to witness the surrender of the Japanese army there, which in a twist of fate was commanded by General Yamashita. Yamashita was momentarily surprised to see his former captive at the ceremony; on this occasion Percival refused to shake Yamashita's hand, angered by the mistreatment of POWs in Singapore. The flag carried by Percival's party on the way to Bukit Timah was also a witness to this reversal of fortunes, being flown when the Japanese formally surrendered Singapore back to Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]].<ref>Morris, p458</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nPercival returned to the United Kingdom in September 1945 to write his despatch at the [[War Office]] but this was revised by the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] and only published in 1948.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38215|pages=1245\u20131346|date=20 February 1948}}</ref> He retired from the army in 1946 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general but the pension of his substantive rank of major-general.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37706|page=4347|date=27 August 1946}}</ref> Thereafter, he held appointments connected with the county of Hertfordshire, where he lived at Bullards in [[Widford, Hertfordshire|Widford]]: he was Honorary Colonel of [[479th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]], ([[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|T.A.]]) from 1949 to 1954<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38762|page=5465|date=18 November 1949}}</ref><ref>Col J.D.

Percival's 1949 memoir, ''The War in Malaya'', did little to quell this criticism, being a restrained rather than self-serving account of the campaign. Unusual for a British lieutenant-general, Percival was not awarded a [[British honours system|knighthood]].\n\nPercival was respected for the time he had spent as a Japanese [[prisoner of war]]. Serving as life president of the [[Far East Prisoners of War]] Association (FEPOW), he pushed for compensation for his fellow captives, eventually helping to obtain a token \u00a35 million of frozen Japanese assets for this cause. This was distributed by the FEPOW Welfare Trust, on which Percival served as Chairman.<ref name = \"MacArthur442\">MacArthur, p. 442.</ref> He led protests against the film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' when it was released in 1957, obtaining the addition of an on-screen statement that the movie was a work of fiction.

Percival, then his Chief Staff Officer, was tasked to draw up a tactical assessment of how the Japanese were most likely to attack.\nIn late 1937, his analysis duly confirmed that north [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] might become the critical battleground. The Japanese were likely to seize the east coast landing sites on [[Thailand]] and Malaya in order to capture aerodromes and achieve air superiority. This could serve as a prelude to further Japanese landings in [[Johore]] to disrupt communications northwards and enable the construction of another main base in North Borneo. From North Borneo, the final sea and air assault could be launched against eastern Singapore\u2014in particular the [[Changi]] area.<ref>Ong, Chit Chung (1997) ''Operation Matador : Britain's war plans against the Japanese 1918\u20131941''. Singapore : Times Academic Press.</ref>\n\n===General Officer Commanding (Malaya)===\nIn April 1941 Percival was promoted to acting [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35160 |supp=y|page=2731|date=9 May 1941}}</ref> and was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Malaya. This was a significant promotion for him as he had never commanded an army [[Corps]]. He left Britain in a [[Sunderland flying boat]] and embarked on an arduous two-week, multi-stage flight via [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]] (where he was delayed by the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), [[Basra]], [[Karachi]] and [[Yangon|Rangoon]], where he was met by an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] transport.<ref name=\"percival1\" />\n\nPercival had mixed feelings about his appointment, noting that \"In going to Malaya I realised that there was the double danger either of being left in an inactive command for some years if war did not break out in the East or, if it did, of finding myself involved in a pretty sticky business with the inadequate forces which are usually to be found in the distant parts of our [[British Empire|Empire]] in the early stages of a war.\"<ref name=\"percival2\" />\n\nFor much of the interwar period, Britain's defensive plan for Malaya had centred on the dispatch of a [[Royal Navy|naval]] fleet to the newly built [[Singapore Naval Base]]. Accordingly, the army's role was to defend Singapore and Southern [[Johore]]. While this plan had seemed adequate when the nearest Japanese base had been {{convert|1700|mi|km}} away, the outbreak of war in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], combined with the partial Japanese occupation of the northern part of [[French Indochina]] and the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact]] in September 1940, had underlined the difficulty of a sea-based defence. Instead it was proposed to use the RAF to defend Malaya, at least until reinforcements could be dispatched from Britain. This led to the building of airfields in northern Malaya and along its east coast and the dispersal of the available army units around the peninsula to protect them.<ref>Percival, Chapter 3</ref>\n\nOn arrival, Percival set about training his inexperienced army; his Indian troops were particularly raw, with most of their experienced officers having been withdrawn to support the formation of new units as the Indian army expanded. Relying upon commercial aircraft or the Volunteer air force to overcome the shortage of RAF planes, he toured the peninsula and encouraged the building of defensive works around [[Jitra]].<ref>Percival, Chapter 4</ref> A training manual approved by Percival, ''Tactical Notes on Malaya'', was distributed to all units.\n\nIn July 1941 when the Japanese occupied southern Indochina, Britain, the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]] imposed economic [[international sanctions|sanctions]], freezing Japanese financial assets and cutting Japan from its supplies of [[petroleum|oil]], [[tin]] and [[rubber]]. The sanctions were aimed at pressuring Japan to abandon its [[Second Sino-Japanese War|involvement in China]]; instead, the Japanese government planned to seize the resources of South-East Asia from the European nations by force. Both the Japanese navy and army were mobilised, but for the moment an uneasy state of cold war persisted. British Commonwealth reinforcements continued to trickle into Malaya. On 2 December, the [[battleship]] [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and the [[battle-cruiser]] [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']], escorted by four [[destroyer]]s, arrived in Singapore, the first time a battle fleet had been based there. (They were to have been accompanied by the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}} to provide air cover but she had run aground in the Caribbean en route.) The following day [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Ernest John Spooner|Spooner]] hosted a dinner attended by the newly arrived Commander-in-Chief [[Eastern Fleet]], [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Thomas Phillips (Naval officer)|Sir Tom Phillips]], and Percival.<ref>Percival, Chapter 7</ref>\n\n===Japanese attack and British surrender===\n{{main article|Japanese invasion of Malaya|Battle of Singapore}}\n[[File:Pacific War - Malaya 1941-42 - Map.jpg|thumb|350px|Malaya Command and the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya]]]]\n\nOn 8 December 1941 the [[Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)|Japanese 25th Army]] under the command of Lieutenant-General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] launched an [[amphibious assault]] on the Malay Peninsula (one hour before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; the difference in date was because the two places lie on opposite sides of the [[international date line]]). That night the first Japanese invasion force arrived at [[Kota Bharu]] on Malaya's east coast. This was just a diversionary force, and the main landings took place the next day at [[Singora]] and [[Pattani (town)|Pattani]] on the south-eastern coast of [[Thailand]], with troops rapidly deploying over the border into northern Malaya.\n\nOn 10 December Percival issued a stirring, if ultimately ineffective, Special Order of the Day:\n<blockquote>In this hour of trial the General Officer Commanding calls upon all ranks Malaya Command for a determined and sustained effort to safeguard Malaya and the adjoining British territories. The eyes of the Empire are upon us. Our whole position in the Far East is at stake. The struggle may be long and grim but let us all resolve to stand fast come what may and to prove ourselves worthy of the great trust which has been placed in us.<ref>Percival, chapter 9</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Royal Engineers prepare to blow up a bridge in Malaya.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Engineers]] prepare to blow up a bridge during the retreat.]]\n\nThe Japanese advanced rapidly, and on 27 January 1942 Percival ordered a general retreat across the [[Johore Strait]] to the island of [[Singapore]] and organised a defence along the length of the island's {{convert|70|mi|km|sing=on}} coast line. But the Japanese did not dawdle, and on 8 February Japanese troops landed on the northwest corner of Singapore island. After a week of fighting on the island, Percival held his final command conference at 9&nbsp;am on 15 February in [[the Battle Box]] of [[Fort Canning]]. The Japanese had already occupied approximately half of Singapore and it was clear that the island would soon fall.  Having been told that ammunition and water would both run out by the following day, Percival agreed to surrender. The Japanese at this point were running low on artillery shells, but Percival did not know this.\n\nThe Japanese insisted that Percival himself march under a [[white flag]] to the [[Old Ford Motor Factory]] in [[Bukit Timah]] to negotiate the surrender. A Japanese officer present noted that he looked \"pale, thin and tired\".<ref>Warren, p265</ref> After a brief disagreement, when Percival insisted that the British keep 1,000 men under arms in Singapore to preserve order, which Yamashita finally conceded, it was agreed at 6:10&nbsp;pm that the British Empire troops would lay down their arms and cease resistance at 8:30&nbsp;pm. This was in spite of instructions from Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] for prolonged resistance.<ref name=\"Morris\"/> The [[Pacific War]] was just ten weeks old.\n\nA common view holds that 138,708 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel surrendered or were killed by fewer than 30,000 Japanese. However, the former figure includes nearly 50,000 troops captured or killed during the [[Battle of Malaya]], and perhaps 15,000 base troops. Many of the other troops were tired and under-equipped following their retreat from the [[Malayan peninsula]]. Conversely, the latter number represents only the front-line troops available for the invasion of Singapore. British Empire battle casualties since 8 December amounted to 7,500 killed and 11,000 wounded. Japanese losses totalled around 3,500 killed and 6,100 wounded.<ref>Thompson, p9 and p424</ref>\n\n===Culpability for the fall of Singapore===\n[[File:Singaporesurrender.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant-General Percival led by a Japanese officer, marches under a flag of [[truce]] to negotiate the capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore, on 15 February 1942. It was the largest surrender of British-led forces in history.]]\nChurchill viewed the fall of Singapore to be \"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.\" However, the British defence was that the [[Middle East]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had all received higher priorities in the allocation of men and material, so the desired [[air force]] strength of 300 to 500 aircraft was never reached, and whereas the Japanese invaded with over two hundred [[tank]]s, the British Army in Malaya did not have a single tank.<ref>Kinvig.</ref> In ''The War in Malaya'' Percival himself cites this as the major factor for the defeat stating that the 'war material which might have saved Singapore was sent to Russia and the Middle East'. However he also concedes that Britain was engaged in 'a life and death struggle in the West' and that 'this decision, however painful and regrettable, was inevitable and right'.<ref>The War in Malaya; Authur Percival p306</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Percival had been described as \"a slim, soft spoken man... with a proven reputation for bravery and organisational powers\"<ref>Kinvig, p. 47.</ref> but by 1945 this description had been turned on its head with even Percival's defenders describing him as \"something of a damp squib\".<ref>Kinvig, p. 242.</ref> The fall of Singapore switched Percival's reputation to that of an ineffective \"staff wallah\", lacking ruthlessness and aggression, even though few doubted that he was a brave and determined officer. Over six feet in height and lanky, with a clipped moustache and two protruding teeth, and unphotogenic, Percival was an easy target for a caricaturist, being described as \"tall, bucktoothed and lightly built\".<ref>Warren, p. 29.</ref> There was no doubt his presentation lacked impact as \"his manner was low key and he was a poor public speaker with the cusp of a lisp\".<ref>Kinvig, ''General Percival and the Fall of Singapore'', p. 241.</ref>\n[[File:BritishSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lieutenant-General Yamashita (seated, centre) thumps the table with his fist to emphasise his demand for unconditional surrender. Lieutenant-General Percival sits between his officers, his clenched hand to his mouth. (Photo from [[Imperial War Museum]]).]]\n\nIt has been argued{{by whom|date=November 2015}} that Percival's colleagues bear a share of the responsibility of defeat. Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham|Robert Brooke-Popham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[British Far East Command]], refused Percival permission to launch [[Operation Matador (1941)|Operation Matador]] in advance of the Japanese landings in Thailand, not wishing to run any risk of provoking the coming war. Brooke-Popham also had a reputation for falling asleep in meetings and not arguing forcefully for the air reinforcements required to defend Malaya. Admiral [[Thomas Spencer Vaughan Phillips|Tom Phillips]]' leadership of [[Force Z]] led to his demise and the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|destruction of the British fleet]] on 10 December 1941, early in the campaign.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Peter Wykeham]] suggested that the government in London was more to blame than any of the British commanders in the Far East. Despite repeated requests, the British government did not provide the necessary reinforcements and they denied Brooke-Popham \u2013 and therefore Percival \u2013 permission to enter neutral Thailand before it was too late to put in place forward defences.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite journal| last =Wykeham| first =Peter| author2 =Thomas Paul Ofcansky| title =Popham, Sir (Henry) Robert Moore Brooke| work =Oxford Dictionary of National Biography| url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/32/101032096/| date =January 2008| doi =10.1093/ref:odnb/32096}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, Percival had difficulties with his subordinates [[Lewis Heath|Sir Lewis \"Piggy\" Heath]], commanding [[Indian III Corps]], and the independent-minded [[Gordon Bennett (general)|Gordon Bennett]], commanding the [[Australian 8th Division]]. The former officer had been senior to Percival prior to his appointment as GOC (Malaya). Bennett was full of confidence in his [[Australia]]n troops and his own ability, but faced a mixed reaction in Australia when he escaped from Singapore immediately after its surrender.\n\nPercival was ultimately responsible for the men who served under him, and with other officers \u2013 notably Major-General [[David Murray-Lyon]], commander of the [[Indian 11th Infantry Division]] \u2013 he had shown a willingness to replace them when he felt their performance was not up to scratch. Perhaps his greatest mistake was to resist the building of fixed defences in either Johore or the north shore of Singapore, dismissing them in the face of repeated requests to start construction from his Chief Engineer, Brigadier [[Ivan Simson]], with the comment \"Defences are bad for morale \u2013 for both troops and civilians\".<ref>Thompson, p. 182.</ref> In doing so, Percival threw away the potential advantages he could have derived from the 6,000 engineers under his command and perhaps missed his best chance to blunt the danger posed by the Japanese tanks.\n\nPercival also insisted on defending the north-eastern shore of Singapore most heavily, against the advice of the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|Allied supreme commander in South East Asia]], General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]]. Percival was perhaps fixed on his responsibilities for defending the Singapore Naval Base.<ref>Dixon, ''[[On the Psychology of Military Incompetence]]'', p. 143.</ref> He also spread his forces thinly around the island and kept few units as a strategic reserve. When the Japanese attack came in the west, the [[Australian 22nd Brigade]] took the brunt of the assault.<ref>Thompson, p. 414.</ref> Percival refused to reinforce them as he continued to believe that the main assault would occur in the north east.<ref>Thompson, p. 430.</ref>\n\n===Captivity===\nPercival himself was briefly held prisoner in [[Changi Prison]], where \"the defeated GOC could be seen sitting head in hands, outside the married quarters he now shared with seven brigadiers, a colonel, his ADC and cook-sergeant. He discussed feelings with few, spent hours walking around the extensive compound, ruminating on the reverse and what might have been\".<ref>Kinvig, p221</ref> In the belief that it would improve discipline, he reconstituted a Malaya Command, complete with staff appointments, and helped occupy his fellow prisoners with lectures on the [[Battle of France]].<ref>MacArthur, ''Surviving the Sword: Prisoners of the Japanese 1942\u201345'', p188</ref>\n[[File:Douglas MacArthur signs formal surrender.jpg|left|thumb|The signing of the Japanese surrender; [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] (sitting), behind him are Generals Percival (background) and [[Jonathan M.

First he was imprisoned in [[Taiwan|Formosa]] and then sent on to [[Manchuria]], where he was held with several dozen other VIP captives, including the [[United States|American]] General [[Jonathan M. Wainwright (general)|Jonathan Wainwright]], in a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] near [[Xi'an District, Mudanjiang|Hsian]], about {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the north east of [[Mukden]].\n\nAs the war drew to an end, an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] team removed the prisoners from Hsian. Percival was then taken, along with Wainwright, to stand immediately behind General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as he confirmed the terms of the Japanese surrender aboard [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'' (BB-63)]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] on 2 September 1945.<ref>''Battleship Missouri Memorial'', {{cite web|url=http://www.ussmissouri.org/surrender.aspx |title=Surrender |accessdate=2006-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109061015/http://ussmissouri.org/surrender.aspx |archivedate=9 November 2005 |df=dmy }} , accessed 2 February 2006</ref> Afterwards, MacArthur gave Percival a pen he had used to sign the treaty.<ref>Warren, p286</ref>\n\nPercival and Wainwright then returned together to the [[Philippines]] to witness the surrender of the Japanese army there, which in a twist of fate was commanded by General Yamashita. Yamashita was momentarily surprised to see his former captive at the ceremony; on this occasion Percival refused to shake Yamashita's hand, angered by the mistreatment of POWs in Singapore. The flag carried by Percival's party on the way to Bukit Timah was also a witness to this reversal of fortunes, being flown when the Japanese formally surrendered Singapore back to Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]].<ref>Morris, p458</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nPercival returned to the United Kingdom in September 1945 to write his despatch at the [[War Office]] but this was revised by the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK Government]] and only published in 1948.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38215|pages=1245\u20131346|date=20 February 1948}}</ref> He retired from the army in 1946 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general but the pension of his substantive rank of major-general.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37706|page=4347|date=27 August 1946}}</ref> Thereafter, he held appointments connected with the county of Hertfordshire, where he lived at Bullards in [[Widford, Hertfordshire|Widford]]: he was Honorary Colonel of [[479th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]], ([[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|T.A.]]) from 1949 to 1954<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38762|page=5465|date=18 November 1949}}</ref><ref>Col J.D.

Percival's 1949 memoir, ''The War in Malaya'', did little to quell this criticism, being a restrained rather than self-serving account of the campaign. Unusual for a British lieutenant-general, Percival was not awarded a [[British honours system|knighthood]].\n\nPercival was respected for the time he had spent as a Japanese [[prisoner of war]]. Serving as life president of the [[Far East Prisoners of War]] Association (FEPOW), he pushed for compensation for his fellow captives, eventually helping to obtain a token \u00a35 million of frozen Japanese assets for this cause.

Except for a small stretch of land to the west of [[Kanyakumari]] town, almost the entire district is sandwiched between the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] - the only district in [[Tamilnadu]] state facing the [[Arabian Sea]].\n\nGeologically, the landmass of the district is much younger when compared to the rest of the state - faulted as late as 2.5 million years during the [[Miocene]], after which numerous [[Marine transgression|transgression]], as well as regression of sea, had shaped the western coast of the district.\n\nHistorically, [[Nanjinad]] and [[Edai Nadu]] which comprise the present day Kanyakumari district, was ruled by various Tamil and Malayalam dynasties: the [[Venad|Venad Kingdom]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyans]], the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Ay kingdom|Ays]] and the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]]. A few artifacts unearthed by archeological excavations in there. It was part of the princely state of [[Travancore]] during the colonial times prior to [[Independence Day (India)|India's independence]]; four of the eight [[tehsil]]s of [[Thiruvananthapuram district]] were separated from erstwhile Travancore Kingdom to form the new district of Kanyakumari, and they were made the part of [[Madras Presidency]] under recommendations from the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] in 1956. The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 37 districts of [[Tamil Nadu]] state.\n\nMany historical assumptions persist in the district and state, which associate sages such as [[Vyasa]], [[Agastya]], [[Tolk\u0101ppiyam|Tolkappiyar]], [[Avvaiyar]] and [[Thiruvalluvar]] to the district. The district is also the birthplace of [[Ayyavazhi]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Ay kingdom|Venad|Sangam period|Travancore|Chera dynasty}}\n{{see also|Merger of Kanyakumari with Madras State}}\n\nThe area that comprises the current Kanyakumari district was a part of the old Ay kingdom of the first and second Sangham ages. Following the decline of the Ay kingdoms, the area became Venad, with its capital [[Padmanabhapuram]] located North, North West of Nagercoil. The wealth of the Nanjilnadu beckoned many invaded kings including the Nayaks and later an Islamist army during the reign of [[Umayamma Rani]]. The [[Venad]] region was in anarchy before [[Marthanda Varma]] ascended the throne in 1729 AD. Under their rule anarchy was dominant in [[Kanyakumari]] region. However, [[Marthanda Varma]] brought a sense of disorder under control by annexing the nearby territories, putting down the feudal lords and establishing the strong state of [[Travancore]]. He had also bought some portions of Kanyakumari from the then viceroy making it the southern boundary. Under his rule, the district improved in a social context as well as economically. The famous [[battle of Colachel]] took place in the district. Later, the Maharajas of Travancore built the forts at Aramboly ( Aralvaimozhy) to prevent any invasion from the Carnatic Kings. Key elements of [[Velu Thampi Dalawa|Velu Thampi Dalawa's]] revolt occurred in the area and the English East India company's army under Col. Leger broke through the fortifications and entered Travancore in 1810. In the year 1949, the area became a part of the reestablished [[Travancore]] Cochin state. The people of Agasteeswarem, Thovalai, Kalkulam and Vilavancode taluks, which formed the southern divisions of the former district of [[Trivandrum]], were predominantly Tamil speaking people. An extreme agitation by Tamil speaking residents under the leadership of [[A. Nesamony|Marshal Nesamony]] took place for including Kanyakumari within [[Tamil Nadu]]. Eventually the merger happened in 1956 based on [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|language reorganization of states]].\n\nHistorically, [[Nanjilnadu]] (Agastheeswaram and Thovalai taluks) and [[Eda Nadu]] (Vilavancode and Kalkulam taluks) which comprises the present Kanyakumari district. The district were ruled by various dynasties: [[Venad|Venad Kingdom]], [[Travancore|Travancore Kingdom]], the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Ay kingdom|Ays]] and the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]]. A few artifacts were unearthed by archeological excavations in parts of the district. The district was part of the princely state of [[Travancore]] during the colonial times prior to [[Independence Day (India)|India's independence]]; four of the eight [[tehsil]]s of [[Thiruvananthapuram district]] were separated to form the new district of Kanyakumari in 1956 following the demands of reunion made by the Tamil speaking majority people (about 70% of the population), who feels that their feelings were suppressed by the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom which has Malayalam majority population. The four taluks were made the part of then [[Madras Presidency]] under recommendations from the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] in 1956.

The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 37 districts of [[Tamil Nadu]] state.\n\nMany historical assumptions persist in the district and state, which associate sages such as [[Vyasa]], [[Agastya]], [[Tolk\u0101ppiyam|Tolkappiyar]], [[Avvaiyar]] and [[Thiruvalluvar]] to the district. The district is also the birthplace of [[Ayyavazhi]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Ay kingdom|Venad|Sangam period|Travancore|Chera dynasty}}\n{{see also|Merger of Kanyakumari with Madras State}}\n\nThe area that comprises the current Kanyakumari district was a part of the old Ay kingdom of the first and second Sangham ages. Following the decline of the Ay kingdoms, the area became Venad, with its capital [[Padmanabhapuram]] located North, North West of Nagercoil. The wealth of the Nanjilnadu beckoned many invaded kings including the Nayaks and later an Islamist army during the reign of [[Umayamma Rani]]. The [[Venad]] region was in anarchy before [[Marthanda Varma]] ascended the throne in 1729 AD. Under their rule anarchy was dominant in [[Kanyakumari]] region. However, [[Marthanda Varma]] brought a sense of disorder under control by annexing the nearby territories, putting down the feudal lords and establishing the strong state of [[Travancore]]. He had also bought some portions of Kanyakumari from the then viceroy making it the southern boundary. Under his rule, the district improved in a social context as well as economically. The famous [[battle of Colachel]] took place in the district. Later, the Maharajas of Travancore built the forts at Aramboly ( Aralvaimozhy) to prevent any invasion from the Carnatic Kings. Key elements of [[Velu Thampi Dalawa|Velu Thampi Dalawa's]] revolt occurred in the area and the English East India company's army under Col. Leger broke through the fortifications and entered Travancore in 1810. In the year 1949, the area became a part of the reestablished [[Travancore]] Cochin state. The people of Agasteeswarem, Thovalai, Kalkulam and Vilavancode taluks, which formed the southern divisions of the former district of [[Trivandrum]], were predominantly Tamil speaking people. An extreme agitation by Tamil speaking residents under the leadership of [[A. Nesamony|Marshal Nesamony]] took place for including Kanyakumari within [[Tamil Nadu]]. Eventually the merger happened in 1956 based on [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|language reorganization of states]].\n\nHistorically, [[Nanjilnadu]] (Agastheeswaram and Thovalai taluks) and [[Eda Nadu]] (Vilavancode and Kalkulam taluks) which comprises the present Kanyakumari district. The district were ruled by various dynasties: [[Venad|Venad Kingdom]], [[Travancore|Travancore Kingdom]], the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Ay kingdom|Ays]] and the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]]. A few artifacts were unearthed by archeological excavations in parts of the district. The district was part of the princely state of [[Travancore]] during the colonial times prior to [[Independence Day (India)|India's independence]]; four of the eight [[tehsil]]s of [[Thiruvananthapuram district]] were separated to form the new district of Kanyakumari in 1956 following the demands of reunion made by the Tamil speaking majority people (about 70% of the population), who feels that their feelings were suppressed by the erstwhile Travancore Kingdom which has Malayalam majority population. The four taluks were made the part of then [[Madras Presidency]] under recommendations from the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] in 1956. The Presidency was later renamed Tamil Nadu in 1969 and Kanyakumari, today, is one of the 37 districts of [[Tamil Nadu]] state.\n\nThe district is the birthplace of [[Ayyavazhi]], the [[Henotheism|henotheistic]] belief initiated by [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Gopalan Seedar]], one among the 5 prime disciples of [[Ayya Vaikundar]]. The social, religious and cultural history of the 19th century Kanyakumari district is intrinsically inter-twined with those of Ayyavazhi. Many historical assumptions persist in the district and state, which associate with sages namely [[Vyasa]], [[Agastya]], [[Tolk\u0101ppiyam|Tolkappiyar]], [[Avvaiyar]] and [[Thiruvalluvar]].\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Location ===\nThe district is situated between 77\u00b015' and 77\u00b036' east longitude and 8\u00b003' and 8\u00b035' north latitude.
