It is characterized by [[isolationism|isolationistic]], semi-open and [[expansionistic]] periods.\n\nThe very first human habitation in the [[Japanese archipelago]] has been traced to [[Japanese Paleolithic|prehistoric times]] around 30,000 BC.<ref name=\"Fujita2016\"/> The [[J\u014dmon period]], named after its [[cord-marked pottery]], was followed by the [[Yayoi]] in the first millennium BC when new technologies were introduced from continental Asia. During this period, the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in the Chinese ''[[Book of Han]]'' in the first century AD.\n\nBetween the fourth century and the ninth century, Japan's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, nominally controlled by the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] (sometimes [[Empress of Japan|Empress]]). This [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial dynasty]] continues to reign over Japan. In 794, a new imperial capital was established at [[Heian-ky\u014d]] (modern [[Kyoto]]), marking the beginning of the [[Heian period]], which lasted until 1185. The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Japanese religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native [[Shinto]] practices and [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]].\n\nOver the following centuries, the power of the Emperor and the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|imperial court]] gradually declined, passing first to great clans of civilian aristocrats \u2013 most notably the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] \u2013 and then to the military clans and their armies of [[samurai]]. The [[Minamoto clan]] under [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] emerged victorious from the [[Genpei War]] of 1180\u201385, defeating their rival military clan, the [[Taira clan|Taira]]. After seizing power, Yoritomo set up his capital in [[Kamakura]] and took the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''. In 1274 and 1281, the [[Kamakura shogunate]] withstood two [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]], but in 1333 it was toppled by a rival claimant to the shogunate, ushering in the [[Muromachi period]]. During the Muromachi period regional warlords called ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' grew in power at the expense of the ''sh\u014dgun''. Eventually, Japan descended into a [[Sengoku period|period of civil war]]. Over the course of the late sixteenth century, Japan was reunified under the leadership of the prominent ''daimy\u014d'' [[Oda Nobunaga]] and his successor [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. After Hideyoshi's death in 1598, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] came to power and was appointed ''sh\u014dgun'' by the Emperor. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which governed from [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]), presided over a prosperous and peaceful era known as the [[Edo period]] (1600\u20131868). The Tokugawa shogunate imposed [[Edo society#Four Classes|a strict class system]] on Japanese society and [[Sakoku|cut off almost all contact with the outside world]]. Under [[Emperor K\u014dkaku]] and the retired [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]], in late 18th and early 19th centuries, the shogunate started to lose its previous positions of power.\n\n[[Portugal]] and Japan started their first affiliation in 1543, when the Portuguese became the first Europeans to reach Japan by landing in the southern archipelago. They had a significant impact on Japan, even in this initial limited interaction, [[Firearms of Japan|introducing firearms to Japanese warfare]]. The [[Netherlands]] was the first to establish trade relations with Japan, [[Japan\u2013Netherlands relations|Japanese and Dutch relations]] are dating back to 1609. The American [[Perry Expedition]] in 1853\u201354 more completely ended Japan's seclusion; this contributed to the [[Bakumatsu|fall of the shogunate]] and the [[Meiji Restoration|return of power to the Emperor]] during the [[Boshin War]] in 1868. The [[Meiji oligarchy|new national leadership]] of the following [[Meiji period]] transformed the isolated feudal [[island country]] into [[Empire of Japan|an empire]] that closely followed Western models and became a [[great power]]. Although democracy developed and modern civilian culture prospered during the [[Taish\u014d period]] (1912\u201326), Japan's powerful military had great autonomy and overruled Japan's civilian leaders in the 1920s and 1930s. The military [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]] in 1931, and from 1937 the conflict escalated into a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|prolonged war with China]]. Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 led to [[Pacific War|war with the United States]] and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Japan's forces soon became overextended, but the military held out in spite of [[Air raids on Japan|Allied air attacks]] that inflicted severe damage on population centers. Emperor [[Hirohito]] announced Japan's [[Surrender of Japan|unconditional surrender]] on August 15, 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]].\n\nThe [[Occupation of Japan|Allies occupied Japan]] until 1952, during which a [[Constitution of Japan|new constitution]] was enacted in 1947 that transformed Japan into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. After 1955, Japan enjoyed [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|very high economic growth]], and became a world [[Economy of Japan|economic powerhouse]]. Since the 1990s, the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]] had been a major issue, such as the 1995 [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Kobe-Osaka earthquake]] and [[Tokyo subway sarin attack]]. In 2004, [[Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group|Japan sent a military force]] as part of the international [[Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq|coalition forces]] during the [[Iraq War]].\n\nOn Friday, March 11, 2011, at 2:46&nbsp;p.m. (UTC+9), Japan suffered from a powerful [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude 9.0]] [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami]], one of the most powerful earthquakes recorded.

[[Edo period]], 1798.]]\n\nThe Edo period was a time of prolific cultural output, as the merchant classes grew in wealth and began spending their income on cultural and social pursuits too expensive for commoners and too inappropriate for the upper and ruling class.\n\nForms of theatre such as [[kabuki]] and ''[[bunraku]]'' puppet theatre became widely popular. These new forms of entertainment were (at the time) accompanied by short songs (''kouta'') and music played on the ''[[shamisen]]'', a new import to Japan in 1600.<ref name=\"Dalby Kouta\">{{cite book |last1=Dalby |first1=Liza |title=Little Songs of the Geisha |date=2000 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |location=Massachusetts |isbn=0-8048-3250-1 |pages=14\u201315 |edition=2nd}}</ref> ''[[Haiku]]'', whose greatest master is generally agreed to be [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]] (1644-1694),<ref>Hane, 213-214.</ref> also rose as a major form of poetry.\n\nKabuki was still a relatively new form of theatre - cheap, flamboyant, and more accessible than traditional [[Noh]] theatre. [[Geisha]] - a new profession of entertainers - also became popular, cheaper and more accessible than [[Oiran|high-ranking courtesans]], who would sometimes require many expensive visits before sleeping with a customer.\n\nGeisha would provide conversation at parties, sing ''kouta'' and play the shamisen, and would dance and play drinking games with customers, though they would not sleep with them. Geisha soon became more popular than courtesans, and faced a number of clamp-downs throughout the Edo period; a geisha accused of stealing a courtesan's customers could be fully investigated, and the profession faced dress edicts to set them apart from courtesans.\n\nBoth forms of theatre and the ''shamisen'' were considered slightly lower-class, as they spoke openly of pursuits improper for the upper classes, talked of geisha and the pleasure quarters, and were relatively frank in their descriptions of forbidden love, heartache and romance. Both ''kouta'' and ''haiku'' could be composed off-the-cuff, and many were whimsical in nature, describing bittersweet emotions and torrid romances.\n\nMembers of the wealthy merchant class who patronized these forms of entertainment were said to live hedonistic lives, which came to be called the ''[[ukiyo]]'' (\"floating world\").<ref>Hane, 200.</ref> This lifestyle inspired ''[[ukiyo-z\u014dshi]]'' popular novels and ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' art, the latter of which were often woodblock prints<ref>Hane, 201\u2013202.</ref> that progressed to greater sophistication and use of [[Nishiki-e|multiple printed colors]].<ref>Deal, 296.</ref>\n\n====Decline and fall of the shogunate====\n{{Main|Bakumatsu|Meiji Restoration}}\nBy the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the shogunate showed signs of weakening.<ref name=\"bakumatsu\">Henshall, 68\u201369.</ref> The dramatic growth of agriculture that had characterized the early Edo period had ended<ref name=\"agriculture\"/> and the government handled the devastating [[Tenp\u014d famine]]s poorly.<ref name=\"bakumatsu\"/> Peasant unrest grew and government revenues fell.<ref>Totman, 367\u2013369.</ref> The shogunate cut the pay of the already financially distressed samurai, many of whom worked side jobs to make a living.<ref>McClain, 123\u2013124, 128.</ref> Discontented samurai were soon to play a major role in engineering the downfall of the Tokugawa shogunate.<ref>Sims, 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the people drew inspiration from new ideas and fields of study.

In 1874, using the incident as a pretext, Japan launched [[Taiwan expedition of 1874|a military expedition]] to Taiwan to assert their claims to the [[Ryukyu Islands]].

Expanding trade and agriculture increased the wealth of society, which was increasingly monopolized by social elites.<ref name=\"Henshall, 13\"/> By 600 AD, a class structure had developed which included court aristocrats, the families of local magnates, commoners, and slaves.<ref name=\"social\">Farris, 26.</ref> Over 90% were commoners, who included farmers, merchants, and artisans.<ref name=\"class\">Farris, 96.</ref> During the late Heian period, the governing elite consisted of three classes. The traditional aristocracy shared power with Buddhist monks and samurai,<ref name=\"class\"/> though the latter became increasingly dominant in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods.<ref>Farris, 152, 181.</ref> These periods witnessed the rise of the merchant class, which diversified into a greater variety of specialized occupations.<ref>Farris, 152, 157.</ref>\n\nWomen initially held social and political equality with men,<ref name=\"social\"/> and archaeological evidence suggests a prehistorical preference for female rulers in western Japan. Female Emperors appear in recorded history until the [[Meiji Constitution]] declared strict male-only ascension in 1889.<ref name=\"Tonomura, 352\">Tonomura, 352.</ref> Chinese Confucian-style patriarchy was first codified in the 7th\u20138th centuries with the ''[[ritsury\u014d]]'' system,<ref>Tonomura, 351.</ref> which introduced a patrilineal [[koseki|family register]] with a male head of household.<ref>Tonomura, 353\u2013354.</ref> Women until then had held important roles in government which thereafter gradually diminished, though even in the late Heian period women wielded considerable court influence.<ref name=\"Tonomura, 352\"/> Marital customs and many laws governing private property remained gender neutral.<ref>Tonomura, 354\u2013355.</ref>\n\nFor reasons that are unclear to historians the status of women rapidly deteriorated from the fourteenth century and onwards.<ref>Farris, 162\u2013163.</ref> Women of all social classes lost the right to own and inherit property and were increasingly viewed as inferior to men.<ref>Farris, 159\u2013160.</ref> Hideyoshi's land survey of the 1590s further entrenched the status of men as dominant landholders.<ref>Tonomura, 360.</ref> During the US occupation following World War II&nbsp;, women gained legal equality with men,<ref>Hastings, 379.</ref> but faced widespread workplace discrimination. A movement for women's rights led to the passage of an equal employment law in 1986, but by the 1990s women held only 10% of management positions.<ref>Totman, 614\u2013615.</ref>\n\nHideyoshi's land survey of the 1590s designated all who cultivated the land as commoners, an act which granted effective freedom to most of Japan's [[Slavery in Japan|slaves]].<ref name=\"Farris, 193\"/>\n\n[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|alt=|Social structure of the Edo period]]\n\nThe Tokugawa shogunate rigidified long-existent class divisions,{{sfn|Wakita|1991|p=123}} placing most of the population into [[Edo Neo-Confucianism|a Neo-Confucian]] hierarchy of [[four occupations]], with the ruling elite at the top, followed by the peasants who made up 80% of the population, then artisans, and merchants at the bottom.{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=390}} Court nobles,{{sfn|Henshall|2012|p=56}} clerics, outcasts, entertainers, and workers of the licensed quarters fell outside this structure.{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=391}} Different legal codes applied to different classes, marriage between classes was prohibited, and towns were subdivided into different class areas.{{sfn|Wakita|1991|p=123}} The social stratification had little bearing on economic conditions: many samurai lived in poverty{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=391}} and the wealth of the merchant class grew throughout the period as the commercial economy developed and urbanization grew.{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=392}} The Edo-era social power structure proved untenable and gave way following the Meiji Restoration to one in which commercial power played an increasingly significant political role.{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=393}}\n\nAlthough all social classes were legally abolished at the start of the Meiji period,<ref name=\"reform\"/> income inequality greatly increased.<ref name=\"income\">Moriguchi and Saez, 80, 88.</ref> New economic class divisions were formed between capitalist business owners who formed the new middle class, small shopkeepers of the old middle class, the working class in factories, rural landlords, and tenant farmers.<ref>Neary, 397.</ref> The great disparities of income between the classes dissipated during and after World War II, eventually declining to levels that were among the lowest in the industrialized world.<ref name=\"income\"/> Some postwar surveys indicated that up to 90% of Japanese self-identified as being middle class.<ref>Duus, 21.</ref>\n\nPopulations of workers in professions [[Kegare|considered unclean]], such as leatherworkers and those who handled the dead, developed in the 15th and 16th centuries into hereditary [[Outcast (person)|outcast]] communities.{{sfn|Neary|2003|p=269}} These people, later called ''[[burakumin]]'', fell outside the Edo-period class structure and suffered discrimination that lasted after the class system was abolished.{{sfn|Neary|2003|p=270}} Though activism has improved the social conditions of those from ''burakumin'' backgrounds, discrimination in employment and education lingered into the 21st century.{{sfn|Neary|2003|p=271}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikivoyage|Pre-modern Japan|History of

It is characterized by [[isolationism|isolationistic]], semi-open and [[expansionistic]] periods.\n\nThe very first human habitation in the [[Japanese archipelago]] has been traced to [[Japanese Paleolithic|prehistoric times]] around 30,000 BC.<ref name=\"Fujita2016\"/> The [[J\u014dmon period]], named after its [[cord-marked pottery]], was followed by the [[Yayoi]] in the first millennium BC when new technologies were introduced from continental Asia. During this period, the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in the Chinese ''[[Book of Han]]'' in the first century AD.\n\nBetween the fourth century and the ninth century, Japan's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, nominally controlled by the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] (sometimes [[Empress of Japan|Empress]]). This [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial dynasty]] continues to reign over Japan. In 794, a new imperial capital was established at [[Heian-ky\u014d]] (modern [[Kyoto]]), marking the beginning of the [[Heian period]], which lasted until 1185. The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Japanese religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native [[Shinto]] practices and [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]].\n\nOver the following centuries, the power of the Emperor and the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|imperial court]] gradually declined, passing first to great clans of civilian aristocrats \u2013 most notably the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] \u2013 and then to the military clans and their armies of [[samurai]]. The [[Minamoto clan]] under [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] emerged victorious from the [[Genpei War]] of 1180\u201385, defeating their rival military clan, the [[Taira clan|Taira]]. After seizing power, Yoritomo set up his capital in [[Kamakura]] and took the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''. In 1274 and 1281, the [[Kamakura shogunate]] withstood two [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]], but in 1333 it was toppled by a rival claimant to the shogunate, ushering in the [[Muromachi period]]. During the Muromachi period regional warlords called ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' grew in power at the expense of the ''sh\u014dgun''. Eventually, Japan descended into a [[Sengoku period|period of civil war]]. Over the course of the late sixteenth century, Japan was reunified under the leadership of the prominent ''daimy\u014d'' [[Oda Nobunaga]] and his successor [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. After Hideyoshi's death in 1598, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] came to power and was appointed ''sh\u014dgun'' by the Emperor. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which governed from [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]), presided over a prosperous and peaceful era known as the [[Edo period]] (1600\u20131868). The Tokugawa shogunate imposed [[Edo society#Four Classes|a strict class system]] on Japanese society and [[Sakoku|cut off almost all contact with the outside world]]. Under [[Emperor K\u014dkaku]] and the retired [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]], in late 18th and early 19th centuries, the shogunate started to lose its previous positions of power.\n\n[[Portugal]] and Japan started their first affiliation in 1543, when the Portuguese became the first Europeans to reach Japan by landing in the southern archipelago. They had a significant impact on Japan, even in this initial limited interaction, [[Firearms of Japan|introducing firearms to Japanese warfare]]. The [[Netherlands]] was the first to establish trade relations with Japan, [[Japan\u2013Netherlands relations|Japanese and Dutch relations]] are dating back to 1609. The American [[Perry Expedition]] in 1853\u201354 more completely ended Japan's seclusion; this contributed to the [[Bakumatsu|fall of the shogunate]] and the [[Meiji Restoration|return of power to the Emperor]] during the [[Boshin War]] in 1868. The [[Meiji oligarchy|new national leadership]] of the following [[Meiji period]] transformed the isolated feudal [[island country]] into [[Empire of Japan|an empire]] that closely followed Western models and became a [[great power]]. Although democracy developed and modern civilian culture prospered during the [[Taish\u014d period]] (1912\u201326), Japan's powerful military had great autonomy and overruled Japan's civilian leaders in the 1920s and 1930s. The military [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]] in 1931, and from 1937 the conflict escalated into a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|prolonged war with China]]. Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 led to [[Pacific War|war with the United States]] and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Japan's forces soon became overextended, but the military held out in spite of [[Air raids on Japan|Allied air attacks]] that inflicted severe damage on population centers. Emperor [[Hirohito]] announced Japan's [[Surrender of Japan|unconditional surrender]] on August 15, 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]].\n\nThe [[Occupation of Japan|Allies occupied Japan]] until 1952, during which a [[Constitution of Japan|new constitution]] was enacted in 1947 that transformed Japan into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. After 1955, Japan enjoyed [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|very high economic growth]], and became a world [[Economy of Japan|economic powerhouse]]. Since the 1990s, the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]] had been a major issue, such as the 1995 [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Kobe-Osaka earthquake]] and [[Tokyo subway sarin attack]]. In 2004, [[Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group|Japan sent a military force]] as part of the international [[Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq|coalition forces]] during the [[Iraq War]].\n\nOn Friday, March 11, 2011, at 2:46&nbsp;p.m. (UTC+9), Japan suffered from a powerful [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude 9.0]] [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami]], one of the most powerful earthquakes recorded. The earthquake killed almost 20,000 people, affected places in the three regions of [[Tohoku region|Tohoku]], [[Chubu region|Chubu]], and [[Kanto region|Kanto]] in the northeast of [[Honshu]], including the [[Tokyo]] [[Greater Tokyo Area|area]], had massive economic ramifications, and caused the serious [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear power disaster]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Geographical background==\n{{See also|Geography of Japan}}\n[[File:Japan_topo_en.jpg|thumb|A topographic map of Japan]]\n\nThe {{nihongo|''[[Japanese archipelago]]''|\u65e5\u672c\u5217\u5cf6|Nihon Rett\u014d}} is a group of 6,852 islands that form the country of [[Japan]].

[[Edo period]], 1798.]]\n\nThe Edo period was a time of prolific cultural output, as the merchant classes grew in wealth and began spending their income on cultural and social pursuits too expensive for commoners and too inappropriate for the upper and ruling class.\n\nForms of theatre such as [[kabuki]] and ''[[bunraku]]'' puppet theatre became widely popular. These new forms of entertainment were (at the time) accompanied by short songs (''kouta'') and music played on the ''[[shamisen]]'', a new import to Japan in 1600.<ref name=\"Dalby Kouta\">{{cite book |last1=Dalby |first1=Liza |title=Little Songs of the Geisha |date=2000 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |location=Massachusetts |isbn=0-8048-3250-1 |pages=14\u201315 |edition=2nd}}</ref> ''[[Haiku]]'', whose greatest master is generally agreed to be [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]] (1644-1694),<ref>Hane, 213-214.</ref> also rose as a major form of poetry.\n\nKabuki was still a relatively new form of theatre - cheap, flamboyant, and more accessible than traditional [[Noh]] theatre. [[Geisha]] - a new profession of entertainers - also became popular, cheaper and more accessible than [[Oiran|high-ranking courtesans]], who would sometimes require many expensive visits before sleeping with a customer.\n\nGeisha would provide conversation at parties, sing ''kouta'' and play the shamisen, and would dance and play drinking games with customers, though they would not sleep with them. Geisha soon became more popular than courtesans, and faced a number of clamp-downs throughout the Edo period; a geisha accused of stealing a courtesan's customers could be fully investigated, and the profession faced dress edicts to set them apart from courtesans.\n\nBoth forms of theatre and the ''shamisen'' were considered slightly lower-class, as they spoke openly of pursuits improper for the upper classes, talked of geisha and the pleasure quarters, and were relatively frank in their descriptions of forbidden love, heartache and romance. Both ''kouta'' and ''haiku'' could be composed off-the-cuff, and many were whimsical in nature, describing bittersweet emotions and torrid romances.\n\nMembers of the wealthy merchant class who patronized these forms of entertainment were said to live hedonistic lives, which came to be called the ''[[ukiyo]]'' (\"floating world\").<ref>Hane, 200.</ref> This lifestyle inspired ''[[ukiyo-z\u014dshi]]'' popular novels and ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' art, the latter of which were often woodblock prints<ref>Hane, 201\u2013202.</ref> that progressed to greater sophistication and use of [[Nishiki-e|multiple printed colors]].<ref>Deal, 296.</ref>\n\n====Decline and fall of the shogunate====\n{{Main|Bakumatsu|Meiji Restoration}}\nBy the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the shogunate showed signs of weakening.<ref name=\"bakumatsu\">Henshall, 68\u201369.</ref> The dramatic growth of agriculture that had characterized the early Edo period had ended<ref name=\"agriculture\"/> and the government handled the devastating [[Tenp\u014d famine]]s poorly.<ref name=\"bakumatsu\"/> Peasant unrest grew and government revenues fell.<ref>Totman, 367\u2013369.</ref> The shogunate cut the pay of the already financially distressed samurai, many of whom worked side jobs to make a living.<ref>McClain, 123\u2013124, 128.</ref> Discontented samurai were soon to play a major role in engineering the downfall of the Tokugawa shogunate.<ref>Sims, 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the people drew inspiration from new ideas and fields of study.

For instance, it criticized the Chinese-style Neo-Confucianism advocated by the shogunate and emphasized the Emperor's divine authority, which the Shinto faith taught had its roots in Japan's mythic past, which was referred to as the \"[[Age of the Gods]]\".<ref>Hane, 168\u2013169.</ref>\n\n[[File:Satsuma-samurai-during-boshin-war-period.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Samurai of the Satsuma Domain during the Boshin War]]\nThe arrival in 1853 of a fleet of American ships commanded by Commodore [[Matthew&nbsp;C.

The shogunate had no defense against Perry's gunboats and had to agree to his demands that American ships be permitted to acquire provisions and trade at Japanese ports.<ref name=\"bakumatsu\"/> The US, Great Britain, Russia, and other Western powers imposed what became known as \"[[unequal treaties]]\" on Japan which stipulated that Japan must allow citizens of these countries to visit or reside on Japanese territory and must not levy tariffs on their imports or try them in Japanese courts.<ref>Perez, 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe shogunate's failure to oppose the Western powers angered many Japanese, particularly those of the southern domains of [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] and [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]].<ref>Henshall, 70.</ref> Many samurai there, inspired by the nationalist doctrines of the kokugaku school, adopted the slogan of ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (\"revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians\").<ref>Totman, 380, 382.</ref> The two domains then went on to form an alliance.

Only two percent of the population were eligible to vote, and legislation proposed in the House required the support of the unelected upper house, the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]].
