The southern boundary is the Dorrigo ranges, which also mark the southern boundary for the Clarence River Basin.\n\nThe defining characteristic of the region are the fertile valleys of the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence]], [[Richmond River|Richmond]] and [[Tweed River, New South Wales|Tweed]] rivers and their sources, hence the region's name; and the region's white sandy beaches.\n\n===Demography and area===\nThe following [[Local government areas of New South Wales|local government areas]] are contained within the region:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+Population by Local Government Area\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Richmond Tweed rank\n! scope=\"col\" | Local government area\n! scope=\"col\" | Population 30 June 2016<ref name=\"3218.0\">{{cite web |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |title=3218.0 \u2013 Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2016 |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/797F86DBD192B8F8CA2568A9001393CD?opendocument}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | 10 year growth rate\n! scope=\"col\" | Population density (people/km<sup>2</sup>)\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 1\n| [[Tweed Shire]]\n| 93,458\n| 14.6\n| 71.5\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 3\n| [[City of Lismore]]\n| 44.054\n| 1.7\n| 34.2\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 4\n| [[Ballina Shire]]\n| 42,626\n| 7.8\n| 87.9\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 5\n| [[Byron Shire]]\n| 32,790\n| 8.8\n| 58.0\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 6\n| [[Richmond Valley Council]]\n| 23,164\n| 6.6\n| 7.6\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 7\n| [[Kyogle Council]]\n| 9,072\n| -4.4\n| 2.5\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Richmond Tweed\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 245,164\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 8.6\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 23.9\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 2\n| [[Clarence Valley Council]]\n| 51,367\n| 4.5\n| 4.9\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Northern Rivers\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 296,531\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 7.9\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 14.3\n|}\n\nThe region is traversed by the [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]], [[Bruxner Highway]], Clarence Way, [[Summerland Way]] and the [[North Coast railway line, New South Wales|North Coast Line]] which links Sydney to Brisbane, Queensland.\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe northernmost part of the region contains [[Mount Warning]] and the surrounding remnants of the long-extinct [[Tweed Volcano]], portions of which extend into southern [[Queensland]]. Immediately to the south was formerly the \"[[Big Scrub]]\", an extensive area of subtropical rainforest that was largely cleared for timber-getting and subsequently dairy farming in the nineteenth century. The major towns of the area developed at the navigable heads of the local river systems (Murwillumbah on the Tweed, Lismore on the [[Wilsons River (New South Wales)|Wilsons]] \u2013 a tributary of the Richmond \u2013 and Grafton on the Clarence) rather than on the coast, in order to be able to transport the valuable timber products (in particular the Australian red cedar, ''[[Toona ciliata]]'') to markets interstate and overseas.<ref>[https://www.tracesmagazine.com.au/2013/09/ballina-naval-maritime-museum-cedar-and-steamers/ Traces magazine September 2013: Ballina Naval and Maritime Museum :: Cedar and steamers]</ref> Dairy production in the region was extensive up until the 1970s and many towns in the area retain their dairy processing plants (\"butter factories\") from that era, now largely re-purposed for other uses; dairy cattle were then largely replaced with beef cattle for economic reasons, although some dairy production remains.<ref>[https://www.richhistory.org.au/lismore-history/district-history/dairying/ Richmond River Historical Society: Dairying]</ref> The north of the region is an important [[sugarcane]] growing area with smaller contributions from coffee, bananas and assorted tropical fruit and vegetables. The hills with their red volcanic soils inland from [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] provide Australia's main region for the cultivation of [[macadamia]] trees which are used for their production of both raw nuts and macadamia oil.<ref>[https://www.macadamiacastle.com.au/macadamia-history/ www.macadamiacastle.com.au: Macadamia History]</ref> [[Ballina, New South Wales|Ballina]] is a fishing port and was a centre for Australia's east coast offshore [[prawn]] industry, although boat numbers have declined in recent years, while additional vessels operate out of [[Iluka, New South Wales|Iluka]] and [[Yamba, New South Wales|Yamba]].<ref>Harrison, John.

Further south, the rural portions of the Clarence river catchment are predominantly used for forestry, agriculture and grazing.<ref>[https://economy.id.com.au/clarence-valley/about Clarence Valley Council: economic profile]</ref>\n\nThe region as a whole includes a significant component of New South Wales' state forests and national parks, and tourism is important in the north of the region in particular, especially in [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]], which is effectively a southern extension of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], and Byron Bay, which has developed a reputation as both a centre for relaxation and \"alternative\" health practices such as [[yoga]], and at certain times of the year, a convenient out-of-town recreation area for partygoers from the major urban centres of south-east Queensland. The village of [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]], in the [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]] area, also attracts tourists interested in its reputation for environmental and alternative living initiatives such as [[permaculture]], sustainability, and self-sufficiency, as well as its often-cited counterculture which includes lobbying for the decriminalisation of recreational and medicinal [[cannabis]], as evidenced by its annual [[MardiGrass]] celebration.<ref>[http://nimbinmardigrass.com/ Nimbin MardiGrass official site]</ref> Following some decades of population decline with the reduction of certain primary industry (in particular dairying), the area is now seeing a population increase, in part because of the availability of ex-dairy land for newer niche crops and hobby farms along with an influx of \"sea change\" and \"tree change\" families, as well as retirees attracted by the region's subtropical climate and unique combination of lifestyle attributes.<ref>[https://www.communityprofile.com.au/northernrivers Regional Development Australia: Northern Rivers Community Profile]</ref><ref>Bock, Karl & Brunckhorst, David (undated but post-2006).

The southern boundary is the Dorrigo ranges, which also mark the southern boundary for the Clarence River Basin.\n\nThe defining characteristic of the region are the fertile valleys of the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence]], [[Richmond River|Richmond]] and [[Tweed River, New South Wales|Tweed]] rivers and their sources, hence the region's name; and the region's white sandy beaches.\n\n===Demography and area===\nThe following [[Local government areas of New South Wales|local government areas]] are contained within the region:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+Population by Local Government Area\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Richmond Tweed rank\n! scope=\"col\" | Local government area\n! scope=\"col\" | Population 30 June 2016<ref name=\"3218.0\">{{cite web |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |title=3218.0 \u2013 Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2016 |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/797F86DBD192B8F8CA2568A9001393CD?opendocument}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | 10 year growth rate\n! scope=\"col\" | Population density (people/km<sup>2</sup>)\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 1\n| [[Tweed Shire]]\n| 93,458\n| 14.6\n| 71.5\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 3\n| [[City of Lismore]]\n| 44.054\n| 1.7\n| 34.2\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 4\n| [[Ballina Shire]]\n| 42,626\n| 7.8\n| 87.9\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 5\n| [[Byron Shire]]\n| 32,790\n| 8.8\n| 58.0\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 6\n| [[Richmond Valley Council]]\n| 23,164\n| 6.6\n| 7.6\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 7\n| [[Kyogle Council]]\n| 9,072\n| -4.4\n| 2.5\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Richmond Tweed\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 245,164\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 8.6\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 23.9\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 2\n| [[Clarence Valley Council]]\n| 51,367\n| 4.5\n| 4.9\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Northern Rivers\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 296,531\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 7.9\n! style=\"text-align:right\" | 14.3\n|}\n\nThe region is traversed by the [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]], [[Bruxner Highway]], Clarence Way, [[Summerland Way]] and the [[North Coast railway line, New South Wales|North Coast Line]] which links Sydney to Brisbane, Queensland.\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe northernmost part of the region contains [[Mount Warning]] and the surrounding remnants of the long-extinct [[Tweed Volcano]], portions of which extend into southern [[Queensland]]. Immediately to the south was formerly the \"[[Big Scrub]]\", an extensive area of subtropical rainforest that was largely cleared for timber-getting and subsequently dairy farming in the nineteenth century. The major towns of the area developed at the navigable heads of the local river systems (Murwillumbah on the Tweed, Lismore on the [[Wilsons River (New South Wales)|Wilsons]] \u2013 a tributary of the Richmond \u2013 and Grafton on the Clarence) rather than on the coast, in order to be able to transport the valuable timber products (in particular the Australian red cedar, ''[[Toona ciliata]]'') to markets interstate and overseas.<ref>[https://www.tracesmagazine.com.au/2013/09/ballina-naval-maritime-museum-cedar-and-steamers/ Traces magazine September 2013: Ballina Naval and Maritime Museum :: Cedar and steamers]</ref> Dairy production in the region was extensive up until the 1970s and many towns in the area retain their dairy processing plants (\"butter factories\") from that era, now largely re-purposed for other uses; dairy cattle were then largely replaced with beef cattle for economic reasons, although some dairy production remains.<ref>[https://www.richhistory.org.au/lismore-history/district-history/dairying/ Richmond River Historical Society: Dairying]</ref> The north of the region is an important [[sugarcane]] growing area with smaller contributions from coffee, bananas and assorted tropical fruit and vegetables. The hills with their red volcanic soils inland from [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] provide Australia's main region for the cultivation of [[macadamia]] trees which are used for their production of both raw nuts and macadamia oil.<ref>[https://www.macadamiacastle.com.au/macadamia-history/ www.macadamiacastle.com.au: Macadamia History]</ref> [[Ballina, New South Wales|Ballina]] is a fishing port and was a centre for Australia's east coast offshore [[prawn]] industry, although boat numbers have declined in recent years, while additional vessels operate out of [[Iluka, New South Wales|Iluka]] and [[Yamba, New South Wales|Yamba]].<ref>Harrison, John.

Further south, the rural portions of the Clarence river catchment are predominantly used for forestry, agriculture and grazing.<ref>[https://economy.id.com.au/clarence-valley/about Clarence Valley Council: economic profile]</ref>\n\nThe region as a whole includes a significant component of New South Wales' state forests and national parks, and tourism is important in the north of the region in particular, especially in [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]], which is effectively a southern extension of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], and Byron Bay, which has developed a reputation as both a centre for relaxation and \"alternative\" health practices such as [[yoga]], and at certain times of the year, a convenient out-of-town recreation area for partygoers from the major urban centres of south-east Queensland. The village of [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]], in the [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]] area, also attracts tourists interested in its reputation for environmental and alternative living initiatives such as [[permaculture]], sustainability, and self-sufficiency, as well as its often-cited counterculture which includes lobbying for the decriminalisation of recreational and medicinal [[cannabis]], as evidenced by its annual [[MardiGrass]] celebration.<ref>[http://nimbinmardigrass.com/ Nimbin MardiGrass official site]</ref> Following some decades of population decline with the reduction of certain primary industry (in particular dairying), the area is now seeing a population increase, in part because of the availability of ex-dairy land for newer niche crops and hobby farms along with an influx of \"sea change\" and \"tree change\" families, as well as retirees attracted by the region's subtropical climate and unique combination of lifestyle attributes.<ref>[https://www.communityprofile.com.au/northernrivers Regional Development Australia: Northern Rivers Community Profile]</ref><ref>Bock, Karl & Brunckhorst, David (undated but post-2006).
