These are often [[Red Ensign]]s (e.g., {{flagof|Bermuda}}) or [[Blue Ensign]]s (e.g., {{flagof|New South Wales}} and {{flagof|Anguilla}}). A small number have backgrounds of other colours (e.g. {{flagof|British Antarctic Territory}} and {{flagof|Niue}}) or a unique pattern in the field (e.g. {{flagof|British Indian Ocean Territory}} and {{flagof|Hawaii}}). A small number put the Union Jack somewhere other than the canton (e.g. {{flagof|British Columbia}}). Unofficial flags, such as {{flagof|Ross Dependency|unofficial}} also use it.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Divisions==\n\n===Upper left divided from rest of flag===\n{{main|Canton (flag)}}\n[[File:flag of the Republic of China.svg|thumb|100px|National flag of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]]\nA '''canton''' in a [[flag]] is a rectangular area at the top hoist corner of a flag, occupying up to a quarter of the flag's area. The canton of a flag may be a flag in its own right. For instance, [[British ensigns]] have the [[Union Jack]] as their canton, as do their derivatives such as the national flags of [[Flag of Australia|Australia]] and [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. Following the practice of British ensigns, a canton sometimes contains a symbol of national unity such as the blue field and white stars of the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]]. In these cases, the canton may be called simply the '''union'''.\n\nThe U.S. flag's canton derives from the British use of the Union Jack in the canton of its possessions (including, historically, the early United States). Subsequently, many New World nations (and other later countries and regions, such as Liberia or Malaysia) that were inspired by the U.S. incorporated elements likewise inspired by the U.S. flag. As a result, many extant uses of a prominent canton derive either from British territorial history, or U.S. influence and inspiration.\n*{{flagof|Chile}}\n*{{flagof|Georgia|1918}} (1918\u20131921)\n*{{flagof|list=yes|Georgian SSR|the=yes|name=Georgia}} ''(Constituent republic of the Soviet Union)''\n*{{flagof|Georgia|1990}} (1990\u20132004)\n*{{flagof|Greece}}\n*{{flagof|Liberia}}\n*{{flagof|Malaysia}}\n*{{flagof|Myanmar|1974}} (1974\u20132010)\n*{{flagof|Republic of China}} (Taiwan)\n*{{flagof|Samoa}}\n*{{flagof|Tonga}}\n*{{flagof|the=yes|United States}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===One vertical stripe on hoist===\n\n[[File:flag of Benin.svg|thumb|100px|National flag of Benin]]\n*{{flagof|Belarus}}\n*{{flagof|Benin}}\n*{{flagof|Chechnya}}\n*{{flagof|Guinea-Bissau}}\n*{{flagof|Khakassia}}\n*{{flagof|Madagascar}}\n*{{flagof|Oman}}\n*{{flagof|Texas}}\n*{{flagof|Republic of West Papua|the=yes|text=[[Morning Star flag]]}} (Republic of West Papua, 1961\u201362)\n*{{flagof|the=yes|United Arab Emirates}}\n*{{flagof|the=yes|South African Republic|1852}} (1852-1902)\n\n===Four equal rectangles meeting at center===\nSee also [[#Cross]] section\n\n[[File:flag of the Dominican Republic (5-8).svg|thumb|100px|National flag of the Dominican Republic]]\n*{{flagof|Dominica}}\n*{{flagof|the=yes|Dominican Republic}}\n*{{flagof|England}} (''UK constituent country'')\n*{{flagof|Panama}}\n*{{flagof|Quebec}} (''Canadian province'')\n{{clear}}\n\n===Four equal triangles meeting at center===\n\n[[File:flag of Jamaica.svg|thumb|100px|National flag of Jamaica]]\n*{{flagof|Burundi}}\n*{{flagof|Grenada}}\n*{{flagof|Jamaica}}\n*{{flagof|Seychelles|1976}} (1976\u20131977)\n;St. Andrew's Cross\n*{{flagof|Scotland}} (''UK constituent country'')\n*{{flagof|the=yes|United Kingdom}}\n;Cross of Burgundy\n*{{flagof|Florida}}\n*{{flagof|the=yes|United Kingdom}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Other symbols and pictures==\n\n===Sun===\n[[File:flag of Uruguay.svg|thumb|100px|National flag of Uruguay]]\n<!--Please do NOT include the flag of Palau here.

These are often [[Red Ensign]]s (e.g., {{flagof|Bermuda}}) or [[Blue Ensign]]s (e.g., {{flagof|New South Wales}} and {{flagof|Anguilla}}). A small number have backgrounds of other colours (e.g. {{flagof|British Antarctic Territory}} and {{flagof|Niue}}) or a unique pattern in the field (e.g. {{flagof|British Indian Ocean Territory}} and {{flagof|Hawaii}}). A small number put the Union Jack somewhere other than the canton (e.g. {{flagof|British Columbia}}). Unofficial flags, such as {{flagof|Ross Dependency|unofficial}} also use it.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Divisions==\n\n===Upper left divided from rest of flag===\n{{main|Canton (flag)}}\n[[File:flag of the Republic of China.svg|thumb|100px|National flag of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]]\nA '''canton''' in a [[flag]] is a rectangular area at the top hoist corner of a flag, occupying up to a quarter of the flag's area. The canton of a flag may be a flag in its own right. For instance, [[British ensigns]] have the [[Union Jack]] as their canton, as do their derivatives such as the national flags of [[Flag of Australia|Australia]] and [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. Following the practice of British ensigns, a canton sometimes contains a symbol of national unity such as the blue field and white stars of the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]]. In these cases, the canton may be called simply the '''union'''.\n\nThe U.S. flag's canton derives from the British use of the Union Jack in the canton of its possessions (including, historically, the early United States). Subsequently, many New World nations (and other later countries and regions, such as Liberia or Malaysia) that were inspired by the U.S. incorporated elements likewise inspired by the U.S. flag. As a result, many extant uses of a prominent canton derive either from British territorial history, or U.S. influence and inspiration.\n*{{flagof|Chile}}\n*{{flagof|Georgia|1918}} (1918\u20131921)\n*{{flagof|list=yes|Georgian SSR|the=yes|name=Georgia}} ''(Constituent republic of the Soviet Union)''\n*{{flagof|Georgia|1990}} (1990\u20132004)\n*{{flagof|Greece}}\n*{{flagof|Liberia}}\n*{{flagof|Malaysia}}\n*{{flagof|Myanmar|1974}} (1974\u20132010)\n*{{flagof|Republic of China}} (Taiwan)\n*{{flagof|Samoa}}\n*{{flagof|Tonga}}\n*{{flagof|the=yes|United States}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===One vertical stripe on hoist===\n\n[[File:flag of Benin.svg|thumb|100px|National flag of Benin]]\n*{{flagof|Belarus}}\n*{{flagof|Benin}}\n*{{flagof|Chechnya}}\n*{{flagof|Guinea-Bissau}}\n*{{flagof|Khakassia}}\n*{{flagof|Madagascar}}\n*{{flagof|Oman}}\n*{{flagof|Texas}}\n*{{flagof|Republic of West Papua|the=yes|text=[[Morning Star flag]]}} (Republic of West Papua, 1961\u201362)\n*{{flagof|the=yes|United Arab Emirates}}\n*{{flagof|the=yes|South African Republic|1852}} (1852-1902)\n\n===Four equal rectangles meeting at center===\nSee also [[#Cross]] section\n\n[[File:flag of the Dominican Republic (5-8).svg|thumb|100px|National flag of the Dominican Republic]]\n*{{flagof|Dominica}}\n*{{flagof|the=yes|Dominican Republic}}\n*{{flagof|England}} (''UK constituent country'')\n*{{flagof|Panama}}\n*{{flagof|Quebec}} (''Canadian province'')\n{{clear}}\n\n===Four equal triangles meeting at center===\n\n[[File:flag of Jamaica.svg|thumb|100px|National flag of Jamaica]]\n*{{flagof|Burundi}}\n*{{flagof|Grenada}}\n*{{flagof|Jamaica}}\n*{{flagof|Seychelles|1976}} (1976\u20131977)\n;St. Andrew's Cross\n*{{flagof|Scotland}} (''UK constituent country'')\n*{{flagof|the=yes|United Kingdom}}\n;Cross of Burgundy\n*{{flagof|Florida}}\n*{{flagof|the=yes|United Kingdom}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Other symbols and pictures==\n\n===Sun===\n[[File:flag of Uruguay.svg|thumb|100px|National flag of Uruguay]]\n<!--Please do NOT include the flag of Palau here.

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}\n\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. For more details, see [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]] in accordance with Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], and with more detail under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]. By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[China's peaceful development]]. Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved,{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979.

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}\n\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. For more details, see [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]] in accordance with Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], and with more detail under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]. By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

In 1971, the PRC replaced the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as \"Taiwan\" since the 1970s, as the sole representative of China in the [[United Nations]] and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Eddy Chang (Aug 22, 2004).

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of [[China's peaceful development]]. Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved, China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

Along with his good friend, Brian Massey, this band became the original \u201cRegents\u201d ....The Regents members evolved, when giging around Toronto over the following 2 years. Kay Taylor, singer extraordinaire, joined the band in 1961...This led to Kay Taylor and the Regents becoming the house band at the famous original Club Bluenote, on Yonge Street.\nDuring its time, this first and original R&B club, hosted many of the recording R&B artists who came Toronto for single night appearances...These artists would gravitate to the Club Bluenote after their gigs.. club owner, Al Steiner, would always encourage them to get up and sing a couple of songs during the famous \u201cFloor Show\u201d in the middle of the evening. With the Regents jamming these non-rehearsed songs...artists such as Jimmy Reed, Maxine Brown, The Olympics, The Marathons, Jackie Shayne, Johnny Nash, Dianne Brooks, Joe Dee, The Charmaine's, Shirley Mathews, and others would perform, and at times, magic was created. \nIt was a special time in the R&B history of Yonge Street ....and Toronto.\n\nA historical Toronto plaque has been placed\non the sidewalk by the City of Toronto,  in front of the original front door of the Club Bluenote on Yonge Street near Gerard Street.\n\nAfter the Big Town Boys projects late 1968, Graham travelled on a cultural journey for a year and a half to many parts of Southeast Asia,... \nIn certain times he  was able to explore parts of  India, West Pakistan and Afghanistan, (before the first war in In 1970, )\n\nIn India, he took in the music cultures there and  studied for a time at the Akbar school of music,\u00a0in Calcutta. \nOn returning to Toronto, he began working for producer Brian Ahearn, contributing as a musician on\u00a0Anne Murray's hit\u00a0Snowbird\u00a0and some other needed parts  during Anne's first four LPs.\n\nPaul White, executive producer at Capital records, gave Graham the opportunity to record his first album titled \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d in 1972. Some of the singles released from this album appeared on the Canadian charts at the time along with the cover version of Neil Young's, \u201cAfter the Gold Rush\u201d which charted in North America and Europe.\nDuring 1980, he co-founded and created a unique computer graphics company based in Toronto, Canada.\nAriel Computer Productions pioneered a new process for graphic designers to create and then output at super hi resolution quality. These images created were then transferred from the graphics work stations and imaged to film at up to 8000 lines of resolution.\n\nIn the 1990s, Graham resumed his career in music recording and production full-time..\nAn initial project, involved going deep into the rainforest of Trinidad and Tobago, carrying a high end digital recorder.  Nature sounds and environs were recorded during various times of the day and night...\nEasy music composed, was integrated, along instruments and flavours from the Caribbean resulting in two CDs\n\u201cSounds of Tobago\u201d and \n\u201cMore sounds of Trinidad and Tobago\u201d\n\nTwo CDs were also produced for Brent Titcomb and his music\n\nAnother project involved taking a  portable multi track, recorder to South America,  recording  certain indigenous groups in their environments as well as recordings with more refined contemporary groups  during his time in Ecuador, Colombia, and Argentina....\n\nIn recent years Graham has been working with Roger Gibbs, originally from Barbados, currently living in Toronto.

Along with his good friend, Brian Massey, this band became the original \u201cRegents\u201d \u2026.The Regents members evolved, when giging around Toronto over the following 2 years. Kay Taylor, singer extraordinaire, joined the band in 1961\u2026This led to Kay Taylor and the Regents becoming the house band at the famous original Club Bluenote, on Yonge Street.\nDuring it\u2019s time, this first and original R&B club, hosted many of the recording R&B artists who came Toronto for single night appearances\u2026These artists would gravitate to the Club Bluenote after their gigs.. club owner, Al Steiner, would always encourage them to get up and sing a couple of songs during the famous \u201cFloor Show\u201d in the middle of the evening. With the Regents jamming these non-rehearsed songs\u2026artists such as Jimmy Reed, Maxine Brown, The Olympics, The Marathons, Jackie Shayne, Johnny Nash, Dianne Brooks, Joe Dee, The Charmaine\u2019s, Shirley Mathews, and others would perform, and at times, magic was created. \nIt was a special time in the R&B history of Yonge Street \u2026.and Toronto.\n\nA historical Toronto plaque has been placed\non the sidewalk by the City of Toronto,  in front of the original front door of the Club Bluenote on Yonge Street near Gerard Street.\n\nAfter the Big Town Boys projects late 1968, Graham travelled on a cultural journey for a year and a half to many parts of Southeast Asia,... \nIn certain times he  was able to explore parts of  India, West Pakistan and Afghanistan, (before the first war in In 1970, )\n\nIn India, he took in the music cultures there and  studied for a time at the Akbar school of music,\u00a0in Calcutta. \nOn returning to Toronto, he began working for producer Brian Ahearn, contributing as a musician on\u00a0Anne Murray's hit\u00a0Snowbird\u00a0and some other needed parts  during Anne\u2019s first four LPs.\n\nPaul White, executive producer at Capital records, gave Graham the opportunity to record his first album titled \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d in 1972. Some of the singles released from this album appeared on the Canadian charts at the time along with the cover version of Neil Young\u2019s, \u201cAfter the Gold Rush\u201d which charted in North America and Europe.\nDuring 1980, he co-founded and created a unique computer graphics company based in Toronto, Canada.\nAriel Computer Productions pioneered a new process for graphic designers to create and then output at super hi resolution quality. These images created were then transferred from the graphics work stations and imaged to film at up to 8000 lines of resolution. \n\nIn the 1990s, Graham resumed his career in music recording and production full time..\nAn initial project, involved going deep into the rainforest of Trinidad and Tobago, carrying a high end digital recorder.  Nature sounds and environs were recorded during various times of the day and night\u2026\nEasy music composed, was integrated, along instruments and flavours from the Caribbean resulting in two CDs\n\u201cSounds of Tobago\u201d and \n\u201cMore sounds of Trinidad and Tobago\u201d\n\nTwo CDs were also produced for Brent Titcomb and his music\n\nAnother project involved taking a  portable multi track, recorder to South America,  recording  certain indigenous groups in their environments as well as recordings with more refined contemporary groups  during his time in Ecuador, Colombia, and Argentina\u2026. \n\n\n\nIn recent years Graham has been working with Roger Gibbs, originally from Barbados, currently living in Toronto. They have recorded and produced two CDs with the group Shak Shak as well as various Roger Gibbs recordings including the song \"Toronto Carnival\" featured during the recent Carnival time in Toronto\u2026\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
