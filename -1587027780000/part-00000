Furthermore, the reliance of the frog on two major modes of locomotion ([[jumping]] and [[Aquatic locomotion|swimming]]) allows for understanding how muscle properties contribute to organismal performance in each of these modes.\n\n==As pets==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nNorthern leopard frogs do well as a beginner pet. A standard 10-gallon tank is sufficient for a single northern leopard frog. A dense piece of wood can be placed partly in the water and land to provide easier transition from water and land (this also provides a basking spot). The substrate must be a combination of [[peat]] and moss, covered with [[orchid]] bark, and [[sphagnum moss]] can be used on the terrestrial side. The depth should be at least 2-3 inches to allow burrowing. Gravel can be used on the aquatic side. It is extremely important to use smooth gravel only (to prevent skin abrasions and injuries). Northern leopard frogs live in an area with 68 to 75&nbsp;\u00b0F, although a temperature drop at night is beneficial (down to about 60&nbsp;\u00b0F 16&nbsp;\u00b0C). A secure lid (preferably a mesh lid with ventilation) is also a must - most frogs are adept at escaping, given the chance. Northern leopard frogs are fed a diet of [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], [[mealworm]]s, [[waxworm]]s, or [[silkworm]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Range==\nNorthern leopard frogs occur from [[Great Slave Lake]] and [[Hudson Bay]], Canada, south to [[Kentucky]] and [[New Mexico]], USA.<ref>Stebbins, R.C.

Furthermore, the reliance of the frog on two major modes of locomotion ([[jumping]] and [[Aquatic locomotion|swimming]]) allows for understanding how muscle properties contribute to organismal performance in each of these modes.\n\n==As pets==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nNorthern leopard frogs do well as a beginner pet. A standard 10-gallon tank is sufficient for a single northern leopard frog. A dense piece of wood can be placed partly in the water and land to provide easier transition from water and land (this also provides a basking spot). The substrate must be a combination of [[peat]] and moss, covered with [[orchid]] bark, and [[sphagnum moss]] can be used on the terrestrial side. The depth should be at least 2-3 inches to allow burrowing. Gravel can be used on the aquatic side. It is extremely important to use smooth gravel only (to prevent skin abrasions and injuries). Northern leopard frogs live in an area with 68 to 75&nbsp;\u00b0F, although a temperature drop at night is beneficial (down to about 60&nbsp;\u00b0F 16&nbsp;\u00b0C). A secure lid (preferably a mesh lid with ventilation) is also a must - most frogs are adept at escaping, given the chance. Northern leopard frogs are fed a diet of [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], [[mealworm]]s, [[waxworm]]s, or [[silkworm]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Range==\nNorthern leopard frogs occur from [[Great Slave Lake]] and [[Hudson Bay]], Canada, south to [[Kentucky]] and [[New Mexico]], USA.<ref>Stebbins, R.C.

At present, the station's satellite coverage reaches Asia, Europe, and Australia in several languages.\n\nNTD, along with ''[[The Epoch Times]]'' and [[Sound of Hope]], was founded by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners who had emigrated to the West. Many of its staff are Falun Gong adherents who volunteer their time and services.

Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string.  In contrast, in [[longitudinal wave]]s, such as [[sound wave]]s in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization.

In [[linear polarization]], the fields oscillate in a single direction.  In [[circular polarization|circular]] or [[elliptical polarization]], the fields rotate at a constant rate in a plane as the wave travels.  The rotation can have two possible directions; if the fields rotate in a [[right hand rule|right hand]] sense with respect to the direction of wave travel, it is called [[right circular polarization]], while if the fields rotate in a left hand sense, it is called [[left circular polarization]].\n\nLight or other electromagnetic radiation from many sources, such as the sun, flames, and [[incandescent lamp]]s, consists of short wave trains with an equal mixture of polarizations; this is called ''unpolarized light''.  Polarized light can be produced by passing unpolarized light through a [[polarizer]], which allows waves of only one polarization to pass through.   The most common optical materials (such as glass) are [[isotropic]] and do not affect the polarization of light passing through them; however, some materials\u2014those that exhibit [[birefringence]], [[dichroism]], or [[optical activity]]\u2014can change the polarization of light.  Some of these are used to make polarizing filters.  Light is also partially polarized when it reflects from a surface.\n\nAccording to [[quantum mechanics]], electromagnetic waves can also be viewed as streams of particles called [[photon]]s.

Especially impacted are technologies such as [[laser]]s, wireless and optical fiber [[telecommunications]], and [[radar]].\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{anchor|Theory}}\n<!-- ==Theory== -->\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Birefringence]] -->\n\n=== Wave propagation and polarization ===\n[[File:Cross_linear_polarization.gif|thumb|cross linear polarized]]\nMost sources of light are classified as incoherent and unpolarized (or only \"partially polarized\") because they consist of a random mixture of waves having different spatial characteristics, frequencies (wavelengths), phases, and polarization states. However, for understanding electromagnetic waves and polarization in particular, it is easier to just consider coherent [[plane wave]]s; these are sinusoidal waves of one particular direction (or [[wavevector]]), frequency, phase, and polarization state. Characterizing an optical system in relation to a plane wave with those given parameters can then be used to predict its response to a more general case, since a wave with any specified spatial structure can be decomposed into a combination of plane waves (its so-called [[angular spectrum]]). Incoherent states can be modeled [[stochastically]] as a weighted combination of such uncorrelated waves with some [[probability distribution|distribution]] of frequencies (its ''[[Spectral density|spectrum]]''), phases, and polarizations.\n\n==== Transverse electromagnetic waves ====\n[[File:Electromagnetic wave.png|thumb|upright=2.6|A \"vertically polarized\" electromagnetic wave of wavelength \u03bb has its electric field vector '''E''' (red) oscillating in the vertical direction. The magnetic field '''B''' (or '''H''') is always at right angles to it (blue), and both are perpendicular to the direction of propagation ('''z''').]]\n\n[[Electromagnetic waves]] (such as light), traveling in free space or another [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] [[isotropic]] [[Attenuation|non-attenuating]] medium, are properly described as [[transverse waves]], meaning that a plane wave's electric field vector '''E''' and magnetic field '''H''' are in directions perpendicular to (or \"transverse\" to) the direction of wave propagation; '''E''' and '''H''' are also perpendicular to each other.  By convention, the \"polarization\" direction of an electromagnetic wave is given by its electric field vector.  Considering a monochromatic [[plane wave]] of optical frequency ''f'' (light of vacuum wavelength \u03bb has a frequency of ''f = c/\u03bb'' where ''c'' is the speed of light), let us take the direction of propagation as the ''z'' axis. Being a transverse wave the '''E''' and '''H''' fields must then contain components only in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions whereas ''E<sub>z</sub> = H<sub>z</sub> = 0''. Using [[Complex number|complex]] (or [[phasor]]) notation, the instantaneous physical electric and magnetic fields are given by the [[real part]]s of the complex quantities occurring in the following equations. As a function of time ''t'' and spatial position ''z'' (since for a plane wave in the +''z'' direction the fields have no dependence on ''x'' or ''y'') these complex fields can be written as:\n: <math>\\vec{E}(z, t) = \\begin{bmatrix} e_x \\\\ e_y \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\; e^{i2\\pi \\left(\\frac{z}{\\lambda} - \\frac{t}{T}\\right)} = \\begin{bmatrix} e_x \\\\ e_y \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\; e^{i(kz - \\omega t)}</math>\n\nand\n: <math>\\vec{H}(z, t) = \\begin{bmatrix} h_x \\\\ h_y \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\; e^{i2\\pi \\left(\\frac{z}{\\lambda} - \\frac{t}{T}\\right)} = \\begin{bmatrix} h_x \\\\ h_y \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\; e^{i(kz - \\omega t)}</math>\n\nwhere \u03bb = \u03bb{{sub|0}}/''n'' is the wavelength ''in the medium'' (whose [[refractive index]] is ''n'') and {{nowrap|1=''T'' = 1/''f''}} is the period of the wave. Here ''e<sub>x</sub>'', ''e<sub>y</sub>'', ''h<sub>x</sub>'', and ''h<sub>y</sub>'' are complex numbers. In the second more compact form, as these equations are customarily expressed, these factors are described using the  [[wavenumber]] <math>k = 2\\pi n / \\lambda _0</math> and [[angular frequency]] (or \"radian frequency\") <math>\\omega = 2\\pi f</math>. In a more general formulation with propagation ''not'' restricted to the ''+z'' direction, then the spatial dependence ''kz'' is replaced by <math>\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r}</math> where <math>\\vec{k}</math> is called the [[wave vector]], the magnitude of which is the wavenumber.\n\nThus the leading vectors '''e''' and '''h''' each contain up to two nonzero (complex) components describing the amplitude and phase of the wave's  ''x'' and ''y'' polarization components (again, there can be no ''z'' polarization component for a transverse wave in the +''z'' direction). For a given medium with a [[wave impedance|characteristic impedance]] <math>\\eta</math>, '''h''' is related to '''e''' by:\n:<math>h_y = \\frac{e_x}{\\eta}</math>\n\nand\n:<math>h_x = -\\frac{e_y}{\\eta}</math>.\n\nIn a dielectric, ''\u03b7'' is real and has the value ''\u03b7''<sub>0</sub>/''n'', where ''n'' is the refractive index and ''\u03b7''<sub>0</sub> is the impedance of free space. The impedance will be complex in a conducting medium.{{clarify|reason=But if eta is not real, how can we complete the proof of orthogonality? Don't we take real parts before doing the dot product? See talk page.|date=May 2015}} Note that given that relationship, the dot product of '''E''' and '''H''' must be zero:{{dubious|reason=Don't we take real parts before doing the dot product?|date=May 2015}}\n:<math>\n  \\vec{E}\\left(\\vec{r}, t\\right) \\cdot \\vec{H}\\left(\\vec{r}, t\\right) =\n    e_x h_x + e_y h_y + e_z h_z =\n    e_x \\left(-\\frac{e_y}{\\eta}\\right) + e_y \\left(\\frac{e_x}{\\eta}\\right) + 0 \\cdot 0 = 0\n</math>\n\nindicating that these vectors are [[orthogonal]] (at right angles to each other), as expected.\n\nSo knowing the propagation direction (+''z'' in this case) and \u03b7, one can just as well specify the wave in terms of just ''e<sub>x</sub>'' and ''e<sub>y</sub>'' describing the electric field. The vector containing ''e<sub>x</sub>'' and ''e<sub>y</sub>'' (but without the ''z'' component which is necessarily zero for a transverse wave) is known as a [[Jones vector]]. In addition to specifying the polarization state of the wave, a general Jones vector also specifies the overall magnitude and phase of that wave. Specifically, the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the light wave is proportional to the sum of the squared magnitudes of the two electric field components:\n:<math> I = \\left(\\left|e_x\\right|^2 + \\left|e_y\\right|^2\\right) \\, \\frac{1}{2\\eta} </math>\n\nhowever the wave's ''state of polarization'' is only dependent on the (complex) ''ratio'' of ''e<sub>y</sub>'' to ''e<sub>x</sub>''. So let us just consider waves whose ''|e<sub>x</sub>|<sup>2</sup> + |e<sub>y</sub>|<sup>2</sup> = 1''; this happens to correspond to an intensity of about .00133 [[watt]]s per square meter in free space (where <math>\\eta = </math> [[impedance of free space|<math>\\eta_0</math>]]). And since the absolute phase of a wave is unimportant in discussing its polarization state, let us stipulate that the phase of ''e<sub>x</sub>'' is zero, in other words ''e<sub>x</sub>'' is a real number while ''e<sub>y</sub>'' may be complex. Under these restrictions, ''e<sub>x</sub>'' and ''e<sub>y</sub>'' can be represented as follows:\n:<math>e_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + Q}{2}} </math>\n:<math>e_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - Q}{2}}\\, e^{i\\phi} </math>\n\nwhere the polarization state is now fully parameterized by the value of ''Q'' (such that \u22121 < ''Q'' < 1) and the relative phase <math>\\phi</math>.\n\n==== Non-transverse waves ====\nIn addition to transverse waves, there are many wave motions where the oscillation is not limited to directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on transverse waves (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), however one should be aware of cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as we have just done.\n\nJust considering electromagnetic waves, we note that the preceding discussion strictly applies to plane waves in a homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, whereas in an [[anisotropic]] medium (such as birefringent crystals as discussed below) the electric or magnetic field may have longitudinal as well as transverse components. In those cases the [[electric displacement]] ''D'' and [[magnetic flux density]] ''B''{{clarify|reason=But B doesn't appear above.|date=May 2015}} still obey the above geometry but due to anisotropy in the [[electric susceptibility]] (or in the [[magnetic permeability]]), now given by a [[tensor]], the direction of ''E'' (or ''H'') may differ from that of ''D'' (or ''B''). Even in isotropic media, so-called [[inhomogeneous wave]]s can be launched into a medium whose refractive index has a significant imaginary part (or \"[[Complex index of refraction#Complex index of refraction and absorption|extinction coefficient]]\") such as metals;{{clarify|reason=Is this the same as having a complex value of the wave impedance \u03b7 that was employed in the previous section? The discussion should be made consistent and the assumptions on the reality of \u03b7 (or not) should be made explicit.|date=May 2015}} these fields are also not strictly transverse.<ref name=Griffiths1998>{{cite book|author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|publisher=Prentice Hall|date=1998|pages=|isbn=0-13-805326-X|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0}}</ref>{{rp|179\u2013184}}<ref name=\"New2011\">{{cite book|author=Geoffrey New|title=Introduction to Nonlinear Optics|date=7 April 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50076-0}}</ref>{{rp|51\u201352}} [[Surface wave]]s or waves propagating in a [[waveguide]] (such as an [[optical fiber]]) are generally ''not'' transverse waves, but might be described as an electric or magnetic [[transverse mode]], or a hybrid mode.\n\nEven in free space, longitudinal field components can be generated in focal regions, where the plane wave approximation breaks down. An extreme example is [[radial polarisation|radially]] or tangentially polarized light, at the focus of which the electric or magnetic field respectively is ''entirely'' longitudinal (along the direction of propagation).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.233901 |author=Dorn, R. |author2=Quabis, S. |author3=Leuchs, G. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Sharper Focus for a Radially Polarized Light Beam |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=Dec 2003 |volume=91 |issue=23 | pages=233901 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..91w3901D |pmid=14683185}}</ref>\n\nFor [[longitudinal wave]]s such as [[sound wave]]s in [[fluid]]s, the direction of oscillation is by definition along the direction of travel, so the issue of polarization is not normally even mentioned. On the other hand, sound waves in a bulk [[solid]] can be transverse as well as longitudinal, for a total of three polarization components. In this case, the transverse polarization is associated with the direction of the [[shear stress]] and displacement in directions perpendicular to the propagation direction, while the longitudinal polarization describes compression of the solid and vibration along the direction of propagation. The differential propagation of transverse and longitudinal polarizations is important in [[seismology]].\n\n== Polarization state{{anchor|State}} ==\n{{further|Linear polarization|Circular polarization|Elliptical polarization}}\n[[File:Polarisation rectiligne.gif|thumb|upright=0.25|Electric field oscillation]]\nPolarization is best understood by initially considering only pure polarization states, and only a coherent sinusoidal wave at some optical frequency. The vector in the adjacent diagram might describe the oscillation of the electric field emitted by a single-mode laser (whose oscillation frequency would be typically 10<sup>15</sup> times faster). The field oscillates in the ''x-y'' plane, along the page, with the wave propagating in the ''z'' direction, perpendicular to the page.\nThe first two diagrams below trace the electric field vector over a complete cycle for linear polarization at two different orientations; these are each considered a distinct ''state of polarization'' (SOP). Note that the linear polarization at 45\u00b0 can also be viewed as the addition of a horizontally linearly polarized wave (as in the leftmost figure) and a vertically polarized wave of the same amplitude ''in the same phase''.\n\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Linear polarization parallel to x axis.svg|center|100px]]\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Linear polarization oriented at +45deg.svg|center|100px]]\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Right-elliptical polarization A.svg|100px]]\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Right-circular polarization.svg|100px]]\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Left-circular polarization.svg|100px]]\n</div>\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Wave Polarisation.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|Animation showing four different polarization states and two orthogonal projections.]]\n[[File:Rising circular.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|A circularly polarized wave as a sum of two linearly polarized components 90\u00b0 out of phase]]\nNow if one were to introduce a [[Phase (waves)#phase shift|phase shift]] in between those horizontal and vertical polarization components, one would generally obtain elliptical polarization<ref>{{cite book | last=Chandrasekhar | first=Subrahmanyan | title=Radiative Transfer | url=https://archive.org/details/radiativetransfe0000chan | url-access=registration | publisher=Dover | year=1960 | isbn=0-486-60590-6 | oclc=924844798 | page=[https://archive.org/details/radiativetransfe0000chan/page/27 27]}}</ref>  as is shown in the third figure. When the phase shift is exactly \u00b190\u00b0, then ''circular polarization'' is produced (fourth and fifth figures). Thus is circular polarization created in practice, starting with linearly polarized light and employing a [[quarter-wave plate]] to introduce such a phase shift. The result of two such phase-shifted components in causing a rotating electric field vector is depicted in the animation on the right. Note that circular or elliptical polarization can involve either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the field. These correspond  to distinct polarization states, such as the two circular polarizations shown above.\n\nOf course the orientation of the ''x'' and ''y'' axes used in this description is arbitrary. The choice of such a coordinate system and viewing the polarization ellipse in terms of the  ''x'' and ''y'' polarization components, corresponds to the definition of the Jones vector (below) in terms of those [[basis functions|basis]] polarizations. One would typically choose axes to suit a particular problem such as ''x'' being in the plane of incidence. Since there are separate reflection coefficients for the linear polarizations in and orthogonal to the plane of incidence (''p'' and ''s'' polarizations, see below), that choice greatly simplifies the calculation of a wave's reflection from a surface.\n\nMoreover, one can use as basis functions ''any'' pair of [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] polarization states, not just linear polarizations. For instance, choosing right and left circular polarizations as basis functions simplifies the solution of problems involving circular birefringence (optical activity) or circular dichroism.\n\n<!-- Following sections (had been) linked from [[coherence (physics)]] and from [[decibel#examples]] and from [[axial ratio]] -->\n<!-- ====Parameterization==== -->\n{{anchor|Parameterization}}\n\n=== Polarization ellipse ===\n{{Main|Polarization ellipse}}\n[[File:Polarisation ellipse2.svg|left|200px]]\nConsider a purely polarized monochromatic wave. If one were to plot the electric field vector over one cycle of oscillation, an ellipse would generally be obtained, as is shown in the figure, corresponding to a particular state of [[elliptical polarization]]. Note that linear polarization and circular polarization can be seen as special cases of elliptical polarization.\n\nA polarization state can then be described in relation to the geometrical parameters of the ellipse, and its \"handedness\", that is, whether the rotation around the ellipse is clockwise or counter clockwise.

The ellipticity parameter is an alternative parameterization of an ellipse's [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|eccentricity]] <math>e=\\sqrt{1 - b^2/a^2}</math>, or the '''ellipticity angle''', \u03c7&nbsp;=&nbsp;arctan&nbsp;b/a=&nbsp;arctan&nbsp;1/\u03b5 as is shown in the figure.<ref name=Stetten /> The angle \u03c7 is also significant in that the latitude (angle from the equator) of the polarization state as represented on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere (see below) is equal to \u00b12\u03c7. The special cases of linear and circular polarization correspond to an ellipticity \u03b5 of infinity and unity (or \u03c7 of zero and 45\u00b0) respectively.\n\n=== Jones vector ===\n{{Main|Jones vector}}\nFull information on a completely polarized state is also provided by the amplitude and phase of oscillations in two components of the electric field vector in the plane of polarization. This representation was used above to show how different states of polarization are possible. The amplitude and phase information can be conveniently represented as a two-dimensional [[complex number|complex]] vector (the [[Jones calculus|Jones vector]]):\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{e} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_1 e^{i\\theta_1} \\\\\n  a_2 e^{i\\theta_2}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nHere <math>a_1</math> and <math>a_2</math> denote the amplitude of the wave in the two components of the electric field vector, while <math>\\theta_1</math> and <math>\\theta_2</math> represent the phases. The product of a Jones vector with a complex number of unit [[Absolute value|modulus]] gives a different Jones vector representing the same ellipse, and thus the same state of polarization. The physical electric field, as the real part of the Jones vector, would be altered but the polarization state itself is independent of [[absolute phase]]. The [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] vectors used to represent the Jones vector need not represent linear polarization states (i.e. be [[real numbers|real]]). In general any two '''orthogonal states''' can be used, where an orthogonal vector pair is formally defined as one having a zero [[inner product]]. A common choice is left and right circular polarizations, for example to model the different propagation of waves in two such components in circularly birefringent media (see below) or signal paths of coherent detectors sensitive to circular polarization.\n\n=== Coordinate frame ===\nRegardless of whether polarization state is represented using geometric parameters or Jones vectors, implicit in the parameterization is the orientation of the coordinate frame. This permits a degree of freedom, namely rotation about the propagation direction. When considering light that is propagating parallel to the surface of the Earth, the terms \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" polarization are often used, with the former being associated with the first component of the Jones vector, or zero azimuth angle. On the other hand, in [[astronomy]] the [[equatorial coordinate system]] is generally used instead, with the zero azimuth (or position angle, as it is more commonly called in astronomy to avoid confusion with the [[horizontal coordinate system]]) corresponding to due north.\n\n==== ''s'' and ''p'' designations{{anchor|s and p}} ====\n\n[[File:E xy deformation.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|Electromagnetic vectors for <math display=\"inline\">\\textbf{E}</math>, <math display=\"inline\">\\textbf{B}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\textbf{k}</math> with <math display=\"inline\">\\textbf{E} = \\textbf{E}(x,y)</math> along with 3 planar projections and a deformation surface of total electric field.

This is the plane made by the incoming propagation direction and the vector perpendicular to the plane of an interface, in other words, the plane in which the ray travels before and after reflection or refraction. <!--The rays in this plane are illustrated in the diagram to the right.--> The component of the electric field parallel to this plane is termed ''p-like'' (parallel) and the component perpendicular to this plane is termed ''s-like'' (from ''senkrecht'', German for perpendicular). Polarized light with its electric field along the plane of incidence is thus denoted ''p-polarized'', while light whose electric field is normal to the plane of incidence is called ''s-polarized''. ''P'' polarization is commonly referred to as ''transverse-magnetic'' (TM), and has also been termed ''pi-polarized'' or ''tangential plane polarized''. ''S'' polarization is also called ''transverse-electric'' (TE), as well as ''sigma-polarized'' or ''sagittal plane polarized''.\n\n=== Unpolarized and partially polarized light ===\n{{Repetition section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==== Definition ====\nNatural light, like most other common sources of visible light, is [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]]: radiation is produced independently by a large number of atoms or molecules whose emissions are [[statistical correlation|uncorrelated]] and generally of random polarizations. In this case the light is said to be ''unpolarized''. This term is somewhat inexact, since at any instant of time at one location there is a definite direction to the electric and magnetic fields, however it implies that the polarization changes so quickly in time that it will not be measured or relevant to the outcome of an experiment.  A so-called [[depolarizer (optics)|depolarizer]] acts on a polarized beam to create one which is actually ''fully'' polarized at every point, but in which the polarization varies so rapidly across the beam that it may be ignored in the intended applications.\n\nUnpolarized light can be described as a mixture of two independent oppositely polarized streams, each with half the intensity.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.4.796| title=Density Operator of Unpolarized Radiation| journal=Physical Review A| volume=4| issue=2| pages=796\u2013799| year=1971| last1=Prakash| first1=Hari| last2=Chandra| first2=Naresh| bibcode=1971PhRvA...4..796P}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Chandrasekhar |first=Subrahmanyan |title=Radiative transfer |publisher=Courier |year=2013 |page=30}}</ref> Light is said to be ''partially polarized'' when there is more power in one of these streams than the other. At any particular wavelength, partially polarized light can be statistically described as the superposition of a completely unpolarized component and a completely polarized one.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|330}} One may then describe the light in terms of the [[degree of polarization]] and the parameters of the polarized component. That polarized component can be described in terms of a Jones vector or polarization ellipse, as is detailed above. However, in order to also describe the degree of polarization, one normally employs Stokes parameters (see below) to specify a state of partial polarization.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|351,374\u2013375}}\n\n==== Motivation ====\nThe transmission of plane waves through a homogeneous medium are fully described in terms of Jones vectors and 2\u00d72 Jones matrices. However, in practice there are cases in which all of the light cannot be viewed in such a simple manner due to spatial inhomogeneities or the presence of mutually incoherent waves. So-called depolarization, for instance, cannot be described using Jones matrices. For these cases it is usual instead to use a 4\u00d74 matrix that acts upon the Stokes 4-vector. Such matrices were first used by Paul Soleillet in 1929, although they have come to be known as [[Mueller matrix|Mueller matrices]]. While every Jones matrix has a Mueller matrix, the reverse is not true. Mueller matrices are then used to describe the observed polarization effects of the [[scattering]] of waves from complex surfaces or ensembles of particles, as shall now be presented.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|377\u2013379}}\n\n==== Coherency matrix ====\nThe Jones vector perfectly describes the state of polarization ''and phase'' of a single monochromatic wave, representing a pure state of polarization as described above. However any mixture of waves of different polarizations (or even of different frequencies) do ''not'' correspond to a Jones vector. In so-called partially polarized radiation the fields are [[stochastic]], and the variations and correlations between components of the electric field can only be described [[statistical]]ly. One such representation is the '''coherency [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]''':<ref name=\"O'Neill2004\">{{cite book|author=Edward L.

Several variants of the coherency matrix have been proposed: the [[Norbert Wiener|Wiener]] coherency matrix and the spectral coherency matrix of [[Richard Barakat]] measure the coherence of a [[spectral decomposition]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} of the signal, while the [[Emil Wolf|Wolf]] coherency matrix averages over all time/frequencies.\n\nThe coherency matrix contains all second order statistical information about the polarization. This matrix can be decomposed into the sum of two [[idempotent]] matrices, corresponding to the [[eigenvector]]s of the coherency matrix, each representing a polarization state that is orthogonal to the other. An alternative decomposition is into completely polarized (zero determinant) and unpolarized (scaled identity matrix) components. In either case, the operation of summing the components corresponds to the incoherent superposition of waves from the two components. The latter case gives rise to the concept of the \"degree of polarization\"; i.e., the fraction of the total intensity contributed by the completely polarized component.\n\n==== Stokes parameters ====\n{{Main|Stokes parameters}}\nThe coherency matrix is not easy to visualize, and it is therefore common to describe incoherent or partially polarized radiation in terms of its total intensity (''I''), (fractional) degree of polarization (''p''), and the shape parameters of the polarization ellipse. An alternative and mathematically convenient description is given by the [[Stokes parameters]], introduced by [[George Gabriel Stokes]] in 1852. The relationship of the Stokes parameters to intensity and polarization ellipse parameters is shown in the equations and figure below.\n\n: <math>S_0 = I \\,</math>\n: <math>S_1 = Ip \\cos 2\\psi \\cos 2\\chi\\,</math>\n: <math>S_2 = Ip \\sin 2\\psi \\cos 2\\chi\\,</math>\n: <math>S_3 = Ip \\sin 2\\chi\\,</math>\n\nHere ''Ip'', 2\u03c8 and 2\u03c7 are the [[spherical coordinates]] of the polarization state in the three-dimensional space of the last three Stokes parameters. Note the factors of two before \u03c8 and \u03c7 corresponding respectively to the facts that any polarization ellipse is indistinguishable from one rotated by 180\u00b0, or one with the semi-axis lengths swapped accompanied by a 90\u00b0 rotation. The Stokes parameters are sometimes denoted ''I'', ''Q'', ''U'' and ''V''.\n\n===== Poincar\u00e9 sphere =====\n\nNeglecting the first Stokes parameter ''S''<sub>0</sub> (or ''I''), the three other Stokes parameters can be plotted directly in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. For a given power in the polarized component given by\n: <math> P = \\sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2} </math>\n\nthe set of all polarization states are then mapped to points on the surface of the so-called ''Poincar\u00e9 sphere'' (but of radius ''P''), as shown in the accompanying diagram.\n[[File:Poincar\u00e9 sphere.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Poincar\u00e9 sphere, on or beneath which the three Stokes parameters [''S''<sub>1</sub>, ''S''<sub>2</sub>, ''S''<sub>3</sub>] (or [''Q'',\u202f''U'',\u202f''V'']) are plotted in Cartesian coordinates]]\n\nOften the total beam power is not of interest, in which case a normalized Stokes vector is used by dividing the Stokes vector by the total intensity ''S''<sub>0</sub>:\n:<math>\\mathbf{S'} = \\frac{1}{S_0} \\begin{bmatrix}S_0\\\\S_1\\\\S_2\\\\S_3\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe normalized Stokes vector <math>\\mathbf{S'}</math> then has unity power (<math>S'_0 = 1</math>) and the three significant Stokes parameters plotted in three dimensions will lie on the unity-radius Poincar\u00e9 sphere for pure polarization states (where <math>P'_0 = 1</math>). Partially polarized states will lie ''inside'' the Poincar\u00e9 sphere at a distance of <math>P' = \\sqrt{S_1'^2 + S_2'^2 + S_3'^2}</math> from the origin. When the non-polarized component is not of interest, the Stokes vector can be further normalized to obtain\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{S''} = \\frac{1}{P'} \\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\S'_1\\\\S'_2\\\\S'_3 \\end{bmatrix}\n               = \\frac{1}{P}  \\begin{bmatrix} S_0\\\\S_1\\\\S_2\\\\S_3 \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nWhen plotted, that point will lie on the surface of the unity-radius Poincar\u00e9 sphere and indicate the state of polarization of the polarized component.\n\nAny two antipodal points on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere refer to orthogonal polarization states. The [[inner product|overlap]] between any two polarization states is dependent solely on the distance between their locations along the sphere. This property, which can only be true when pure polarization states are mapped onto a sphere, is the motivation for the invention of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere and the use of Stokes parameters, which are thus plotted on (or beneath) it.\n\n== Implications for reflection and propagation ==\n\n=== Polarization in wave propagation ===\n\nIn a [[vacuum]], the components of the electric field propagate at the [[speed of light]], so that the phase of the wave varies in space and time while the polarization state does not. That is, the electric field vector '''e''' of a plane wave in the +''z'' direction follows:\n:<math>\\mathbf{e}(z + \\Delta z, t + \\Delta t) = \\mathbf{e}(z, t) e^{ik (c\\Delta t - \\Delta z)},</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is the [[wavenumber]]. As noted above, the instantaneous electric field is the real part of the product of the Jones vector times the phase factor <math>e^{-i\\omega t}</math>. When an electromagnetic wave interacts with matter, its propagation is altered according to the material's (complex) [[index of refraction]]. When the real or imaginary part of that refractive index is dependent on the polarization state of a wave, properties known as [[birefringence]] and polarization [[dichroism]] (or [[Diattenuator|diattenuation]]) respectively, then the polarization state of a wave will generally be altered.\n\nIn such media, an electromagnetic wave with any given state of polarization may be decomposed into two orthogonally polarized components that encounter different [[propagation constant]]s. The effect of propagation over a given path on those two components is most easily characterized in the form of a complex 2\u00d72 [[linear transformation|transformation]] matrix '''J''' known as a [[Jones calculus|Jones matrix]]:\n:<math>\\mathbf{e'} = \\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{e}.</math>\n\nThe Jones matrix due to passage through a transparent material is dependent on the propagation distance as well as the birefringence. The birefringence (as well as the average refractive index) will generally be [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive]], that is, it will vary as a function of optical frequency (wavelength). In the case of non-birefringent materials, however, the 2\u00d72 Jones matrix is the identity matrix (multiplied by a scalar [[phase factor]] and attenuation factor), implying no change in polarization during propagation.\n\nFor propagation effects in two orthogonal modes, the Jones matrix can be written as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{T}\\begin{bmatrix}\n  g_1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & g_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf{T}^{-1},</math>\n\nwhere ''g''<sub>1</sub> and ''g''<sub>2</sub> are complex numbers\ndescribing the [[phase delay]] and possibly the amplitude attenuation due to propagation in each of the two polarization eigenmodes. '''T''' is a [[unitary matrix]] representing a change of basis from these propagation modes to the linear system used for the Jones vectors; in the case of linear birefringence or diattenuation the modes are themselves linear polarization states so '''T''' and '''T<sup>\u22121</sup>''' can be omitted if the coordinate axes have been chosen appropriately.\n\n==== Birefringence ====\n{{Main|Birefringence}}\n\nIn media termed [[birefringent]], in which the amplitudes are unchanged but a differential phase delay occurs, the Jones matrix is a [[unitary matrix]]: |''g''<sub>1</sub>| = |''g''<sub>2</sub>| = 1. Media termed diattenuating (or ''[[dichroic]]'' in the sense of polarization), in which only the amplitudes of the two polarizations are affected differentially, may be described using a [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] matrix (generally multiplied by a common phase factor). In fact, since ''any'' matrix may be written as the product of unitary and positive Hermitian matrices, light propagation through any sequence of polarization-dependent optical components can be written as the product of these two basic types of transformations.\n\n[[File:Birefringence Stress Plastic.JPG|thumb|Color pattern of a plastic box showing [[Birefringence#Stress induced birefringence|stress-induced birefringence]] when placed in between two crossed [[polarizer]]s.]]\nIn birefringent media there is no attenuation, but two modes accrue a differential phase delay. Well known manifestations of linear birefringence (that is, in which the basis polarizations are orthogonal linear polarizations) appear in optical [[wave plate]]s/retarders and many crystals. If linearly polarized light passes through a birefringent material, its state of polarization will generally change, ''unless'' its polarization direction is identical to one of those basis polarizations. Since the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually wavelength-dependent, such objects viewed under white light in between two polarizers may give rise to colorful effects, as seen in the accompanying photograph.\n\nCircular birefringence is also termed [[optical activity]], especially in [[chiral]] fluids, or [[Faraday rotation]], when due to the presence of a magnetic field along the direction of propagation. When linearly polarized light is passed through such an object, it will exit still linearly polarized, but with the axis of polarization rotated. A combination of linear and circular birefringence will have as basis polarizations two orthogonal elliptical polarizations; however, the term \"elliptical birefringence\" is rarely used.\n\n[[File:Birefringence.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Paths taken by vectors in the Poincar\u00e9 sphere under birefringence. The propagation modes (rotation axes) are shown with red, blue, and yellow lines, the initial vectors by thick black lines, and the paths they take by colored ellipses (which represent circles in three dimensions).]]\n\nOne can visualize the case of linear birefringence (with two orthogonal linear propagation modes) with an incoming wave linearly polarized at a 45\u00b0 angle to those modes. As a differential phase starts to accrue, the polarization becomes elliptical, eventually changing to purely circular polarization (90\u00b0 phase difference), then to elliptical and eventually linear polarization (180\u00b0 phase) perpendicular to the original polarization, then through circular again (270\u00b0 phase), then elliptical with the original azimuth angle, and finally back to the original linearly polarized state (360\u00b0 phase) where the cycle begins anew. In general the situation is more complicated and can be characterized as a [[coordinate rotation|rotation]] in the Poincar\u00e9 sphere about the axis defined by the propagation modes. Examples for linear (blue), circular (red), and elliptical (yellow) [[birefringence]] are shown in the figure on the left. The total intensity and degree of polarization are unaffected. If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, the two polarization components of a collimated beam (or [[Ray (optics)|ray]]) can exit the material with a positional offset, even though their final propagation directions will be the same (assuming the entrance face and exit face are parallel). This is commonly viewed using [[calcite]] [[crystal]]s, which present the viewer with two slightly offset images, in opposite polarizations, of an object behind the crystal. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by [[Erasmus Bartholinus]] in 1669.\n\n==== Dichroism ====\nMedia in which transmission of one polarization mode is preferentially reduced are called ''[[dichroism|dichroic]]'' or ''diattenuating''. Like birefringence, diattenuation can be with respect to linear polarization modes (in a crystal) or circular polarization modes (usually in a liquid).\n\nDevices that block nearly all of the radiation in one mode are known as ''polarizing filters'' or simply \"[[polarizer]]s\". This corresponds to ''g''<sub>2</sub>=0 in the above representation of the Jones matrix. The output of an ideal polarizer is a specific polarization state (usually linear polarization) with an amplitude equal to the input wave's original amplitude in that polarization mode. Power in the other polarization mode is eliminated. Thus if unpolarized light is passed through an ideal polarizer (where ''g''<sub>1</sub>=1 and ''g''<sub>2</sub>=0) exactly half of its initial power is retained. Practical polarizers, especially inexpensive sheet polarizers, have additional loss so that\n''g''<sub>1</sub> < 1. However, in many instances the more relevant figure of merit is the polarizer's [[degree of polarization]] or [[extinction ratio]], which involve a comparison of ''g''<sub>1</sub> to ''g''<sub>2</sub>. Since Jones vectors refer to waves' amplitudes (rather than [[Irradiance|intensity]]), when illuminated by unpolarized light the remaining power in the unwanted polarization will be (''g''<sub>2</sub>/''g''<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> of the power in the intended polarization.\n\n=== Specular reflection ===\nIn addition to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, polarization effects describable using Jones matrices can also occur at (reflective) interface between two materials of different [[refractive index]]. These effects are treated by the [[Fresnel equations]]. Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reflected; for a given material those proportions (and also the phase of reflection) are dependent on the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] and are different for the ''s'' and ''p'' polarizations. Therefore, the polarization state of reflected light (even if initially unpolarized) is generally changed.\n\n[[File:Brewster-polarizer.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|A stack of plates at Brewster's angle to a beam reflects off a fraction of the ''s''-polarized light at each surface, leaving (after many such plates) a mainly ''p''-polarized beam.]]\nAny light striking a surface at a special angle of incidence known as [[Brewster's angle]], where the reflection coefficient for ''p'' polarization is zero, will be reflected with only the ''s''-polarization remaining. This principle is employed in the so-called \"pile of plates polarizer\" (see figure) in which part of the ''s'' polarization is removed by reflection at each Brewster angle surface, leaving only the ''p'' polarization after transmission through many such surfaces. The generally smaller reflection coefficient of the ''p'' polarization is also the basis of [[polarized sunglasses]]; by blocking the ''s'' (horizontal) polarization, most of the glare due to reflection from a wet street, for instance, is removed.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|348\u2013350}}\n\nIn the important special case of reflection at normal incidence (not involving anisotropic materials) there is no particular ''s'' or ''p'' polarization. Both the ''x'' and ''y'' polarization components are reflected identically, and therefore the polarization of the reflected wave is identical to that of the incident wave. However, in the case of circular (or elliptical) polarization, the handedness of the polarization state is thereby reversed, since by [[Circular polarization#Left/Right|convention]] this is specified relative to the direction of propagation. The circular rotation of the electric field around the ''x-y'' axes called \"right-handed\" for a wave in the ''+z'' direction is \"left-handed\" for a wave in the ''-z'' direction. But in the general case of reflection at a nonzero angle of incidence, no such generalization can be made. For instance, right-circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at a grazing angle, will still be right-handed (but elliptically) polarized. Linear polarized light reflected from a metal at non-normal incidence will generally become elliptically polarized. These cases are handled using Jones vectors acted upon by the different Fresnel coefficients for the ''s'' and ''p'' polarization components.\n\n== Measurement techniques involving polarization ==\nSome optical measurement techniques are based on polarization. In many other optical techniques polarization is crucial or at least must be taken into account and controlled; such examples are too numerous to mention.\n\n=== Measurement of stress ===\n[[File:Polarized Stress Glasses.jpg|thumb|Stress in plastic glasses]]\nIn [[engineering]], the phenomenon of [[birefringence#Stress-induced birefringence|stress induced birefringence]] allows for stresses in transparent materials to be readily observed. As noted above and seen in the accompanying photograph, the chromaticity of birefringence typically creates colored patterns when viewed in between two polarizers. As external forces are applied, internal stress induced in the material is thereby observed. Additionally, birefringence is frequently observed due to stresses \"frozen in\" at the time of manufacture. This is famously observed in [[cellophane]] tape whose birefringence is due to the stretching of the material during the manufacturing process.\n\n=== Ellipsometry ===\n{{Main|Ellipsometry}}\nEllipsometry is a powerful technique for the measurement of the optical properties of a uniform surface. It involves measuring the polarization state of light following specular reflection from such a surface. This is typically done as a function of incidence angle or wavelength (or both). Since ellipsometry relies on reflection, it is not required for the sample to be transparent to light or for its back side to be accessible.\n\nEllipsometry can be used to model the (complex) refractive index of a surface of a bulk material. It is also very useful in determining parameters of one or more [[thin film]] layers deposited on a substrate. Due to their [[Thin-film interference|reflection properties]], not only are the predicted magnitude of the ''p'' and ''s'' polarization components, but their relative phase shifts upon reflection, compared to measurements using an ellipsometer. A normal ellipsometer does not measure the actual reflection coefficient (which requires careful photometric calibration of the illuminating beam) but the ratio of the ''p'' and ''s'' reflections, as well as change of polarization ellipticity (hence the name) induced upon reflection by the surface being studied. In addition to use in science and research, ellipsometers are used [[ellipsometry#In situ ellipsometry|in situ]] to control production processes for instance.<ref name=\"GoldsteinGoldstein2011\">{{cite book|author1=Dennis Goldstein|author2=Dennis H.

Linearly polarized light generally has its polarization state altered upon transmission through such a crystal, making it stand out when viewed in between two crossed polarizers, as seen in the photograph, above. Likewise, in chemistry, rotation of polarization axes in a liquid solution can be a useful measurement. In a liquid, linear birefringence is impossible, however there may be circular birefringence when a chiral molecule is in solution. When the right and left handed [[enantiomers]] of such a molecule are present in equal numbers (a so-called [[racemic]] mixture) then their effects cancel out. However, when there is only one (or a preponderance of one), as is more often the case for [[organic molecules]], a net circular birefringence (or ''[[optical activity]]'') is observed, revealing the magnitude of that imbalance (or the concentration of the molecule itself, when it can be assumed that only one enantiomer is present). This is measured using a [[polarimeter]] in which polarized light is passed through a tube of the liquid, at the end of which is another polarizer which is rotated in order to null the transmission of light through it.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|360\u2013365}}<ref name=\"VollhardtSchore2003\">{{cite book|first1=K.

In the picture on the left, the horizontally oriented polarizer preferentially transmits those reflections; rotating the polarizer by 90\u00b0 (right) as one would view using polarized sunglasses blocks almost all [[specular reflection|specularly reflected]] sunlight.]]\n[[File:Test for polarized and non-polarized sunglasses 2.jpg|left|thumb|One can test whether sunglasses are polarized by looking through two pairs, with one perpendicular to the other. If both are polarized, all light will be blocked.]]\nUnpolarized light, after being reflected by a specular (shiny) surface, generally obtains a degree of polarization. This phenomenon was observed in 1808 by the mathematician [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]], after whom [[Malus's law]] is named. Polarizing [[sunglasses]] exploit this effect to reduce glare from reflections by horizontal surfaces, notably the road ahead viewed at a grazing angle.\n\nWearers of polarized sunglasses will occasionally observe inadvertent polarization effects such as color-dependent birefringent effects, for example in [[toughened glass]] (e.g., car windows) or items made from transparent [[plastic]]s, in conjunction with natural polarization by reflection or scattering. The polarized light from LCD monitors (see below) is very conspicuous when these are worn.\n\n=== Sky polarization and photography ===\n{{Details|Polarizing filter (Photography)}}\n[[File:CircularPolarizer.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|The effects of a [[polarizing filter (Photography)|polarizing filter]] (right image) on the sky in a photograph.]]\nPolarization is observed in the light of the [[sky#During the day|sky]], as this is due to sunlight scattered by [[aerosols]] as it passes through the [[earth's atmosphere]]. The [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]] light produces the brightness and color in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be used to darken the sky in photographs, increasing the contrast. This effect is most strongly observed at points on the sky making a 90\u00b0 angle to the sun. Polarizing filters use these effects to optimize the results of photographing scenes in which reflection or scattering by the sky is involved.<ref name=Hecht2002>{{cite book|last=Hecht|first=Eugene|title=Optics|date=2002| location=United States of America|publisher=Addison Wesley| edition=4th|isbn=0-8053-8566-5}}</ref>{{rp|346\u2013347}}<ref name=Bekefi>{{cite book|last1=Bekefi|first1=George|last2=Barrett|first2=Alan|title=Electromagnetic Vibrations, Waves, and Radiation|url=https://archive.org/details/electromagneticv0000beke|url-access=registration|publisher=MIT Press|location=USA|isbn=0-262-52047-8|date=1977}}</ref>{{rp|495\u2013499}}\n\nSky polarization has been used for orientation in navigation.

Light from the [[backlight]] (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a [[seven-segment display]] or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny [[helices]]. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used in the vast majority of televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.\n\nIn a totally different sense, polarization encoding has become the leading (but not sole) method for delivering separate images to the left and right eye in [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] displays used for [[3D film|3D movies]]. This involves separate images intended for each eye either projected from two different projectors with orthogonally oriented polarizing filters or, more typically, from a single projector with time multiplexed polarization (a fast alternating polarization device for successive frames). [[Polarized 3D glasses]] with suitable polarizing filters ensure that each eye receives only the intended image. Historically such systems used linear polarization encoding because it was inexpensive and offered good separation. However circular polarization makes separation of the two images insensitive to tilting of the head, and is widely used in 3-D movie exhibition today, such as the system from [[RealD]]. Projecting such images requires screens that maintain the polarization of the projected light when viewed in reflection (such as [[silver screen]]s); a normal diffuse white projection screen causes depolarization of the projected images, making it unsuitable for this application.\n\nAlthough now obsolete, CRT computer displays suffered from reflection by the glass envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of circularly polarized light. A circular polarizing filter in front of the screen allows for the transmission of (say) only right circularly polarized room light. Now, right circularly polarized light (depending on the [[Circular polarization#From the point of view of the source|convention]] used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same direction of rotation, but now propagation is in the \u2212z direction making the reflected wave ''left'' circularly polarized. With the right circular polarization filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected from the glass will thus be in very polarization state that is ''blocked'' by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of circular polarization on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed circular polarization in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct circular polarization allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.\n\n=== Radio transmission and reception{{anchor|Antennas}} ===\n{{See also|Antenna (radio)#Polarization}}\n\nAll [[radio]] (and microwave) [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] used for transmitting or receiving are intrinsically polarized. They transmit in (or receive signals from) a particular polarization, being totally insensitive to the opposite polarization; in certain cases that polarization is a function of direction. Most antennas are nominally linearly polarized, but elliptical and circular polarization is a possibility. As is the convention in optics, the \"polarization\" of a radio wave is understood to refer to the polarization of its electric field, with the magnetic field being at a 90 degree rotation with respect to it for a linearly polarized wave.\n\nThe vast majority of antennas are linearly polarized. In fact it can be shown from considerations of symmetry that an antenna that lies entirely in a plane which also includes the observer, can ''only'' have its polarization in the direction of that plane. This applies to many cases, allowing one to easily infer such an antenna's polarization at an intended direction of propagation. So a typical rooftop [[Yagi-Uda antenna|Yagi]] or [[log-periodic antenna]] with horizontal conductors, as viewed from a second station toward the horizon, is necessarily horizontally polarized. But a vertical \"[[whip antenna]]\" or AM broadcast tower used as an antenna element (again, for observers horizontally displaced from it) will transmit in the vertical polarization. A [[turnstile antenna]] with its four arms in the horizontal plane, likewise transmits horizontally polarized radiation toward the horizon. However, when that same turnstile antenna is used in the \"axial mode\" (upwards, for the same horizontally-oriented structure) its radiation is circularly polarized. At intermediate elevations it is elliptically polarized.\n\nPolarization is important in radio communications because, for instance, if one attempts to use a horizontally polarized antenna to receive a vertically polarized transmission, the signal strength will be substantially reduced (or under very controlled conditions, reduced to nothing). This principle is used in [[satellite television]] in order to double the channel capacity over a fixed frequency band. The same frequency channel can be used for two signals broadcast in opposite polarizations. By adjusting the receiving antenna for one or the other polarization, either signal can be selected without interference from the other.\n\nEspecially due to the presence of the [[Surface wave#ground wave|ground]], there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]]) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses horizontal polarization. At low frequencies especially, horizontal polarization is avoided. That is because the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the horizontal direction will receive both the direct and reflected wave, which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of [[radar]] pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, back scattering of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as specular reflection of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.\n\nThe effect of [[plasma (physics)|free electrons]] in the [[ionosphere]], in conjunction with the [[earth's magnetic field]], causes [[Faraday rotation#Faraday rotation in the ionosphere|Faraday rotation]], a sort of circular birefringence. This is the same mechanism which can rotate the axis of linear polarization by electrons in [[interstellar space]] as mentioned [[#Astronomy|below]]. The magnitude of Faraday rotation caused by such a plasma is greatly exaggerated at lower frequencies, so at the higher microwave frequencies used by satellites the effect is minimal. However medium or [[short wave]] transmissions received following [[sky wave|refraction by the ionosphere]] are strongly affected. Since a wave's path through the ionosphere and the earth's magnetic field vector along such a path are rather unpredictable, a wave transmitted with vertical (or horizontal) polarization will generally have a resulting polarization in an arbitrary orientation at the receiver.\n[[File:Oceano Atlantico 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|Circular polarization through an airplane plastic window, 1989]]\n\n=== Polarization and vision ===\nMany [[animal]]s are capable of perceiving some of the components of the polarization of light, e.g., linear horizontally polarized light. This is generally used for navigational purposes, since the linear polarization of sky light is always perpendicular to the direction of the sun.

In addition, however, light carries a certain [[angular momentum]] if it is circularly polarized (or partially so). In comparison with lower frequencies such as microwaves, the amount of [[Spin angular momentum of light|angular momentum in light]], even of pure circular polarization, compared to the same wave's linear momentum (or [[radiation pressure]]) is very small and difficult to even measure.

Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string.  In contrast, in [[longitudinal wave]]s, such as [[sound wave]]s in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization.

In [[linear polarization]], the fields oscillate in a single direction.  In [[circular polarization|circular]] or [[elliptical polarization]], the fields rotate at a constant rate in a plane as the wave travels.  The rotation can have two possible directions; if the fields rotate in a [[right hand rule|right hand]] sense with respect to the direction of wave travel, it is called [[right circular polarization]], while if the fields rotate in a left hand sense, it is called [[left circular polarization]].\n\nLight or other electromagnetic radiation from many sources, such as the sun, flames, and [[incandescent lamp]]s, consists of short wave trains with an equal mixture of polarizations; this is called ''unpolarized light''.  Polarized light can be produced by passing unpolarized light through a [[polarizer]], which allows waves of only one polarization to pass through.   The most common optical materials (such as glass) are [[isotropic]] and do not affect the polarization of light passing through them; however, some materials\u2014those that exhibit [[birefringence]], [[dichroism]], or [[optical activity]]\u2014can change the polarization of light.  Some of these are used to make polarizing filters.  Light is also partially polarized when it reflects from a surface.\n\nAccording to [[quantum mechanics]], electromagnetic waves can also be viewed as streams of particles called [[photon]]s.  When viewed in this way, the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is determined by a quantum mechanical property of photons called their [[spin (physics)|spin]].<ref name=\"Lipson\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Lipson\n | first1 =  Stephen G.\n | last2  = Lipson\n | first2 = Henry\n | last3  = Tannhauser\n | first3 = David Stefan\n | title  = Optical Physics\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | date   = 1995\n | pages  = 125\u2013127\n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=wlylmCXMZicC&pg=PA126&dq=polarization+photon+spin\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 978-0-521-43631-1\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Waldman\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Waldman\n | first1 = Gary\n | title  = Introduction to Light: The Physics of Light, Vision, and Color\n | publisher = Courier Corporation\n | date   = 2002\n | pages  = 79\u201380\n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=PbsoAXWbnr4C&pg=PA80&dq=polarization+spin+light+photon\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   =  978-0-486-42118-6\n }}</ref>  A photon has one of two possible spins: it can either spin in a [[right hand rule|right hand]] sense or a left hand sense about its direction of travel.

Linearly polarized waves consist of photons that are in a superposition of right and left circularly polarized states, with equal amplitude and phases synchronized to give oscillation in a plane.<ref name=\"Waldman\" />\n\nPolarization is an important parameter in areas of science dealing with transverse waves, such as [[optics]], [[seismology]], [[radio]], and [[microwave]]s. Especially impacted are technologies such as [[laser]]s, wireless and optical fiber [[telecommunications]], and [[radar]].\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{anchor|Theory}}\n<!-- ==Theory== -->\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Birefringence]] -->\n\n=== Wave propagation and polarization ===\n[[File:Cross_linear_polarization.gif|thumb|cross linear polarized]]\nMost sources of light are classified as incoherent and unpolarized (or only \"partially polarized\") because they consist of a random mixture of waves having different spatial characteristics, frequencies (wavelengths), phases, and polarization states. However, for understanding electromagnetic waves and polarization in particular, it is easier to just consider coherent [[plane wave]]s; these are sinusoidal waves of one particular direction (or [[wavevector]]), frequency, phase, and polarization state. Characterizing an optical system in relation to a plane wave with those given parameters can then be used to predict its response to a more general case, since a wave with any specified spatial structure can be decomposed into a combination of plane waves (its so-called [[angular spectrum]]). Incoherent states can be modeled [[stochastically]] as a weighted combination of such uncorrelated waves with some [[probability distribution|distribution]] of frequencies (its ''[[Spectral density|spectrum]]''), phases, and polarizations.\n\n==== Transverse electromagnetic waves ====\n[[File:Electromagnetic wave.png|thumb|upright=2.6|A \"vertically polarized\" electromagnetic wave of wavelength \u03bb has its electric field vector '''E''' (red) oscillating in the vertical direction. The magnetic field '''B''' (or '''H''') is always at right angles to it (blue), and both are perpendicular to the direction of propagation ('''z''').]]\n\n[[Electromagnetic waves]] (such as light), traveling in free space or another [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] [[isotropic]] [[Attenuation|non-attenuating]] medium, are properly described as [[transverse waves]], meaning that a plane wave's electric field vector '''E''' and magnetic field '''H''' are in directions perpendicular to (or \"transverse\" to) the direction of wave propagation; '''E''' and '''H''' are also perpendicular to each other.  By convention, the \"polarization\" direction of an electromagnetic wave is given by its electric field vector.  Considering a monochromatic [[plane wave]] of optical frequency ''f'' (light of vacuum wavelength \u03bb has a frequency of ''f = c/\u03bb'' where ''c'' is the speed of light), let us take the direction of propagation as the ''z'' axis. Being a transverse wave the '''E''' and '''H''' fields must then contain components only in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions whereas ''E<sub>z</sub> = H<sub>z</sub> = 0''. Using [[Complex number|complex]] (or [[phasor]]) notation, the instantaneous physical electric and magnetic fields are given by the [[real part]]s of the complex quantities occurring in the following equations. As a function of time ''t'' and spatial position ''z'' (since for a plane wave in the +''z'' direction the fields have no dependence on ''x'' or ''y'') these complex fields can be written as:\n: <math>\\vec{E}(z, t) = \\begin{bmatrix} e_x \\\\ e_y \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\; e^{i2\\pi \\left(\\frac{z}{\\lambda} - \\frac{t}{T}\\right)} = \\begin{bmatrix} e_x \\\\ e_y \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\; e^{i(kz - \\omega t)}</math>\n\nand\n: <math>\\vec{H}(z, t) = \\begin{bmatrix} h_x \\\\ h_y \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\; e^{i2\\pi \\left(\\frac{z}{\\lambda} - \\frac{t}{T}\\right)} = \\begin{bmatrix} h_x \\\\ h_y \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\; e^{i(kz - \\omega t)}</math>\n\nwhere \u03bb = \u03bb{{sub|0}}/''n'' is the wavelength ''in the medium'' (whose [[refractive index]] is ''n'') and {{nowrap|1=''T'' = 1/''f''}} is the period of the wave. Here ''e<sub>x</sub>'', ''e<sub>y</sub>'', ''h<sub>x</sub>'', and ''h<sub>y</sub>'' are complex numbers. In the second more compact form, as these equations are customarily expressed, these factors are described using the  [[wavenumber]] <math>k = 2\\pi n / \\lambda _0</math> and [[angular frequency]] (or \"radian frequency\") <math>\\omega = 2\\pi f</math>. In a more general formulation with propagation ''not'' restricted to the ''+z'' direction, then the spatial dependence ''kz'' is replaced by <math>\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r}</math> where <math>\\vec{k}</math> is called the [[wave vector]], the magnitude of which is the wavenumber.\n\nThus the leading vectors '''e''' and '''h''' each contain up to two nonzero (complex) components describing the amplitude and phase of the wave's  ''x'' and ''y'' polarization components (again, there can be no ''z'' polarization component for a transverse wave in the +''z'' direction). For a given medium with a [[wave impedance|characteristic impedance]] <math>\\eta</math>, '''h''' is related to '''e''' by:\n:<math>h_y = \\frac{e_x}{\\eta}</math>\n\nand\n:<math>h_x = -\\frac{e_y}{\\eta}</math>.\n\nIn a dielectric, ''\u03b7'' is real and has the value ''\u03b7''<sub>0</sub>/''n'', where ''n'' is the refractive index and ''\u03b7''<sub>0</sub> is the impedance of free space. The impedance will be complex in a conducting medium.{{clarify|reason=But if eta is not real, how can we complete the proof of orthogonality? Don't we take real parts before doing the dot product? See talk page.|date=May 2015}} Note that given that relationship, the dot product of '''E''' and '''H''' must be zero:{{dubious|reason=Don't we take real parts before doing the dot product?|date=May 2015}}\n:<math>\n  \\vec{E}\\left(\\vec{r}, t\\right) \\cdot \\vec{H}\\left(\\vec{r}, t\\right) =\n    e_x h_x + e_y h_y + e_z h_z =\n    e_x \\left(-\\frac{e_y}{\\eta}\\right) + e_y \\left(\\frac{e_x}{\\eta}\\right) + 0 \\cdot 0 = 0\n</math>\n\nindicating that these vectors are [[orthogonal]] (at right angles to each other), as expected.\n\nSo knowing the propagation direction (+''z'' in this case) and \u03b7, one can just as well specify the wave in terms of just ''e<sub>x</sub>'' and ''e<sub>y</sub>'' describing the electric field. The vector containing ''e<sub>x</sub>'' and ''e<sub>y</sub>'' (but without the ''z'' component which is necessarily zero for a transverse wave) is known as a [[Jones vector]]. In addition to specifying the polarization state of the wave, a general Jones vector also specifies the overall magnitude and phase of that wave. Specifically, the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the light wave is proportional to the sum of the squared magnitudes of the two electric field components:\n:<math> I = \\left(\\left|e_x\\right|^2 + \\left|e_y\\right|^2\\right) \\, \\frac{1}{2\\eta} </math>\n\nhowever the wave's ''state of polarization'' is only dependent on the (complex) ''ratio'' of ''e<sub>y</sub>'' to ''e<sub>x</sub>''. So let us just consider waves whose ''|e<sub>x</sub>|<sup>2</sup> + |e<sub>y</sub>|<sup>2</sup> = 1''; this happens to correspond to an intensity of about .00133 [[watt]]s per square meter in free space (where <math>\\eta = </math> [[impedance of free space|<math>\\eta_0</math>]]). And since the absolute phase of a wave is unimportant in discussing its polarization state, let us stipulate that the phase of ''e<sub>x</sub>'' is zero, in other words ''e<sub>x</sub>'' is a real number while ''e<sub>y</sub>'' may be complex. Under these restrictions, ''e<sub>x</sub>'' and ''e<sub>y</sub>'' can be represented as follows:\n:<math>e_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + Q}{2}} </math>\n:<math>e_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - Q}{2}}\\, e^{i\\phi} </math>\n\nwhere the polarization state is now fully parameterized by the value of ''Q'' (such that \u22121 < ''Q'' < 1) and the relative phase <math>\\phi</math>.\n\n==== Non-transverse waves ====\nIn addition to transverse waves, there are many wave motions where the oscillation is not limited to directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on transverse waves (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), however one should be aware of cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as we have just done.\n\nJust considering electromagnetic waves, we note that the preceding discussion strictly applies to plane waves in a homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, whereas in an [[anisotropic]] medium (such as birefringent crystals as discussed below) the electric or magnetic field may have longitudinal as well as transverse components. In those cases the [[electric displacement]] ''D'' and [[magnetic flux density]] ''B''{{clarify|reason=But B doesn't appear above.|date=May 2015}} still obey the above geometry but due to anisotropy in the [[electric susceptibility]] (or in the [[magnetic permeability]]), now given by a [[tensor]], the direction of ''E'' (or ''H'') may differ from that of ''D'' (or ''B''). Even in isotropic media, so-called [[inhomogeneous wave]]s can be launched into a medium whose refractive index has a significant imaginary part (or \"[[Complex index of refraction#Complex index of refraction and absorption|extinction coefficient]]\") such as metals;{{clarify|reason=Is this the same as having a complex value of the wave impedance \u03b7 that was employed in the previous section? The discussion should be made consistent and the assumptions on the reality of \u03b7 (or not) should be made explicit.|date=May 2015}} these fields are also not strictly transverse.<ref name=Griffiths1998>{{cite book|author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|publisher=Prentice Hall|date=1998|pages=|isbn=0-13-805326-X|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0}}</ref>{{rp|179\u2013184}}<ref name=\"New2011\">{{cite book|author=Geoffrey New|title=Introduction to Nonlinear Optics|date=7 April 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50076-0}}</ref>{{rp|51\u201352}} [[Surface wave]]s or waves propagating in a [[waveguide]] (such as an [[optical fiber]]) are generally ''not'' transverse waves, but might be described as an electric or magnetic [[transverse mode]], or a hybrid mode.\n\nEven in free space, longitudinal field components can be generated in focal regions, where the plane wave approximation breaks down. An extreme example is [[radial polarisation|radially]] or tangentially polarized light, at the focus of which the electric or magnetic field respectively is ''entirely'' longitudinal (along the direction of propagation).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.233901 |author=Dorn, R. |author2=Quabis, S. |author3=Leuchs, G. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Sharper Focus for a Radially Polarized Light Beam |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=Dec 2003 |volume=91 |issue=23 | pages=233901 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..91w3901D |pmid=14683185}}</ref>\n\nFor [[longitudinal wave]]s such as [[sound wave]]s in [[fluid]]s, the direction of oscillation is by definition along the direction of travel, so the issue of polarization is not normally even mentioned. On the other hand, sound waves in a bulk [[solid]] can be transverse as well as longitudinal, for a total of three polarization components. In this case, the transverse polarization is associated with the direction of the [[shear stress]] and displacement in directions perpendicular to the propagation direction, while the longitudinal polarization describes compression of the solid and vibration along the direction of propagation. The differential propagation of transverse and longitudinal polarizations is important in [[seismology]].\n\n== Polarization state{{anchor|State}} ==\n{{further|Linear polarization|Circular polarization|Elliptical polarization}}\n[[File:Polarisation rectiligne.gif|thumb|upright=0.25|Electric field oscillation]]\nPolarization is best understood by initially considering only pure polarization states, and only a coherent sinusoidal wave at some optical frequency. The vector in the adjacent diagram might describe the oscillation of the electric field emitted by a single-mode laser (whose oscillation frequency would be typically 10<sup>15</sup> times faster). The field oscillates in the ''x-y'' plane, along the page, with the wave propagating in the ''z'' direction, perpendicular to the page.\nThe first two diagrams below trace the electric field vector over a complete cycle for linear polarization at two different orientations; these are each considered a distinct ''state of polarization'' (SOP). Note that the linear polarization at 45\u00b0 can also be viewed as the addition of a horizontally linearly polarized wave (as in the leftmost figure) and a vertically polarized wave of the same amplitude ''in the same phase''.\n\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Linear polarization parallel to x axis.svg|center|100px]]\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Linear polarization oriented at +45deg.svg|center|100px]]\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Right-elliptical polarization A.svg|100px]]\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Right-circular polarization.svg|100px]]\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:left;width:100px\">\n[[File:Polarisation state - Left-circular polarization.svg|100px]]\n</div>\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Wave Polarisation.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|Animation showing four different polarization states and two orthogonal projections.]]\n[[File:Rising circular.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|A circularly polarized wave as a sum of two linearly polarized components 90\u00b0 out of phase]]\nNow if one were to introduce a [[Phase (waves)#phase shift|phase shift]] in between those horizontal and vertical polarization components, one would generally obtain elliptical polarization<ref>{{cite book | last=Chandrasekhar | first=Subrahmanyan | title=Radiative Transfer | url=https://archive.org/details/radiativetransfe0000chan | url-access=registration | publisher=Dover | year=1960 | isbn=0-486-60590-6 | oclc=924844798 | page=[https://archive.org/details/radiativetransfe0000chan/page/27 27]}}</ref>  as is shown in the third figure. When the phase shift is exactly \u00b190\u00b0, then ''circular polarization'' is produced (fourth and fifth figures). Thus is circular polarization created in practice, starting with linearly polarized light and employing a [[quarter-wave plate]] to introduce such a phase shift. The result of two such phase-shifted components in causing a rotating electric field vector is depicted in the animation on the right. Note that circular or elliptical polarization can involve either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the field. These correspond  to distinct polarization states, such as the two circular polarizations shown above.\n\nOf course the orientation of the ''x'' and ''y'' axes used in this description is arbitrary. The choice of such a coordinate system and viewing the polarization ellipse in terms of the  ''x'' and ''y'' polarization components, corresponds to the definition of the Jones vector (below) in terms of those [[basis functions|basis]] polarizations. One would typically choose axes to suit a particular problem such as ''x'' being in the plane of incidence. Since there are separate reflection coefficients for the linear polarizations in and orthogonal to the plane of incidence (''p'' and ''s'' polarizations, see below), that choice greatly simplifies the calculation of a wave's reflection from a surface.\n\nMoreover, one can use as basis functions ''any'' pair of [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] polarization states, not just linear polarizations. For instance, choosing right and left circular polarizations as basis functions simplifies the solution of problems involving circular birefringence (optical activity) or circular dichroism.\n\n<!-- Following sections (had been) linked from [[coherence (physics)]] and from [[decibel#examples]] and from [[axial ratio]] -->\n<!-- ====Parameterization==== -->\n{{anchor|Parameterization}}\n\n=== Polarization ellipse ===\n{{Main|Polarization ellipse}}\n[[File:Polarisation ellipse2.svg|left|200px]]\nConsider a purely polarized monochromatic wave.

The special cases of linear and circular polarization correspond to an ellipticity \u03b5 of infinity and unity (or \u03c7 of zero and 45\u00b0) respectively.\n\n=== Jones vector ===\n{{Main|Jones vector}}\nFull information on a completely polarized state is also provided by the amplitude and phase of oscillations in two components of the electric field vector in the plane of polarization. This representation was used above to show how different states of polarization are possible. The amplitude and phase information can be conveniently represented as a two-dimensional [[complex number|complex]] vector (the [[Jones calculus|Jones vector]]):\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{e} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_1 e^{i\\theta_1} \\\\\n  a_2 e^{i\\theta_2}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nHere <math>a_1</math> and <math>a_2</math> denote the amplitude of the wave in the two components of the electric field vector, while <math>\\theta_1</math> and <math>\\theta_2</math> represent the phases. The product of a Jones vector with a complex number of unit [[Absolute value|modulus]] gives a different Jones vector representing the same ellipse, and thus the same state of polarization. The physical electric field, as the real part of the Jones vector, would be altered but the polarization state itself is independent of [[absolute phase]]. The [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] vectors used to represent the Jones vector need not represent linear polarization states (i.e. be [[real numbers|real]]). In general any two '''orthogonal states''' can be used, where an orthogonal vector pair is formally defined as one having a zero [[inner product]]. A common choice is left and right circular polarizations, for example to model the different propagation of waves in two such components in circularly birefringent media (see below) or signal paths of coherent detectors sensitive to circular polarization.\n\n=== Coordinate frame ===\nRegardless of whether polarization state is represented using geometric parameters or Jones vectors, implicit in the parameterization is the orientation of the coordinate frame. This permits a degree of freedom, namely rotation about the propagation direction. When considering light that is propagating parallel to the surface of the Earth, the terms \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" polarization are often used, with the former being associated with the first component of the Jones vector, or zero azimuth angle. On the other hand, in [[astronomy]] the [[equatorial coordinate system]] is generally used instead, with the zero azimuth (or position angle, as it is more commonly called in astronomy to avoid confusion with the [[horizontal coordinate system]]) corresponding to due north.\n\n==== ''s'' and ''p'' designations{{anchor|s and p}} ====\n\n[[File:E xy deformation.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|Electromagnetic vectors for <math display=\"inline\">\\textbf{E}</math>, <math display=\"inline\">\\textbf{B}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\textbf{k}</math> with <math display=\"inline\">\\textbf{E} = \\textbf{E}(x,y)</math> along with 3 planar projections and a deformation surface of total electric field.

This is the plane made by the incoming propagation direction and the vector perpendicular to the plane of an interface, in other words, the plane in which the ray travels before and after reflection or refraction. <!--The rays in this plane are illustrated in the diagram to the right.--> The component of the electric field parallel to this plane is termed ''p-like'' (parallel) and the component perpendicular to this plane is termed ''s-like'' (from ''senkrecht'', German for perpendicular). Polarized light with its electric field along the plane of incidence is thus denoted ''p-polarized'', while light whose electric field is normal to the plane of incidence is called ''s-polarized''. ''P'' polarization is commonly referred to as ''transverse-magnetic'' (TM), and has also been termed ''pi-polarized'' or ''tangential plane polarized''. ''S'' polarization is also called ''transverse-electric'' (TE), as well as ''sigma-polarized'' or ''sagittal plane polarized''.\n\n=== Unpolarized and partially polarized light ===\n{{Repetition section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==== Definition ====\nNatural light, like most other common sources of visible light, is [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]]: radiation is produced independently by a large number of atoms or molecules whose emissions are [[statistical correlation|uncorrelated]] and generally of random polarizations. In this case the light is said to be ''unpolarized''. This term is somewhat inexact, since at any instant of time at one location there is a definite direction to the electric and magnetic fields, however it implies that the polarization changes so quickly in time that it will not be measured or relevant to the outcome of an experiment.  A so-called [[depolarizer (optics)|depolarizer]] acts on a polarized beam to create one which is actually ''fully'' polarized at every point, but in which the polarization varies so rapidly across the beam that it may be ignored in the intended applications.\n\nUnpolarized light can be described as a mixture of two independent oppositely polarized streams, each with half the intensity.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.4.796| title=Density Operator of Unpolarized Radiation| journal=Physical Review A| volume=4| issue=2| pages=796\u2013799| year=1971| last1=Prakash| first1=Hari| last2=Chandra| first2=Naresh| bibcode=1971PhRvA...4..796P}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Chandrasekhar |first=Subrahmanyan |title=Radiative transfer |publisher=Courier |year=2013 |page=30}}</ref> Light is said to be ''partially polarized'' when there is more power in one of these streams than the other. At any particular wavelength, partially polarized light can be statistically described as the superposition of a completely unpolarized component and a completely polarized one.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|330}} One may then describe the light in terms of the [[degree of polarization]] and the parameters of the polarized component. That polarized component can be described in terms of a Jones vector or polarization ellipse, as is detailed above. However, in order to also describe the degree of polarization, one normally employs Stokes parameters (see below) to specify a state of partial polarization.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|351,374\u2013375}}\n\n==== Motivation ====\nThe transmission of plane waves through a homogeneous medium are fully described in terms of Jones vectors and 2\u00d72 Jones matrices. However, in practice there are cases in which all of the light cannot be viewed in such a simple manner due to spatial inhomogeneities or the presence of mutually incoherent waves. So-called depolarization, for instance, cannot be described using Jones matrices. For these cases it is usual instead to use a 4\u00d74 matrix that acts upon the Stokes 4-vector. Such matrices were first used by Paul Soleillet in 1929, although they have come to be known as [[Mueller matrix|Mueller matrices]]. While every Jones matrix has a Mueller matrix, the reverse is not true. Mueller matrices are then used to describe the observed polarization effects of the [[scattering]] of waves from complex surfaces or ensembles of particles, as shall now be presented.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|377\u2013379}}\n\n==== Coherency matrix ====\nThe Jones vector perfectly describes the state of polarization ''and phase'' of a single monochromatic wave, representing a pure state of polarization as described above. However any mixture of waves of different polarizations (or even of different frequencies) do ''not'' correspond to a Jones vector. In so-called partially polarized radiation the fields are [[stochastic]], and the variations and correlations between components of the electric field can only be described [[statistical]]ly. One such representation is the '''coherency [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]''':<ref name=\"O'Neill2004\">{{cite book|author=Edward L. O'Neill|title=Introduction to Statistical Optics|date=January 2004|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-43578-7}}</ref>{{rp|137\u2013142}}\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{\\Psi} &= \\left\\langle \\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{e}^\\dagger \\right\\rangle \\\\\n                &= \\left\\langle\\begin{bmatrix}\n                     e_1 e_1^* & e_1 e_2^* \\\\\n                     e_2 e_1^* & e_2 e_2^*\n                   \\end{bmatrix}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n                &= \\left\\langle\\begin{bmatrix}\n                     a_1^2 & a_1 a_2 e^{i \\left(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2\\right)} \\\\\n                     a_1 a_2 e^{-i \\left(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2\\right)} & a_2^2\n                   \\end{bmatrix}\\right\\rangle\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere angular brackets denote averaging over many wave cycles. Several variants of the coherency matrix have been proposed: the [[Norbert Wiener|Wiener]] coherency matrix and the spectral coherency matrix of [[Richard Barakat]] measure the coherence of a [[spectral decomposition]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} of the signal, while the [[Emil Wolf|Wolf]] coherency matrix averages over all time/frequencies.\n\nThe coherency matrix contains all second order statistical information about the polarization. This matrix can be decomposed into the sum of two [[idempotent]] matrices, corresponding to the [[eigenvector]]s of the coherency matrix, each representing a polarization state that is orthogonal to the other. An alternative decomposition is into completely polarized (zero determinant) and unpolarized (scaled identity matrix) components. In either case, the operation of summing the components corresponds to the incoherent superposition of waves from the two components. The latter case gives rise to the concept of the \"degree of polarization\"; i.e., the fraction of the total intensity contributed by the completely polarized component.\n\n==== Stokes parameters ====\n{{Main|Stokes parameters}}\nThe coherency matrix is not easy to visualize, and it is therefore common to describe incoherent or partially polarized radiation in terms of its total intensity (''I''), (fractional) degree of polarization (''p''), and the shape parameters of the polarization ellipse. An alternative and mathematically convenient description is given by the [[Stokes parameters]], introduced by [[George Gabriel Stokes]] in 1852. The relationship of the Stokes parameters to intensity and polarization ellipse parameters is shown in the equations and figure below.\n\n: <math>S_0 = I \\,</math>\n: <math>S_1 = Ip \\cos 2\\psi \\cos 2\\chi\\,</math>\n: <math>S_2 = Ip \\sin 2\\psi \\cos 2\\chi\\,</math>\n: <math>S_3 = Ip \\sin 2\\chi\\,</math>\n\nHere ''Ip'', 2\u03c8 and 2\u03c7 are the [[spherical coordinates]] of the polarization state in the three-dimensional space of the last three Stokes parameters. Note the factors of two before \u03c8 and \u03c7 corresponding respectively to the facts that any polarization ellipse is indistinguishable from one rotated by 180\u00b0, or one with the semi-axis lengths swapped accompanied by a 90\u00b0 rotation. The Stokes parameters are sometimes denoted ''I'', ''Q'', ''U'' and ''V''.\n\n===== Poincar\u00e9 sphere =====\n\nNeglecting the first Stokes parameter ''S''<sub>0</sub> (or ''I''), the three other Stokes parameters can be plotted directly in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. For a given power in the polarized component given by\n: <math> P = \\sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2} </math>\n\nthe set of all polarization states are then mapped to points on the surface of the so-called ''Poincar\u00e9 sphere'' (but of radius ''P''), as shown in the accompanying diagram.\n[[File:Poincar\u00e9 sphere.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Poincar\u00e9 sphere, on or beneath which the three Stokes parameters [''S''<sub>1</sub>, ''S''<sub>2</sub>, ''S''<sub>3</sub>] (or [''Q'',\u202f''U'',\u202f''V'']) are plotted in Cartesian coordinates]]\n\nOften the total beam power is not of interest, in which case a normalized Stokes vector is used by dividing the Stokes vector by the total intensity ''S''<sub>0</sub>:\n:<math>\\mathbf{S'} = \\frac{1}{S_0} \\begin{bmatrix}S_0\\\\S_1\\\\S_2\\\\S_3\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe normalized Stokes vector <math>\\mathbf{S'}</math> then has unity power (<math>S'_0 = 1</math>) and the three significant Stokes parameters plotted in three dimensions will lie on the unity-radius Poincar\u00e9 sphere for pure polarization states (where <math>P'_0 = 1</math>). Partially polarized states will lie ''inside'' the Poincar\u00e9 sphere at a distance of <math>P' = \\sqrt{S_1'^2 + S_2'^2 + S_3'^2}</math> from the origin. When the non-polarized component is not of interest, the Stokes vector can be further normalized to obtain\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{S''} = \\frac{1}{P'} \\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\S'_1\\\\S'_2\\\\S'_3 \\end{bmatrix}\n               = \\frac{1}{P}  \\begin{bmatrix} S_0\\\\S_1\\\\S_2\\\\S_3 \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nWhen plotted, that point will lie on the surface of the unity-radius Poincar\u00e9 sphere and indicate the state of polarization of the polarized component.\n\nAny two antipodal points on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere refer to orthogonal polarization states. The [[inner product|overlap]] between any two polarization states is dependent solely on the distance between their locations along the sphere. This property, which can only be true when pure polarization states are mapped onto a sphere, is the motivation for the invention of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere and the use of Stokes parameters, which are thus plotted on (or beneath) it.\n\n== Implications for reflection and propagation ==\n\n=== Polarization in wave propagation ===\n\nIn a [[vacuum]], the components of the electric field propagate at the [[speed of light]], so that the phase of the wave varies in space and time while the polarization state does not. That is, the electric field vector '''e''' of a plane wave in the +''z'' direction follows:\n:<math>\\mathbf{e}(z + \\Delta z, t + \\Delta t) = \\mathbf{e}(z, t) e^{ik (c\\Delta t - \\Delta z)},</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is the [[wavenumber]]. As noted above, the instantaneous electric field is the real part of the product of the Jones vector times the phase factor <math>e^{-i\\omega t}</math>. When an electromagnetic wave interacts with matter, its propagation is altered according to the material's (complex) [[index of refraction]]. When the real or imaginary part of that refractive index is dependent on the polarization state of a wave, properties known as [[birefringence]] and polarization [[dichroism]] (or [[Diattenuator|diattenuation]]) respectively, then the polarization state of a wave will generally be altered.\n\nIn such media, an electromagnetic wave with any given state of polarization may be decomposed into two orthogonally polarized components that encounter different [[propagation constant]]s. The effect of propagation over a given path on those two components is most easily characterized in the form of a complex 2\u00d72 [[linear transformation|transformation]] matrix '''J''' known as a [[Jones calculus|Jones matrix]]:\n:<math>\\mathbf{e'} = \\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{e}.</math>\n\nThe Jones matrix due to passage through a transparent material is dependent on the propagation distance as well as the birefringence. The birefringence (as well as the average refractive index) will generally be [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive]], that is, it will vary as a function of optical frequency (wavelength). In the case of non-birefringent materials, however, the 2\u00d72 Jones matrix is the identity matrix (multiplied by a scalar [[phase factor]] and attenuation factor), implying no change in polarization during propagation.\n\nFor propagation effects in two orthogonal modes, the Jones matrix can be written as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{T}\\begin{bmatrix}\n  g_1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & g_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\\mathbf{T}^{-1},</math>\n\nwhere ''g''<sub>1</sub> and ''g''<sub>2</sub> are complex numbers\ndescribing the [[phase delay]] and possibly the amplitude attenuation due to propagation in each of the two polarization eigenmodes. '''T''' is a [[unitary matrix]] representing a change of basis from these propagation modes to the linear system used for the Jones vectors; in the case of linear birefringence or diattenuation the modes are themselves linear polarization states so '''T''' and '''T<sup>\u22121</sup>''' can be omitted if the coordinate axes have been chosen appropriately.\n\n==== Birefringence ====\n{{Main|Birefringence}}\n\nIn media termed [[birefringent]], in which the amplitudes are unchanged but a differential phase delay occurs, the Jones matrix is a [[unitary matrix]]: |''g''<sub>1</sub>| = |''g''<sub>2</sub>| = 1. Media termed diattenuating (or ''[[dichroic]]'' in the sense of polarization), in which only the amplitudes of the two polarizations are affected differentially, may be described using a [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] matrix (generally multiplied by a common phase factor). In fact, since ''any'' matrix may be written as the product of unitary and positive Hermitian matrices, light propagation through any sequence of polarization-dependent optical components can be written as the product of these two basic types of transformations.\n\n[[File:Birefringence Stress Plastic.JPG|thumb|Color pattern of a plastic box showing [[Birefringence#Stress induced birefringence|stress-induced birefringence]] when placed in between two crossed [[polarizer]]s.]]\nIn birefringent media there is no attenuation, but two modes accrue a differential phase delay. Well known manifestations of linear birefringence (that is, in which the basis polarizations are orthogonal linear polarizations) appear in optical [[wave plate]]s/retarders and many crystals. If linearly polarized light passes through a birefringent material, its state of polarization will generally change, ''unless'' its polarization direction is identical to one of those basis polarizations. Since the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually wavelength-dependent, such objects viewed under white light in between two polarizers may give rise to colorful effects, as seen in the accompanying photograph.\n\nCircular birefringence is also termed [[optical activity]], especially in [[chiral]] fluids, or [[Faraday rotation]], when due to the presence of a magnetic field along the direction of propagation. When linearly polarized light is passed through such an object, it will exit still linearly polarized, but with the axis of polarization rotated. A combination of linear and circular birefringence will have as basis polarizations two orthogonal elliptical polarizations; however, the term \"elliptical birefringence\" is rarely used.\n\n[[File:Birefringence.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Paths taken by vectors in the Poincar\u00e9 sphere under birefringence. The propagation modes (rotation axes) are shown with red, blue, and yellow lines, the initial vectors by thick black lines, and the paths they take by colored ellipses (which represent circles in three dimensions).]]\n\nOne can visualize the case of linear birefringence (with two orthogonal linear propagation modes) with an incoming wave linearly polarized at a 45\u00b0 angle to those modes. As a differential phase starts to accrue, the polarization becomes elliptical, eventually changing to purely circular polarization (90\u00b0 phase difference), then to elliptical and eventually linear polarization (180\u00b0 phase) perpendicular to the original polarization, then through circular again (270\u00b0 phase), then elliptical with the original azimuth angle, and finally back to the original linearly polarized state (360\u00b0 phase) where the cycle begins anew. In general the situation is more complicated and can be characterized as a [[coordinate rotation|rotation]] in the Poincar\u00e9 sphere about the axis defined by the propagation modes. Examples for linear (blue), circular (red), and elliptical (yellow) [[birefringence]] are shown in the figure on the left. The total intensity and degree of polarization are unaffected. If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, the two polarization components of a collimated beam (or [[Ray (optics)|ray]]) can exit the material with a positional offset, even though their final propagation directions will be the same (assuming the entrance face and exit face are parallel). This is commonly viewed using [[calcite]] [[crystal]]s, which present the viewer with two slightly offset images, in opposite polarizations, of an object behind the crystal. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by [[Erasmus Bartholinus]] in 1669.\n\n==== Dichroism ====\nMedia in which transmission of one polarization mode is preferentially reduced are called ''[[dichroism|dichroic]]'' or ''diattenuating''. Like birefringence, diattenuation can be with respect to linear polarization modes (in a crystal) or circular polarization modes (usually in a liquid).\n\nDevices that block nearly all of the radiation in one mode are known as ''polarizing filters'' or simply \"[[polarizer]]s\". This corresponds to ''g''<sub>2</sub>=0 in the above representation of the Jones matrix. The output of an ideal polarizer is a specific polarization state (usually linear polarization) with an amplitude equal to the input wave's original amplitude in that polarization mode. Power in the other polarization mode is eliminated. Thus if unpolarized light is passed through an ideal polarizer (where ''g''<sub>1</sub>=1 and ''g''<sub>2</sub>=0) exactly half of its initial power is retained. Practical polarizers, especially inexpensive sheet polarizers, have additional loss so that\n''g''<sub>1</sub> < 1. However, in many instances the more relevant figure of merit is the polarizer's [[degree of polarization]] or [[extinction ratio]], which involve a comparison of ''g''<sub>1</sub> to ''g''<sub>2</sub>. Since Jones vectors refer to waves' amplitudes (rather than [[Irradiance|intensity]]), when illuminated by unpolarized light the remaining power in the unwanted polarization will be (''g''<sub>2</sub>/''g''<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> of the power in the intended polarization.\n\n=== Specular reflection ===\nIn addition to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, polarization effects describable using Jones matrices can also occur at (reflective) interface between two materials of different [[refractive index]]. These effects are treated by the [[Fresnel equations]]. Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reflected; for a given material those proportions (and also the phase of reflection) are dependent on the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] and are different for the ''s'' and ''p'' polarizations. Therefore, the polarization state of reflected light (even if initially unpolarized) is generally changed.\n\n[[File:Brewster-polarizer.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|A stack of plates at Brewster's angle to a beam reflects off a fraction of the ''s''-polarized light at each surface, leaving (after many such plates) a mainly ''p''-polarized beam.]]\nAny light striking a surface at a special angle of incidence known as [[Brewster's angle]], where the reflection coefficient for ''p'' polarization is zero, will be reflected with only the ''s''-polarization remaining. This principle is employed in the so-called \"pile of plates polarizer\" (see figure) in which part of the ''s'' polarization is removed by reflection at each Brewster angle surface, leaving only the ''p'' polarization after transmission through many such surfaces. The generally smaller reflection coefficient of the ''p'' polarization is also the basis of [[polarized sunglasses]]; by blocking the ''s'' (horizontal) polarization, most of the glare due to reflection from a wet street, for instance, is removed.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|348\u2013350}}\n\nIn the important special case of reflection at normal incidence (not involving anisotropic materials) there is no particular ''s'' or ''p'' polarization. Both the ''x'' and ''y'' polarization components are reflected identically, and therefore the polarization of the reflected wave is identical to that of the incident wave. However, in the case of circular (or elliptical) polarization, the handedness of the polarization state is thereby reversed, since by [[Circular polarization#Left/Right|convention]] this is specified relative to the direction of propagation. The circular rotation of the electric field around the ''x-y'' axes called \"right-handed\" for a wave in the ''+z'' direction is \"left-handed\" for a wave in the ''-z'' direction. But in the general case of reflection at a nonzero angle of incidence, no such generalization can be made. For instance, right-circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at a grazing angle, will still be right-handed (but elliptically) polarized. Linear polarized light reflected from a metal at non-normal incidence will generally become elliptically polarized. These cases are handled using Jones vectors acted upon by the different Fresnel coefficients for the ''s'' and ''p'' polarization components.\n\n== Measurement techniques involving polarization ==\nSome optical measurement techniques are based on polarization. In many other optical techniques polarization is crucial or at least must be taken into account and controlled; such examples are too numerous to mention.\n\n=== Measurement of stress ===\n[[File:Polarized Stress Glasses.jpg|thumb|Stress in plastic glasses]]\nIn [[engineering]], the phenomenon of [[birefringence#Stress induced birefringence|stress induced birefringence]] allows for stresses in transparent materials to be readily observed. As noted above and seen in the accompanying photograph, the chromaticity of birefringence typically creates colored patterns when viewed in between two polarizers. As external forces are applied, internal stress induced in the material is thereby observed. Additionally, birefringence is frequently observed due to stresses \"frozen in\" at the time of manufacture. This is famously observed in [[cellophane]] tape whose birefringence is due to the stretching of the material during the manufacturing process.\n\n=== Ellipsometry ===\n{{Main|Ellipsometry}}\nEllipsometry is a powerful technique for the measurement of the optical properties of a uniform surface. It involves measuring the polarization state of light following specular reflection from such a surface. This is typically done as a function of incidence angle or wavelength (or both). Since ellipsometry relies on reflection, it is not required for the sample to be transparent to light or for its back side to be accessible.\n\nEllipsometry can be used to model the (complex) refractive index of a surface of a bulk material. It is also very useful in determining parameters of one or more [[thin film]] layers deposited on a substrate. Due to their [[Thin-film interference|reflection properties]], not only are the predicted magnitude of the ''p'' and ''s'' polarization components, but their relative phase shifts upon reflection, compared to measurements using an ellipsometer. A normal ellipsometer does not measure the actual reflection coefficient (which requires careful photometric calibration of the illuminating beam) but the ratio of the ''p'' and ''s'' reflections, as well as change of polarization ellipticity (hence the name) induced upon reflection by the surface being studied. In addition to use in science and research, ellipsometers are used [[ellipsometry#In situ ellipsometry|in situ]] to control production processes for instance.<ref name=\"GoldsteinGoldstein2011\">{{cite book|author1=Dennis Goldstein|author2=Dennis H.

Linearly polarized light generally has its polarization state altered upon transmission through such a crystal, making it stand out when viewed in between two crossed polarizers, as seen in the photograph, above. Likewise, in chemistry, rotation of polarization axes in a liquid solution can be a useful measurement. In a liquid, linear birefringence is impossible, however there may be circular birefringence when a chiral molecule is in solution. When the right and left handed [[enantiomers]] of such a molecule are present in equal numbers (a so-called [[racemic]] mixture) then their effects cancel out. However, when there is only one (or a preponderance of one), as is more often the case for [[organic molecules]], a net circular birefringence (or ''[[optical activity]]'') is observed, revealing the magnitude of that imbalance (or the concentration of the molecule itself, when it can be assumed that only one enantiomer is present). This is measured using a [[polarimeter]] in which polarized light is passed through a tube of the liquid, at the end of which is another polarizer which is rotated in order to null the transmission of light through it.<ref name=Hecht2002 />{{rp|360\u2013365}}<ref name=\"VollhardtSchore2003\">{{cite book|first1=K.

Although not usually a factor in the [[thermal radiation]] of [[star]]s, polarization is also present in radiation from coherent [[astronomical source]]s (e.g. hydroxyl or methanol [[maser]]s), and incoherent sources such as the large radio lobes in active galaxies, and pulsar radio radiation (which may, it is speculated, sometimes be coherent), and is also imposed upon starlight by scattering from [[interstellar dust]]. Apart from providing information on sources of radiation and scattering, polarization also probes the interstellar magnetic field via [[Faraday rotation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vlemmings|first=W.

If both are polarized, all light will be blocked.]]\nUnpolarized light, after being reflected by a specular (shiny) surface, generally obtains a degree of polarization. This phenomenon was observed in 1808 by the mathematician [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]], after whom [[Malus's law]] is named. Polarizing [[sunglasses]] exploit this effect to reduce glare from reflections by horizontal surfaces, notably the road ahead viewed at a grazing angle.\n\nWearers of polarized sunglasses will occasionally observe inadvertent polarization effects such as color-dependent birefringent effects, for example in [[toughened glass]] (e.g., car windows) or items made from transparent [[plastic]]s, in conjunction with natural polarization by reflection or scattering. The polarized light from LCD monitors (see below) is very conspicuous when these are worn.\n\n=== Sky polarization and photography ===\n{{Details|Polarizing filter (Photography)}}\n[[File:CircularPolarizer.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|The effects of a [[polarizing filter (Photography)|polarizing filter]] (right image) on the sky in a photograph.]]\nPolarization is observed in the light of the [[sky#During the day|sky]], as this is due to sunlight scattered by [[aerosols]] as it passes through the [[earth's atmosphere]]. The [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]] light produces the brightness and color in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be used to darken the sky in photographs, increasing the contrast. This effect is most strongly observed at points on the sky making a 90\u00b0 angle to the sun. Polarizing filters use these effects to optimize the results of photographing scenes in which reflection or scattering by the sky is involved.<ref name=Hecht2002>{{cite book|last=Hecht|first=Eugene|title=Optics|date=2002| location=United States of America|publisher=Addison Wesley| edition=4th|isbn=0-8053-8566-5}}</ref>{{rp|346\u2013347}}<ref name=Bekefi>{{cite book|last1=Bekefi|first1=George|last2=Barrett|first2=Alan|title=Electromagnetic Vibrations, Waves, and Radiation|url=https://archive.org/details/electromagneticv0000beke|url-access=registration|publisher=MIT Press|location=USA|isbn=0-262-52047-8|date=1977}}</ref>{{rp|495\u2013499}}\n\nSky polarization has been used for orientation in navigation. The [[August Herman Pfund|Pfund sky compass]] was used in the 1950s when navigating near the poles of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] when neither the [[sun]] nor [[star]]s were visible (e.g., under daytime [[cloud]] or [[twilight]]). It has been suggested, controversially, that the [[Viking]]s exploited a similar device (the \"[[sunstone (medieval)|sunstone]]\") in their extensive expeditions across the [[North Atlantic]] in the 9th\u201311th centuries, before the arrival of the [[magnetic compass]] from Asia to Europe in the 12th century. Related to the sky compass is the \"[[polar clock]]\", invented by [[Charles Wheatstone]] in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Pye2001\">{{cite book|author=J. David Pye|title=Polarised Light in Science and Nature|date=13 February 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0673-7}}</ref>{{rp|67\u201369}}\n\n=== Display technologies ===\nThe principle of [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) technology relies on the rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the [[backlight]] (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a [[seven-segment display]] or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny [[helices]]. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used in the vast majority of televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.\n\nIn a totally different sense, polarization encoding has become the leading (but not sole) method for delivering separate images to the left and right eye in [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] displays used for [[3D film|3D movies]]. This involves separate images intended for each eye either projected from two different projectors with orthogonally oriented polarizing filters or, more typically, from a single projector with time multiplexed polarization (a fast alternating polarization device for successive frames). [[Polarized 3D glasses]] with suitable polarizing filters ensure that each eye receives only the intended image. Historically such systems used linear polarization encoding because it was inexpensive and offered good separation. However circular polarization makes separation of the two images insensitive to tilting of the head, and is widely used in 3-D movie exhibition today, such as the system from [[RealD]]. Projecting such images requires screens that maintain the polarization of the projected light when viewed in reflection (such as [[silver screen]]s); a normal diffuse white projection screen causes depolarization of the projected images, making it unsuitable for this application.\n\nAlthough now obsolete, CRT computer displays suffered from reflection by the glass envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of circularly polarized light. A circular polarizing filter in front of the screen allows for the transmission of (say) only right circularly polarized room light. Now, right circularly polarized light (depending on the [[Circular polarization#From the point of view of the source|convention]] used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same direction of rotation, but now propagation is in the \u2212z direction making the reflected wave ''left'' circularly polarized. With the right circular polarization filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected from the glass will thus be in very polarization state that is ''blocked'' by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of circular polarization on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed circular polarization in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct circular polarization allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.\n\n=== Radio transmission and reception{{anchor|Antennas}} ===\n{{See also|Antenna (radio)#Polarization}}\n\nAll [[radio]] (and microwave) [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] used for transmitting or receiving are intrinsically polarized. They transmit in (or receive signals from) a particular polarization, being totally insensitive to the opposite polarization; in certain cases that polarization is a function of direction. Most antennas are nominally linearly polarized, but elliptical and circular polarization is a possibility. As is the convention in optics, the \"polarization\" of a radio wave is understood to refer to the polarization of its electric field, with the magnetic field being at a 90 degree rotation with respect to it for a linearly polarized wave.\n\nThe vast majority of antennas are linearly polarized. In fact it can be shown from considerations of symmetry that an antenna that lies entirely in a plane which also includes the observer, can ''only'' have its polarization in the direction of that plane. This applies to many cases, allowing one to easily infer such an antenna's polarization at an intended direction of propagation. So a typical rooftop [[Yagi-Uda antenna|Yagi]] or [[log-periodic antenna]] with horizontal conductors, as viewed from a second station toward the horizon, is necessarily horizontally polarized. But a vertical \"[[whip antenna]]\" or AM broadcast tower used as an antenna element (again, for observers horizontally displaced from it) will transmit in the vertical polarization. A [[turnstile antenna]] with its four arms in the horizontal plane, likewise transmits horizontally polarized radiation toward the horizon. However, when that same turnstile antenna is used in the \"axial mode\" (upwards, for the same horizontally-oriented structure) its radiation is circularly polarized. At intermediate elevations it is elliptically polarized.\n\nPolarization is important in radio communications because, for instance, if one attempts to use a horizontally polarized antenna to receive a vertically polarized transmission, the signal strength will be substantially reduced (or under very controlled conditions, reduced to nothing). This principle is used in [[satellite television]] in order to double the channel capacity over a fixed frequency band. The same frequency channel can be used for two signals broadcast in opposite polarizations. By adjusting the receiving antenna for one or the other polarization, either signal can be selected without interference from the other.\n\nEspecially due to the presence of the [[Surface wave#ground wave|ground]], there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]]) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses horizontal polarization. At low frequencies especially, horizontal polarization is avoided. That is because the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the horizontal direction will receive both the direct and reflected wave, which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of [[radar]] pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, back scattering of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as specular reflection of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.\n\nThe effect of [[plasma (physics)|free electrons]] in the [[ionosphere]], in conjunction with the [[earth's magnetic field]], causes [[Faraday rotation#Faraday rotation in the ionosphere|Faraday rotation]], a sort of circular birefringence. This is the same mechanism which can rotate the axis of linear polarization by electrons in [[interstellar space]] as mentioned [[#Astronomy|below]]. The magnitude of Faraday rotation caused by such a plasma is greatly exaggerated at lower frequencies, so at the higher microwave frequencies used by satellites the effect is minimal. However medium or [[short wave]] transmissions received following [[sky wave|refraction by the ionosphere]] are strongly affected. Since a wave's path through the ionosphere and the earth's magnetic field vector along such a path are rather unpredictable, a wave transmitted with vertical (or horizontal) polarization will generally have a resulting polarization in an arbitrary orientation at the receiver.\n[[File:Oceano Atlantico 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|Circular polarization through an airplane plastic window, 1989]]\n\n=== Polarization and vision ===\nMany [[animal]]s are capable of perceiving some of the components of the polarization of light, e.g., linear horizontally polarized light. This is generally used for navigational purposes, since the linear polarization of sky light is always perpendicular to the direction of the sun. This ability is very common among the [[insect]]s, including [[bee]]s, which use this information to orient their [[Bee learning and communication|communicative dances]].<ref name=\"Pye2001\" />{{rp|102\u2013103}} Polarization sensitivity has also been observed in species of [[octopus]], [[squid]], [[cuttlefish]], and [[mantis shrimp]].<ref name=\"Pye2001\" />{{rp|111\u2013112}} In the latter case, one species measures all six orthogonal components of polarization, and is believed to have optimal polarization vision.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sonja Kleinlogel|author2=Andrew White| title=The secret world of shrimps: polarisation vision at its best| journal=PLoS ONE| date=2008|pmid=18478095|pmc=2377063| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002190 |doi-access=free|volume=3|issue=5|pages=e2190|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2190K |arxiv=0804.2162}}</ref> The rapidly changing, vividly colored skin patterns of cuttlefish, used for communication, also incorporate polarization patterns, and mantis shrimp are known to have polarization selective reflective tissue.

This pattern is very difficult to see, but with practice one can learn to detect polarized light with the naked eye.<ref name=\"Pye2001\" />{{rp|118}}\n\n=== Angular momentum using circular polarization ===\nIt is well known that electromagnetic radiation carries a certain linear [[momentum]] in the direction of propagation. In addition, however, light carries a certain [[angular momentum]] if it is circularly polarized (or partially so). In comparison with lower frequencies such as microwaves, the amount of [[Spin angular momentum of light|angular momentum in light]], even of pure circular polarization, compared to the same wave's linear momentum (or [[radiation pressure]]) is very small and difficult to even measure. However it was utilized in an experiment to achieve speeds of up to 600 million revolutions per minute.<ref>{{cite web | title='Fastest spinning object' created | website=BBC News | date=2013-08-28 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-23861397 | access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Laser-induced rotation and cooling of a trapped microgyroscope in vacuum|journal = Nature Communications|volume = 4|pages = 2374|first1=Kishan|last1=Dholakia|first2=Michael|last2=Mazilu|first3=Yoshihiko|last3=Arita|date=August 28, 2013|doi=10.1038/ncomms3374|pmid = 23982323|pmc = 3763500|hdl = 10023/4019|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.2374A}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Depolarizer (optics)]]\n* [[Fluorescence anisotropy]]\n* [[Glan\u2013Taylor prism]]\n* [[Kerr effect]]\n* [[Nicol prism]]\n* [[Pockels effect]]\n* [[Polarization rotator]]\n* [[Polarized light microscopy]]\n* [[Polarizer]]\n* [[Polaroid (polarizer)]]\n* [[Radial polarization]]\n* [[Rayleigh sky model]]\n* [[Waveplate]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Cited references ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== General references ===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* ''Principles of Optics'', 7th edition, M.

He worked as an Accounting Officer for [[Texaco]] from 1976\u201384.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\" /> In 1984 he set up his own management consultancy and quality assurance company, Daisley Associates, together with his father; he was formally Director of Finance and Administration for the company.<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" />\n\nWhile at Texaco in 1979, Daisley had joined the [[Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs]] and became an active trade unionist; he joined the Labour Party in 1982 in Lewisham, feeling that \"it needed all the help it could get\". Daisley was to become a leading local supporter of [[Neil Kinnock]].<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> He married Lesley Jordan in 1984,<ref name=\"Times obituary\">\"Paul Daisley\" (obituary), ''The Times'', 19 June 2003, p. 34.</ref> and the two moved to Sudbury Avenue in the [[London Borough of Brent]].<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" />\n\n==Local government==\nAt the 1986 local elections, Daisley was an unsuccessful candidate in the then safe Conservative ward<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> of Sudbury Court.<ref>\"London Borough Council Election Results, 8 May 1986\", London Residuary Body, 1986, p. 14.</ref> Highly critical of the Labour administration that won the election, Daisley worked together with likeminded colleagues to rebuild the party. Although Labour lost control in the 1990 local elections, Daisley was elected as a councillor for [[Harlesden]] ward.<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> and became [[Whip (politics)|Chief Whip]] of the Labour group after a year. His ward had a serious problem with gang violence among the black population, and Daisley's decision to confront the gangs won him local respect.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\" />\n\nDaisley was Labour group leader from 1993 and led the party through the 1994 council elections. The Conservative administration in Brent had reduced the level of [[Council Tax]] charged, and Daisley admitted that his party might have trouble fighting the election because of it; he stressed that the council had also increased charges and rents.<ref>Ian Katz, \"Dancing round a double-edged sword\", ''The Guardian'', 4 May 1994, p. 6.</ref> Although the Conservatives did not win an overall majority, their administration continued. Daisley became Leader of the Council in April 1996, when the death of a Conservative councillor placed the Conservatives in a minority;<ref>\"Tories lose Brent council\", ''The Guardian'', 23 April 1996, p. 7.</ref> he negotiated a deal with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] group which allowed Labour to gain control with the casting vote of the Mayor.<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> After taking control Daisley reorganised the council's internal organisation so that departments were no longer failing. Labour won an overall majority in the 1998 elections.<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" />\n\nAs Leader, Daisley took on the role of tackling the crime problems of his borough, declaring that \"thanks to the evil activities of a handful of people Harlesden has a reputation as a bad and fearful place\" and the time had come \"to take a stand against the gangsters who are a menace on our streets\". He put up a series of controversial posters with the slogan \"[[Young, Gifted and Black|Young, gifted and dead]]\",<ref>Diane Taylor, \"Hard-hitting campaign targets gun crime\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2001, p. 8.</ref> and set up street crime patrols modelled on those in New York which were briefed by [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] officers  and based at local police stations. He received praise for tackling crime from the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]], Sir [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|John Stevens]].<ref name=\"Times obituary\" /> Daisley was initially sceptical about the redevelopment of [[Wembley Stadium]], although the election of [[Ken Livingstone]] as Mayor of London led to a change of mind in May 2000.<ref>\"Mayor breaks Wembley impasse\", ''Sunday Times'', 7 May 2000, p. 8.</ref> When the council granted planning permission for the redevelopment, it insisted on a [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990#Section 106|legal agreement]] requiring substantial payments for improvements; Daisley became unpopular with the Football Association for taking this stance.<ref name=\"Times obituary\" />\n\nLong before legislation required it, Daisley made the council set up a Standards Committee and bring in a code of practice for councillors; he set up a special website for audits and investigations and encouraged residents to report suspected fraud. By the end of his term Daisley was sometimes referred to as 'the man who had put the \"r\" back into Brent', a statement referring to the frequent nickname 'Bent' used by ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' due to the council's association with corruption.<ref name=\"Times obituary\" />\n\n==Selection for Parliament==\nDespite being described a 'Blairite', Daisley supported the Mayoral campaign of [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]] MP [[Ken Livingstone]] when he fought as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] after being defeated for the official Labour Party nomination. After Livingstone won, Daisley pressed for his readmission into the Labour Party,<ref name=\"Times obituary\" /> on the grounds that Livingstone had \"gone out of his way to be conciliatory\". Livingstone's election as Mayor meant giving up his Parliamentary seat, and Daisley was viewed as one of two front-runners for the nomination (his rival being [[Mary Turner (trade unionist)|Mary Turner]], a leading official of the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] union). Daisley received Livingstone's support in the fierce battle;<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\" /> a dispute about postal votes in the selection had to be taken to the regional party body to be resolved.<ref>Diary, ''The Guardian'', 27 September 2000, p. 22.</ref> Daisley's selection, as a white candidate for a very ethnically mixed constituency, was denounced by the vice-chairman of the Black Socialist Society.<ref name=\"Times obituary\" />\n\n==Parliament and illness==\nIn February 2001 Daisley felt suddenly unwell and was rushed to hospital where an emergency operation removed a tumour in his [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]; he spent six weeks in a coma recovering from the operation. As a result, he was unable to campaign for his own election at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> Despite his absence, Daisley was elected with a majority of 13,047, retaining the same percentage majority which Ken Livingstone, who had personally campaigned for him, had previously obtained.<ref>\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons June 2001\", Times Books, 2001, p. 97.</ref> He did not attend Parliament to take the oath of allegiance until 14 September,<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2001/sep/14/members-sworn Hansard]'', HC 6ser vol 362 col 603.</ref> during an emergency debate on the recent [[September 11 attacks]], the last member to take the oath in 2001, and made his [[maiden speech]] on 1 February 2002 (the last of the 2001 intake to do so). This would be his only spoken contribution to the House of Commons. Having regained his mobility after some months using a wheelchair, Daisley paid tribute to the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] staff who had helped him, before speaking about the role of local authorities in helping disadvantaged areas.<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2002/feb/01/disadvantaged-areas#2002-02-01T09:52:00Z Hansard]'', HC 6ser vol 379 cols 1160-2.</ref>\n\nDaisley's weight had fallen to seven and a half stone at the time of his treatment, and it was slowly recovering through 2002. However, in November a new cancer was discovered,<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> and despite further surgery Daisley was told by his doctors that it was terminal. His colleague [[Barry Gardiner]], MP for [[Brent North (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent North]], announced the prognosis to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on the last sitting day before Christmas.<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2002/dec/19/adjournment-christmas#column_1092 Hansard]'', HC 6ser vol 396 cols 1092-3.</ref> He died from [[colorectal cancer]] aged 45 on 18 June 2003.\n\nIt would be 12 years until Labour held the seat again, because in the [[2003 Brent East by-election|September 2003 by-election]], following Daisley's death, the seat was gained by 29-year old [[Sarah Teather]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The [[Opposition to the Iraq War|anti-Iraq War vote]] played a key part in gaining the seat. At the time Teather became the youngest MP in the Commons and held the seat and its successor seat of [[Brent Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent Central]] until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], when she stood down and Labour took the seat back again.\n\n==Memorials==\nIn memory of Daisley, the Paul Daisley Trust was established in 2003 to raise awareness of colon cancer and to encourage early diagnosis.

He spent many days at his grandparents' home in [[Hallaton]] in [[Leicestershire]].<ref name=\"Independent obituary\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/paul-daisley-548297.html |title=Paul Daisley |last=Gardiner |first=Barry |authorlink=Barry Gardiner |date=20 June 2003 |accessdate=6 March 2011 |location=London |work=The Independent}}</ref> He went to Littlemore School in [[Littlemore]], south [[Oxford]] then [[Abingdon and Witney College|Abingdon College]] in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], where he met his future wife. He worked as an Accounting Officer for [[Texaco]] from 1976\u201384.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\" /> In 1984 he set up his own management consultancy and quality assurance company, Daisley Associates, together with his father; he was formally Director of Finance and Administration for the company.<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" />\n\nWhile at Texaco in 1979, Daisley had joined the [[Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs]] and became an active trade unionist; he joined the Labour Party in 1982 in Lewisham, feeling that \"it needed all the help it could get\". Daisley was to become a leading local supporter of [[Neil Kinnock]].<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> He married Lesley Jordan in 1984,<ref name=\"Times obituary\">\"Paul Daisley\" (obituary), ''The Times'', 19 June 2003, p. 34.</ref> and the two moved to Sudbury Avenue in the [[London Borough of Brent]].<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" />\n\n==Local government==\nAt the 1986 local elections, Daisley was an unsuccessful candidate in the then safe Conservative ward<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> of Sudbury Court.<ref>\"London Borough Council Election Results, 8 May 1986\", London Residuary Body, 1986, p. 14.</ref> Highly critical of the Labour administration that won the election, Daisley worked together with likeminded colleagues to rebuild the party. Although Labour lost control in the 1990 local elections, Daisley was elected as a councillor for [[Harlesden]] ward.<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> and became [[Whip (politics)|Chief Whip]] of the Labour group after a year. His ward had a serious problem with gang violence among the black population, and Daisley's decision to confront the gangs won him local respect.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\" />\n\nDaisley was Labour group leader from 1993 and led the party through the 1994 council elections. The Conservative administration in Brent had reduced the level of [[Council Tax]] charged, and Daisley admitted that his party might have trouble fighting the election because of it; he stressed that the council had also increased charges and rents.<ref>Ian Katz, \"Dancing round a double-edged sword\", ''The Guardian'', 4 May 1994, p. 6.</ref> Although the Conservatives did not win an overall majority, their administration continued. Daisley became Leader of the Council in April 1996, when the death of a Conservative councillor placed the Conservatives in a minority;<ref>\"Tories lose Brent council\", ''The Guardian'', 23 April 1996, p. 7.</ref> he negotiated a deal with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] group which allowed Labour to gain control with the casting vote of the Mayor.<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> After taking control Daisley reorganised the council's internal organisation so that departments were no longer failing. Labour won an overall majority in the 1998 elections.<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" />\n\nAs Leader, Daisley took on the role of tackling the crime problems of his borough, declaring that \"thanks to the evil activities of a handful of people Harlesden has a reputation as a bad and fearful place\" and the time had come \"to take a stand against the gangsters who are a menace on our streets\". He put up a series of controversial posters with the slogan \"[[Young, Gifted and Black|Young, gifted and dead]]\",<ref>Diane Taylor, \"Hard-hitting campaign targets gun crime\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2001, p. 8.</ref> and set up street crime patrols modelled on those in New York which were briefed by [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] officers  and based at local police stations. He received praise for tackling crime from the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]], Sir [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|John Stevens]].<ref name=\"Times obituary\" /> Daisley was initially sceptical about the redevelopment of [[Wembley Stadium]], although the election of [[Ken Livingstone]] as Mayor of London led to a change of mind in May 2000.<ref>\"Mayor breaks Wembley impasse\", ''Sunday Times'', 7 May 2000, p. 8.</ref> When the council granted planning permission for the redevelopment, it insisted on a [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990#Section 106|legal agreement]] requiring substantial payments for improvements; Daisley became unpopular with the Football Association for taking this stance.<ref name=\"Times obituary\" />\n\nLong before legislation required it, Daisley made the council set up a Standards Committee and bring in a code of practice for councillors; he set up a special website for audits and investigations and encouraged residents to report suspected fraud. By the end of his term Daisley was sometimes referred to as 'the man who had put the \"r\" back into Brent', a statement referring to the frequent nickname 'Bent' used by ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' due to the council's association with corruption.<ref name=\"Times obituary\" />\n\n==Selection for Parliament==\nDespite being described a 'Blairite', Daisley supported the Mayoral campaign of [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]] MP [[Ken Livingstone]] when he fought as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] after being defeated for the official Labour Party nomination. After Livingstone won, Daisley pressed for his readmission into the Labour Party,<ref name=\"Times obituary\" /> on the grounds that Livingstone had \"gone out of his way to be conciliatory\". Livingstone's election as Mayor meant giving up his Parliamentary seat, and Daisley was viewed as one of two front-runners for the nomination (his rival being [[Mary Turner (trade unionist)|Mary Turner]], a leading official of the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] union). Daisley received Livingstone's support in the fierce battle;<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\" /> a dispute about postal votes in the selection had to be taken to the regional party body to be resolved.<ref>Diary, ''The Guardian'', 27 September 2000, p. 22.</ref> Daisley's selection, as a white candidate for a very ethnically mixed constituency, was denounced by the vice-chairman of the Black Socialist Society.<ref name=\"Times obituary\" />\n\n==Parliament and illness==\nIn February 2001 Daisley felt suddenly unwell and was rushed to hospital where an emergency operation removed a tumour in his [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]; he spent six weeks in a coma recovering from the operation. As a result, he was unable to campaign for his own election at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> Despite his absence, Daisley was elected with a majority of 13,047, retaining the same percentage majority which Ken Livingstone, who had personally campaigned for him, had previously obtained.<ref>\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons June 2001\", Times Books, 2001, p. 97.</ref> He did not attend Parliament to take the oath of allegiance until 14 September,<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2001/sep/14/members-sworn Hansard]'', HC 6ser vol 362 col 603.</ref>, during an emergency debate on the recent [[September 11 attacks]], the last member to take the oath in 2001, and made his [[maiden speech]] on 1 February 2002 (the last of the 2001 intake to do so). This would be his only spoken contribution to the House of Commons. Having regained his mobility after some months using a wheelchair, Daisley paid tribute to the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] staff who had helped him, before speaking about the role of local authorities in helping disadvantaged areas.<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2002/feb/01/disadvantaged-areas#2002-02-01T09:52:00Z Hansard]'', HC 6ser vol 379 cols 1160-2.</ref>\n\nDaisley's weight had fallen to seven and a half stone at the time of his treatment, and it was slowly recovering through 2002. However, in November a new cancer was discovered,<ref name=\"Independent obituary\" /> and despite further surgery Daisley was told by his doctors that it was terminal. His colleague [[Barry Gardiner]], MP for [[Brent North (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent North]], announced the prognosis to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on the last sitting day before Christmas.<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/2002/dec/19/adjournment-christmas#column_1092 Hansard]'', HC 6ser vol 396 cols 1092-3.</ref> He died from [[colorectal cancer]] aged 45 on 18 June 2003. \n\nIt would be 12 years until Labour held the seat again, because in the [[2003 Brent East by-election|September 2003 by-election]], following Daisley's death, the seat was gained by 29-year old [[Sarah Teather]] of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The [[Opposition to the Iraq War|anti-Iraq War vote]] played a key part in gaining the seat. At the time Teather became the youngest MP in the Commons and held the seat and it's successor seat of [[Brent Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent Central]] until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], when she stood down and Labour took the seat back again.\n\n==Memorials==\nIn memory of Daisley, the Paul Daisley Trust was established in 2003 to raise awareness of colon cancer and to encourage early diagnosis.

English Electric had already been successful with orders for type 1 and type 4 diesels, and had produced locomotives of similar power for railways in East Africa.

Many of the original locomotives were fitted with [[Steam generator (railroad)|boilers for steam heating]]. D6700-6754 were fitted with boilers from new, along with D6758, D6775, D6781-D6818, D6875-D6892. D6960-6968 received boilers from D6701-6709 during 1967/68. 37247 was fitted with a boiler in 1977. With the withdrawal of many Type 2 and Type 3 locomotives in the 1980s the 37s were selected as the standard Type 3 and many of the fleet were given a heavy overhaul to prolong their life into the 1990s and beyond. Some were fitted with [[Head end power|electrical train heating]] (ETH) equipment in the 1980s to become the 37/4 sub-class, initially for use on the [[West Highland Line]], the [[Welsh Marches line]] and South Wales - Bristol area services and [[Far North Line]]s but later seeing use in north/mid Wales and occasionally the West Country. In 2010, they were used on passenger services on the [[Cumbrian Coast line]] and [[Wherry lines]].\n\n=== Rebuilding ===\nA number of locomotives were rebuilt as Class 37/9s in the late 1980s to evaluate [[Blackstone & Co|Mirrlees]] and [[Ruston & Hornsby|Ruston]] engines for possible use on a new [[List of British Rail unbuilt locomotive classes#Type 3 locomotives|Class 38]] freight locomotive. These 'Slugs' were heavily ballasted to improve traction and had excellent load-hauling capabilities, but the Class 38, understood to be a 'modular' locomotive based on the approach that gave rise to the [[British Rail Class 58|Class 58]] diesel loco and the proposed [[List of British Rail unbuilt locomotive classes#Electric locomotives|Class 88]] electric loco, was never built.\n\n=== Axle load ===\n[[File:Class 37 cab.jpg|right|thumb|Cab interior of loco no. 37052]]\nThe Class 37 has a relatively low axle loading for its size and power. With the withdrawal of most of the smaller types of diesel locomotive, this left it as the only mainline type available in significant numbers for lines with weight restrictions, and for a number of years 37s handled almost all locomotive-hauled services on the West Highland Line, the lines north of [[Inverness railway station|Inverness]] ([[Far North Line]]) and in parts of [[Wales]]. The Class 37 has [[Route Availability]] 5 and this is one of the main reasons it is still in use on the network.  Note that class 37/7 and 37/9 have an RA of 7 due to their extra ballast weights.\n\n=== Regional variations ===\nThere are several differences between particular locomotives, some of them easily seen. Western Region Class 37s can be identified by 'cow horns' around halfway up on the outer edge of each end of the lamp brackets. When British Railways took over from the [[Great Western Railway]] the use of Great Western lamps continued. Their brackets used an L-shaped upright that was parallel to the direction of travel, unlike the other regions which used transverse brackets. Another difference between the regions is by the nose end headcodes. Lower-numbered, split-box Class 37s were allocated to northern England and east Anglia; centre-box locomotives were almost all allocated to Wales and the south west. After locomotives were transferred between pools in the 1980s they tended to stray from their original depots. Regional decorations included the Highland ([[Inverness TMD|Inverness]]) Stag, the Cockney Sparrow ([[Stratford TMD|Stratford]]) the Cornish lizard ([[St Blazey engine shed|St Blazey]]) and [[Eastfield TMD|Eastfield]] Highland Terrier. All the [[Cardiff Canton TMD|Cardiff Canton]] Class 37/4s received Celtic Dragons below the driver's window whilst in large logo blue. Some Scottish locomotives were later fitted with small Saltire flags by their TOPS data panels or on their noses in a similar fashion to the HAA hoppers allocated to Scottish power stations.\n\n=== British Rail liveries ===\nOn delivery, the Class 37s were painted in plain green with a grey roof, the 'late' (post-1956) British Railways crest and a D prefix to their running number. Some locomotives were delivered as the small yellow warning panel was introduced, earlier locomotives being given these panels during works visits. Towards the late 1960s, the yellow was extended to the full height of the nose.\n\nBy the 1970s, all locomotives had received all over British Rail blue with a full yellow nose; by 1975 most locomotives had also received their [[TOPS]] numbers. Their livery remained the same until the early 1980s when 'Large Logo blue' was introduced. This entailed the yellow nose continuing round to behind the driver's door and up to the top of the windscreen and a full height 'double arrow' logo. These locomotives had the top of the nose painted black to lower the risk of the driver being dazzled by the sun. Freight-allocated examples received a similar livery - the only difference being the blue was replaced by freight grey. In 1987, the Sectors were launched, incorporating a new livery of 'three tone grey'; a light grey lower bodyside, medium grey cantrail and a dark grey roof, along with a bright Sector logo (Coal, Metals, Petroleum, Distribution, General and Construction). In addition a metal double arrow logo was fitted. This livery co-existed with plain blue, large logo blue/grey and the new [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] and [[Regional Railways]] liveries right up to the end of British Rail in 1996.\n\n[[File:37891 British Rail class 37 diesel loco.jpg|thumb|37 891 with [[Mainline Freight]] branding at [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]]]]\nSome locomotives in the 'sectorised company' pools received [[Transrail Freight]] logos or [[Mainline Freight]] 'Rolling Balls' over their 3TG (three tone grey) colours, while [[Loadhaul]] locomotives were painted orange and black and Mainline locomotives received 'aircraft' blue with silver stripes. Departmental locomotives were initially painted in a plain grey livery, but this didn't find favour and was modified into 'Dutch' grey and yellow livery, similar to that of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]]. 37 093 was mocked up as a \"police\" locomotive which pulled over a [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|Class 43 HST power car]] for speeding in an [[InterCity 125]] advert broadcast in the 1980s.\n\n== TOPS renumbering ==\n{{main|British Rail Class 37 renumbering}}\nAs with many diesel classes, the [[TOPS]] renumbering was implemented in a straightforward manner, with the locomotive numbers remaining in sequence. Thus 6701 became 37001 and D6999 became 37299; while D6600 - D6608 became 37300 - 37308. The remaining locomotive, D6700 became 37119 instead of D6819 which became 37283 (redundant number as D6983 was destroyed in an accident in 1965).<ref>[http://www.greywall.demon.co.uk/rail/37.html ENGLISH ELECTRIC CLASS 37 Renumbering the type 3s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628085538/http://www.greywall.demon.co.uk/rail/37.html |date=28 June 2008 }}</ref>  As members of the class were altered later in their careers, they were renumbered, some more than once.\n\nD6983 was withdrawn in December 1965 following a fatal collision with a derailed [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]], number D1671, in South Wales, near [[Bridgend]] as the result of a landslip. D6983 was the first EE Type 3 to be withdrawn and as a result, the only locomotive in the entire class not to receive a TOPS number. The remains of both locomotives were sold to local scrap merchants, R.S. Hayes, and cut up the following year.<ref>{{cite book | last = Morrison | first = Brian | title = The Power of the 37s | publisher = Oxford Publishing Co| year=  1981 | location = Oxford }}</ref>\n\n== Sub-classes ==\nIn the 1980s the Class 37 locomotives were extensively refurbished - from that point 37/0 refers to the original version. The work took place at [[British Rail Engineering Limited]]'s [[Crewe Works]] except for the 37/3 subclass whose bogies were replaced at various depots.<ref name=\"rc37\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Sub-class\n!align=left|Description\n|-\n|37/0\n|Locomotives which remained unmodified after other sub-classes were created\n|-\n|37/3\n|Locomotives which were rebogied but not refurbished\n|-\n|37/4\n|Refurbished, rewired, English Electric generator replaced with Brush alternator, electric train supply (ETS) fitted\n|-\n|37/5\n|Refurbished, rewired, English Electric generator replaced with [[Brush Traction]] alternator\n|-\n|37/6\n|Locomotives from Class 37/5 further modified with through ETS wiring and RCH jumper cables\n|-\n|37/7\n|Refurbished, rewired, English Electric generator replaced with [[General Electric Company|GEC]] G564AZ or Brush alternator,<ref name=\"rc37\"/> additional weight added\n|-\n|37/9\n|Refurbished, rewired, English Electric generator replaced with Brush alternator, new engines: [[Blackstone & Co|Mirrlees]] MB275Tt or [[Ruston & Hornsby|Ruston]] RK270Tt<ref name=\"rc37\"/>\n|}\n\n===Class 37/0===\n[[File:37 263 at Didcot.jpg|thumb|left|37263 at [[Didcot Parkway railway station|Didcot]]]]\nThis designation covered all 309 locomotives as built, but with such a large number of locomotives and with two companies involved in the building, there were several differences within this sub-class alone. The most visible external difference was that the first 119 locos had a \"split\" headcode box; for these locos the four digit [[Train reporting number]] was shown in two square boxes containing two digits and separated by a pair of doors designed to allow the train crew to be exchanged while in motion. Later locomotives had a single centrally placed headcode box, and also had the horns mounted on the roof rather than built into the nose of the locomotive. This difference was the reason for the double change in numbers when implementing the [[TOPS]] scheme described earlier.\n\n===Class 37/3===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}\n[[File:37 371 at Eastleigh.jpg|thumb|37371 at [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]]]]\nThere were two incarnations of a 37/3 subclass. The first was a group of 12 [[Motherwell TMD|Motherwell]] allocated locos that were fitted with strengthened couplings and modified brake blocks for working the heavy trains to [[Ravenscraig]]. These were all renumbered back to their original numbers by the end of 1988.\n\nThe second set of locos were rebogied at various depots with the regeared cast frame type 'CP7 Bogie'. Bogies from the English Electric [[British Rail Class 55|Deltics]], [[British Rail Class 50|Class 50]] and Class 37s are largely interchangeable with only modification to traction motor gearing, to {{convert|80|mph}} in the case of the 37s, and access step positions needing alteration between the classes. The fuel capacity was doubled by using the redundant train heating boiler water tanks but no other changes were made.<ref>[http://www.thejunction.org.uk/cl37.html Rolling stock : class 37, English Electric/BR] ''thejunction.org.uk''</ref>\n\n===Class 37/4===\n[[File:BR Class 37 37 409.jpg|thumb|left|BR Class 37/4 37 409 ''Loch Awe'' at {{stn|Fort William}} in 1989]]\nWith ETH ([[Electric Train Heating]]) replacing 'steam heated' coaches, some of this class received ETH Supply when refurbished at [[Crewe Works]] during 1985 and 1986. During this refurbishment, the locomotives also received regeared CP7 [[bogies]] and the English electric generator was replaced with a [[Brush Traction|Brush]] BA1005A [[alternator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railfaneurope.net/pix/picmonth/1997-12.html |title=The European Railway Picture Gallery Class 37/4 data sheet |publisher=Railfaneurope.net |date=13 May 1965 |accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref> Extensive re-wiring, as well as a full repaint into [[British Rail corporate liveries#Moving away from Rail Blue|BR Large Logo]] was undertaken. The modifications allowed the rebuilt locomotives to work passenger trains all year round, with the 31 strong fleet being split between [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], Scotland receiving the first 25 and Wales the other six.\n\nAfter the extensive refurbishment, the locomotives were allocated the 37/4 sub-class, following the trend of renumbering 'ETH' fitted locomotives xx/4s, (e.g. 47 4xx and 31 4xx).\n\nThe next chapter saw the entire sub-class pass to [[Transrail Freight]], which was one of the three regional [[Freight operating company|freight operating companies]] prior to the privatisation of the entire British Rail network.\n\nOver the years, the locomotives have received a large number of liveries: BR Green, [[Regional Railways#Livery|Regional Railways]], Trainload Grey, [[DB Cargo UK|EWS]] maroon, [[Transrail Freight]], BR Large Logo and Mainline, to name a few.\n\nThe [[Cambrian line|Cambrian]], [[North Wales Coast Line|North Wales Coast]], [[Rhymney line|Rhymney]], [[West Highland Line|West Highland]], [[South Wales Main Line|South Wales]] and [[West of England Main Line|West Country]] all benefited from the use of 37/4s.\n\nLocomotive hauled operations have taken a big hit within the past couple of years, thanks to the widespread introduction of diesel multiple units, and the replacement of loco hauled trains by multiple units, although the sub-class did hold out on the [[Rhymney line|Cardiff - Rhymney]] trains for [[Arriva Trains Wales]] latterly. 37411 and 37425 were painted especially to mark the end of loco hauled service on the line in April 2005, these repaints being funded by Arriva.\n\nIn late 2010, [[DB Cargo UK|DB Schenker]] put all of its remaining 37/4s up for sale with many examples expected to be sold for scrap. DRS has since bought the remaining class 37/4s as of April 2011.<ref>Rail Express April 2011</ref> The DRS ones are currently (Summer 2017) used on Northern services on the Cumbrian Coast and on local Anglian services from Norwich.\n\n===Class 37/5===\n[[File:37 667 BR diesel locomotive.jpg|thumb|37 667, Class 37/5 at [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]]]]\nThis class were updated in similar fashion to the 37/4 subclass, except that they did not receive Electric Train Heating and some were fitted with Sandite ports. Locomotives previously numbered between 37001 and 37119 (those which had split headcode boxes) were given new numbers from 37501 upwards; those previously numbered between 37120 and 37308 were renumbered from 37699 downwards (locomotives 37601-37612 were Class 37/6, not Class 37/5).\n\n===Class 37/6===\n[[File:37603 and 37604 At Clapham Junction.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Eurostar]] 37/6 types at [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]]]]\n[[Eurostar]] (at the time European Passenger Services) had 12 locomotives modified (all ex-37/5) as Class 37/6, with the intention that they would haul overnight international trains (\"[[Nightstar (train)|Nightstar]]\") over the non-electrified sections of their routes in Britain. However, these services were never introduced, and, in 1997, Eurostar sold six of its locomotives to [[Direct Rail Services]] (DRS), with a further three sold in 2000. The remaining three locomotives were retained by Eurostar for a variety of tasks, including driver training, route learning, and for rescuing failed [[British Rail Class 373|Class 373]] units. Once Eurostar moved its operations to its new depot at [[Temple Mills TMD|Temple Mills]], its Class 37 locomotives became redundant and they too were sold to DRS in 2007.  DRS has subsequently sold some of them, [[Europhoenix]] being the principal recipient.  The Europhoenix 37/6s are used on test trains and will soon be used to haul EMUs to and from works.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Class 37/7===\n[[File:37710 stabled at Didcot Yard.JPG|thumb| [[Loadhaul]] liveried 37/7 type]]\nThe Class 37/7 sub-class is intended primarily for heavy freight work.\n\nAgain, as part of the major refurbishment scheme of the Class 37 locomotives in the 1980s, another freight dedicated fleet of 44 Class 37s was created; the Class 37/7 subclass which was very similar to the 37/5 subclass except for plating over of a bodyside window and the addition of a ballast weight to give extra 'pulling power' when hauling heavy freight trains such as the metals trains in South Wales. Again, like the 37/5s, there were two batches completed; from phase 1 and phase 2 Class 37/0 locos. The batch numbered 37701 upwards were from phase 1 build locos and have the flush front ends and the batch numbered from 37899 downwards were rebuilds from phase 2 locos, having the central headcode box (plated over). A further complication was created; locos numbered 37796-37803 had a different type of electrical equipment fitted (Brush) as part of a trial and differ from the other locos in the subclass internally.\n\nIn British Rail use, the sub-class were particularly common in South Wales on heavy coal and metals work. They were particularly adept at working coal trains up and down the short but steeply graded branch lines around Swansea and Cardiff to collieries such as Tower Colliery, Coedbach and Cwmbargoed. They operated [[merry-go-round train]]s of 32-ton HAA air-braked hoppers, usually numbering 32 wagons, between collieries, washeries, open cast mines and disposal points to power stations such as Aberthaw and occasionally further afield.\n\nTheir use on Metals Sector trains, usually from Llanwern, Port Talbot or English metal works such as Scunthorpe, saw them hauling incredibly heavy trains between docks, works and purchasers in Britain. Indeed, the use of three Class 37/0 locomotives on Llanwern-Port Talbot Docks steel trains (the heaviest on the British rail network at {{convert|3300|LT}} was soon abandoned when Class 37/7s became available, requiring only two locomotives. Cardiff had a large allocation of 37/7s, some waiting on standby, ready for a call from the mills requiring more wagons to handle any extra traffic. Eventually this work was taken over by [[British Rail Class 56|Class 56s]] and [[British Rail Class 60|Class 60s]]. This Metals traffic would also become the domain of the sub-class 37/9, which to all intents and purposes was a 37/7 but with a different [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]].\n\nWhen [[DB Cargo UK|EWS]] introduced its 250 [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66s]] from 1998, many of the sub-class were put into store. Some have since been involved in construction work in France and Spain building new high-speed lines. 15 were sent to Spain; an additional two were sent to Italy.\n\nEWS has been selling off the sub-class. Four were purchased by [[West Coast Railways]] for overhaul and main line charters; these are 37706, 37710, 37712 and 37717. 37717 has since been sold for scrap while 37712 returned to traffic before a serious internal fire.\n\n=== Class 37/9 ===\n[[file:37906 at Cardiff on 22-07-91 (7716517456) John Pease.jpg|thumb|right|37906 at Cardiff Central in July 1991.]]\nIn 1986, four Class 37s, numbers 150/148/249/124, were converted to test the [[Mirrlees Blackstone|Mirrlees]] MB275T engine<ref name=\"RE63-55\">{{cite magazine|title=Enter the Super 'Syphons'|magazine=[[Rail (magazine)|Rail Enthusiast]]|publisher=EMAP National Publications|date=December 1986|issue=63|pp=55\u201357|issn=0262-561X|oclc=49957965}}</ref> and [[Brush Traction|Brush]] alternator for the proposed [[List of British Rail unbuilt locomotive classes|Class 38]], and were numbered 37901\u2013904. These were followed in 1987 by 37905/6, converted from 37136/206, and fitted with the alternative pairing of a [[Ruston & Hornsby|Ruston]] RK270T engine and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] alternator.<ref name=\"RE63-55\" /> All six locomotives were fitted with new bogies, and had ballast weights to increase their overall weight to 120 [[Long ton|tons]]. Although intended as a testbed for the Class 38, the two power units fitted were those considered for the [[British Rail Class 60|Class 60]], which was eventually delivered with an enlarged version of the Mirrlees MB275T. They all had modifications similar to that of Class 37/7, including new nose grilles, removal of the central bodyside windows and 4 fire extinguisher ports. However, 37901-904 had a heavily modified central roof section, consisting of flat panels rather than the curved sheets of the original. All 6 had a new exhaust port fitted, replacing the two of the original design.\n\nAll six Class 37/9s were delivered in Railfreight Grey livery, later receiving 3TG metals sub sector livery, and operated as part of the British Rail Heavy Metals sector, being based in [[South Wales]] and hauling trains normally rostered for the much more powerful [[British Rail Class 56|Class 56]] such as the [[Port Talbot Steelworks]] - Llanwern Iron Ore tipplers.<ref>{{cite magazine  | last = Banks  | first = Alan  | title = Masterclass : BR Class 37/9s  |magazine=Model Rail  | issue = 111  | pages =18\u201324  | publisher = EMAP active Ltd  | location = Peterborough  |date=December 2007  }}</ref> During the late 1990s, use of the Class 37/9s declined due to availability of the newer and more powerful [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66s]] and problems maintaining such a small number of non-standard locos, with all six officially designated as being in storage in 1999.\n\nThis was not, however, the end of the sub-class. In July 2000, 37906 was designated as part of the EWS heritage fleet but has since been sold into preservation, joining 37901 and 37905. 37902 was sold to [[Direct Rail Services]] in 2003, but was scrapped and cut up in 2005 after a review by DRS. 37904 was cut up at [[CF Booth]]'s in [[Rotherham]] in November 2004 and 37903 was scrapped at [[Crewe Diesel TMD]] in April 2005.\n\n==Operations==\n\n===British Rail===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}\n\nDuring the time of British Rail, the Class 37s found use on both passenger and freight workings, being one of the mainstays of the BR fleet. While freight use was widespread, passenger work was predominantly in the [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]] with use on [[Liverpool Street railway station|London]] - [[Norwich railway station|Norwich]] and [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]]/[[King's Lynn railway station|King's Lynn]] services, the latter through to the 1980s and in West Wales on services west of [[Swansea railway station|Swansea]] to [[Fishguard Harbour railway station|Fishguard Harbour]], [[Milford Haven railway station|Milford Haven]] and [[Pembroke Dock railway station|Pembroke Dock]].  Darnall's (later [[Tinsley TMD|Tinsley's]]) 37s were used on various passenger services in the Sheffield area, notably the [[Pullman train (UK)|Pullman]] service to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]]. Hull Dairycoates' 37s were used on local stopping services as well as on King's Cross portions down to [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, the remaining steam-heat capable locomotives gravitated to Scotland, eventually replacing both [[British Rail Class 27|Class 27s]] on the [[West Highland Line]] and [[British Rail Class 26|Class 26s]] on the [[Far North Line|Far North]] and [[Kyle of Lochalsh line|Kyle of Lochalsh]] lines. However, their use became tricky once ETH-fitted [[British Rail Mark 2|Mark 2]] and [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] coaches moved north. The sleeper trains were a particular problem. To this end, steam-heat 37/0s were coupled to ETHELs (Electric Train Heating Ex-Locomotive - essentially [[British Rail Class 25|Class 25s]] with isolated traction motors that provided [[Head End Power|Electric Train Heating]]) which provided the necessary power to run them.\n\nClass 37s were subject to several modifications during their time in service. One short-lived experiment involved 37175 receiving CP5 'self-steering bogies' designed to reduce excess wear and noise on the tightly-curved West Highland line to [[Fort William railway station|Fort William]] and [[Mallaig railway station|Mallaig]]. This however, proved too expensive to be practicable. Some [[Inverness TMD|Inverness]] allocated Class 37s received 'car lights'; these were essentially spotlights that made them more visible on the sharply curved Scottish branches, especially to users of level crossings. These were eventually either removed or superseded by the modern 'sealed beam' lights that became compulsory from 1993. Other classes fitted with these or similar lights were [[British Rail Class 24|Class 24s]], [[British Rail Class 26|Class 26s]], [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47s]] and a solitary [[British Rail Class 86|Class 86]] 86225.\n\nThe other notable use was of nominally freight locomotives to [[Aberystwyth railway station|Aberystwyth]] over the Cambrian line, in this case taking over from [[British Rail Class 25|Class 25s]] on the holiday trains.\n\nFrom 1985, the 37/4 subclass took over on the Scottish lines although the use of original 37/0s continued in the summer when train supply was not required. The Welsh allocation in turn took over from the 37/0s on the Cambrian as well as from [[British Rail Class 33|Class 33s]] on [[Crewe railway station|Crewe]] - [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]] workings. They were also used on the [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]] - Cardiff/Swansea leg of services from [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station|Portsmouth Harbour]] and later on the [[Heart of Wessex line]].\n\nOver time they were displaced from most passenger work by new build DMUs such as the ''[[Sprinter (train)|Sprinter]]'' units, though they still found work in the summer and on secondary services from time to time through the 1990s as traffic demand required. This saw use both on the North Wales Coast and, most remarkably, [[Rhymney line|Cardiff - Rhymney]] local services through to 2006.  In Scotland after being displaced from the West Highland and far north routes, 37/4s were used on two diagrams on the [[Inverness railway station|Inverness]] - [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] route for several years as well as being used to Kyle of Lochalsh in the summer and on Inverness - [[Aberdeen railway station|Aberdeen]] services. The final daily work in Scotland was the Fort William ''[[Caledonian Sleeper]]'', this ending in June 2006.\n\nTheir freight work similarly reduced, being displaced by higher powered locomotives such as the [[British Rail Class 56|Class 56]] and [[British Rail Class 58|Class 58]] locomotives on coal trains, though they continued on other cargos such as oil tankers for longer.\n\n===Post privatisation===\nIn the 1980s many locomotives were refurbished, which has meant the Class 37 fleet is one of the longest surviving classes on British railways. However, the introduction of new [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66]] locomotives has meant many 37s have been withdrawn or scrapped. [[DB Cargo|English Welsh & Scottish]] and [[Direct Rail Services]] operated small fleets, with several other examples also operated by spot-hire companies. However, second-hand Class 37s have also proved popular in the export market, with some examples operating in Spain and France, serving the construction of those countries' high-speed railway networks. As of 2019, examples of the class are still in mainline service despite being more than 50 years old.\n\n====Colas Rail====\n[[Colas Rail]] owns ex-preservation 37057, 37099, 37116, 37175, 37219, 37254, 37421, all currently operational. 37175 and 37219 are being used in 2014 Rail Head Treatment Trains working off Kings Norton but in 2015, Colas Class 47s (47727 and 47739) are on this duty.\n\nAdditionally, Colas purchased 37146, 37188 and 37207 with the intention of returning them to main line duty but as of November 2017 37146 and 37188 are unlikely to receive their intended overhaul and are expected to be sold or used as parts donors.\n\nBetween July 2019 and March 2020, 3 Colas Rail class 37s, 37025/418/421, operated peak time loco-hauled services on the [[Rhymney line|Rhymney Line]] with 8 mark 2 carriages,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2019-07-03/50-year-old-loco-drafted-in-to-cope-with-demand-in-the-rhymney-valley/|title=54-year-old loco drafted in to cope with demand in the Rhymney Valley|website=ITV News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> the first passenger loco-hauled services on the route since 2005, due to a lack of rolling stock caused by the 2-year delay on the class 769 that was scheduled to run services on the route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/class-37s-to-stay-in-wales-into-2020|title=Class 37s to stay in Wales into 2020?|website=www.railmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n====Direct Rail Services====\n[[File:37038 at Crewe Works.jpg|thumb|right|Class 37/0 in [[Direct Rail Services]] livery at [[Crewe Works]] in June 2003)]]\n[[Direct Rail Services]] has a variety of Class 37s operational, and others stored.

Until December 2018 they hauled passenger services on the [[Cumbrian Coast line]] on behalf of [[Northern Rail (Serco-Abellio)|Northern Rail]] until 2016 and then its successor, [[Arriva Rail North|Northern]].\n\n====EWS====\n[[File:37401 fort william.jpg|thumb|[[DB Cargo UK|EWS]] maroon 37401 at [[Fort William railway station|Fort William]]]]\n[[DB Cargo UK|EWS]] usually used Class 37s in pairs, for freight workings. Additionally EWS used the Class 37s on railtours or charter hire to train operating companies. For example, in 2005 Arriva Trains Wales used 37/4 haulage on the Rhymney valley line, from a pool of four locomotives, these locomotives being 37405 (EWS livery), 37425 (BR Large Logo), 37411 (BR green livery), 37419 (EW&S livery), This loco replaced 37408 ''Loch Rannoch'' which was involved in a collision with parked stock at Rhymney sidings, which was suspected to be caused by vandals. 37408 suffered extensive damage and was written off at [[Toton TMD]] with its power unit removed and used to revive 37422. Its body was later scrapped at [[European Metal Recycling]], [[Kingsbury, Warwickshire]].\n\nBy mid-2008, only three EWS Class 37s were still in regular use on the mainline (37401, 417 & 422). 37422 was placed in WNTS tactical store pool in September leaving only 37401 and 417 in traffic. On 16 December, 37417 suffered serious engine failure and was sent to Eastleigh for storage, resulting in 37401 the only Class 37 to remain in traffic into the new DB Schenker era.\n\n====DB Schenker====\n[[File:Weymouth 37670 37401.jpg|thumb|37670 in DB Schenker livery at Weymouth]]\nDB Schenker had one operational Class 37/4, 37401 at the time of its rebranding from EWS on 1 January 2009. DB Schenker also has hired locomotives for temporary duties, such as 37423 from Direct Rail Services (DRS) to cover for failed 37417. DB Schenker 37401 (and DRS's 37423) were on snowplough duty at Inverness for the winter months. 37401, DB Schenker's sole operational English Electric type 3 at the time, was reported sounding rough, and was later stored although this did not last long as it was soon sent to Toton TMD for repairs along with 37406 ''The Saltire Society''.\n\n37401, DB Schenker's most reliable Class 37, was repaired and returned to service. 37406 was returned to service, failing on its first working. 37670 was also returned operational.\n\n37419 was prepared for a return to traffic and saw itself repainted into DB Schenker livery, however its long time in store did not help its power unit and it failed with a serious engine fault on its trial run. The locomotive is now operational with Direct Rail Services.\n\nDB Schenker had the largest route for railhead treatment trains for Autumn 2009 and required Class 37 haulage due to their route availability. Much speculation was surrounding the return of several Class 37s, however DB Schenker were eventually given clearance from Network Rail to use Class 66s and 67s on the routes instead, resulting in the Class 37 plan being ditched despite several of the machines having their air horns moved onto the nose to resolve clearance problems.\n\nReliability problems plagued 37670 during its short time in traffic and the loco was eventually stored unserviceable.\n\nWith the storage of 37670, this meant that once again 37401 was the sole operational Class 37 in active service under DB Schenker. To take the load strain off 37401, 37425 ''Pride of the Valleys'' was fitted with OTMR safety equipment and was returned fully operational. The locomotive retained in BR blue large logo livery, however like 37670 it was also plagued with unreliability.\n\nAs of summer 2010, DB Schenker Rail UK ceased using Class 37s.\n\nIn June 2013, DB Schenker offered six Class 37s for sale: 37703, 37714, 37716, 37718, 37800 and 37884. These had been stored out of use at [[Dollands Moor]] after returning from mainland Europe, where they had been working on the construction of a new high speed line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rail.co.uk/rail-news/2013/more-1960s-redundant-class-37-diesel-locomotives-put-up-for-sale-by-db-schenker/ |title=More 1960s redundant Class 37 diesel locomotives put up for sale by DB Schenker |publisher=Rail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref> 37703 went on hire/loaned (but still owned by Direct Rail Services) to the Scottish Railway Preservation Society, 37703/714/716/718 were bought by Direct Rail Services. 37718 was scrapped at CF Booth, Rotherham in July 2015. 37800 and 37884 were bought by [[Europhoenix]] and once restored to working order, went on long term hire to Rail Operations Group in a dual Europhoenix/ROG livery.\n\n====West Coast Railways====\n[[File:37 706 British Rail class 37 diesel loco.jpg|thumb|[[West Coast Railways]] 37706 approaching Northam Junction]]\n[[West Coast Railways]] (WCR) purchased four locomotives from [[Ian Riley Engineering]] in 2004. The two operational locomotives (nos. 37197 and 37261) were used on charter trains or as standby locomotives for ''The Jacobite'' [[Steam locomotive|steam-hauled]] excursion services from [[Fort William railway station|Fort William]] to [[Mallaig railway station|Mallaig]] during 2005. These two, along with non-operational 37423, have since been sold to DRS. The fourth (no. 37235) was for spares.\n\nIn late 2007, WCR purchased several non-operational Class 37/5 and Class 37/7s from EWS: nos. 37517, 37668, 37676, 37685, 37706, 37712 and 37710. Of the acquired locomotives 37710 will be used as a source of spares, 37676 and 37712 were the first two returned to mainline. 37676 was named ''Loch Rannoch'' at a special event in [[Carnforth]] Steamtown. 37712 suffered a fire on an empty coaching stock move and was subsequently stored. It is known that major work will need to be done on 37712, however demand exists for chartered Class 37s.\n\nBy the end of 2019, WCR had seven Class 37s running in service: nos. 37516, 37518, 37668, 37669, 37676, 37685, 37706 with nos. 37710 as a spare donor and 37517 and 37712 stored.\n\n====Locomotive Services Ltd====\nBy 2019 [[Locomotive Services Limited]] began to acquire a number of class 37s to use alongside their own fleet of [[British Rail Class 47|BR Class 47]]s.

The driver and second man of D1671 died, and damage to both locomotives was extensive enough that even though each locomotive was barely a year old, they were withdrawn and eventually scrapped. D6983 was the first Class 37 withdrawn and the only one of the class not to be renumbered.\n* In January 1988, locomotives No. 37 671 and 37 672 were hauling a freight train that was diverted into a siding at Tavistock Junction, [[Devon]] due to a pointsman's error. The train collided with a wagon, pushed it through the buffers and was derailed.{{sfn|Earnshaw|1993|pp=39, rear cover}}\n\n==Departmental==\n===Network Rail ERTMS project===\n[[Network Rail]] restored four Class 37s as part of the [[European Rail Traffic Management System]] (ERTMS) trial project on the [[Cambrian Line]]. The site of the restoration was the [[Barrow Hill Roundhouse]], where ex-[[Harry Needle Railroad Company|HNRC]] locomotives 37100, 37170, 37178 and 37217 were taken in. The restored Class 37s for ERTMS use were re-designated as [[British Rail Class 97|Class 97/3]], numbered 97301(Since removed due to fault), 97302, 97303 and 97304.<ref>[http://www.wnxx.net/fleetstatus/Fleet_files/sheet010.htm Class 97 Status] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213002015/http://www.wnxx.net/fleetstatus/Fleet_files/sheet010.htm |date=13 February 2009 }} wnxx.com, retrieved on 13 September 2008</ref>\n\nThe class was chosen because of its original fitment with both air and vacuum braking, a feature which will allow them to pull both modern freight trains as well as steam specials. The main work of the locomotives is to pull on-track machines (such as [[ballast tamper|tampers]]) through the ERTMS section.\n\nThe 97/3s are based at the newly constructed [[Shrewsbury TMD|Coleham Depot]] for the duration of the ERTMS testing on the Cambrian Line, thereafter they are used to pilot trains not fitted with the ERTMS signalling system.  They are also used to work Network Rail test trains on other parts of the network when not required for ERTMS testing.\n\nThese locos were effectively refurbished, having been completely stripped down to bare steel, with reconditioned engines, somewhat updated cabs, all new signalling systems installed (ERTMS in this instance) and extensive re-wiring.\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:37901 British Rail diesel loco.jpg|thumb|37901 ''Mirrlees Pioneer'']]\nClass 37 locomotives have proved to be very popular, with many examples saved for preservation on [[heritage railway]]s or by [[railfan|enthusiast]] groups. Notable examples saved include the first-built locomotive, no. D6700, and the last built locomotive 37308.  A number of the class have been sold back out of preservation to mainline operators including [[Blackstone & Co|Mirrlees]]-engined prototype no. 37901, and both [[Ruston & Hornsby|Ruston]]-engined prototypes nos. 37905 and 37906. One locomotive, 37372, has been procured by a group called the [[British Rail Class 23#Preservation|Baby Deltic Project]] for conversion into a replica of a [[British Rail Class 23|Class 23 ''Baby Deltic'']].<ref>[http://www.thebabydelticproject.co.uk/#/the-project/4534194461 The Project] - The Baby Deltic Project</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Pre<br>[[TOPS]]\n!Post<br>TOPS\n!Final\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Owner\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Notes or livery\n|-\n|-\n|align=center|D6607\n|align=center|37307\n|align=center|'''37403'''\n|Isle of Mull\n|Hired to DRS\n|\n|BR Blue Large Logo.\n|-\n|align=center|D6608\n|align=center|'''37308'''\n|align=center|37274\n|\n|\n|Dean Forest Railway<ref group=\"pre\" name=\"x\">[http://www.wnxx.net/fleetstatus/Fleet.htm Fleet status :UK locomotive database - subsection \"31-37\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020214626/http://www.wnxx.net/fleetstatus/Fleet.htm |date=20 October 2007 }} ''wnxx.net''</ref>\n|Sky Blue undercoat\n|-\n|align=center|'''D6700'''\n|align=center|37119\n|align=center|37350\n|(National Railway Museum)\n|[[National Railway Museum]]\n|National Railway Museum\n|First locomotive of class built.<br>[[BR Green]]\n|-\n|align=center|D6703\n|align=center|'''37003'''\n|align=center|\n|no name plates currently carried\n|Class 37 Locomotive Group.<ref name=\"c37lg\" group=\"pre\">{{cite web|url=http://www.c37lg.co.uk |title=Class 37 Locomotive Group |publisher=C37lg.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref>\n|[[Mid Norfolk Railway]] (currently at UKRL Leicester\n|BR Blue\nCurrently undergoing major overhaul at UKRL Leicester as of August 2017.\n|-\n|align=center|D6709\n|align=center|'''37009'''\n|align=center|37340\n|\n|English Electric Preservation\n|[[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)|Great Central Railway (North)]]\n|Undergoing restoration.

Many of the original locomotives were fitted with [[Steam generator (railroad)|boilers for steam heating]]. D6700-6754 were fitted with boilers from new, along with D6758, D6775, D6781-D6818, D6875-D6892. D6960-6968 received boilers from D6701-6709 during 1967/68. 37247 was fitted with a boiler in 1977. With the withdrawal of many Type 2 and Type 3 locomotives in the 1980s the 37s were selected as the standard Type 3 and many of the fleet were given a heavy overhaul to prolong their life into the 1990s and beyond. Some were fitted with [[Head end power|electrical train heating]] (ETH) equipment in the 1980s to become the 37/4 sub-class, initially for use on the [[West Highland Line]], the [[Welsh Marches line]] and South Wales - Bristol area services and [[Far North Line]]s but later seeing use in north/mid Wales and occasionally the West Country. In 2010, they were used on passenger services on the [[Cumbrian Coast line]] and [[Wherry lines]].\n\n=== Rebuilding ===\nA number of locomotives were rebuilt as Class 37/9s in the late 1980s to evaluate [[Blackstone & Co|Mirrlees]] and [[Ruston & Hornsby|Ruston]] engines for possible use on a new [[List of British Rail unbuilt locomotive classes#Type 3 locomotives|Class 38]] freight locomotive. These 'Slugs' were heavily ballasted to improve traction and had excellent load-hauling capabilities, but the Class 38, understood to be a 'modular' locomotive based on the approach that gave rise to the [[British Rail Class 58|Class 58]] diesel loco and the proposed [[List of British Rail unbuilt locomotive classes#Electric locomotives|Class 88]] electric loco, was never built.\n\n=== Axle load ===\n[[File:Class 37 cab.jpg|right|thumb|Cab interior of loco no. 37052]]\nThe Class 37 has a relatively low axle loading for its size and power. With the withdrawal of most of the smaller types of diesel locomotive, this left it as the only mainline type available in significant numbers for lines with weight restrictions, and for a number of years 37s handled almost all locomotive-hauled services on the West Highland Line, the lines north of [[Inverness railway station|Inverness]] ([[Far North Line]]) and in parts of [[Wales]]. The Class 37 has [[Route Availability]] 5 and this is one of the main reasons it is still in use on the network.  Note that class 37/7 and 37/9 have an RA of 7 due to their extra ballast weights.\n\n=== Regional variations ===\nThere are several differences between particular locomotives, some of them easily seen. Western Region Class 37s can be identified by 'cow horns' around halfway up on the outer edge of each end of the lamp brackets. When British Railways took over from the [[Great Western Railway]] the use of Great Western lamps continued. Their brackets used an L-shaped upright that was parallel to the direction of travel, unlike the other regions which used transverse brackets. Another difference between the regions is by the nose end headcodes. Lower-numbered, split-box Class 37s were allocated to northern England and east Anglia; centre-box locomotives were almost all allocated to Wales and the south west. After locomotives were transferred between pools in the 1980s they tended to stray from their original depots. Regional decorations included the Highland ([[Inverness TMD|Inverness]]) Stag, the Cockney Sparrow ([[Stratford TMD|Stratford]]) the Cornish lizard ([[St Blazey engine shed|St Blazey]]) and [[Eastfield TMD|Eastfield]] Highland Terrier. All the [[Cardiff Canton TMD|Cardiff Canton]] Class 37/4s received Celtic Dragons below the driver's window whilst in large logo blue. Some Scottish locomotives were later fitted with small Saltire flags by their TOPS data panels or on their noses in a similar fashion to the HAA hoppers allocated to Scottish power stations.\n\n=== British Rail liveries ===\nOn delivery, the Class 37s were painted in plain green with a grey roof, the 'late' (post-1956) British Railways crest and a D prefix to their running number. Some locomotives were delivered as the small yellow warning panel was introduced, earlier locomotives being given these panels during works visits. Towards the late 1960s, the yellow was extended to the full height of the nose.\n\nBy the 1970s, all locomotives had received all over British Rail blue with a full yellow nose; by 1975 most locomotives had also received their [[TOPS]] numbers. Their livery remained the same until the early 1980s when 'Large Logo blue' was introduced. This entailed the yellow nose continuing round to behind the driver's door and up to the top of the windscreen and a full height 'double arrow' logo. These locomotives had the top of the nose painted black to lower the risk of the driver being dazzled by the sun. Freight-allocated examples received a similar livery - the only difference being the blue was replaced by freight grey. In 1987, the Sectors were launched, incorporating a new livery of 'three tone grey'; a light grey lower bodyside, medium grey cantrail and a dark grey roof, along with a bright Sector logo (Coal, Metals, Petroleum, Distribution, General and Construction). In addition a metal double arrow logo was fitted. This livery co-existed with plain blue, large logo blue/grey and the new [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] and [[Regional Railways]] liveries right up to the end of British Rail in 1996.\n\n[[File:37891 British Rail class 37 diesel loco.jpg|thumb|37 891 with [[Mainline Freight]] branding at [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]]]]\nSome locomotives in the 'sectorised company' pools received [[Transrail Freight]] logos or [[Mainline Freight]] 'Rolling Balls' over their 3TG (three tone grey) colours, while [[Loadhaul]] locomotives were painted orange and black and Mainline locomotives received 'aircraft' blue with silver stripes. Departmental locomotives were initially painted in a plain grey livery, but this didn't find favour and was modified into 'Dutch' grey and yellow livery, similar to that of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]]. 37 093 was mocked up as a \"police\" locomotive which pulled over a [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|Class 43 HST power car]] for speeding in an [[InterCity 125]] advert broadcast in the 1980s.\n\n== TOPS renumbering ==\n{{main article|British Rail Class 37 renumbering}}\nAs with many diesel classes, the [[TOPS]] renumbering was implemented in a straightforward manner, with the locomotive numbers remaining in sequence. Thus 6701 became 37001 and D6999 became 37299; while D6600 - D6608 became 37300 - 37308. The remaining locomotive, D6700 became 37119 instead of D6819 which became 37283 (redundant number as D6983 was destroyed in an accident in 1965).<ref>[http://www.greywall.demon.co.uk/rail/37.html ENGLISH ELECTRIC CLASS 37 Renumbering the type 3s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628085538/http://www.greywall.demon.co.uk/rail/37.html |date=28 June 2008 }}</ref>  As members of the class were altered later in their careers, they were renumbered, some more than once.\n\nD6983 was withdrawn in December 1965 following a fatal collision with a derailed [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]], number D1671, in South Wales, near [[Bridgend]] as the result of a landslip. D6983 was the first EE Type 3 to be withdrawn and as a result, the only locomotive in the entire class not to receive a TOPS number. The remains of both locomotives were sold to local scrap merchants, R.S. Hayes, and cut up the following year.<ref>{{cite book | last = Morrison | first = Brian | title = The Power of the 37s | publisher = Oxford Publishing Co| year=  1981 | location = Oxford }}</ref>\n\n== Sub-classes ==\nIn the 1980s the Class 37 locomotives were extensively refurbished - from that point 37/0 refers to the original version.

The most visible external difference was that the first 119 locos had a \"split\" headcode box; for these locos the four digit [[Train reporting number]] was shown in two square boxes containing two digits and separated by a pair of doors designed to allow the train crew to be exchanged while in motion. Later locomotives had a single centrally placed headcode box, and also had the horns mounted on the roof rather than built into the nose of the locomotive. This difference was the reason for the double change in numbers when implementing the [[TOPS]] scheme described earlier.\n\n===Class 37/3===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}\n[[File:37 371 at Eastleigh.jpg|thumb|37371 at [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]]]]\nThere were two incarnations of a 37/3 subclass. The first was a group of 12 [[Motherwell TMD|Motherwell]] allocated locos that were fitted with strengthened couplings and modified brake blocks for working the heavy trains to [[Ravenscraig]]. These were all renumbered back to their original numbers by the end of 1988.\n\nThe second set of locos were rebogied at various depots with the regeared cast frame type 'CP7 Bogie'. Bogies from the English Electric [[British Rail Class 55|Deltics]], [[British Rail Class 50|Class 50]] and Class 37s are largely interchangeable with only modification to traction motor gearing, to {{convert|80|mph}} in the case of the 37s, and access step positions needing alteration between the classes. The fuel capacity was doubled by using the redundant train heating boiler water tanks but no other changes were made.<ref>[http://www.thejunction.org.uk/cl37.html Rolling stock : class 37, English Electric/BR] ''thejunction.org.uk''</ref>\n\n===Class 37/4===\n[[File:BR Class 37 37 409.jpg|thumb|left|BR Class 37/4 37 409 ''Loch Awe'' at {{stn|Fort William}} in 1989]]\nWith ETH ([[Electric Train Heating]]) replacing 'steam heated' coaches, some of this class received ETH Supply when refurbished at [[Crewe Works]] during 1985 and 1986. During this refurbishment, the locomotives also received regeared CP7 [[bogies]] and the English electric generator was replaced with a [[Brush Traction|Brush]] BA1005A [[alternator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railfaneurope.net/pix/picmonth/1997-12.html |title=The European Railway Picture Gallery Class 37/4 data sheet |publisher=Railfaneurope.net |date=13 May 1965 |accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref> Extensive re-wiring, as well as a full repaint into [[British Rail corporate liveries#Moving away from Rail Blue|BR Large Logo]] was undertaken. The modifications allowed the rebuilt locomotives to work passenger trains all year round, with the 31 strong fleet being split between [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], Scotland receiving the first 25 and Wales the other six.\n\nAfter the extensive refurbishment, the locomotives were allocated the 37/4 sub-class, following the trend of renumbering 'ETH' fitted locomotives xx/4s, (e.g. 47 4xx and 31 4xx).\n\nThe next chapter saw the entire sub-class pass to [[Transrail Freight]], which was one of the three regional [[Freight operating company|freight operating companies]] prior to the privatisation of the entire British Rail network.\n\nOver the years, the locomotives have received a large number of liveries: BR Green, [[Regional Railways#Livery|Regional Railways]], Trainload Grey, [[DB Cargo UK|EWS]] maroon, [[Transrail Freight]], BR Large Logo and Mainline, to name a few.\n\nThe [[Cambrian line|Cambrian]], [[North Wales Coast Line|North Wales Coast]], [[Rhymney line|Rhymney]], [[West Highland Line|West Highland]], [[South Wales Main Line|South Wales]] and [[West of England Main Line|West Country]] all benefited from the use of 37/4s. \n\nLocomotive hauled operations have taken a big hit within the past couple of years, thanks to the widespread introduction of diesel multiple units, and the replacement of loco hauled trains by multiple units, although the sub-class did hold out on the [[Rhymney line|Cardiff - Rhymney]] trains for [[Arriva Trains Wales]] latterly. 37411 and 37425 were painted especially to mark the end of loco hauled service on the line in April 2005, these repaints being funded by Arriva.\n\nIn late 2010, [[DB Cargo UK|DB Schenker]] put all of its remaining 37/4s up for sale with many examples expected to be sold for scrap. DRS has since bought the remaining class 37/4s as of April 2011.<ref>Rail Express April 2011</ref> The DRS ones are currently (Summer 2017) used on Northern services on the Cumbrian Coast and on local Anglian services from Norwich.\n\n===Class 37/5===\n[[File:37 667 BR diesel locomotive.jpg|thumb|37 667, Class 37/5 at [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]]]]\nThis class were updated in similar fashion to the 37/4 subclass, except that they did not receive Electric Train Heating and some were fitted with Sandite ports. Locomotives previously numbered between 37001 and 37119 (those which had split headcode boxes) were given new numbers from 37501 upwards; those previously numbered between 37120 and 37308 were renumbered from 37699 downwards (locomotives 37601-37612 were Class 37/6, not Class 37/5).\n\n===Class 37/6===\n[[File:37603 and 37604 At Clapham Junction.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Eurostar]] 37/6 types at [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]]]]\n[[Eurostar]] (at the time European Passenger Services) had 12 locomotives modified (all ex-37/5) as Class 37/6, with the intention that they would haul overnight international trains (\"[[Nightstar (train)|Nightstar]]\") over the non-electrified sections of their routes in Britain. However, these services were never introduced, and, in 1997, Eurostar sold six of its locomotives to [[Direct Rail Services]] (DRS), with a further three sold in 2000. The remaining three locomotives were retained by Eurostar for a variety of tasks, including driver training, route learning, and for rescuing failed [[British Rail Class 373|Class 373]] units. Once Eurostar moved its operations to its new depot at [[Temple Mills TMD|Temple Mills]], its Class 37 locomotives became redundant and they too were sold to DRS in 2007.  DRS has subsequently sold some of them, [[Europhoenix]] being the principal recipient.  The Europhoenix 37/6s are used on test trains and will soon be used to haul EMUs to and from works.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Class 37/7===\n[[File:37710 stabled at Didcot Yard.JPG|thumb| [[Loadhaul]] liveried 37/7 type]]\nThe Class 37/7 sub-class is intended primarily for heavy freight work.\n\nAgain, as part of the major refurbishment scheme of the Class 37 locomotives in the 1980s, another freight dedicated fleet of 44 Class 37s was created; the Class 37/7 subclass which was very similar to the 37/5 subclass except for plating over of a bodyside window and the addition of a ballast weight to give extra 'pulling power' when hauling heavy freight trains such as the metals trains in South Wales. Again, like the 37/5s, there were two batches completed; from phase 1 and phase 2 Class 37/0 locos. The batch numbered 37701 upwards were from phase 1 build locos and have the flush front ends and the batch numbered from 37899 downwards were rebuilds from phase 2 locos, having the central headcode box (plated over). A further complication was created; locos numbered 37796-37803 had a different type of electrical equipment fitted (Brush) as part of a trial and differ from the other locos in the subclass internally.\n\nIn British Rail use, the sub-class were particularly common in South Wales on heavy coal and metals work. They were particularly adept at working coal trains up and down the short but steeply graded branch lines around Swansea and Cardiff to collieries such as Tower Colliery, Coedbach and Cwmbargoed. They operated [[merry-go-round train]]s of 32-ton HAA air-braked hoppers, usually numbering 32 wagons, between collieries, washeries, open cast mines and disposal points to power stations such as Aberthaw and occasionally further afield.\n\nTheir use on Metals Sector trains, usually from Llanwern, Port Talbot or English metal works such as Scunthorpe, saw them hauling incredibly heavy trains between docks, works and purchasers in Britain. Indeed, the use of three Class 37/0 locomotives on Llanwern-Port Talbot Docks steel trains (the heaviest on the British rail network at {{convert|3300|LT}} was soon abandoned when Class 37/7s became available, requiring only two locomotives. Cardiff had a large allocation of 37/7s, some waiting on standby, ready for a call from the mills requiring more wagons to handle any extra traffic. Eventually this work was taken over by [[British Rail Class 56|Class 56s]] and [[British Rail Class 60|Class 60s]]. This Metals traffic would also become the domain of the sub-class 37/9, which to all intents and purposes was a 37/7 but with a different [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]].\n\nWhen [[DB Cargo UK|EWS]] introduced its 250 [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66s]] from 1998, many of the sub-class were put into store. Some have since been involved in construction work in France and Spain building new high-speed lines. 15 were sent to Spain; an additional two were sent to Italy.\n\nEWS has been selling off the sub-class. Four were purchased by [[West Coast Railways]] for overhaul and main line charters; these are 37706, 37710, 37712 and 37717. 37717 has since been sold for scrap while 37712 returned to traffic before a serious internal fire.\n\n=== Class 37/9 ===\n[[file:37906 at Cardiff on 22-07-91 (7716517456) John Pease.jpg|thumb|right|37906 at Cardiff Central in July 1991.]]\nIn 1986, four Class 37s, numbers 150/148/249/124, were converted to test the [[Mirrlees Blackstone|Mirrlees]] MB275T engine<ref name=\"RE63-55\">{{cite magazine|title=Enter the Super 'Syphons'|magazine=[[Rail (magazine)|Rail Enthusiast]]|publisher=EMAP National Publications|date=December 1986|issue=63|pp=55-57|issn=0262-561X|oclc=49957965}}</ref> and [[Brush Traction|Brush]] alternator for the proposed [[List of British Rail unbuilt locomotive classes|Class 38]], and were numbered 37901-904. These were followed in 1987 by 37905/6, converted from 37136/206, and fitted with the alternative pairing of a [[Ruston & Hornsby|Ruston]] RK270T engine and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] alternator.<ref name=\"RE63-55\" /> All six locomotives were fitted with new bogies, and had ballast weights to increase their overall weight to 120 [[Long ton|tons]]. Although intended as a testbed for the Class 38, the two power units fitted were those considered for the [[British Rail Class 60|Class 60]], which was eventually delivered with an enlarged version of the Mirrlees MB275T. They all had modifications similar to that of Class 37/7, including new nose grilles, removal of the central bodyside windows and 4 fire extinguisher ports. However, 37901-904 had a heavily modified central roof section, consisting of flat panels rather than the curved sheets of the original. All 6 had a new exhaust port fitted, replacing the two of the original design.\n\nAll six Class 37/9s were delivered in Railfreight Grey livery, later receiving 3TG metals sub sector livery, and operated as part of the British Rail Heavy Metals sector, being based in [[South Wales]] and hauling trains normally rostered for the much more powerful [[British Rail Class 56|Class 56]] such as the [[Port Talbot Steelworks]] - Llanwern Iron Ore tipplers.<ref>{{cite magazine  | last = Banks  | first = Alan  | title = Masterclass : BR Class 37/9s  |magazine=Model Rail  | issue = 111  | pages =18\u201324  | publisher = EMAP active Ltd  | location = Peterborough  |date=December 2007  }}</ref> During the late 1990s, use of the Class 37/9s declined due to availability of the newer and more powerful [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66s]] and problems maintaining such a small number of non-standard locos, with all six officially designated as being in storage in 1999.\n\nThis was not, however, the end of the sub-class. In July 2000, 37906 was designated as part of the EWS heritage fleet but has since been sold into preservation, joining 37901 and 37905. 37902 was sold to [[Direct Rail Services]] in 2003, but was scrapped and cut up in 2005 after a review by DRS. 37904 was cut up at [[CF Booth]]'s in [[Rotherham]] in November 2004 and 37903 was scrapped at [[Crewe Diesel TMD]] in April 2005.\n\n==Operations==\n\n===British Rail===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}\n\nDuring the time of British Rail, the Class 37s found use on both passenger and freight workings, being one of the mainstays of the BR fleet. While freight use was widespread, passenger work was predominantly in the [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]] with use on [[Liverpool Street railway station|London]] - [[Norwich railway station|Norwich]] and [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]]/[[King's Lynn railway station|King's Lynn]] services, the latter through to the 1980s and in West Wales on services west of [[Swansea railway station|Swansea]] to [[Fishguard Harbour railway station|Fishguard Harbour]], [[Milford Haven railway station|Milford Haven]] and [[Pembroke Dock railway station|Pembroke Dock]].  Darnall's (later [[Tinsley TMD|Tinsley's]]) 37s were used on various passenger services in the Sheffield area, notably the [[Pullman train (UK)|Pullman]] service to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]]. Hull Dairycoates' 37s were used on local stopping services as well as on King's Cross portions down to [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, the remaining steam-heat capable locomotives gravitated to Scotland, eventually replacing both [[British Rail Class 27|Class 27s]] on the [[West Highland Line]] and [[British Rail Class 26|Class 26s]] on the [[Far North Line|Far North]] and [[Kyle of Lochalsh line|Kyle of Lochalsh]] lines. However, their use became tricky once ETH-fitted [[British Rail Mark 2|Mark 2]] and [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] coaches moved north. The sleeper trains were a particular problem. To this end, steam-heat 37/0s were coupled to ETHELs (Electric Train Heating Ex-Locomotive - essentially [[British Rail Class 25|Class 25s]] with isolated traction motors that provided [[Head End Power|Electric Train Heating]]) which provided the necessary power to run them.\n\nClass 37s were subject to several modifications during their time in service. One short-lived experiment involved 37175 receiving CP5 'self-steering bogies' designed to reduce excess wear and noise on the tightly-curved West Highland line to [[Fort William railway station|Fort William]] and [[Mallaig railway station|Mallaig]]. This however, proved too expensive to be practicable. Some [[Inverness TMD|Inverness]] allocated Class 37s received 'car lights'; these were essentially spotlights that made them more visible on the sharply curved Scottish branches, especially to users of level crossings. These were eventually either removed or superseded by the modern 'sealed beam' lights that became compulsory from 1993. Other classes fitted with these or similar lights were [[British Rail Class 24|Class 24s]], [[British Rail Class 26|Class 26s]], [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47s]] and a solitary [[British Rail Class 86|Class 86]] 86225.\n\nThe other notable use was of nominally freight locomotives to [[Aberystwyth railway station|Aberystwyth]] over the Cambrian line, in this case taking over from [[British Rail Class 25|Class 25s]] on the holiday trains.\n\nFrom 1985, the 37/4 subclass took over on the Scottish lines although the use of original 37/0s continued in the summer when train supply was not required. The Welsh allocation in turn took over from the 37/0s on the Cambrian as well as from [[British Rail Class 33|Class 33s]] on [[Crewe railway station|Crewe]] - [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]] workings. They were also used on the [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol]] - Cardiff/Swansea leg of services from [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station|Portsmouth Harbour]] and later on the [[Heart of Wessex line]].\n\nOver time they were displaced from most passenger work by new build DMUs such as the ''[[Sprinter (train)|Sprinter]]'' units, though they still found work in the summer and on secondary services from time to time through the 1990s as traffic demand required. This saw use both on the North Wales Coast and, most remarkably, [[Rhymney line|Cardiff - Rhymney]] local services through to 2006.  In Scotland after being displaced from the West Highland and far north routes, 37/4s were used on two diagrams on the [[Inverness railway station|Inverness]] - [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] route for several years as well as being used to Kyle of Lochalsh in the summer and on Inverness - [[Aberdeen railway station|Aberdeen]] services. The final daily work in Scotland was the Fort William ''[[Caledonian Sleeper]]'', this ending in June 2006.\n\nTheir freight work similarly reduced, being displaced by higher powered locomotives such as the [[British Rail Class 56|Class 56]] and [[British Rail Class 58|Class 58]] locomotives on coal trains, though they continued on other cargos such as oil tankers for longer.\n\n===Post privatisation===\nIn the 1980s many locomotives were refurbished, which has meant the Class 37 fleet is one of the longest surviving classes on British railways. However, the introduction of new [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66]] locomotives has meant many 37s have been withdrawn or scrapped. [[DB Cargo|English Welsh & Scottish]] and [[Direct Rail Services]] operated small fleets, with several other examples also operated by spot-hire companies. However, second-hand Class 37s have also proved popular in the export market, with some examples operating in Spain and France, serving the construction of those countries' high-speed railway networks. As of 2019, examples of the class are still in mainline service despite being more than 50 years old.\n\n====Colas Rail====\n[[Colas Rail]] owns ex-preservation 37057, 37099, 37116, 37175, 37219, 37254, 37421, all currently operational. 37175 and 37219 are being used in 2014 Rail Head Treatment Trains working off Kings Norton but in 2015, Colas Class 47s (47727 and 47739) are on this duty.\n\nAdditionally, Colas purchased 37146, 37188 and 37207 with the intention of returning them to main line duty but as of November 2017 37146 and 37188 are unlikely to receive their intended overhaul and are expected to be sold or used as parts donors.\n\nBetween July 2019 and March 2020, 3 Colas Rail class 37s, 37025/418/421, operated peak time loco-hauled services on the [[Rhymney line|Rhymney Line]] with 8 mark 2 carriages<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2019-07-03/50-year-old-loco-drafted-in-to-cope-with-demand-in-the-rhymney-valley/|title=54-year-old loco drafted in to cope with demand in the Rhymney Valley|website=ITV News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>, the first passenger loco-hauled services on the route since 2005, due to a lack of rolling stock caused by the 2 year delay on the class 769 that was scheduled to run services on the route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/class-37s-to-stay-in-wales-into-2020|title=Class 37s to stay in Wales into 2020?|website=www.railmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n====Direct Rail Services====\n[[File:37038 at Crewe Works.jpg|thumb|right|Class 37/0 in [[Direct Rail Services]] livery at [[Crewe Works]] in June 2003)]]\n[[Direct Rail Services]] has a variety of Class 37s operational, and others stored.

Additionally EWS used the Class 37s on railtours or charter hire to train operating companies. For example, in 2005 Arriva Trains Wales used 37/4 haulage on the Rhymney valley line, from a pool of four locomotives, these locomotives being 37405 (EWS livery), 37425 (BR Large Logo), 37411 (BR green livery), 37419 (EW&S livery), This loco replaced 37408 ''Loch Rannoch'' which was involved in a collision with parked stock at Rhymney sidings, which was suspected to be caused by vandals. 37408 suffered extensive damage and was written off at [[Toton TMD]] with its power unit removed and used to revive 37422. Its body was later scrapped at [[European Metal Recycling]], [[Kingsbury, Warwickshire]].\n\nBy mid-2008, only three EWS Class 37s were still in regular use on the mainline (37401, 417 & 422). 37422 was placed in WNTS tactical store pool in September leaving only 37401 and 417 in traffic. On 16 December, 37417 suffered serious engine failure and was sent to Eastleigh for storage, resulting in 37401 the only Class 37 to remain in traffic into the new DB Schenker era.\n\n====DB Schenker====\n[[File:Weymouth 37670 37401.jpg|thumb|37670 in DB Schenker livery at Weymouth]]\nDB Schenker had one operational Class 37/4, 37401 at the time of its rebranding from EWS on 1 January 2009. DB Schenker also has hired locomotives for temporary duties, such as 37423 from Direct Rail Services (DRS) to cover for failed 37417. DB Schenker 37401 (and DRS's 37423) were on snowplough duty at Inverness for the winter months. 37401, DB Schenker's sole operational English Electric type 3 at the time, was reported sounding rough, and was later stored although this did not last long as it was soon sent to Toton TMD for repairs along with 37406 ''The Saltire Society''.\n\n37401, DB Schenker's most reliable Class 37, was repaired and returned to service. 37406 was returned to service, failing on its first working. 37670 was also returned operational.\n\n37419 was prepared for a return to traffic and saw itself repainted into DB Schenker livery, however its long time in store did not help its power unit and it failed with a serious engine fault on its trial run. The locomotive is now operational with Direct Rail Services.\n\nDB Schenker had the largest route for railhead treatment trains for Autumn 2009 and required Class 37 haulage due to their route availability. Much speculation was surrounding the return of several Class 37s, however DB Schenker were eventually given clearance from Network Rail to use Class 66s and 67s on the routes instead, resulting in the Class 37 plan being ditched despite several of the machines having their air horns moved onto the nose to resolve clearance problems.\n\nReliability problems plagued 37670 during its short time in traffic and the loco was eventually stored unserviceable.\n\nWith the storage of 37670, this meant that once again 37401 was the sole operational Class 37 in active service under DB Schenker. To take the load strain off 37401, 37425 ''Pride of the Valleys'' was fitted with OTMR safety equipment and was returned fully operational. The locomotive retained in BR blue large logo livery, however like 37670 it was also plagued with unreliability.\n\nAs of summer 2010, DB Schenker Rail UK ceased using Class 37s.\n\nIn June 2013, DB Schenker offered six Class 37s for sale: 37703, 37714, 37716, 37718, 37800 and 37884. These had been stored out of use at [[Dollands Moor]] after returning from mainland Europe, where they had been working on the construction of a new high speed line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rail.co.uk/rail-news/2013/more-1960s-redundant-class-37-diesel-locomotives-put-up-for-sale-by-db-schenker/ |title=More 1960s redundant Class 37 diesel locomotives put up for sale by DB Schenker |publisher=Rail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref> 37703 went on hire/loaned (but still owned by Direct Rail Services) to the Scottish Railway Preservation Society, 37703/714/716/718 were bought by Direct Rail Services. 37718 was scrapped at CF Booth, Rotherham in July 2015. 37800 and 37884 were bought by [[Europhoenix]] and once restored to working order, went on long term hire to Rail Operations Group in a dual Europhoenix/ROG livery.\n\n====West Coast Railways====\n[[File:37 706 British Rail class 37 diesel loco.jpg|thumb|[[West Coast Railways]] 37706 approaching Northam Junction]]\n[[West Coast Railways]] (WCR) purchased four locomotives from [[Ian Riley Engineering]] in 2004. The two operational locomotives (nos. 37197 and 37261) were used on charter trains or as standby locomotives for ''The Jacobite'' [[Steam locomotive|steam-hauled]] excursion services from [[Fort William railway station|Fort William]] to [[Mallaig railway station|Mallaig]] during 2005. These two, along with non-operational 37423, have since been sold to DRS. The fourth (no. 37235) was for spares.\n\nIn late 2007, WCR purchased several non-operational Class 37/5 and Class 37/7s from EWS: nos. 37517, 37668, 37676, 37685, 37706, 37712 and 37710. Of the acquired locomotives 37710 will be used as a source of spares, 37676 and 37712 were the first two returned to mainline. 37676 was named ''Loch Rannoch'' at a special event in [[Carnforth]] Steamtown. 37712 suffered a fire on an empty coaching stock move and was subsequently stored. It is known that major work will need to be done on 37712, however demand exists for chartered Class 37s.\n\nBy the end of 2019, WCR had seven Class 37s running in service: nos. 37516, 37518, 37668, 37669, 37676, 37685, 37706 with nos. 37710 as a spare donor and 37517 and 37712 stored.\n\n====Locomotive Services Ltd====\nBy 2019 [[Locomotive Services Limited]] began to aquire a number of class 37s to use alongside their own fleet of [[British Rail Class 47|BR Class 47]]s. As of February 2020 LSL have four on their books and running in service: nos. 37190, 37521, 37667 and 37688. Not all of which are owned by LSL as some are hired in by the company from their owners for use on LSL run trains.\n\n====Rail Operations Group====\n[[File:On the final journey (geograph 6217754).jpg|thumb|[[Rail Operations Group|ROG]] 37 884 hauling class 313 units through Newport]]\n[[Rail Operations Group]] (ROG) leases five Class 37s (37601, 37608, 37611, 37800, 37884) from [[Europhoenix]] for frequent moves of passenger stock.

The driver and second man of D1671 died, and damage to both locomotives was extensive enough that even though each locomotive was barely a year old, they were withdrawn and eventually scrapped. D6983 was the first Class 37 withdrawn and the only one of the class not to be renumbered.\n* In January 1988, locomotives No. 37 671 and 37 672 were hauling a freight train that was diverted into a siding at Tavistock Junction, [[Devon]] due to a pointsman's error. The train collided with a wagon, pushed it through the buffers and was derailed.{{sfn|Earnshaw|1993|pp=39, rear cover}}\n\n==Departmental==\n===Network Rail ERTMS project===\n[[Network Rail]] restored four Class 37s as part of the [[European Rail Traffic Management System]] (ERTMS) trial project on the [[Cambrian Line]]. The site of the restoration was the [[Barrow Hill Roundhouse]], where ex-[[Harry Needle Railroad Company|HNRC]] locomotives 37100, 37170, 37178 and 37217 were taken in. The restored Class 37s for ERTMS use were re-designated as [[British Rail Class 97|Class 97/3]], numbered 97301(Since removed due to fault), 97302, 97303 and 97304.<ref>[http://www.wnxx.net/fleetstatus/Fleet_files/sheet010.htm Class 97 Status] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213002015/http://www.wnxx.net/fleetstatus/Fleet_files/sheet010.htm |date=13 February 2009 }} wnxx.com, retrieved on 13 September 2008</ref>\n\nThe class was chosen because of its original fitment with both air and vacuum braking, a feature which will allow them to pull both modern freight trains as well as steam specials. The main work of the locomotives is to pull on-track machines (such as [[ballast tamper|tampers]]) through the ERTMS section.\n\nThe 97/3s are based at the newly constructed [[Shrewsbury TMD|Coleham Depot]] for the duration of the ERTMS testing on the Cambrian Line, thereafter they are used to pilot trains not fitted with the ERTMS signalling system.  They are also used to work Network Rail test trains on other parts of the network when not required for ERTMS testing.\n\nThese locos were effectively refurbished, having been completely stripped down to bare steel, with reconditioned engines, somewhat updated cabs, all new signalling systems installed (ERTMS in this instance) and extensive re-wiring.\n\n==Preservation==\n[[File:37901 British Rail diesel loco.jpg|thumb|37901 ''Mirrlees Pioneer'']]\nClass 37 locomotives have proved to be very popular, with many examples saved for preservation on [[heritage railway]]s or by [[railfan|enthusiast]] groups. Notable examples saved include the first-built locomotive, no. D6700, and the last built locomotive 37308.  A number of the class have been sold back out of preservation to mainline operators including [[Blackstone & Co|Mirrlees]]-engined prototype no. 37901, and both [[Ruston & Hornsby|Ruston]]-engined prototypes nos. 37905 and 37906.
