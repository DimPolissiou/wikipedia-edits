He was the son of Samuel Archibald, and grandson of James Archibald, judge of the court of common pleas, Nova Scotia. He was also related to [[Samuel George William Archibald|Samuel G. W. Archibald]], who had served as the province's Attorney General from 1830 to 1841. Sir Adams Archibald studied science and medicine for a few years, subsequently articled in law, and was called to the Nova Scotia bar in January 1839. He held a number of local offices over the next decade, and was appointed a probate judge in 1848.<ref name=DCB>{{cite DCB |first=K. G. |last=Pryke |title=Archibald, Sir Adams George |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/archibald_adams_george_12E.html |volume=12}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nArchibald was elected to the Nova Scotia legislature in 1851 as a supporter of Joseph Howe's governing [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Reformers]], topping the poll in the two-member riding of [[Colchester County, Nova Scotia|Colchester County]]. Once in the legislature, Archibald frequently took positions that were opposed by other members of the Liberal caucus. He supported elected municipal governments, for instance, and was a vociferous proponent of taxation for a state-run school system (regarded by many Nova Scotia Liberals as an unnecessary expense). Archibald also supported reciprocity with the United States, and opposed any efforts to expand the province's electoral franchise.\n\nArchibald was re-elected in 1855, and was appointed [[Solicitor|Solicitor General]] of Nova Scotia on August 14, 1856. His term in office was cut short by a sectarian quarrel in the legislature, which occurred after the President of the [[Charitable Irish Society]] was dismissed from his government job and charged with treason. The Liberal government had previously been supported by a majority of the province's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] population, but in early 1857 eight Catholic Liberals and two Protestant Liberals from Catholic ridings defected to the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia|Conservative]] opposition, which was then able to form government. Archibald was forced to resign his position on February 21, 1857.\n\nIn the provincial election of 1859, Howe's Liberals were returned to office on a platform of defending Protestant interests. This was essentially a cynical appeal to popular prejudice, and no significant actions were taken against the province's Catholics following the election. Archibald did not run, but was nevertheless appointed [[Attorney General]] in Howe's government on February 10, 1860. He returned to parliament following a by-election victory on March 8, 1860. In his new capacity, Archibald was a leading proponent of provincial railway development, even following the economic downturn of 1862.\n\nIn December 1862, Premier Howe was appointed Imperial Fisheries Commissioner by the British government. Archibald succeeded him as Liberal leader, although Howe continued to serve as Premier until the next election was called.\n\nIn early 1863, Howe's outgoing ministry passed a bill which re-introduced property qualifications for voters. The bill did not become law before the provincial election of May 1863, however, and it was largely due to the bill's unpopularity that Archibald's Liberals were dealt a crushing defeat. The party won only 14 seats out of 55, though Archibald was personally re-elected in [[Colchester South]].\n\nDespite serving as leader of the opposition from 1863 to 1867, Archibald frequently sided with the Conservative ministry against his own caucus on important legislative initiatives. He supported the education tax plan put forward by [[Charles Tupper]]'s government, although it was opposed by most members of his own party. Archibald was later the Nova Scotia Liberal Party's representative to the first conference on Canadian Confederation, held at [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]] in 1864. Following the conference, he was the ''only'' member of the Liberal caucus to support Nova Scotia's entry into confederation.\n\nArchibald faced a leadership challenge from anti-confederate [[William Annand]] in 1866, but emerged victorious. When Nova Scotia joined the new nation of Canada on July 1, 1867, Archibald was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Provinces]] in the cabinet of [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\nNova Scotia's political system was transformed by the debate on Confederation, and its concurrent provincial and federal elections in September 1867 were fought by Confederation and anti-Confederation parties, rather than by Liberals and Conservatives. The Confederation Party suffered a massive defeat, and Archibald (despite spending a very large sum of money) was defeated by [[Archibald McLelan]] in the riding of [[Colchester (electoral district)|Colchester]]. He resigned his cabinet post on April 30, 1868.\n\nPopular opinion in Nova Scotia subsequently shifted in favour of Confederation, particularly after one-time anti-confederate Joseph Howe joined Macdonald's government in 1869. McLelan followed Howe to the Confederation side, and was appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] in August 1869. This allowed Archibald to run for the riding in a by-election, in which he defeated [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Frederick M. Pearson|Frederick Pearson]], 1585 votes to 1230. Archibald was by this time a Liberal-Conservative, and continued to support the Macdonald government in parliament (though he was not re-appointed to cabinet).\n\nIn 1870, Archibald gave a speech in favour of conciliation towards the leaders of the [[Red River Rebellion]] in Manitoba. This was noticed by [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], who was the ''de facto'' leader of the Canadian government while Macdonald was recovering from a serious illness. Cartier asked Archibald to become the first Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and the [[Northwest Territories]]. Although he had little interest in the region, he agreed on condition that he be appointed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia after serving a single term.\n\nArchibald was sworn into office in August 1870, in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. He then travelled to Manitoba, and began piecing together the province's first government. There was considerable antagonism between the province's [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] population and recently arrived soldiers from Ontario, and Archibald had difficulties finding suitable candidates to work with him. Until January 1871, the only members of his cabinet were local merchant [[Alfred Boyd]] and [[Marc-Amable Girard]], a recent arrival from Quebec. Archibald himself was the province's ''de facto'' Premier, and often determined policy without consulting his ministers.\n\nDespite opposition from many of the province's Anglophones, Archibald was able to settle the province's electoral boundaries by December 1870. Archibald himself was the leader of the government side in the election which followed; the francophone population was mostly united in support of him, while [[John Christian Schultz]] led a group of ultra-loyalist Anglophones who opposed the conciliation policy. Archibald was successful, as Schultz's opposition won only five seats and Schultz was personally defeated in [[Winnipeg and St. John]].\n\nArchibald put together a five-member cabinet in January 1871, which included Boyd, Girard, [[Henry Joseph Clarke]], [[James Mackay (Canada)|James Mackay]] and [[Thomas Howard (Manitoba politician)|Thomas Howard]] \u2014 a group which balanced the province's ethnic, religious and linguistic divisions. Archibald himself remained the real Premier.\n\nArchibald continued to pursue a policy of conciliation with the province's M\u00e9tis population, encouraging them to register their lands and even meeting with [[Louis Riel]] after an armed M\u00e9tis band had defended the government against [[Fenian]] invaders from America. His real intentions were to prevent another M\u00e9tis uprising in the short-term, and to allow for the gradual hegemony of new Canadian settlers in the region. Nevertheless, the specifics of his conciliation policy were opposed by Macdonald and Howe alike (Howe was by this time Macdonald's Indian Affairs minister). In the face of this opposition, Archibald submitted his resignation in late 1871. Macdonald initially had difficulty finding a replacement and asked Archibald to reconsider. The federal government chose [[Francis Godschall Johnson]] as his replacement on April 9, 1872, but this commission was revoked before Johnson was sworn in. It was not until October 1872 that Archibald returned to [[Ontario]].\n\nArchibald was not immediately appointed to the Nova Scotia court, and was instead made a director of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific Railway Company]] in February 1873. He was finally appointed to the bench in June, but withdrew days later to be appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia (former Conservative Premier [[James W. Johnston]] initially received this appointment, but withdrew due to ill health). This position required less intervention than Archibald had exercised in Manitoba, although he attended cabinet meetings in 1873 and 1874. After 1876, he came to regard the position as primarily ceremonial, and above partisan concerns.\n\nArchibald served as the 4th Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia until June 1883. In 1886, he became President of the [[Nova Scotia Historical Society]], which he had helped to found six years earlier. He courted controversy by a public defence of the 18th-century [[Acadian expulsion]] later in the year.\n\nIn 1888, [[Archibald McLellan]] was appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]]. McLellan had resigned his Senate seat in 1881 and subsequently returned to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. His appointment meant that the riding of Colchester again became vacant, and, ironically, Archibald was again prevailed upon to stand for the riding as a Liberal-Conservative candidate. He was re-elected to the Commons on August 15, 1888, 18 years after his previous departure. Archibald was little involved in the activities of the House following his return, and did not make any speeches. Due to ill health, he did not run again in 1891.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mrs Elizabeth Alice Jones by Parsons, St. John's, Nfld.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mrs Elizabeth Alice Jones (n\u00e9e Archibald) by Parsons, St. John's, Nfld]]\nHon.

He was the son of Samuel Archibald, and grandson of James Archibald, judge of the court of common pleas, Nova Scotia. He was also related to [[Samuel George William Archibald|Samuel G. W. Archibald]], who had served as the province's Attorney General from 1830 to 1841. Sir Adams Archibald studied science and medicine for a few years, subsequently articled in law, and was called to the Nova Scotia bar in January 1839. He held a number of local offices over the next decade, and was appointed a probate judge in 1848.<ref name=DCB>{{cite DCB |first=K. G. |last=Pryke |title=Archibald, Sir Adams George |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/archibald_adams_george_12E.html |volume=12}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nArchibald was elected to the Nova Scotia legislature in 1851 as a supporter of Joseph Howe's governing [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Reformers]], topping the poll in the two-member riding of [[Colchester County, Nova Scotia|Colchester County]]. Once in the legislature, Archibald frequently took positions that were opposed by other members of the Liberal caucus. He supported elected municipal governments, for instance, and was a vociferous proponent of taxation for a state-run school system (regarded by many Nova Scotia Liberals as an unnecessary expense). Archibald also supported reciprocity with the United States, and opposed any efforts to expand the province's electoral franchise.\n\nArchibald was re-elected in 1855, and was appointed [[Solicitor|Solicitor General]] of Nova Scotia on August 14, 1856. His term in office was cut short by a sectarian quarrel in the legislature, which occurred after the President of the [[Charitable Irish Society]] was dismissed from his government job and charged with treason. The Liberal government had previously been supported by a majority of the province's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] population, but in early 1857 eight Catholic Liberals and two Protestant Liberals from Catholic ridings defected to the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia|Conservative]] opposition, which was then able to form government. Archibald was forced to resign his position on February 21, 1857.\n\nIn the provincial election of 1859, Howe's Liberals were returned to office on a platform of defending Protestant interests. This was essentially a cynical appeal to popular prejudice, and no significant actions were taken against the province's Catholics following the election. Archibald did not run, but was nevertheless appointed [[Attorney General]] in Howe's government on February 10, 1860. He returned to parliament following a by-election victory on March 8, 1860. In his new capacity, Archibald was a leading proponent of provincial railway development, even following the economic downturn of 1862.\n\nIn December 1862, Premier Howe was appointed Imperial Fisheries Commissioner by the British government. Archibald succeeded him as Liberal leader, although Howe continued to serve as Premier until the next election was called.\n\nIn early 1863, Howe's outgoing ministry passed a bill which re-introduced property qualifications for voters. The bill did not become law before the provincial election of May 1863, however, and it was largely due to the bill's unpopularity that Archibald's Liberals were dealt a crushing defeat. The party won only 14 seats out of 55, though Archibald was personally re-elected in [[Colchester South]].\n\nDespite serving as leader of the opposition from 1863 to 1867, Archibald frequently sided with the Conservative ministry against his own caucus on important legislative initiatives. He supported the education tax plan put forward by [[Charles Tupper]]'s government, although it was opposed by most members of his own party. Archibald was later the Nova Scotia Liberal Party's representative to the first conference on Canadian Confederation, held at [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]] in 1864. Following the conference, he was the ''only'' member of the Liberal caucus to support Nova Scotia's entry into confederation.\n\nArchibald faced a leadership challenge from anti-confederate [[William Annand]] in 1866, but emerged victorious. When Nova Scotia joined the new nation of Canada on July 1, 1867, Archibald was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Provinces]] in the cabinet of [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\nNova Scotia's political system was transformed by the debate on Confederation, and its concurrent provincial and federal elections in September 1867 were fought by Confederation and anti-Confederation parties, rather than by Liberals and Conservatives. The Confederation Party suffered a massive defeat, and Archibald (despite spending a very large sum of money) was defeated by [[Archibald McLelan]] in the riding of [[Colchester (electoral district)|Colchester]]. He resigned his cabinet post on April 30, 1868.\n\nPopular opinion in Nova Scotia subsequently shifted in favour of Confederation, particularly after one-time anti-confederate Joseph Howe joined Macdonald's government in 1869. McLelan followed Howe to the Confederation side, and was appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] in August 1869. This allowed Archibald to run for the riding in a by-election, in which he defeated [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Frederick M. Pearson|Frederick Pearson]], 1585 votes to 1230. Archibald was by this time a Liberal-Conservative, and continued to support the Macdonald government in parliament (though he was not re-appointed to cabinet).\n\nIn 1870, Archibald gave a speech in favour of conciliation towards the leaders of the [[Red River Rebellion]] in Manitoba. This was noticed by [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]], who was the ''de facto'' leader of the Canadian government while Macdonald was recovering from a serious illness. Cartier asked Archibald to become the first Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba and the [[Northwest Territories]]. Although he had little interest in the region, he agreed on condition that he be appointed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia after serving a single term.\n\nArchibald was sworn into office in August 1870, in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. He then travelled to Manitoba, and began piecing together the province's first government. There was considerable antagonism between the province's [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] population and recently arrived soldiers from Ontario, and Archibald had difficulties finding suitable candidates to work with him. Until January 1871, the only members of his cabinet were local merchant [[Alfred Boyd]] and [[Marc-Amable Girard]], a recent arrival from Quebec. Archibald himself was the province's ''de facto'' Premier, and often determined policy without consulting his ministers.\n\nDespite opposition from many of the province's Anglophones, Archibald was able to settle the province's electoral boundaries by December 1870. Archibald himself was the leader of the government side in the election which followed; the francophone population was mostly united in support of him, while [[John Christian Schultz]] led a group of ultra-loyalist Anglophones who opposed the conciliation policy. Archibald was successful, as Schultz's opposition won only five seats and Schultz was personally defeated in [[Winnipeg and St. John]].\n\nArchibald put together a five-member cabinet in January 1871, which included Boyd, Girard, [[Henry Joseph Clarke]], [[James Mackay (Canada)|James Mackay]] and [[Thomas Howard (Manitoba politician)|Thomas Howard]] \u2014 a group which balanced the province's ethnic, religious and linguistic divisions. Archibald himself remained the real Premier.\n\nArchibald continued to pursue a policy of conciliation with the province's M\u00e9tis population, encouraging them to register their lands and even meeting with [[Louis Riel]] after an armed M\u00e9tis band had defended the government against [[Fenian]] invaders from America. His real intentions were to prevent another M\u00e9tis uprising in the short-term, and to allow for the gradual hegemony of new Canadian settlers in the region. Nevertheless, the specifics of his conciliation policy were opposed by Macdonald and Howe alike (Howe was by this time Macdonald's Indian Affairs minister). In the face of this opposition, Archibald submitted his resignation in late 1871. Macdonald initially had difficulty finding a replacement and asked Archibald to reconsider. The federal government chose [[Francis Godschall Johnson]] as his replacement on April 9, 1872, but this commission was revoked before Johnson was sworn in. It was not until October 1872 that Archibald returned to [[Ontario]].\n\nArchibald was not immediately appointed to the Nova Scotia court, and was instead made a director of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific Railway Company]] in February 1873. He was finally appointed to the bench in June, but withdrew days later to be appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia (former Conservative Premier [[James W. Johnston]] initially received this appointment, but withdrew due to ill health). This position required less intervention than Archibald had exercised in Manitoba, although he attended cabinet meetings in 1873 and 1874. After 1876, he came to regard the position as primarily ceremonial, and above partisan concerns.\n\nArchibald served as the 4th Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia until June 1883. In 1886, he became President of the [[Nova Scotia Historical Society]], which he had helped to found six years earlier. He courted controversy by a public defence of the 18th-century [[Acadian expulsion]] later in the year.\n\nIn 1888, [[Archibald McLellan]] was appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]]. McLellan had resigned his Senate seat in 1881 and subsequently returned to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. His appointment meant that the riding of Colchester again became vacant, and, ironically, Archibald was again prevailed upon to stand for the riding as a Liberal-Conservative candidate. He was re-elected to the Commons on August 15, 1888, 18 years after his previous departure. Archibald was little involved in the activities of the House following his return, and did not make any speeches. Due to ill health, he did not run again in 1891.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mrs Elizabeth Alice Jones by Parsons, St. John's, Nfld.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mrs Elizabeth Alice Jones (n\u00e9e Archibald) by Parsons, St. John's, Nfld]]\nHon.

It also describes task forces of other ministries (such as the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]' [[ODON]] and [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]]' special rescue unit)<ref>{{cite web|last=Lunev|first=Stanislav|author-link=Stanislav Lunev|url=http://www.sambofrance.org/documents/degradation.html|title=The Degradation of Russia's Special Forces|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> in post-Soviet countries.

The [[5th Spetsnaz Brigade]] of Belarus is such an example of non-Russian Spetsnaz forces.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/gru/5obrsn.htm|title=5th independent military police Brigade GRU|date=3 October 2014|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Russian Marine Commandos Frogmen II.jpg|thumb|[[Russian commando frogmen|Naval Spetsnaz \"Frogmen\"]] performing operations on land, armed with an [[APS underwater rifle|APS Underwater Rifle]].]] -->\n[[File:Special forces Military of Russia 01.jpg|thumb|[[Russian special operations forces|Spetsnaz SSO]] snipers.]]\n\nThe Russian abbreviations ''spetsnaz'' and ''osnaz'' are [[syllabic abbreviation]]s typical{{clarify|date=June 2017|reason=What does 'typical' mean in this context, and according to whom?}} of [[Soviet era]] Russian, for ''spetsialnovo naznacheniya'' and ''osobovo naznacheniya'', both of which may be interpreted as \"special purpose\". As syllabic acronyms they are not normally [[upper case|capitalized]].\n\nThey are general terms that were used for a variety of Soviet [[special operations]] (''spetsoperatsiya'') units. In addition, many ''[[Cheka]]'' and [[Internal Troops]] units (such as ''[[OMSDON]]'' and ''[[ODON]]'') also included ''osobovo naznacheniya'' in their full names. Regular forces assigned to special tasks were sometimes also referred to by terms such as ''spetsnaz'' and ''osnaz''.\n\n''Spetsnaz'' later referred specifically to special (''spetsialnovo'') purpose (''naznacheniya'') or special operations (spetsoperatsiya; ''spec ops'') forces, and the word's widespread use is a relatively recent, post-''[[perestroika]]'' development in Russian language. The Soviet public used to know very little about their country's special forces until many state secrets were disclosed under the ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") policy of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the late 1980s. Since then, stories about ''spetsnaz'' and their purportedly incredible prowess, from the serious to the highly questionable, have captivated the imagination of patriotic Russians, particularly in the midst of the post-Soviet era decay in military and security forces during the era of ''perestroika ''championed by Mikhail Gorbachev and continued under Boris Yeltsin. A number of books about the Soviet military intelligence special forces, such as 1987's ''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/spetsnaz-the-story-behind-the-soviet-sas/oclc/768618982 Spetsnaz: The Story Behind the Soviet SAS]'' by defected [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] agent [[Viktor Suvorov]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spetsnaz. The Story Behind the Soviet SAS|last=Suvorov|first=Victor|publisher=Hamish Hamilton Ltd.|year=1987|isbn=0-241-11961-8|location=London|pages=}}</ref> helped introduce the term to the Western public. In ''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'',<ref>''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'' ({{lang|ru|\u0410\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0443\u043c}}), 1985, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-241-11545-0}}</ref> a book published by Viktor Suvorov after defecting to the west, he alleges that the Spetsnaz used condemned criminals from the Gulag system (even other condemned secret operatives) as \"dolls\" and \"gladiators\" for to-the-death combat training. It is not known when the practice stopped. The author mentions duels to the death becoming more rare during the time of his service due to \"procurement of dolls\" becoming harder. Additionally Suvorov frequently references the co-location of some secret Spetsnaz training facilities that killed prisoners in this way, adjacent to Gulags for this reason.\n\nIn post-Soviet Russia \"''Spetsnaz''\" became a colloquial term as special operations (''spetsoperatsiya''), from police raids to military operations in internal conflicts, grew more common. Coverage of these operations, and the celebrity status of special operations forces in state-controlled media, encouraged the public to identify many of these forces by name: [[SOBR]], [[Alpha Group|Alpha]], [[Vityaz (MVD)|Vityaz]]. The term ''Spetsnaz'' has also continued to be used in several other [[post-Soviet state]]s such as Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan for their own special operations forces.

On 5 July 1941 Admiral [[Arseniy Golovko]] of the [[Northern Fleet]] authorized the formation of a ground reconnaissance detachment. This unit, the [[Russian commando frogmen|4th Special Volunteer Detachment]], was to be recruited from the fleet's athletes and have an initial fill of 65 to 70 personnel. Later the unit was renamed the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Spetsnaz:Russia's Special Forces by Mark Galeotti</ref> The most prominent of these new recruits was [[Viktor Leonov]], who joined the [[Soviet Navy]] in 1937.

It is alleged that through a network of supporting KGB operatives, members of the task force identified each of the perpetrators involved in the crisis; once these had been identified, the team began to take relatives of these militants as hostages. Following the standard Soviet policy of not negotiating with terrorists, some of the hostages taken by Alpha were dismembered, and their body parts sent to the militants. The warning was clear: more would follow unless the remaining hostages were released immediately.

Such tactics, considered revolutionary at the time, would later inspire people like Prussian [[Willy Rohr|Captain Willy Rohr]] in the development of the Prussian [[Stormtrooper]]s (founded in 1915).\n\n===Timeline===\n<div class=\"floatright\">\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:550 height:550\nPlotArea   = width:50 height:530 left:50 bottom:10\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1950 till:1994\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1950\n# there is no automatic collision detection,\n# so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap\nDefine $dx = 25 # shift text to right side of bar\nPlotData=\n  bar:Leaders color:red width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:S\n  from:start till:1950 shift:($dx,5)  text:46 army Spetsnaz companies established by Georgy Zhukov (5,520 men).\n  from:1950  till:1962 shift:($dx,5)  text:Army and fleet Spetsnaz companies expanded to battalions.\n  from:1962  till:1974 shift:($dx,5)  text:Spetsnaz battalions expanded to 16 army and fleet brigades and a number of separate detachments.\n  from:1974  till:1978 shift:($dx,5)  text:First KGB special detachment, Alpha Group, established by Yuri Andropov (30 men).\n  from:1978  till:1979 shift:($dx,5)  text:First MVD special detachment, Vityaz, established by Nikolay Schyolokov (100 men).\n  from:1981  till:1991 shift:($dx,5)  text:Second KGB special detachment, Vega Group (Vympel), established by Yuri Andropov (100 men).\n  from:1991  till:1992 shift:($dx,5)  text:First FSIN special detachment, Saturn, established by Viktor Yerin.\n  from:1992  till:1994 shift:($dx,5)  text:VDV 45th Spetsnaz regiment established by Eugene Podkolzin (655 men).\n</timeline></div>\n\nThe Russian military theorist [[Colonel]] [[Mikhail Svechnikov|Mikhail Svechnykov]] originally proposed the concept of using special tactics and strategies.

These forces were subordinate to [[Front (military formation)|front]] commanders.<ref>Carey Schofield, ''The Russian Elite: Inside Spetsnaz and the Airborne Forces'', Greenhill, London, 1993, p.34-37</ref> The infamous [[NKVD]] internal-security and espionage agency also had their own special purpose (''osnaz'') detachments, including many saboteur teams who were airdropped into enemy-occupied territories to work with (and often take over and lead) the [[Soviet Partisans]].\n\nIn 1950 [[Georgy Zhukov]] advocated the creation of 46 military ''spetsnaz'' companies, each consisting of 120 servicemen. This was the first use of ''\"spetsnaz\"'' to denote a separate military branch since [[World War II]]. These companies were later expanded to battalions and then to brigades. However, some separate companies (orSpN) and detachments (ooSpN) existed with brigades until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe special-purpose forces of the Armed Forces of the [[Soviet Union]] included fourteen land brigades, two naval brigades and a number of separate detachments and companies, operating under the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)|Main Intelligence Directorate]] (GRU) and collectively known as [[Spetsnaz GRU]]. These units and formations existed in the highest possible secrecy, disguised as [[Russian Airborne Troops|Soviet paratroopers]] (Army spetsnaz) or [[Soviet Naval Infantry|naval infantrymen]] (Naval spetsnaz) by their uniforms and insignia.\n\nTwenty-four years after the birth of Spetsnaz, the Chairman of the KGB General [[Yuri Andropov]] (in that office from 1967 to 1982) established the first counter-terrorist unit. From the late 1970s through to the 1980s, a number of special-purpose units were founded in the KGB (1954\u20131991) and in the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) (1946\u20131954).\n\nDuring the 1990s special detachments were established within the [[Federal Penitentiary Service]] (FSIN) and the [[Russian Airborne Troops|Airborne Troops]] (VDV). Some civil agencies with non-police functions have formed special units also known as ''Spetsnaz'', such as the Leader special centre in the [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] (MChS).\n\nIn total, by December 1991, at the time of the collapse of the USSR, the GRU reconnaissance and sabotage formations had:\n* 14 special purpose brigades \n* 2 special purposes regiments\n* 29 independent special purpose companies \n* 5 naval reconnaissance point\n\nIn 2013 a Special Operations Forces Command was established for Special Operations Forces which had earlier been established from around 2009 following a study of Western special-operations forces units and commands. The Command was not under the control of the GRU but reported directly to the General Staff \u2013 as did the GRU.<ref name=\"Newsru2013\" />\n\n==List and structure of Soviet and Russian military special forces==\nThe elite units of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and [[Russian Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]] are controlled, for the most part, by the military-intelligence [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] ([[Spetsnaz GRU]]) under the General Staff. They were heavily involved in secret operations and training pro-Soviet forces during the [[Cold War]] and in the wars in Afghanistan during the 1980s and Chechnya during the 1990s and 2000s.

It is tasked with the protection of strategic installations, such as factories and transportation centers. With its Alpha counterparts, it is heavily used in the North Caucasus. Vympel has four operative units in Moscow, with branch offices in nearly every city containing a nuclear power plant.\n\nSpetsgruppa \"S\", abbreviation of the Directorate C (Russian Cyrillic for S), also known as Smerch, but also known as the Service of Special Operations (\u0421\u0421\u041e), is a relatively new unit formed in July 1999. Officers from Smerch are frequently involved with the capture and transfer of various bandit and criminal leaders who help aid disruption in the North Caucasus and throughout Russia. Operations include both direct action against bandit holdouts in Southern Russia as well as high-profile arrests in more densely populated cities and guarding government officials. Because of its initials, this group is casually referred to as \"Smerch\". With the Centre of Special Operations and its elite units, many FSB special forces units operate at the regional level.

Nevertheless, there were some rumors that such group does indeed exist and is assigned to execute very specific special operations abroad primarily for protection of Russian embassy personnel and internal investigations.

The [[5th Spetsnaz Brigade]] of Belarus is such an example of non-Russian Spetsnaz forces.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/gru/5obrsn.htm|title=5th independent military police Brigade GRU|date=3 October 2014|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Russian Marine Commandos Frogmen II.jpg|thumb|[[Russian commando frogmen|Naval Spetsnaz \"Frogmen\"]] performing operations on land, armed with an [[APS underwater rifle|APS Underwater Rifle]].]] -->\n[[File:Special forces Military of Russia 01.jpg|thumb|[[Russian special operations forces|Spetsnaz SSO]] snipers.]]\n\nThe Russian abbreviations ''spetsnaz'' and ''osnaz'' are [[syllabic abbreviation]]s typical{{clarify|date=June 2017|reason=What does 'typical' mean in this context, and according to whom?}} of [[Soviet era]] Russian, for ''spetsialnovo naznacheniya'' and ''osobovo naznacheniya'', both of which may be interpreted as \"special purpose\". As syllabic acronyms they are not normally [[upper case|capitalized]].\n\nThey are general terms that were used for a variety of Soviet [[special operations]] (''spetsoperatsiya'') units. In addition, many ''[[Cheka]]'' and [[Internal Troops]] units (such as ''[[OMSDON]]'' and ''[[ODON]]'') also included ''osobovo naznacheniya'' in their full names. Regular forces assigned to special tasks were sometimes also referred to by terms such as ''spetsnaz'' and ''osnaz''.\n\n''Spetsnaz'' later referred specifically to special (''spetsialnovo'') purpose (''naznacheniya'') or special operations (spetsoperatsiya; ''spec ops'') forces, and the word's widespread use is a relatively recent, post-''[[perestroika]]'' development in Russian language. The Soviet public used to know very little about their country's special forces until many state secrets were disclosed under the ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") policy of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the late 1980s. Since then, stories about ''spetsnaz'' and their purportedly incredible prowess, from the serious to the highly questionable, have captivated the imagination of patriotic Russians, particularly in the midst of the post-Soviet era decay in military and security forces during the era of ''perestroika ''championed by Mikhail Gorbachev and continued under Boris Yeltsin. A number of books about the Soviet military intelligence special forces, such as 1987's ''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/spetsnaz-the-story-behind-the-soviet-sas/oclc/768618982 Spetsnaz: The Story Behind the Soviet SAS]'' by defected [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] agent [[Viktor Suvorov]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spetsnaz. The Story Behind the Soviet SAS|last=Suvorov|first=Victor|publisher=Hamish Hamilton Ltd.|year=1987|isbn=0-241-11961-8|location=London|pages=}}</ref> helped introduce the term to the Western public. In ''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'',<ref>''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'' ({{lang|ru|\u0410\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0443\u043c}}), 1985, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-241-11545-0}}</ref> a book published by Viktor Suvorov after defecting to the west, he alleges that the Spetsnaz used condemned criminals from the Gulag system (even other condemned secret operatives) as \"dolls\" and \"gladiators\" for to-the-death combat training. It is not known when the practice stopped. The author mentions duels to the death becoming more rare during the time of his service due to \"procurement of dolls\" becoming harder. Additionally Suvorov frequently references the co-location of some secret Spetsnaz training facilities that killed prisoners in this way, adjacent to Gulags for this reason.\n\nIn post-Soviet Russia \"''Spetsnaz''\" became a colloquial term as special operations (''spetsoperatsiya''), from police raids to military operations in internal conflicts, grew more common. Coverage of these operations, and the celebrity status of special operations forces in state-controlled media, encouraged the public to identify many of these forces by name: [[SOBR]], [[Alpha Group|Alpha]], [[Vityaz (MVD)|Vityaz]]. The term ''Spetsnaz'' has also continued to be used in several other [[post-Soviet state]]s such as Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan for their own special operations forces. In Russia, foreign special operations forces are also known as \"Spetsnaz\" (for example, [[United States special operations forces]] would be called \"''amerikanskiy spetsnaz''\"). {{Clear}}\n\n==Known operations history==\n===Second World War===\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0412. \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Leonov]] helped lay the foundation for modern day [[Russian commando frogmen|Naval Spetsnaz]] operations.]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], it became clear early on for Soviet leadership that it had an urgent need for immediate intelligence on German land forces in northern Norway and Finland. On 5 July 1941 Admiral [[Arseniy Golovko]] of the [[Northern Fleet]] authorized the formation of a ground reconnaissance detachment. This unit, the [[Russian commando frogmen|4th Special Volunteer Detachment]], was to be recruited from the fleet's athletes and have an initial fill of 65 to 70 personnel. Later the unit was renamed the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Spetsnaz:Russia's Special Forces by Mark Galeotti</ref> The most prominent of these new recruits was [[Viktor Leonov]], who joined the [[Soviet Navy]] in 1937.

Leonov along with Capt. Kulebyakin and 140 men, landed on a Japanese airfield at [[Port Vonsan]], not realizing they were opposed by over 3,500 enemy soldiers.

On 16 November 2007, the [[BBC]] and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that Eduard Koltsov, a [[Russian commando frogmen|Soviet frogman]], claimed to have caught Crabb placing a mine on the [[Sverdlov-class cruiser|''Ordzhonikidze'']] hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat.

The Kremlin had been informed of the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats by the militant group, the Islamic Liberation Organization (a radical offshoot of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]). It was believed that this was retaliation for the Soviet support of [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Syrian involvement]] in the [[Lebanese Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=4072 |title=Terrorist Organization Profile: Islamic Liberation Organization|publisher=University of Maryland |accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref> However, by the time Alpha arrived, one of the hostages had already been killed. It is alleged that through a network of supporting KGB operatives, members of the task force identified each of the perpetrators involved in the crisis; once these had been identified, the team began to take relatives of these militants as hostages. Following the standard Soviet policy of not negotiating with terrorists, some of the hostages taken by Alpha were dismembered, and their body parts sent to the militants. The warning was clear: more would follow unless the remaining hostages were released immediately. The show of force worked, and for 20 years, no Soviet or Russian officials was taken captive, until the 2006 [[Abduction of Russian diplomats in Iraq|abduction and murder]] of four Russian embassy staff in [[Iraq]].\n\nHowever, the veracity of this story has been brought into question. Another version says that the release of the Soviet hostages was the result of extensive diplomatic negotiations with the spiritual leader of [[Hezbollah]], Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah]], who appealed to King [[Hussein of Jordan]] and the leaders of Libya and Iran to use their influence on the kidnappers.<ref>{{cite web| language = Russian |url=http://www.chekist.ru/article/2257 |title=\u0412\u044f\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u041b\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0443\u043b. \u0411\u0435\u0439\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043a\u0438/Vyacheslav Lashkul |trans-title=The Beirut Soviet intelligence operations |publisher=Chekist.ru |date=31 March 2006 |accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===After the breakup of Soviet Union===\nAfter the collapse of the USSR, Spetsnaz forces of the Soviet Union's newly formed republics took part in many local conflicts such as the [[Civil war in Tajikistan]], [[Chechen\u2013Russian conflict|Chechen Wars]], [[Russo-Georgian War]] and the [[Crimea Crisis]].

This was the first use of ''\"spetsnaz\"'' to denote a separate military branch since [[World War II]]. These companies were later expanded to battalions and then to brigades. However, some separate companies (orSpN) and detachments (ooSpN) existed with brigades until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe special-purpose forces of the Armed Forces of the [[Soviet Union]] included fourteen land brigades, two naval brigades and a number of separate detachments and companies, operating under the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)|Main Intelligence Directorate]] (GRU) and collectively known as [[Spetsnaz GRU]]. These units and formations existed in the highest possible secrecy, disguised as [[Russian Airborne Troops|Soviet paratroopers]] (Army spetsnaz) or [[Soviet Naval Infantry|naval infantrymen]] (Naval spetsnaz) by their uniforms and insignia.\n\nTwenty-four years after the birth of Spetsnaz, the Chairman of the KGB General [[Yuri Andropov]] (in that office from 1967 to 1982) established the first counter-terrorist unit. From the late 1970s through to the 1980s, a number of special-purpose units were founded in the KGB (1954\u20131991) and in the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) (1946\u20131954).\n\nDuring the 1990s special detachments were established within the [[Federal Penitentiary Service]] (FSIN) and the [[Russian Airborne Troops|Airborne Troops]] (VDV). Some civil agencies with non-police functions have formed special units also known as ''Spetsnaz'', such as the Leader special centre in the [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] (MChS).\n\nIn total, by December 1991, at the time of the collapse of the USSR, the GRU reconnaissance and sabotage formations had:\n* 14 special purpose brigades \n* 2 special purposes regiments\n* 29 independent special purpose companies \n* 5 naval reconnaissance point\n\nIn 2013 a Special Operations Forces Command was established for Special Operations Forces which had earlier been established from around 2009 following a study of Western special-operations forces units and commands.

Other units are stationed in [[Moscow]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Khabarovsk]]. All Alpha operators undergo airborne, mountain and counter-sabotage dive training. Alpha has operated in other countries, most notably [[Operation Storm-333]] (when Alpha and Zenith detachments supported the 154th Independent Spetsnaz Detachment\u2014known as the \"Muslim Battalion\"\u2014of the GRU on a mission to overthrow and kill Afghan president [[Hafizullah Amin]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Take-Down of Kabul: An Effective Coup de Main |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2002/MOUTGrau.htm |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org | accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nSpetsgruppa \"V\", abbreviation of the Directorate \u0432 (Russian Cyrillic for V), also known as \"Vega\" in period 1993\u20131995, was formed in 1981, merging two elite Cold War-era KGB special units\u2014Cascade (''Kaskad'') and Zenith (''Zenit'')\u2014which were similar to the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] (responsible for clandestine / covert operations involving sabotage and assassination in other countries) and re-designated for counter-terrorist and counter-sabotage operations. It is tasked with the protection of strategic installations, such as factories and transportation centers. With its Alpha counterparts, it is heavily used in the North Caucasus. Vympel has four operative units in Moscow, with branch offices in nearly every city containing a nuclear power plant.\n\nSpetsgruppa \"S\", abbreviation of the Directorate C (Russian Cyrillic for S), also known as Smerch, but also known as the Service of Special Operations (\u0421\u0421\u041e), is a relatively new unit formed in July 1999. Officers from Smerch are frequently involved with the capture and transfer of various bandit and criminal leaders who help aid disruption in the North Caucasus and throughout Russia. Operations include both direct action against bandit holdouts in Southern Russia as well as high-profile arrests in more densely populated cities and guarding government officials. Because of its initials, this group is casually referred to as \"Smerch\". With the Centre of Special Operations and its elite units, many FSB special forces units operate at the regional level. These detachments are usually known as ROSN or ROSO (Regional Department of Special Designation), such as [[Saint Petersburg]]'s ''Grad'' (Hail) or [[Murmansk]]'s ''Kasatka'' (Orca).\n\n==Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation==\nThe [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR RF]], formerly the [[First Chief Directorate]] of the KGB of the USSR, has its own top secret elite special force within the Operations Department of Directorate Z known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Zaslon (SVR)|ru|3=\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043d (\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435)|lt=Zaslon}} (\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043d) (meaning Screen, Barrier or Shield) about which extremely little is known.

Nevertheless, there were some rumors that such group does indeed exist and is assigned to execute very specific special operations abroad primarily for protection of Russian embassy personnel and internal investigations. It is believed that the group is deep undercover and consists of approximately 300\u2013500 highly experienced operatives speaking several languages and having extensive record of operations while serving in other secret units of the Russian military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vietnamdefence.com/Home/tinhbaoanninh/chiendichtinhbao/Pho-Thu-tuong-Nga-bat-can-tiet-lo-don-vi-dac-nhiem-hanh-dong-cua-tinh-bao-Nga/20145/53688.vnd|title=Vietnamdefence.com \u2013 Tin Qu\u00e2n s\u1ef1 24h|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.blouinnews.com/blouinbeatpolitics/2013/05/10/special-force-deployment-to-syria-may-signal-moscows-doubts/|title=Special force deployment to Syria may signal Moscow's doubts|work=BLOUIN BEAT: Politics|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-zaslon-special-operations-2013-5|title=Russian Zaslon Special Operations \u2013 Business Insider|date=19 May 2013|work=Business Insider|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Soviet MVD and Russian National Guard special forces==\n[[File:VVday2015 47.jpg|thumb|604th Special Purpose Centre operator.]]\n[[File:Beret-water.jpg|thumb|right|Water obstacle phase during tryouts for the OSN [[Maroon Beret]].]]\n[[File:Interpolitex 2012 (477-12).jpg|thumb|SURPAT wearing OSN \"Grom\" operator of the Russian [[Federal Drug Control Service]].]]\nThe special missions units of the [[National Guard of Russia]] (consolidated and replaced the forces of the [[Internal Troops of Russia|MVD Internal Troops]], [[SOBR]], [[OMON]]) includes a number of [[Internal Troops of Russia|Russian Internal Troops]] (VV, successor to the Soviet [[Internal Troops]]) paramilitary units to combat internal threats to the government, such as insurgencies and mutinies.

It involves the manipulation of the [[endocrine system]] through exogenous or external administration of specific [[hormone]]s, particularly [[steroid hormone]]s, or drugs which inhibit the production or activity of such hormones ([[hormone antagonist]]s). Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of [[gene expression]] in certain cancer [[cell (biology)|cells]], changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing, or even undergo [[cell death]]. Surgical removal of endocrine organs, such as [[orchiectomy]] and [[oophorectomy]] can also be employed as a form of hormonal therapy. \n\nHormonal therapy is used for several types of cancers derived from hormonally responsive [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], including the [[breast cancer|breast]], [[prostate cancer|prostate]], [[endometrial cancer|endometrium]], and [[adrenocortical carcinoma|adrenal cortex]]. Hormonal therapy may also be used in the treatment of [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]s or to ameliorate certain cancer- and [[chemotherapy]]-associated [[symptom]]s, such as [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]]. Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in [[oncology]] is the use of the ''selective estrogen-response modulator'' [[tamoxifen]] for the treatment of [[breast cancer]], although another class of hormonal agents, [[aromatase inhibitor]]s, now have an expanding role in that disease. \n\n==Inhibitors of hormone synthesis==\n\n[[File:Nolvadex.jpg|thumb|Nolvadex ([[tamoxifen]]) 20 mg tablets]]\n[[File:Arimidex.jpg|thumb|Arimidex ([[anastrozole]]) 1 mg tablets]]\n\nOne effective strategy for starving tumor cells of growth- and survival-promoting hormones is to use drugs which inhibit the production of those hormones in their organ of origin.\n\n===Aromatase inhibitors===\n[[Aromatase inhibitor]]s are an important class of drugs used for the treatment of [[breast cancer]] in [[menopause|postmenopausal]] women. At menopause, [[estrogen]] production in the ovaries ceases, but other tissues continue to produce estrogen through the action of the enzyme [[aromatase]] on [[androgen]]s produced by the [[adrenal gland]]s. When the action of aromatase is blocked, estrogen levels in post-menopausal women can drop to extremely low levels, causing growth arrest and/or apoptosis of hormone-responsive cancer cells.\n[[File:Letrozole.svg|thumb|150px|left|[[Letrozole]]]]\n[[Letrozole]] and [[anastrozole]] are aromatase inhibitors which have been shown to be superior to [[tamoxifen]] for the first-line treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/> [[Exemestane]] is an irreversible \"aromatase inactivator\" which is superior to [[megestrol acetate]] for treatment of [[tamoxifen]]-refractory metastatic breast cancer, and does not appear to have the [[osteoporosis]]-promoting side effects of other drugs in this class.<ref name=\"DeVita\">{{cite book |editor1-last=DeVita |editor1-first=Vincent T. |editor2-last=Hellman |editor2-first=Samuel |editor3-last=Rosenberg |editor3-first=Steven A. |year=2005 |title=Cancer: principles & practice of oncology |publisher=[[J.

It was formerly used for [[breast cancer]] treatment, but has since been replaced by more selective aromatase inhibitors. It can also be used for the treatment of hyperadrenocortical syndromes, such as [[Cushing's syndrome]] and [[Conn's syndrome|hyperaldosteronism]] in [[adrenocortical carcinoma]].<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n===GnRH analogues===\nAnalogs of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) can be used to induce a [[chemical castration]], that is, complete suppression of the production of estrogen and progesterone from the female [[ovary|ovaries]], or complete suppression of [[testosterone]] production from the male [[testis|testes]]. This is due to a negative feedback effect of continuous stimulation of  the [[pituitary]] gland by these hormones. [[Leuprorelin]] and [[goserelin]] are GnRH analogs which are used primarily for the treatment of hormone-responsive [[prostate cancer]]. Because the initial [[endocrine]] response to GnRH analogs is actually hypersecretion of gonadal steroids, hormone receptor antagonists such as [[flutamide]] are typically used to prevent a transient boost in tumor growth.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n==Hormone receptor antagonists==\n[[Hormone antagonists|Hormone receptor antagonists]] bind to the normal receptor for a given hormone and prevent its activation. The target receptor may be on the cell surface, as in the case of peptide and glycoprotein hormones, or it may be intracellular, as in the case of [[steroid hormone]] receptors.\n\n===Selective estrogen receptor modulators===\n[[File:Tamoxifen.svg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tamoxifen]]]]\n\n''[[Selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s'' (SERMs) are an important class of hormonal therapy agents which act as antagonists of the estrogen receptor and are used primarily for the treatment and [[chemoprevention]] of [[breast cancer]]. Some members of this family, such as [[tamoxifen]], are actually [[partial agonist]]s, which can actually ''increase'' estrogen receptor signalling in some tissues, such as the [[endometrium]]. Tamoxifen<ref>[https://www.voiceofcancerpatients.com/breast-cancer/drugs/tamoxifen Voice of Cancer Patients an online cancer patients community]</ref> is currently first-line treatment for nearly all [[menopause|pre-menopausal]] women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/> [[Raloxifene]] is another partial agonist SERM which does not seem to promote [[endometrial cancer]], and is used primarily for [[chemoprevention]] of breast cancer in high-risk individuals, as well as to prevent [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\"DeVita\"/> [[Toremifene]] and [[fulvestrant]] are SERMs with little or no agonist activity, and are used for treatment of [[metastasis|metastatic]] breast cancer.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n===Antiandrogens===\n[[Antiandrogen]]s are a class of drug which bind and inhibit the [[androgen receptor]], blocking the growth- and survival-promoting effects of [[testosterone]] on certain [[prostate cancer]]s. [[Flutamide]] and [[bicalutamide]] are antiandrogens which are frequently used in the treatment of prostate cancer, either as long-term monotherapy, or in the initial few weeks of GnRH analog therapy.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/> (See also [[Androgen deprivation therapy]])\n\n==Hormone supplementation==\n[[File:Megestrol_acetate.svg|thumb|150px|left|[[Megestrol acetate]]]]\n\nWhile most hormonal therapy strategies seek to block hormone signalling to cancer cells, there are some instances in which supplementation with specific hormone agonists may have a growth-inhibiting, or even cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. Because many hormones can produce antagonism and feedback inhibition of the synthesis of other hormones, there is significant overlap between this concept and those discussed above.\n\n===Progestogens===\n[[Progestin]]s ([[progesterone]]-like drugs) such as [[megestrol acetate]] and [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] have been used for the treatment of hormone-responsive, advanced [[breast cancer]], [[endometrial cancer]], and [[prostate cancer]]. Progestins are also used in the treatment of [[endometrial hyperplasia]], a precursor to endometrial adenocarcinoma. The exact mechanism of action of these hormones is unclear, and may involve both direct effect on the tumor cells (suppression of estrogen receptor levels, alteration of hormone metabolism, direct cytotoxicity) and indirect endocrine effects (suppression of adrenal androgen production and plasma estrone sulfate formation).<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n===Androgens===\n[[Fluoxymesterone]], an [[anabolic steroid]] (testosterone-like) medication, is occasionally used for the treatment of advanced [[breast cancer]]. The mechanism of the anticancer effects of this androgen in breast cancer are unclear, but may be analogous to those of progestins.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n===Estrogens===\nThe [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) is occasionally used to treat [[prostate cancer]] through suppression of testosterone production. It was previously used in the treatment of [[breast cancer]], but has been replaced by more effective and less toxic agents. [[Estrace]] is an estrogen which was also formerly used for [[antiandrogen]] therapy of prostate cancer.<ref name=\"G&G\">{{cite book |author=Laurence L. Brunton, editor-in-chief; John S.

Octreotide is used for suppression of the hormonal syndromes which accompany several pancreatic [[islet cell tumor]]s, including the [[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]] of [[gastrinoma]] and the chronic [[hypoglycemia]] of [[insulinoma]]. It is also effective in suppression of the [[carcinoid syndrome]], caused by advanced or extra-[[gastrointestinal system|gastrointestinal]] [[carcinoid]] tumors. Octreotide may also be used for treatment of severe diarrhea caused by [[5-fluorouracil]] [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiation therapy]].<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n==Non-medical hormonal interventions==\nIn addition to the use of medication to produce tumor-suppressing endocrine alterations, destruction of endocrine organs through [[surgery]] or [[radiation therapy]] are also possible. Surgical [[castration]], or removal of the [[testes]] in males and [[ovaries]] in females, have been widely used in the past to treat hormone-responsive [[prostate cancer]] and [[breast cancer]] respectively.

When the action of aromatase is blocked, estrogen levels in post-menopausal women can drop to extremely low levels, causing growth arrest and/or apoptosis of hormone-responsive cancer cells.\n[[File:Letrozole.svg|thumb|150px|left|[[Letrozole]]]]\n[[Letrozole]] and [[anastrozole]] are aromatase inhibitors which have been shown to be superior to [[tamoxifen]] for the first-line treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/> [[Exemestane]] is an irreversible \"aromatase inactivator\" which is superior to [[megestrol acetate]] for treatment of [[tamoxifen]]-refractory metastatic breast cancer, and does not appear to have the [[osteoporosis]]-promoting side effects of other drugs in this class.<ref name=\"DeVita\">{{cite book |editor1-last=DeVita |editor1-first=Vincent T. |editor2-last=Hellman |editor2-first=Samuel |editor3-last=Rosenberg |editor3-first=Steven A. |year=2005 |title=Cancer: principles & practice of oncology |publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott & Co.|Lippincott]] |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7817-4865-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Aminoglutethimide]] inhibits both [[aromatase]] and other enzymes critical for steroid hormone synthesis in the [[adrenal gland]]s. It was formerly used for [[breast cancer]] treatment, but has since been replaced by more selective aromatase inhibitors. It can also be used for the treatment of hyperadrenocortical syndromes, such as [[Cushing's syndrome]] and [[Conn's syndrome|hyperaldosteronism]] in [[adrenocortical carcinoma]].<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n===GnRH analogues===\nAnalogs of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) can be used to induce a [[chemical castration]], that is, complete suppression of the production of estrogen and progesterone from the female [[ovary|ovaries]], or complete suppression of [[testosterone]] production from the male [[testis|testes]]. This is due to a negative feedback effect of continuous stimulation of  the [[pituitary]] gland by these hormones. [[Leuprorelin]] and [[goserelin]] are GnRH analogs which are used primarily for the treatment of hormone-responsive [[prostate cancer]]. Because the initial [[endocrine]] response to GnRH analogs is actually hypersecretion of gonadal steroids, hormone receptor antagonists such as [[flutamide]] are typically used to prevent a transient boost in tumor growth.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n==Hormone receptor antagonists==\n[[Hormone antagonists|Hormone receptor antagonists]] bind to the normal receptor for a given hormone and prevent its activation. The target receptor may be on the cell surface, as in the case of peptide and glycoprotein hormones, or it may be intracellular, as in the case of [[steroid hormone]] receptors.\n\n===Selective estrogen receptor modulators===\n[[File:Tamoxifen.svg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tamoxifen]]]]\n\n''[[Selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s'' (SERMs) are an important class of hormonal therapy agents which act as antagonists of the estrogen receptor and are used primarily for the treatment and [[chemoprevention]] of [[breast cancer]]. Some members of this family, such as [[tamoxifen]], are actually [[partial agonist]]s, which can actually ''increase'' estrogen receptor signalling in some tissues, such as the [[endometrium]]. Tamoxifen is currently first-line treatment for nearly all [[menopause|pre-menopausal]] women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/> [[Raloxifene]] is another partial agonist SERM which does not seem to promote [[endometrial cancer]], and is used primarily for [[chemoprevention]] of breast cancer in high-risk individuals, as well as to prevent [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\"DeVita\"/> [[Toremifene]] and [[fulvestrant]] are SERMs with little or no agonist activity, and are used for treatment of [[metastasis|metastatic]] breast cancer.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n===Antiandrogens===\n[[Antiandrogen]]s are a class of drug which bind and inhibit the [[androgen receptor]], blocking the growth- and survival-promoting effects of [[testosterone]] on certain [[prostate cancer]]s. [[Flutamide]] and [[bicalutamide]] are antiandrogens which are frequently used in the treatment of prostate cancer, either as long-term monotherapy, or in the initial few weeks of GnRH analog therapy.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/> (See also [[Androgen deprivation therapy]])\n\n==Hormone supplementation==\n[[File:Megestrol_acetate.svg|thumb|150px|left|[[Megestrol acetate]]]]\n\nWhile most hormonal therapy strategies seek to block hormone signalling to cancer cells, there are some instances in which supplementation with specific hormone agonists may have a growth-inhibiting, or even cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. Because many hormones can produce antagonism and feedback inhibition of the synthesis of other hormones, there is significant overlap between this concept and those discussed above.\n\n===Progestogens===\n[[Progestin]]s ([[progesterone]]-like drugs) such as [[megestrol acetate]] and [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] have been used for the treatment of hormone-responsive, advanced [[breast cancer]], [[endometrial cancer]], and [[prostate cancer]]. Progestins are also used in the treatment of [[endometrial hyperplasia]], a precursor to endometrial adenocarcinoma. The exact mechanism of action of these hormones is unclear, and may involve both direct effect on the tumor cells (suppression of estrogen receptor levels, alteration of hormone metabolism, direct cytotoxicity) and indirect endocrine effects (suppression of adrenal androgen production and plasma estrone sulfate formation).<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n===Androgens===\n[[Fluoxymesterone]], an [[anabolic steroid]] (testosterone-like) medication, is occasionally used for the treatment of advanced [[breast cancer]]. The mechanism of the anticancer effects of this androgen in breast cancer are unclear, but may be analogous to those of progestins.<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n===Estrogens===\nThe [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) is occasionally used to treat [[prostate cancer]] through suppression of testosterone production. It was previously used in the treatment of [[breast cancer]], but has been replaced by more effective and less toxic agents. [[Estrace]] is an estrogen which was also formerly used for [[antiandrogen]] therapy of prostate cancer.<ref name=\"G&G\">{{cite book |author=Laurence L. Brunton, editor-in-chief; John S.

Octreotide is used for suppression of the hormonal syndromes which accompany several pancreatic [[islet cell tumor]]s, including the [[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]] of [[gastrinoma]] and the chronic [[hypoglycemia]] of [[insulinoma]]. It is also effective in suppression of the [[carcinoid syndrome]], caused by advanced or extra-[[gastrointestinal system|gastrointestinal]] [[carcinoid]] tumors. Octreotide may also be used for treatment of severe diarrhea caused by [[5-fluorouracil]] [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiation therapy]].<ref name=\"DeVita\"/>\n\n==Non-medical hormonal interventions==\nIn addition to the use of medication to produce tumor-suppressing endocrine alterations, destruction of endocrine organs through [[surgery]] or [[radiation therapy]] are also possible. Surgical [[castration]], or removal of the [[testes]] in males and [[ovaries]] in females, have been widely used in the past to treat hormone-responsive [[prostate cancer]] and [[breast cancer]] respectively. However, these invasive methods have been widely supplanted by the use of GnRH agonists, and other forms of pharmacologic castration.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite book |author=Edited by Robert Leon Souhami |title=Oxford Textbook of Oncology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-19-262926-3 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>\n\nThere are still situations in which surgical castration may be beneficial such as in special cases for women with high risk [[BRCA mutation]]s.\n\n==Hormonal immunotherapy==\n''For more information on this topic, see [[Immunotherapy]]''\n\nHormonal stimulation of the immune system with [[interferon]]s and [[cytokines]] has been used to treat specific cancers, including [[renal cell carcinoma]] and [[melanoma]]. \n\n==See also==\n* [[List of hormonal cytostatic antineoplastic agents]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Androgens and antiandrogens}}\n{{Estrogens and antiestrogens}}\n{{Progestogens and antiprogestogens}}\n\n[[Category:Cancer hormone therapy]]\n[[Category:Hormonal antineoplastic drugs]]\n", "name_user": "Mahika khatri", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSelective estrogen receptor modulators", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_therapy_(oncology)"}

In particular, the court invalidated Ministry of Health Protection Measures that introduced curfew, banned hospital visits and banned selected retail sale and services. The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not by Ministry of Health alone. Both curfew and retail sale ban were originally adopted by Government Resolutions on 14 and 15 March respectively, however then they were replaced by a Ministry of Health Protection Measures from 24 March onwards. The court invalidated these measures from 27 April onwards, giving the Government three days to remedy the situation. Ministry of Health may lodge appeal to Supreme Administrative Court.

In particular, the court invalidated Ministry of Health Protection Measures that introduced curfew, banned hospital visits and banned selected retail sale and services. The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not by Ministry of Health alone. Both curfew and retail sale ban were originally adopted by Government Resolutions on 14 and 15 March respectively, however then they were replaced by a Ministry of Health Protection Measures from 24 March onwards. The court invalidated these measures from 27 April onwards, giving the Government three days to remedy the situation. Ministry of Health may lodge appeal to Supreme Administrative Court.

{"title_page": "Addled Parliament", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Parliaments of England 1601}}\n\nThe '''Parliament of 1614''' was the second [[Parliament of England]] of the reign of [[James VI and I]], which sat between 5 April and 7 June 1614. Lasting only two months and two days, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20131625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]];{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} as his slogan went: \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, with proceeding through five sessions, before James dissolved it,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, in hopes of assuaging outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, proposals for unification faced such criticism from MPs that the idea was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the [[Gunpowder Plot]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to [[Bubonic plague|plague]], the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|The feudal duty of impositions were an invaluable source of extra-parliamentary income for James, bringing the Crown \u00a370,000 a year. This sum would only increase with the growth of trade in England;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} by the 1630s, they brought the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament was outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hopes of securing any more financial support from Parliament, James grew impatient. On 31 December 1610, James publicly proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament had ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} [[Conspicuous consumption]] had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98\u201399}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed this summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, in 1614, James reluctantly summoned another parliament. [[Writs of election]] were issued on 19 February that year.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Preparations===\n[[File:Randolph Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] for the Addled Parliament. Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344\u2013345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251\u2013252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221\u2013222}} and James had unapologetically packed the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's anger at this.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} An atypically large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament;{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors had seats in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222\u2013223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the Crown's ambitions.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} The [[Privy Council]], in actuality, seemed more apathetic with regards to appointing useful Parliamentary officials. Few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], judge and MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41\u201342}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in [[9th Parliament of Queen Elizabeth I|1597\u201398]] and an appearance on two minor legal counsels; his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience at dealing with rowdy MPs was no doubt among the factors that allowed Parliament to descend into disorder, as it rapidly did.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though a spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies. Such an ostensibly tolerant doctrine was a novelty in James's time.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}}}} the second ({{lang|la|bona corporis}}), assuring parliament of the security of the [[Stuart dynasty]]; and the third ({{lang|la|bona fortunae}}), stating his financial necessity, and his aim not to bargain with Parliament any longer, but ask of their good will.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=226}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=80\u201382}} All but the religious aspect of this speech bore the unmistakable stamp of Bacon's influence.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=82}} Notably missing from the speech was any promise of compromise or reformation from the king.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} In the same speech, he stringently denied any sanction of Neville's undertaking,{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} but speculation on the conspiracy was already widespread.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Neville's plan had, by now, been twisted into a far-reaching conspiracy of the king's court.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} English diplomat Sir [[Thomas Roe]] was the first to allege that the rumours were promulgated by the Earl of Northampton's crypto-Catholic faction, who wanted the king to instead look for funds in a [[marital alliance]] with Catholic Spain, thus favouring parliament's failure.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}} The idea that Northampton masterminded many of the factors in the failure of this Parliament has been accepted by most later historians,{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 533: \"Northampton was accused by some contemporaries and most later historians of engineering the abrupt dissolution of the Addled Parliament in 1614\"}} but has met with the notable rejection of Northampton's biographer, [[Linda Levy Peck]].{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 535: \"Secondly, the one thing that every schoolboy knows about Northampton - that he destroyed the Addled Parliament of 1614 - might be questioned\"}}\n\nSuspicions only compounded as Parliament proceeded, with the revelation that the king had corresponded with influential subjects in the hopes of securing the election of the sympathetic.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} The House of Commons was divided between those who accepted the conspiracy and those who rejected it.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Commons thus immediately set about investigating the preceding elections for signs of misconduct.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} Though little more was established, it was found that [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], Sir [[Thomas Parry (ambassador)|Thomas Parry]] had swayed the election in [[Stockbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockbridge]]. For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had conclusively been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} However, by the end, resentment against the undertakers had evaporated. Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation of Parliament after some time, seeing him as helping the king to remedy their grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116\u2013117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130\u2013131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broken down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132\u2013133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinacy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was still deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially its Scottish members, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}} Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament. Shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. Northampton's goals were finally fulfilled, seeing the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with [[royal assent]], and thus was not constitutionally a Parliament.

Lasting only two months and two days, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20131625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]];{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} as his slogan went: \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, with proceeding through five sessions, before James dissolved it,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, in hopes of assuaging outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, proposals for unification faced such criticism from MPs that the idea was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the [[Gunpowder Plot]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to [[Bubonic plague|plague]], the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|The feudal duty of impositions were an invaluable source of extra-parliamentary income for James, bringing the Crown \u00a370,000 a year. This sum would only increase with the growth of trade in England;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} by the 1630s, they brought the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament was outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hopes of securing any more financial support from Parliament, James grew impatient. On 31 December 1610, James publicly proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament had ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} [[Conspicuous consumption]] had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98\u201399}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed this summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, in 1614, James reluctantly summoned another parliament.

Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344\u2013345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251\u2013252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221\u2013222}} and James had unapologetically packed the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]].

James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's anger at this.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} An atypically large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament;{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors had seats in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222\u2013223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the Crown's ambitions.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} The [[Privy Council]], in actuality, seemed more apathetic with regards to appointing useful Parliamentary officials. Few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], judge and MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41\u201342}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in [[9th Parliament of Queen Elizabeth I|1597\u201398]] and an appearance on two minor legal counsels; his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience at dealing with rowdy MPs was no doubt among the factors that allowed Parliament to descend into disorder, as it rapidly did.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful.

However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had conclusively been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} However, by the end, resentment against the undertakers had evaporated.

Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was still deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially its Scottish members, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]].

Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament. Shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614.

The same was done for Hoskins's encouragers a few days later.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=146}} Royal favour was extended to the king's supporters in Parliament, even the Speaker, who received a knighthood and a [[Serjeant-at-law|Serjeantry]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=148}} Simultaneously, James approached the Spanish Ambassador shortly after Parliament, confiding much in him, especially regarding his lack of confidence with Parliament.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} He reopened negotiations with Spain for a Spanish wife to his heir-apparent, anticipating a dowry of \u00a3600,000, enough to cover almost all his debt.{{sfn|Thrush|2010d}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}}\n\nShortly after the Parliament ended, the Privy Council went into talks of calling another, possibly [[Parliament of Scotland|in Scotland]],{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} but James surmised this break in Parliament would be final.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} Indeed, he would not call another Parliament for seven years. He only raised a [[3rd Parliament of King James I|Parliament in 1621]] as a last resort to raise money for his son-in-law [[Elector Palatine Frederick V]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{sfn|Thrush|2010d}} This interlude was England's longest since 1515.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=140}} As one historian has commented, \"had it not been for the outbreak of the Thirty Years\u2019 War in 1618, he might have succeeded in avoiding Parliament for the rest of his reign.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} In the mean time, still heavily in debt, James set about finding other ways to raise money. \"We shall see strange projects for money set on foot, and yet all will not help\", one observer noted.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=158\u2013159}} His financial needs were temporarily sated with a [[benevolence (tax)|benevolence]] asked of his wealthiest subjects in 1614, raising \u00a365,000;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=94}} the sale of the [[Cautionary Towns]] of [[Brielle]] and [[Vlissingen]] to the Dutch in 1616, raising \u00a3250,000;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=95}} and in 1617, the request of a loan of \u00a3100,000 from the [[City of London]] for a Scottish [[Royal entry|Progress]], though the City did not give this in full.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=100}} The deficit was slowly reduced from 1614 to 1618.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=153}} Yet, by 1620, his debt had risen to \u00a3900,000 and no marriage deal had materialised.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:Portrait of Samuel Rawson Gardiner.jpg|thumb|Victorian historian of James's reign [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] concluded that the Addled Parliament saw the \"first dawning\" of certain constitutional ideas in Parliament.]]\n[[Victorian era|Victorian]] Whig historian [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]], in his monumental history of the lead up to the Civil War, took the view that the Parliament of 1614 was primarily concerned with \"higher questions\", i.e. those a constitutional nature, \"which, once [[wikt:mooted|mooted]], can never drop out of sight\".{{sfn|Clucas|Davies|2003|p=1}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1883|p=228}} To this Parliament, Gardiner wrote, one can \"trace the first dawning of the idea that, in order to preserve the rights of the subject intact, it would be necessary to make some change in the relations between the authority of the Crown and the representatives of the people.\"{{sfn|Gardiner|1883|p=240}} Gardiner's judgement of the constitutional import of this assembly has met with the sympathy of some later historians.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=31}} [[Thomas L.

The disagreement between Parliament and Crown was not a \"battle between rival constitutional ideas\"{{sfn|Clucas|Davies|2003|p=2}} but, as Russell concluded:\n{{quote|The central disagreement of James's reign was about the true [monetary] cost of government, and James\u2019s central failure was his failure to convince the House of Commons he needed as much as in fact he did. From that single failure, all the constitutional troubles of the reign stemmed.{{sfn|Clucas|Davies|2003|p=2}}}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of MPs elected to the English parliament in 1614]]\n*[[James VI and I and the English Parliament]]\n*[[List of Parliaments of England]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book |last1=Clucas |first1=Stephen |last2=Davies |first2=Rosalind |date=2003 |chapter=Introduction |editor1-last=Clucas |editor1-first=Stephen |editor2-last=Davies |editor2-first=Rosalind |title=The Crisis of 1614 and The Addled Parliament: Literary and Historical Perspectives |edition=1st |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location=Aldershot |isbn=978-0-7546-0681-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Crisis_of_1614_and_the_Addled_Parlia.html?id=wVdnAAAAMAAJ |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite book |last=Cramsie |first=John |date=2002 |title=Kingship and Crown Finance under James VI and I, 1603\u20131625 |location=Suffolk |publisher=The Boydell Press |series=[[Royal Historical Society Studies in History]] (New Series) |isbn=978-0-86193-259-7 |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite book |last=Croft |first=Pauline |author-link=Pauline Croft |date=2003 |title=King James |location=Hampshire |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |url=https://archive.org/details/kingjames00crof |url-access=registration |oclc=938114859 |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite book |last=Dietz |first=Frederick C. |date=1964 |title=English Public Finance, 1558\u20131641 |series=English Public Finance, 1485\u20131641 |volume=2 |edition=2nd |publisher=Barnes & Noble, Inc. |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/englishpublicfin0002diet |url-access=registration |oclc=22976184 |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Owen |last2=Roberts |first2=Clayton |date=July 1978 |title= The Parliamentary Undertaking of 1614  |journal=[[The English Historical Review]] |volume=93 |issue=238 |pp=481\u2013498  |doi=10.1093/ehr/xciii.ccclxviii.481 |jstor=565464 |ref=harv }} \n: {{cite book |last=Gardiner |first=Samuel R. |date=1883 |title=History of England from the Accession of James I to the Outbreak of the Civil War, 1603\u20131642.

They were then inherited by Cardinale [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Odoardo Farnese]]. The Game of Chess then turned up in Naples, after the Farnese inheritance had passed to the Bourbons, and it was eventually acquired by [[Lucien Bonaparte|Luciano Bonaparte]]. It changed hands once more after this and arrived in the collection that today forms part of the [[National Museum, Pozna\u0144|Museo Narodowe]] in Poznan, Poland. \n\nThree engravings based on this painting are known.  \n\nThe painting has undergone evident repaintings. \n\n== Description ==\nIn an agreeable garden Luca, the third born of the Anguissola children, is moving some chess pieces; in front of her is Minerva, the fourth born, who is reacting to her adversary. She attracts the attention of the youngest sister, Europe (the fifth born) who is following the game and laughing. Minerva appears in a later painting (Portrait of the ''[[Portrait of the Artist's Family|Anguissola family),]]'' but as an adolescent. The Portrait of Europa was painted by [[Lucia Anguissola]] possibly in the year after. Europa Anguissola is also identifiable as the child in the pencil drawing, ''Old Woman Studying the Alphabet with a Laughing Girl,'' today in the Uffizi, where the maid is also present, but older than the woman that appears in ''The Game of Chess''. \n\nLucia is in action, while the housemaid observes the scene. There is a clear contrast in physiognomy between the younger (rich) women and the elder (common) woman. The young Anguissola women have jewels, embroidered clothes, elaborate hairstyles. Minerva wears the same necklace as the ''Portrait of a Lady'' that is in Berlin and now identified as Bianca Ponzoni Anguissola - the mother of the three girls around the chessboard. The picture takes place in a domestic setting, circled with friendly figures, but the competitiveness of a game of chess is also visible. \n\nIn the garden an old oak tree grows, laden in branches: it is a symbol of the solidity of family relationships. In the background is a light blue landscape, painted in the Flemish style.\n\nThe small youthful poem of the Cremonese poet and bishop of Alba [[Marco Girolamo Vida|Marco Gerolamo Vida]], entitled ''Scacchia Ludus'' was published in 1550.<ref>{{Citation|author=Marco Girolamo Vida|title=Poemata omnia.

The game was part of the humanistic education and was considered an excellent intellectual exercise for a human; in contrast the card and dice games, which were forbidden to women, but they were based on luck and not on intelligence  \n\nAccording to an old tradition, the chess alluded to a Battle of the Amazons. The queens had the possibility of being resurrected from a pawn.<ref>Severino, Marco Aurelio. 1690.

Napoli: Bulifon.</ref> Marco Girolamo Vigo in ''Scacchia ludus'' sometimes called the queen ''virgo'' and sometimes ''amazon'' and said that it can move in any direction. In the final section Vida mentions a battle between two queens, in which the white queen dies and rises again. At the end the black queen checkmates the white. The battle painted by Anguissola alludes to the search for a conquering woman. With this the chessboard becomes a allegory and the true queens are the two Anguissola sisters, then spend their life virtuously, taking part in a educational exercise.<ref>Centro culturale \u2018Citt\u00e0 di Cremona\u2019 in S.

There is a clear contrast in physiognomy between the younger (rich) women and the elder (common) woman. The young Anguissola women have jewels, embroidered clothes, elaborate hairstyles. Minerva wears the same necklace as the ''Portrait of a Lady'' that is in Berlin and now identified as Bianca Ponzoni Anguissola - the mother of the three girls around the chessboard. The picture takes place in a domestic setting, circled with friendly figures, but the competitiveness of a game of chess is also visible. \n\nIn the garden an old oak tree grows, laden in branches: it is a symbol of the solidity of family relationships. In the background is a light blue landscape, painted in the Flemish style.\n\nThe small youthful poem of the Cremonese poet and bishop of Alba [[Marco Girolamo Vida|Marco Gerolamo Vida]], entitled ''Scacchia Ludus'' was published in 1550.<ref>{{Citation|author=Marco Girolamo Vida|title=Poemata omnia.

The game was part of the humanistic education and was considered an excellent intellectual exercise for a human; in contrast the card and dice games, which were forbidden to women, but they were based on luck and not on intelligence  \n\nAccording to an old tradition, the chess alluded to a Battle of the Amazons. The queens had the possibility of being resurrected from a pawn.<ref>Severino, Marco Aurelio. 1690.

Napoli: Bulifon.</ref> Marco Girolamo Vigo in ''Scacchia ludus'' sometimes called the queen ''virgo'' and sometimes ''amazon'' and said that it can move in any direction. In the final section Vida mentions a battle between two queens, in which the white queen dies and rises again. At the end the black queen checkmates the white. The battle painted by Anguissola alludes to the search for a conquering woman. With this the chessboard becomes a allegory and the true queens are the two Anguissola sisters, then spend their life virtuously, taking part in a educational exercise.<ref>Centro culturale \u2018Citt\u00e0 di Cremona\u2019 in S.
