{"title_page": "Chicken (game)", "text_new": "{{other uses|Chicken (disambiguation)}}\n\nThe '''game of chicken''', also known as the '''hawk\u2013dove game''' or '''snowdrift game''',<ref>Sugden, R. ''The Economics of Rights, Cooperation and Welfare'' 2 edition, page 132. Palgrave Macmillan, 2005.</ref> is a model of conflict for two players in [[game theory]].  The principle of the game is that while the outcome is ideal for one player to yield (to avoid the worst outcome if neither yield), but the individuals try to avoid it out of pride for not wanting to look like a 'chicken'. So each player taunts the other to increase the risk of shame in yielding. However, when one player yields, the conflict is avoided, and the game is for the most part over.\n\nThe name \"chicken\" has its origins in a game in which two drivers drive towards each other on a collision course: one must swerve, or both may die in the crash, but if one driver swerves and the other does not, the one who swerved will be called a \"[[:wikt:chicken|chicken]]\", meaning a coward; this terminology is most prevalent in [[political science]] and [[economics]]. The name \"hawk\u2013dove\" refers to a situation in which there is a competition for a shared resource and the contestants can choose either conciliation or conflict; this terminology is most commonly used in [[biology]] and [[evolutionary game theory]]. From a game-theoretic point of view, \"chicken\" and \"hawk\u2013dove\" are identical; the different names stem from parallel development of the basic principles in different research areas.<ref>Osborne and Rubenstein (1994) p. 30.</ref> The game has also been used to describe the [[mutual assured destruction]] of [[nuclear warfare]], especially the sort of [[brinkmanship]] involved in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Russell (1959) p. 30.</ref>\n\n==Popular versions==\n\nThe game of chicken models two drivers, both headed for a single-lane bridge from opposite directions.  The first to swerve away yields the bridge to the other. If neither player swerves, the result is a costly deadlock in the middle of the bridge, or a potentially fatal head-on collision.  It is presumed that the best thing for each driver is to stay straight while the other swerves (since the other is the \"chicken\" while a crash is avoided).  Additionally, a crash is presumed to be the worst outcome for both players.  This yields a situation where each player, in attempting to secure their best outcome, risks the worst.\n\nThe phrase ''game of chicken'' is also used as a metaphor for a situation where two parties engage in a showdown where they have nothing to gain, and only pride stops them from backing down. [[Bertrand Russell]] famously compared the game of Chicken to [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] [[brinkmanship]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nSince the nuclear stalemate became apparent, the Governments of East and West have adopted the policy which [[John Foster Dulles|Mr. Dulles]] calls 'brinkmanship'. This is a policy adapted from a sport which, I am told, is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called 'Chicken!'. It is played by choosing a long straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels on one side of the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as they pass, shouts 'Chicken!', and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, is absurd. Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly dangerous game. The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of 'Chicken!' from the other side. When that moment is come, the statesmen of both sides will plunge the world into destruction.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n</blockquote>\n\nBrinkmanship involves the introduction of an element of uncontrollable risk: even if all players act rationally in the face of risk, uncontrollable events can still trigger the catastrophic outcome.<ref name=Dixit>Dixit and Nalebuff (1991) pp. 205\u2013222.</ref> In the \"chickie run\" scene from the film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', this happens when Buzz cannot escape from the car and dies in the crash.  The opposite scenario occurs in ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'' where Ren McCormack is stuck in his tractor and hence wins the game as they cannot play \"chicken\".  A similar event happens in two different games in the film \"[[The Heavenly Kid]]\", when first Bobby, then later Lenny become stuck in their cars and drive off a cliff. The basic game-theoretic formulation of Chicken has no element of variable, potentially catastrophic, risk, and is also the contraction of a dynamic situation into a one-shot interaction.\n\nThe hawk\u2013dove version of the game imagines two players (animals) contesting an indivisible resource who can choose between two strategies, one more escalated than the other.<ref name=\"JMS&P76\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0003-3472(76)80110-8| title = The logic of asymmetric contests| journal = Animal Behaviour| volume = 24| pages = 159\u2013175| year = 1976| last1 = Smith | first1 = J.

If both players choose the Hawk strategy, then they fight until one is injured and the other wins.  If only one player chooses Hawk, then this player defeats the Dove player.  If both players play Dove, there is a tie, and each player receives a payoff lower than the profit of a hawk defeating a dove.\n\n==Game theoretic applications==\n\n===Chicken===\n\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Fig. 1: A [[payoff matrix]] of Chicken\n                | 2L = Swerve     | 2R = Straight   |\n1U = Swerve     | UL = <small>Tie,&nbsp;Tie</small>  | UR = <small>Lose,&nbsp;Win</small>|\n1D = Straight   | DL = <small>Win,&nbsp;Lose</small> | DR = <small>Crash,&nbsp;Crash</small>}}\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Fig. 2: Chicken with numerical [[Risk dominance|payoffs]]\n                | 2L = Swerve     | 2R = Straight   |\n1U = Swerve     | UL = 0,&nbsp;0  | UR = -1,&nbsp;+1|\n1D = Straight   | DL = +1,&nbsp;-1 | DR = -1000,&nbsp;-1000}}\n\nA formal version of the game of Chicken has been the subject of serious research in [[game theory]].<ref>Rapoport and Chammah (1966) pp. 10\u201314 and 23\u201328.</ref>  Two versions of the [[payoff matrix]] for this game are presented here (Figures 1 and 2).  In Figure 1, the outcomes are represented in words, where each player would prefer to win over tying, prefer to tie over losing, and prefer to lose over crashing.  Figure 2 presents arbitrarily set numerical payoffs which theoretically conform to this situation.  Here, the benefit of winning is 1, the cost of losing is -1, and the cost of crashing is -1000.\n\nBoth Chicken and Hawk\u2013Dove are ''anti-coordination games'', in which it is mutually beneficial for the players to play different strategies. In this way, it can be thought of as the opposite of a [[coordination game]], where playing the same strategy [[Pareto dominance|Pareto dominates]] playing different strategies. The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the resource is [[non-rivalrous]], and the shared usage creates positive [[externality|externalities]]. In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but [[Non-excludable good|non-excludable]] and sharing comes at a cost (or negative externality).\n\nBecause the loss of swerving is so trivial compared to the crash that occurs if nobody swerves, the reasonable strategy would seem to be to swerve before a crash is likely. Yet, knowing this, if one believes one's opponent to be reasonable, one may well decide not to swerve at all, in the belief that they will be reasonable and decide to swerve, leaving the other player the winner. This unstable situation can be formalized by saying there is more than one [[Nash equilibrium]], which is a pair of strategies for which neither player gains by changing their own strategy while the other stays the same. (In this case, the [[pure strategy]] equilibria are the two situations wherein one player swerves while the other does not.)\n\n                                                                                                            By ANU\n\n===Hawk\u2013dove===\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Fig. 3: Hawk\u2013Dove game\n                | 2L = Hawk                               | 2R = Dove                         |\n1U = Hawk       | UL = <small>{{nowrap|(V\u2212C)/2, (V\u2212C)/2}}</small> | UR = <small>V, 0</small>                  |\n1D = Dove       | DL = <small>0, V</small>                        | DR = <small>{{nowrap|V/2, V/2}}</small>   }}\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Fig. 4: General Hawk\u2013Dove game\n                | 2L = Hawk       | 2R = Dove       |\n1U = Hawk       | UL = X, X       | UR = W, L       |\n1D = Dove       | DL = L, W       | DR = T, T       }}\n{{main article|Evolutionary game theory}}\n\nIn [[Evolutionary game theory|the biological literature]], this game is known as Hawk\u2013Dove.

It is (almost always) assumed that the value of the resource is less than the cost of a fight, i.e., C&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;V&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0. If C&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;V, the resulting game is not a game of Chicken but is instead a [[Prisoner's Dilemma]].\n\n[[File:Hawk-Dove transforming into Prisoner's Dilemma.gif|thumb|Hawk\u2013Dove transforming into Prisoner's Dilemma. As C becomes smaller than V, the mixed strategy equilibrium moves to the pure strategy equilibrium of both players playing hawk (see [[#Replicator dynamics|Replicator dynamics]]).]]\n\nThe exact value of the Dove vs. Dove payoff varies between model formulations.  Sometimes the players are assumed to split the payoff equally (V/2 each), other times the payoff is assumed to be zero (since this is the expected payoff to a [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] game, which is the presumed models for a contest decided by display duration).\n\nWhile the Hawk\u2013Dove game is typically taught and discussed with the payoffs in terms of V and C, the solutions hold true for any matrix with the payoffs in Figure 4, where W&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;T&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;L&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;X.<ref name=\"JMS82\"/>\n\n====Hawk\u2013dove variants====\nBiologists have explored modified versions of classic Hawk\u2013Dove game to investigate a number of biologically relevant factors.  These include adding variation in [[resource holding potential]], and differences in the value of winning to the different players,<ref>Hammerstein (1981).</ref> allowing the players to threaten each other before choosing moves in the game,<ref name = \"Kim\">Kim (1995).</ref> and extending the interaction to two plays of the game.<ref>Cressman (1995).</ref>\n\n====Pre-commitment====\nOne tactic in the game is for one party to signal their intentions convincingly before the game begins. For example, if one party were to ostentatiously disable their steering wheel just before the match, the other party would be compelled to swerve.<ref>Kahn (1965), cited in Rapoport and Chammah (1966)</ref> This shows that, in some circumstances, reducing one's own options can be a good strategy. One real-world example is a protester who handcuffs themselves to an object, so that no threat can be made which would compel them to move (since they cannot move). Another example, taken from fiction, is found in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''. In that film, the [[Soviet Union|Russians]] sought to deter American attack by building a \"doomsday machine\", a device that would trigger world annihilation if Russia was hit by nuclear weapons or if any attempt were made to disarm it. However, the Russians had planned to signal the deployment of the machine a few days after having set it up, which, because of an unfortunate course of events, turned out to be too late.\n\nPlayers may also make non-binding threats to not swerve. This has been modeled explicitly in the Hawk\u2013Dove game. Such threats work, but must be [[handicap principle|wastefully costly]] if the threat is one of two possible signals (\"I will not swerve\"/\"I will swerve\"), or they will be costless if there are three or more signals (in which case the signals will function as a game of \"[[Rock, Paper, Scissors]]\").<ref name = \"Kim\"/>\n\n==Best response mapping and Nash equilibria==\n[[Image:Reaction-correspondence-hawk-dove.jpg|500px|thumbnail|none|Fig.5 - Reaction correspondences for both players in a discoordination game. Compare with replicator dynamic vector fields [[#Replicator dynamics|below]]]]\n\nAll anti-coordination games have three [[Nash equilibria]].  Two of these are [[pure strategy|pure]] contingent strategy profiles, in which each player plays one of the pair of strategies, and the other player chooses the opposite strategy.  The third one is a [[mixed strategy|mixed]] equilibrium, in which each player [[probability|probabilistically]] chooses between the two pure strategies. Either the pure, or mixed, Nash equilibria will be [[evolutionarily stable strategies]] depending upon whether [[uncorrelated asymmetry|uncorrelated asymmetries]] exist.\n\nThe [[best response]] mapping for all 2x2 anti-coordination games is shown in Figure 5. The variables ''x'' and ''y'' in Figure 5 are the probabilities of playing the escalated strategy (\"Hawk\" or \"Don't swerve\") for players X and Y respectively.  The line in graph on the left shows the optimum probability of playing the escalated strategy for player Y as a function of ''x''.  The line in the second graph shows the optimum probability of playing the escalated strategy for player X as a function of ''y'' (the axes have not been rotated, so the [[dependent variable]] is plotted on the [[abscissa]], and the [[independent variable]] is plotted on the [[ordinate]]).  The Nash equilibria are where the players' correspondences agree, i.e., cross. These are shown with points in the right hand graph.  The best response mappings agree (i.e., cross) at three points. The first two Nash equilibria are in the top left and bottom right corners, where one player chooses one strategy, the other player chooses the opposite strategy. The third Nash equilibrium is a mixed strategy which lies along the diagonal from the bottom left to top right corners. If the players do not know which one of them is which, then the mixed Nash is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS), as play is confined to the bottom left to top right diagonal line.  Otherwise an uncorrelated asymmetry is said to exist, and the corner Nash equilibria are ESSes.\n\n===Strategy polymorphism vs strategy mixing===\nThe ESS for the Hawk\u2013Dove game is a mixed strategy.  Formal game theory is indifferent to whether this mixture is due to all players in a population choosing randomly between the two pure strategies (a range of possible instinctive reactions for a single situation) or whether the population is a polymorphic mixture of players dedicated to choosing a particular pure strategy(a single reaction differing from individual to individual).  Biologically, these two options are strikingly different ideas. The Hawk\u2013Dove game has been used as a basis for evolutionary simulations to explore which of these two modes of mixing ought to predominate in reality.<ref>Bergstrom and Goddfrey-Smith (1998)</ref><!--a JMS paper on this too, must find-->\n\n==Symmetry breaking==\nIn both \"Chicken\" and \"Hawk\u2013Dove\", the only [[symmetric equilibrium|symmetric]] [[Nash equilibrium]] is the [[mixed strategy]] Nash equilibrium, where both individuals randomly chose between playing Hawk/Straight or Dove/Swerve. This mixed strategy equilibrium is often sub-optimal\u2014both players would do better if they could coordinate their actions in some way. This observation has been made independently in two different contexts, with almost identical results.<ref name=\"Skyrms-ESC\">Skyrms (1996) pp. 76\u201379.</ref>\n\n===Correlated equilibrium and the game of chicken===\n\n{{payoff matrix | Name=Fig. 6: A version of Chicken\n                | 2L=Dare   | 2R=Chicken\n|1U=Dare        | UL=0,0    | UR=7,2\n|1D=Chicken     | DL=2,7    | DR=6,6}}\n\nConsider the version of \"Chicken\" pictured in Figure 6.  Like all forms of the game, there are three [[Nash equilibria]].  The two [[pure strategy]] Nash equilibria are (''D'', ''C'') and (''C'', ''D'').  There is also a [[mixed strategy]] equilibrium where each player Dares with probability 1/3. It results in expected payoffs of 14/3 = 4.667 for each player.\n\nNow consider a third party (or some natural event) that draws one of three cards labeled: (''C'', ''C''), (''D'', ''C''), and (''C'', ''D''). This exogenous draw event is assumed to be uniformly at random over the 3 outcomes. After drawing the card the third party informs the players of the strategy assigned to them on the card (but '''not''' the strategy assigned to their opponent).  Suppose a player is assigned ''D'', they would not want to deviate supposing the other player played their assigned strategy since they will get 7 (the highest payoff possible).  Suppose a player is assigned ''C''.  Then the other player has been assigned ''C'' with probability 1/2 and ''D'' with probability 1/2 (due to the nature of the exogenous draw).  The [[expected utility]] of Daring is 0(1/2) + 7(1/2) = 3.5 and the expected utility of chickening out is 2(1/2) + 6(1/2) = 4.  So, the player would prefer to chicken out.\n\nSince neither player has an incentive to deviate from the drawn assignments, this probability distribution over the strategies is known as a [[correlated equilibrium]] of the game. Notably, the expected payoff for this equilibrium is 7(1/3) + 2(1/3) + 6(1/3) = 5 which is higher than the expected payoff of the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\n===Uncorrelated asymmetries and solutions to the hawk\u2013dove game===\n\nAlthough there are three Nash equilibria in the Hawk\u2013Dove game, the one which emerges as the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS) depends upon the existence of any [[uncorrelated asymmetry]] in the game (in the sense of [[best response#Anti-coordination games|anti-coordination games]]).  In order for row players to choose one strategy and column players the other, the players must be able to distinguish which role (column or row player) they have.  If no such uncorrelated asymmetry exists then both players must choose the same strategy, and the ESS will be the mixing Nash equilibrium.  If there is an uncorrelated asymmetry, then the mixing Nash is not an ESS, but the two pure, role contingent, Nash equilibria are.\n\nThe standard biological interpretation of this uncorrelated asymmetry is that one player is the territory owner, while the other is an intruder on the territory.  In most cases, the territory owner plays Hawk while the intruder plays Dove. In this sense, the evolution of strategies in Hawk\u2013Dove can be seen as the evolution of a sort of prototypical version of ownership. Game-theoretically, however, there is nothing special about this solution.  The opposite solution\u2014where the owner plays dove and the intruder plays Hawk\u2014is equally stable.  In fact, this solution is present in a certain species of spider; when an invader appears the occupying spider leaves.  In order to explain the prevalence of property rights over \"anti-property rights\" one must discover a way to break this additional symmetry.<ref name=\"Skyrms-ESC\" />\n\n==Replicator dynamics==\n[[Image:Chicken Two Pop Replicator Dynamics Labeled.png|thumb|right|200px|Fig 7a: Vector field for two population replicator dynamics and Hawk\u2013Dove]]\n\n[[Replicator dynamics]] is a simple model of strategy change commonly used in [[evolutionary game theory]].  In this model, a strategy which does better than the average increases in frequency at the expense of strategies that do worse than the average.  There are two versions of the replicator dynamics.  In one version, there is a single population which plays against itself.  In another, there are two population models where each population only plays against the other population (and not against itself).\n\nIn the one population model, the only stable state is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.  Every initial population proportion (except all ''Hawk'' and all ''Dove'') converge to the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium where part of the population plays ''Hawk'' and part of the population plays ''Dove''.  (This occurs because the only ESS is the mixed strategy equilibrium.)  In the two population model, this mixed point becomes unstable.  In fact, the only stable states in the two population model correspond to the pure strategy equilibria, where one population is composed of all ''Hawk''s and the other of all ''Dove''s.  In this model one population becomes the aggressive population while the other becomes passive.  This model is illustrated by the [[vector field]] pictured in Figure 7a.  The one-dimensional vector field of the single population model (Figure 7b) corresponds to the bottom left to top right diagonal of the two population model.\n\n[[Image:Chicken Replicator Dynamics.png|thumb|none|400px|Fig. 7b: Vector field for single population replicator dynamics]]\n\nThe single population model presents a situation where no uncorrelated asymmetries exist, and so the best players can do is randomize their strategies.  The two population models provide such an asymmetry and the members of each population will then use that to correlate their strategies.  In the two population model, one population gains at the expense of another.  Hawk\u2013Dove and Chicken thus illustrate an interesting case where the qualitative results for the two different versions of the replicator dynamics differ wildly.<ref>Weibull (1995) pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\n==Related strategies and games==\n\n===Brinkmanship===\n\"Chicken\" and \"[[Brinkmanship]]\" are often used synonymously in the context of conflict, but in the strict game-theoretic sense, \"brinkmanship\" refers to a [[strategic move]] designed to avert the possibility of the opponent switching to aggressive behavior. The move involves a credible threat of the risk of irrational behavior in the face of aggression. If player 1 unilaterally moves to A, a rational player 2 cannot retaliate since (A,&nbsp;C) is preferable to (A,&nbsp;A). Only if player 1 has grounds to believe that there is sufficient risk that player 2 responds irrationally (usually by giving up control over the response, so that there is sufficient risk that player 2 responds with A) player 1 will retract and agree on the compromise.\n\n===War of attrition===\nLike \"Chicken\", the \"War of attrition\" game models escalation of conflict, but they differ in the form in which the conflict can escalate. Chicken models a situation in which the catastrophic outcome differs in kind from the agreeable outcome, e.g., if the conflict is over life and death. War of attrition models a situation in which the outcomes differ only in degrees, such as a boxing match in which the contestants have to decide whether the ultimate prize of victory is worth the ongoing cost of deteriorating health and stamina.\n\n===Hawk\u2013dove and war of attrition===\nThe Hawk\u2013Dove game is the most commonly used game theoretical model of aggressive interactions in biology.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, J.]] 1998. Evolutionary Genetics. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-850231-9}}</ref>  The [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] is another very influential model of aggression in biology.  The two models investigate slightly different questions.  The Hawk\u2013Dove game is a model of escalation, and addresses the question of when ought an individual escalate to dangerously costly physical combat.  The war of attrition seeks to answer the question of how contests may be resolved when there is no possibility of physical combat.  The war of attrition is an [[auction]] in which both players pay the lower [[Bidding|bid]] (an all-pay second price auction).  The bids are assumed to be the duration which the player is willing to persist in making a costly [[threat display]].  Both players accrue costs while displaying at each other, the contest ends when the individual making the lower bid quits.  Both players will then have paid the lower bid.\n\n===Chicken and prisoner's dilemma===\nChicken is a symmetrical 2x2 game with conflicting interests, the preferred outcome is to play ''Straight'' while the opponent plays ''Swerve''.  Similarly, the [[prisoner's dilemma]] is a symmetrical 2x2 game with conflicting interests: the preferred outcome is to ''Defect'' while the opponent plays ''Cooperate''.  PD is about the impossibility of cooperation while Chicken is about the inevitability of conflict.

''The Economics of Rights, Cooperation and Welfare'' 2 edition, page 132. Palgrave Macmillan, 2005.</ref> is a model of conflict for two players in [[game theory]].  The principle of the game is that while the outcome is ideal for one player to yield (to avoid the worst outcome if neither yield), but the individuals try to avoid it out of pride for not wanting to look like a 'chicken'. So each player taunts the other to increase the risk of shame in yielding. However, when one player yields, the conflict is avoided, and the game is for the most part over.\n\nThe name \"chicken\" has its origins in a game in which two drivers drive towards each other on a collision course: one must swerve, or both may die in the crash, but if one driver swerves and the other does not, the one who swerved will be called a \"[[:wikt:chicken|chicken]]\", meaning a coward; this terminology is most prevalent in [[political science]] and [[economics]]. The name \"hawk\u2013dove\" refers to a situation in which there is a competition for a shared resource and the contestants can choose either conciliation or conflict; this terminology is most commonly used in [[biology]] and [[evolutionary game theory]]. From a game-theoretic point of view, \"chicken\" and \"hawk\u2013dove\" are identical; the different names stem from parallel development of the basic principles in different research areas.<ref>Osborne and Rubenstein (1994) p. 30.</ref> The game has also been used to describe the [[mutual assured destruction]] of [[nuclear warfare]], especially the sort of [[brinkmanship]] involved in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Russell (1959) p. 30.</ref>\n\n==Popular versions==\n\nThe game of chicken models two drivers, both headed for a single-lane bridge from opposite directions.  The first to swerve away yields the bridge to the other. If neither player swerves, the result is a costly deadlock in the middle of the bridge, or a potentially fatal head-on collision.  It is presumed that the best thing for each driver is to stay straight while the other swerves (since the other is the \"chicken\" while a crash is avoided).  Additionally, a crash is presumed to be the worst outcome for both players.  This yields a situation where each player, in attempting to secure their best outcome, risks the worst.\n\nThe phrase ''game of chicken'' is also used as a metaphor for a situation where two parties engage in a showdown where they have nothing to gain, and only pride stops them from backing down. [[Bertrand Russell]] famously compared the game of Chicken to [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] [[brinkmanship]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nSince the nuclear stalemate became apparent, the Governments of East and West have adopted the policy which [[John Foster Dulles|Mr. Dulles]] calls 'brinkmanship'. This is a policy adapted from a sport which, I am told, is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called 'Chicken!'. It is played by choosing a long straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels on one side of the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as they pass, shouts 'Chicken!', and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, is absurd. Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly dangerous game. The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of 'Chicken!' from the other side. When that moment is come, the statesmen of both sides will plunge the world into destruction.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n</blockquote>\n\nBrinkmanship involves the introduction of an element of uncontrollable risk: even if all players act rationally in the face of risk, uncontrollable events can still trigger the catastrophic outcome.<ref name=Dixit>Dixit and Nalebuff (1991) pp. 205\u2013222.</ref> In the \"chickie run\" scene from the film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', this happens when Buzz cannot escape from the car and dies in the crash.  The opposite scenario occurs in ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'' where Ren McCormack is stuck in his tractor and hence wins the game as they cannot play \"chicken\".  A similar event happens in two different games in the film \"[[The Heavenly Kid]]\", when first Bobby, then later Lenny become stuck in their cars and drive off a cliff. The basic game-theoretic formulation of Chicken has no element of variable, potentially catastrophic, risk, and is also the contraction of a dynamic situation into a one-shot interaction.\n\nThe hawk\u2013dove version of the game imagines two players (animals) contesting an indivisible resource who can choose between two strategies, one more escalated than the other.<ref name=\"JMS&P76\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0003-3472(76)80110-8| title = The logic of asymmetric contests| journal = Animal Behaviour| volume = 24| pages = 159\u2013175| year = 1976| last1 = Smith | first1 = J.

If both players choose the Hawk strategy, then they fight until one is injured and the other wins.  If only one player chooses Hawk, then this player defeats the Dove player.  If both players play Dove, there is a tie, and each player receives a payoff lower than the profit of a hawk defeating a dove.\n\n==Game theoretic applications==\n\n===Chicken===\n\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Fig. 1: A [[payoff matrix]] of Chicken\n                | 2L = Swerve     | 2R = Straight   |\n1U = Swerve     | UL = <small>Tie,&nbsp;Tie</small>  | UR = <small>Lose,&nbsp;Win</small>|\n1D = Straight   | DL = <small>Win,&nbsp;Lose</small> | DR = <small>Crash,&nbsp;Crash</small>}}\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Fig. 2: Chicken with numerical [[Risk dominance|payoffs]]\n                | 2L = Swerve     | 2R = Straight   |\n1U = Swerve     | UL = 0,&nbsp;0  | UR = -1,&nbsp;+1|\n1D = Straight   | DL = +1,&nbsp;-1 | DR = -1000,&nbsp;-1000}}\n\nA formal version of the game of Chicken has been the subject of serious research in [[game theory]].<ref>Rapoport and Chammah (1966) pp. 10\u201314 and 23\u201328.</ref>  Two versions of the [[payoff matrix]] for this game are presented here (Figures 1 and 2).  In Figure 1, the outcomes are represented in words, where each player would prefer to win over tying, prefer to tie over losing, and prefer to lose over crashing.  Figure 2 presents arbitrarily set numerical payoffs which theoretically conform to this situation.  Here, the benefit of winning is 1, the cost of losing is -1, and the cost of crashing is -1000.\n\nBoth Chicken and Hawk\u2013Dove are ''anti-coordination games'', in which it is mutually beneficial for the players to play different strategies. In this way, it can be thought of as the opposite of a [[coordination game]], where playing the same strategy [[Pareto dominance|Pareto dominates]] playing different strategies. The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the resource is [[non-rivalrous]], and the shared usage creates positive [[externality|externalities]]. In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but [[Non-excludable good|non-excludable]] and sharing comes at a cost (or negative externality).\n\nBecause the loss of swerving is so trivial compared to the crash that occurs if nobody swerves, the reasonable strategy would seem to be to swerve before a crash is likely. Yet, knowing this, if one believes one's opponent to be reasonable, one may well decide not to swerve at all, in the belief that they will be reasonable and decide to swerve, leaving the other player the winner. This unstable situation can be formalized by saying there is more than one [[Nash equilibrium]], which is a pair of strategies for which neither player gains by changing their own strategy while the other stays the same. (In this case, the [[pure strategy]] equilibria are the two situations wherein one player swerves while the other does not.)\n\n===Hawk\u2013dove===\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Fig. 3: Hawk\u2013Dove game\n                | 2L = Hawk                               | 2R = Dove                         |\n1U = Hawk       | UL = <small>{{nowrap|(V\u2212C)/2, (V\u2212C)/2}}</small> | UR = <small>V, 0</small>                  |\n1D = Dove       | DL = <small>0, V</small>                        | DR = <small>{{nowrap|V/2, V/2}}</small>   }}\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Fig. 4: General Hawk\u2013Dove game\n                | 2L = Hawk       | 2R = Dove       |\n1U = Hawk       | UL = X, X       | UR = W, L       |\n1D = Dove       | DL = L, W       | DR = T, T       }}\n{{main article|Evolutionary game theory}}\n\nIn [[Evolutionary game theory|the biological literature]], this game is known as Hawk\u2013Dove.

It is (almost always) assumed that the value of the resource is less than the cost of a fight, i.e., C&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;V&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0. If C&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;V, the resulting game is not a game of Chicken but is instead a [[Prisoner's Dilemma]].\n\n[[File:Hawk-Dove transforming into Prisoner's Dilemma.gif|thumb|Hawk\u2013Dove transforming into Prisoner's Dilemma. As C becomes smaller than V, the mixed strategy equilibrium moves to the pure strategy equilibrium of both players playing hawk (see [[#Replicator dynamics|Replicator dynamics]]).]]\n\nThe exact value of the Dove vs. Dove payoff varies between model formulations.  Sometimes the players are assumed to split the payoff equally (V/2 each), other times the payoff is assumed to be zero (since this is the expected payoff to a [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] game, which is the presumed models for a contest decided by display duration).\n\nWhile the Hawk\u2013Dove game is typically taught and discussed with the payoffs in terms of V and C, the solutions hold true for any matrix with the payoffs in Figure 4, where W&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;T&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;L&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;X.<ref name=\"JMS82\"/>\n\n====Hawk\u2013dove variants====\nBiologists have explored modified versions of classic Hawk\u2013Dove game to investigate a number of biologically relevant factors.  These include adding variation in [[resource holding potential]], and differences in the value of winning to the different players,<ref>Hammerstein (1981).</ref> allowing the players to threaten each other before choosing moves in the game,<ref name = \"Kim\">Kim (1995).</ref> and extending the interaction to two plays of the game.<ref>Cressman (1995).</ref>\n\n====Pre-commitment====\nOne tactic in the game is for one party to signal their intentions convincingly before the game begins. For example, if one party were to ostentatiously disable their steering wheel just before the match, the other party would be compelled to swerve.<ref>Kahn (1965), cited in Rapoport and Chammah (1966)</ref> This shows that, in some circumstances, reducing one's own options can be a good strategy. One real-world example is a protester who handcuffs themselves to an object, so that no threat can be made which would compel them to move (since they cannot move). Another example, taken from fiction, is found in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''. In that film, the [[Soviet Union|Russians]] sought to deter American attack by building a \"doomsday machine\", a device that would trigger world annihilation if Russia was hit by nuclear weapons or if any attempt were made to disarm it. However, the Russians had planned to signal the deployment of the machine a few days after having set it up, which, because of an unfortunate course of events, turned out to be too late.\n\nPlayers may also make non-binding threats to not swerve. This has been modeled explicitly in the Hawk\u2013Dove game. Such threats work, but must be [[handicap principle|wastefully costly]] if the threat is one of two possible signals (\"I will not swerve\"/\"I will swerve\"), or they will be costless if there are three or more signals (in which case the signals will function as a game of \"[[Rock, Paper, Scissors]]\").<ref name = \"Kim\"/>\n\n==Best response mapping and Nash equilibria==\n[[Image:Reaction-correspondence-hawk-dove.jpg|500px|thumbnail|none|Fig.5 - Reaction correspondences for both players in a discoordination game. Compare with replicator dynamic vector fields [[#Replicator dynamics|below]]]]\n\nAll anti-coordination games have three [[Nash equilibria]].  Two of these are [[pure strategy|pure]] contingent strategy profiles, in which each player plays one of the pair of strategies, and the other player chooses the opposite strategy.  The third one is a [[mixed strategy|mixed]] equilibrium, in which each player [[probability|probabilistically]] chooses between the two pure strategies. Either the pure, or mixed, Nash equilibria will be [[evolutionarily stable strategies]] depending upon whether [[uncorrelated asymmetry|uncorrelated asymmetries]] exist.\n\nThe [[best response]] mapping for all 2x2 anti-coordination games is shown in Figure 5. The variables ''x'' and ''y'' in Figure 5 are the probabilities of playing the escalated strategy (\"Hawk\" or \"Don't swerve\") for players X and Y respectively.  The line in graph on the left shows the optimum probability of playing the escalated strategy for player Y as a function of ''x''.  The line in the second graph shows the optimum probability of playing the escalated strategy for player X as a function of ''y'' (the axes have not been rotated, so the [[dependent variable]] is plotted on the [[abscissa]], and the [[independent variable]] is plotted on the [[ordinate]]).  The Nash equilibria are where the players' correspondences agree, i.e., cross. These are shown with points in the right hand graph.  The best response mappings agree (i.e., cross) at three points. The first two Nash equilibria are in the top left and bottom right corners, where one player chooses one strategy, the other player chooses the opposite strategy. The third Nash equilibrium is a mixed strategy which lies along the diagonal from the bottom left to top right corners. If the players do not know which one of them is which, then the mixed Nash is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS), as play is confined to the bottom left to top right diagonal line.  Otherwise an uncorrelated asymmetry is said to exist, and the corner Nash equilibria are ESSes.\n\n===Strategy polymorphism vs strategy mixing===\nThe ESS for the Hawk\u2013Dove game is a mixed strategy.  Formal game theory is indifferent to whether this mixture is due to all players in a population choosing randomly between the two pure strategies (a range of possible instinctive reactions for a single situation) or whether the population is a polymorphic mixture of players dedicated to choosing a particular pure strategy(a single reaction differing from individual to individual).  Biologically, these two options are strikingly different ideas. The Hawk\u2013Dove game has been used as a basis for evolutionary simulations to explore which of these two modes of mixing ought to predominate in reality.<ref>Bergstrom and Goddfrey-Smith (1998)</ref><!--a JMS paper on this too, must find-->\n\n==Symmetry breaking==\nIn both \"Chicken\" and \"Hawk\u2013Dove\", the only [[symmetric equilibrium|symmetric]] [[Nash equilibrium]] is the [[mixed strategy]] Nash equilibrium, where both individuals randomly chose between playing Hawk/Straight or Dove/Swerve. This mixed strategy equilibrium is often sub-optimal\u2014both players would do better if they could coordinate their actions in some way. This observation has been made independently in two different contexts, with almost identical results.<ref name=\"Skyrms-ESC\">Skyrms (1996) pp. 76\u201379.</ref>\n\n===Correlated equilibrium and the game of chicken===\n\n{{payoff matrix | Name=Fig. 6: A version of Chicken\n                | 2L=Dare   | 2R=Chicken\n|1U=Dare        | UL=0,0    | UR=7,2\n|1D=Chicken     | DL=2,7    | DR=6,6}}\n\nConsider the version of \"Chicken\" pictured in Figure 6.  Like all forms of the game, there are three [[Nash equilibria]].  The two [[pure strategy]] Nash equilibria are (''D'', ''C'') and (''C'', ''D'').  There is also a [[mixed strategy]] equilibrium where each player Dares with probability 1/3. It results in expected payoffs of 14/3 = 4.667 for each player.\n\nNow consider a third party (or some natural event) that draws one of three cards labeled: (''C'', ''C''), (''D'', ''C''), and (''C'', ''D''). This exogenous draw event is assumed to be uniformly at random over the 3 outcomes. After drawing the card the third party informs the players of the strategy assigned to them on the card (but '''not''' the strategy assigned to their opponent).  Suppose a player is assigned ''D'', they would not want to deviate supposing the other player played their assigned strategy since they will get 7 (the highest payoff possible).  Suppose a player is assigned ''C''.  Then the other player has been assigned ''C'' with probability 1/2 and ''D'' with probability 1/2 (due to the nature of the exogenous draw).  The [[expected utility]] of Daring is 0(1/2) + 7(1/2) = 3.5 and the expected utility of chickening out is 2(1/2) + 6(1/2) = 4.  So, the player would prefer to chicken out.\n\nSince neither player has an incentive to deviate from the drawn assignments, this probability distribution over the strategies is known as a [[correlated equilibrium]] of the game. Notably, the expected payoff for this equilibrium is 7(1/3) + 2(1/3) + 6(1/3) = 5 which is higher than the expected payoff of the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\n===Uncorrelated asymmetries and solutions to the hawk\u2013dove game===\n\nAlthough there are three Nash equilibria in the Hawk\u2013Dove game, the one which emerges as the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS) depends upon the existence of any [[uncorrelated asymmetry]] in the game (in the sense of [[best response#Anti-coordination games|anti-coordination games]]).  In order for row players to choose one strategy and column players the other, the players must be able to distinguish which role (column or row player) they have.  If no such uncorrelated asymmetry exists then both players must choose the same strategy, and the ESS will be the mixing Nash equilibrium.  If there is an uncorrelated asymmetry, then the mixing Nash is not an ESS, but the two pure, role contingent, Nash equilibria are.\n\nThe standard biological interpretation of this uncorrelated asymmetry is that one player is the territory owner, while the other is an intruder on the territory.  In most cases, the territory owner plays Hawk while the intruder plays Dove. In this sense, the evolution of strategies in Hawk\u2013Dove can be seen as the evolution of a sort of prototypical version of ownership. Game-theoretically, however, there is nothing special about this solution.  The opposite solution\u2014where the owner plays dove and the intruder plays Hawk\u2014is equally stable.  In fact, this solution is present in a certain species of spider; when an invader appears the occupying spider leaves.  In order to explain the prevalence of property rights over \"anti-property rights\" one must discover a way to break this additional symmetry.<ref name=\"Skyrms-ESC\" />\n\n==Replicator dynamics==\n[[Image:Chicken Two Pop Replicator Dynamics Labeled.png|thumb|right|200px|Fig 7a: Vector field for two population replicator dynamics and Hawk\u2013Dove]]\n\n[[Replicator dynamics]] is a simple model of strategy change commonly used in [[evolutionary game theory]].  In this model, a strategy which does better than the average increases in frequency at the expense of strategies that do worse than the average.  There are two versions of the replicator dynamics.  In one version, there is a single population which plays against itself.  In another, there are two population models where each population only plays against the other population (and not against itself).\n\nIn the one population model, the only stable state is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.  Every initial population proportion (except all ''Hawk'' and all ''Dove'') converge to the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium where part of the population plays ''Hawk'' and part of the population plays ''Dove''.  (This occurs because the only ESS is the mixed strategy equilibrium.)  In the two population model, this mixed point becomes unstable.  In fact, the only stable states in the two population model correspond to the pure strategy equilibria, where one population is composed of all ''Hawk''s and the other of all ''Dove''s.  In this model one population becomes the aggressive population while the other becomes passive.  This model is illustrated by the [[vector field]] pictured in Figure 7a.  The one-dimensional vector field of the single population model (Figure 7b) corresponds to the bottom left to top right diagonal of the two population model.\n\n[[Image:Chicken Replicator Dynamics.png|thumb|none|400px|Fig. 7b: Vector field for single population replicator dynamics]]\n\nThe single population model presents a situation where no uncorrelated asymmetries exist, and so the best players can do is randomize their strategies.  The two population models provide such an asymmetry and the members of each population will then use that to correlate their strategies.  In the two population model, one population gains at the expense of another.  Hawk\u2013Dove and Chicken thus illustrate an interesting case where the qualitative results for the two different versions of the replicator dynamics differ wildly.<ref>Weibull (1995) pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\n==Related strategies and games==\n\n===Brinkmanship===\n\"Chicken\" and \"[[Brinkmanship]]\" are often used synonymously in the context of conflict, but in the strict game-theoretic sense, \"brinkmanship\" refers to a [[strategic move]] designed to avert the possibility of the opponent switching to aggressive behavior. The move involves a credible threat of the risk of irrational behavior in the face of aggression. If player 1 unilaterally moves to A, a rational player 2 cannot retaliate since (A,&nbsp;C) is preferable to (A,&nbsp;A). Only if player 1 has grounds to believe that there is sufficient risk that player 2 responds irrationally (usually by giving up control over the response, so that there is sufficient risk that player 2 responds with A) player 1 will retract and agree on the compromise.\n\n===War of attrition===\nLike \"Chicken\", the \"War of attrition\" game models escalation of conflict, but they differ in the form in which the conflict can escalate. Chicken models a situation in which the catastrophic outcome differs in kind from the agreeable outcome, e.g., if the conflict is over life and death. War of attrition models a situation in which the outcomes differ only in degrees, such as a boxing match in which the contestants have to decide whether the ultimate prize of victory is worth the ongoing cost of deteriorating health and stamina.\n\n===Hawk\u2013dove and war of attrition===\nThe Hawk\u2013Dove game is the most commonly used game theoretical model of aggressive interactions in biology.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, J.]] 1998. Evolutionary Genetics. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-850231-9}}</ref>  The [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] is another very influential model of aggression in biology.  The two models investigate slightly different questions.  The Hawk\u2013Dove game is a model of escalation, and addresses the question of when ought an individual escalate to dangerously costly physical combat.  The war of attrition seeks to answer the question of how contests may be resolved when there is no possibility of physical combat.  The war of attrition is an [[auction]] in which both players pay the lower [[Bidding|bid]] (an all-pay second price auction).  The bids are assumed to be the duration which the player is willing to persist in making a costly [[threat display]].  Both players accrue costs while displaying at each other, the contest ends when the individual making the lower bid quits.  Both players will then have paid the lower bid.\n\n===Chicken and prisoner's dilemma===\nChicken is a symmetrical 2x2 game with conflicting interests, the preferred outcome is to play ''Straight'' while the opponent plays ''Swerve''.  Similarly, the [[prisoner's dilemma]] is a symmetrical 2x2 game with conflicting interests: the preferred outcome is to ''Defect'' while the opponent plays ''Cooperate''.  PD is about the impossibility of cooperation while Chicken is about the inevitability of conflict. Iterated play can solve PD but not Chicken. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1043463190002004004 {{Payoff matrix | Name = Prisoner's dilemma. Payoff ranks (to Row player) are: '''T'''emptation > '''C'''oordination > '''N'''eutral > '''P'''unishment.\n                | 2L = Defect       | 2R = Cooperate       |\n1U = Defect       | UL = N       | UR = T       |\n1D = Cooperate       | DL = P       | DR = C       }}\n\nBoth games have a desirable cooperative outcome in which both players choose the less escalated strategy, ''Swerve-Swerve'' in the Chicken game, and ''Cooperate-Cooperate'' in the prisoner's dilemma, such that players receive the ''Coordination'' payoff C (see tables below).  The temptation away from this sensible outcome is towards a ''Straight'' move in Chicken and a ''Defect'' move in the prisoner's dilemma (generating the '''T'''emptation payoff, should the other player use the less escalated move). The essential difference between these two games is that in the prisoner's dilemma, the ''Cooperate'' strategy is dominated, whereas in Chicken the equivalent move is not dominated since the outcome payoffs when the opponent plays the more escalated move (''Straight'' in place of ''Defect'') are reversed.\n\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Chicken/Hawk\u2013Dove.

Cambridge University Press, 1998.</ref>  is used in [[project management]] and [[software development]] circles. The condition occurs when two or more areas of a product team claim they can deliver features at an unrealistically early date because each assumes the other teams are stretching the predictions even more than they are. This pretense continually moves forward past one project checkpoint to the next until feature [[Integration testing|integration]] begins or just before the functionality is actually due.\n\nThe practice of \"schedule chicken\"<ref>Beck, K and Fowler, M: ''Planning Extreme Programming'', page 33. Safari Tech Books, 2000.</ref> often results in contagious schedule slips due to the inter-team dependencies and is difficult to identify and resolve, as it is in the best interest of each team not to be the first bearer of bad news. The psychological drivers underlining the \"schedule chicken\" behavior in many ways mimic the hawk\u2013dove or [[Prisoner's dilemma#Iterated snowdrift|snowdrift model]] of conflict.<ref>{{cite web|author=Martin T. |url=http://macronomy.blogspot.in/2012_02_01_archive.html |title=Macronomics: February 2012 |publisher=Macronomy.blogspot.in |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brinkmanship]]\n*[[Coordination game]]\n*[[Fireship]], a naval tactic of intentional suicidal ramming into an enemy ship\n*[[Matching pennies]]\n*[[Volunteer's dilemma]]\n*[[War of attrition (game)|War of attrition]]\n*[[Prisoner's dilemma]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal|author = [[Carl Bergstrom|Bergstrom, C.

The final addition to the original Blackhearts was drummer Danny \"Furious\" O'Brien, formerly of the San Francisco band the [[Avengers (band)|Avengers]]. This lineup played several gigs at the [[Golden Bear (nightclub)|Golden Bear]], in Huntington Beach, California and the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Hollywood before embarking on their first European tour, which consisted of an extensive tour of the Netherlands and a few key shows in England, including the Marquee in London.<ref name=\"badrep\">{{cite web| last=Jett|first=Joan|title=Joan Jett and the Blackhearts&nbsp;\u2013 An Open Forum with Joan Jett!|volume=2, Issue 4|website=Bad Reputation Nation|date=July 1992|url=http://joanjettbadrep.com/Interviews/fanclub/Vol2Issue4.shtml|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLaguna fired O'Brien at the end of the tour,<ref name=\"Record8\"/> and upon returning to the States, Jett, Ryan, and Ambel moved to [[Long Beach, New York]].

It's beautiful, and I still have it, but it's heavy as shit. I jump and run around a lot onstage, and it was really getting to my shoulder, so I was looking for a lighter guitar. I heard from one of our road crew that [[Eric Carmen]] from the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] was selling a Melody Maker, so I ended up buying it. Now, this is the guitar that he played on \"Go All the Way\" and all those [Raspberries] hits. And then I played it on \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Crimson and Clover\", \"Do You Want to Touch Me\", \"Bad Reputation\" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it. I'm actually kind of afraid to bring out the original. It's got a great heritage. It's a guitar full of hits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/dear-guitar-hero-joan-jett-talks-gibson-melody-makers-runaways-pre-show-jitters-and-more|title=Joan Jett Talks Gibson Melody Makers, the Runaways, Pre-Show Jitters and More|author=Brad Angle|website=Guitar WOrld|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ericcarmen.com/forums/index.php?/topic/31131-joan-jett-talks-erics-guitar/|title=Joan Jett Talks Eric's Guitar|website=EricCarmen.com|accessdate=October 9, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Joan Jett by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|Jett promoting [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], New York City, 2010]]\n\nJett has consistently refused either to confirm or deny rumors that she is lesbian or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]].

The final addition to the original Blackhearts was drummer Danny \"Furious\" O'Brien, formerly of the San Francisco band the [[Avengers (band)|Avengers]]. This lineup played several gigs at the [[Golden Bear (nightclub)|Golden Bear]], in Huntington Beach, California and the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Hollywood before embarking on their first European tour, which consisted of an extensive tour of the Netherlands and a few key shows in England, including the Marquee in London.<ref name=\"badrep\">{{cite web| last=Jett|first=Joan|title=Joan Jett and the Blackhearts&nbsp;\u2013 An Open Forum with Joan Jett!|volume=2, Issue 4|website=Bad Reputation Nation|date=July 1992|url=http://joanjettbadrep.com/Interviews/fanclub/Vol2Issue4.shtml|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLaguna fired O'Brien at the end of the tour,<ref name=\"Record8\"/> and upon returning to the States, Jett, Ryan, and Ambel moved to [[Long Beach, New York]].

It's beautiful, and I still have it, but it's heavy as shit. I jump and run around a lot onstage, and it was really getting to my shoulder, so I was looking for a lighter guitar.

Now, this is the guitar that he played on \"Go All the Way\" and all those [Raspberries] hits. And then I played it on \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Crimson and Clover\", \"Do You Want to Touch Me\", \"Bad Reputation\" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it. I'm actually kind of afraid to bring out the original. It's got a great heritage.

It runs {{convert|144|mi|km|0}} from its northwestern terminus at [[Interstate 90 in Washington|I-90]] in [[Ellensburg, Washington]], to its southeastern terminus at [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] in [[Hermiston, Oregon]]. The highway passes through [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] and the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]], and is also part of the link between [[Seattle]] and [[Boise, Idaho]]. I-82 travels [[concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 97 in Washington|U.S. Route 97]] (US&nbsp;97) between Ellensburg and [[Union Gap, Washington|Union Gap]]; [[U.S. Route 12 in Washington|US&nbsp;12]] from Yakima to the Tri-Cities; and [[U.S. Route 395|US&nbsp;395]] from [[Kennewick, Washington|Kennewick]] and [[Umatilla, Oregon]].\n\nI-82 primarily serves the [[Yakima River|Yakima Valley]] agricultural region, following the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers southeastward to the Tri-Cities. The highway enters the valley from the north by crossing the [[Manastash Ridge]], which separates Yakima from the [[Kittitas Valley]]. I-82 bypasses the Tri-Cities by traveling southwest around [[Richland, Washington|Richland]] and Kennewick, turning south to cross the Columbia River on the [[Umatilla Bridge]]. Its only [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary route]], [[Interstate 182|I-182]], connects the highway to Richland and [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]] in the Tri-Cities.\n\nThe I-82 corridor was originally used by several state and national highways, including the [[Inland Empire Highway]] and [[U.S. Route 410|US&nbsp;410]], which were built in the early 20th century. The federal government created I-82 in late 1957 to serve military facilities in the region, replacing an earlier designation for what is now I-84. The first section of I-82 to be constructed was the easterly bypass of Yakima, which opened in 1963 and was gradually extended north to Ellensburg by 1971. The Yakima Valley section, connecting Union Gap to [[Prosser, Washington|Prosser]], was constructed between 1977 and 1982.\n\nThe routing of the highway between Prosser and I-84 was very controversial with residents of the Tri-Cities area, who lobbied for a longer I-82 alignment to serve them. Oregon legislators and highway officials remained opposed to a routing that bypassed Umatilla, leading to several attempts at finding a compromise along the [[Wallula Gap]] or in other areas southeast of the Tri-Cities. In 1973, Oregon and Washington adopted a federal compromise to build I-82 through Umatilla and around the outskirts of the Tri-Cities with a spur route (I-182) to serve the area directly. The Tri-Cities section opened in 1986 while in Oregon, the final section of I-82 was completed in 1988. In the early 2000s, Oregon highway officials examined plans to extend I-82 further south through [[eastern Oregon]] and towards [[California]], but rejected them from further consideration.\n\n==Route description==\n\nI-82 travels {{convert|143.6|mi|km|0}}<ref name=\"FHWA log\"/> through a part of the [[Inland Northwest (United States)|Inland Northwest]] in a generally northwest\u2013southeast direction along the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers.<ref name=\"WSDOT-Map\">{{cite map |year=2014 |title=Washington State Highways 2014\u20132015 |scale=1:842,000 |url=https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2006/06/13/TouristMapFront_withoutHillshade.pdf |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |postscript=none |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}, with [https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Publications/HighwayMap/view.htm inset maps].</ref> The four-lane divided highway forms part of the link between [[Seattle]] and the inland West, which includes [[Boise, Idaho]] and [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]].<ref>{{cite web |date=March 29, 2018 |title=Corridor Sketch Summary \u2013 I-82: Union Gap to Oregon Border (Umatilla) |url=https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2018/02/05/CSS513-i82-UnionGap-OregonBorderUmatilla.pdf |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |date=December 1972 |title=Draft Environmental Statement: Interstate 82/182, Prosser, Washington to Interstate 80N in Oregon |page=1 |publisher=Washington State Department of Highways, Oregon State Highway Division |oclc=16701863 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heQ0AQAAMAAJ&pg=SA1-PA1#v=onepage |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Port of Grandview: Transportation |url=http://portofgrandview.org/transportation/ |publisher=[[Port of Grandview]] |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> I-82 is a component of the [[Interstate Highway System]] and is also designated as an important national highway under the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Highway System Routes \u2013 Washington State |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/travel/hpms/NHSRoutes.htm |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |date=March 25, 2015 |title=National Highway System: Oregon |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/oregon/or_oregon.pdf |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> It is also listed as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the Washington state government.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 26, 2009 |title=Transportation Commission List of Highways of Statewide Significance |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2006/03/16/HSSlist2009mod2.pdf |publisher=[[Washington State Transportation Commission]] |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref> I-82 has one [[auxiliary Interstate Highway|auxiliary route]], [[Interstate 182|I-182]], a spur route that serves the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]] region.<ref>{{cite web |date=December 31, 2017 |title=Table 2: Auxiliary Routes of the Dwight D.

The westernmost route would follow [[U.S. Route 97 in Oregon|US&nbsp;97]] from [[Klamath Falls, Oregon|Klamath Falls]] through [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]] and [[Redmond, Oregon|Redmond]] to [[Biggs Junction, Oregon|Biggs Junction]], relying on I-84 to complete its connection with I-82. A variation of the route with a direct connection to I-82 near Hermiston would branch off at [[Madras, Oregon|Madras]] and travel northeastward through a mountainous region along [[Oregon Route 218|Route&nbsp;218]] and [[Oregon Route 207|Route&nbsp;207]]. The easternmost route would follow [[U.S. Route 395 in Oregon|US&nbsp;395]] between the California border and Pendleton, passing through a less-densely populated region but serving [[Burns, Oregon|Burns]] and [[John Day, Oregon|John Day]].<ref name=\"ODOT-2001Study\">{{cite report |author=ODOT Transportation Development Division |date=April 2001 |title=Study of Eastern Oregon Freeway Alternatives, Pursuant to House Bill 3090 |url=https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Planning/Documents/Eastern-Oregon-Freeway-Alternatives-Study.pdf |publisher=Oregon Department of Transportation |accessdate=September 9, 2018}}</ref> The study found that a new freeway would have little effect on economic growth in eastern Oregon and the relief of congestion in the [[Willamette Valley]], but would provide a suitable alternative route for long-haul travel.<ref name=\"ODOT-2001Study\"/>\n\nSince the 1990s, the Washington state government has improved or rebuilt several interchanges on I-82, particularly in the Yakima area.

It runs {{convert|144|mi|km|0}} from its northwestern terminus at [[Interstate 90 in Washington|I-90]] in [[Ellensburg, Washington]], to its southeastern terminus at [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] in [[Hermiston, Oregon]]. The highway passes through [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] and the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]], and is also part of the link between [[Seattle]] and [[Boise, Idaho]]. I-82 travels [[concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 97 in Washington|U.S. Route 97]] (US&nbsp;97) between Ellensburg and [[Union Gap, Washington|Union Gap]]; [[U.S. Route 12 in Washington|US&nbsp;12]] from Yakima to the Tri-Cities; and [[U.S. Route 395|US&nbsp;395]] from [[Kennewick, Washington|Kennewick]] and [[Umatilla, Oregon]].\n\nI-82 primarily serves the [[Yakima River|Yakima Valley]] agricultural region, following the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers southeastward to the Tri-Cities. The highway enters the valley from the north by crossing the [[Manastash Ridge]], which separates Yakima from the [[Kittitas Valley]]. I-82 bypasses the Tri-Cities by traveling southwest around [[Richland, Washington|Richland]] and Kennewick, turning south to cross the Columbia River on the [[Umatilla Bridge]]. Its only [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary route]], [[Interstate 182|I-182]], connects the highway to Richland and [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]] in the Tri-Cities.\n\nThe I-82 corridor was originally used by several state and national highways, including the [[Inland Empire Highway]] and [[U.S. Route 410|US&nbsp;410]], which were built in the early 20th century. The federal government created I-82 in late 1957 to serve military facilities in the region, replacing an earlier designation for what is now I-84. The first section of I-82 to be constructed was the easterly bypass of Yakima, which opened in 1963 and was gradually extended north to Ellensburg by 1971. The Yakima Valley section, connecting Union Gap to [[Prosser, Washington|Prosser]], was constructed between 1977 and 1982.\n\nThe routing of the highway between Prosser and I-84 was very controversial with residents of the Tri-Cities area, who lobbied for a longer I-82 alignment to serve them. Oregon legislators and highway officials remained opposed to a routing that bypassed Umatilla, leading to several attempts at finding a compromise along the [[Wallula Gap]] or in other areas southeast of the Tri-Cities. In 1973, Oregon and Washington adopted a federal compromise to build I-82 through Umatilla and around the outskirts of the Tri-Cities with a spur route (I-182) to serve the area directly. The Tri-Cities section opened in 1986 while in Oregon, the final section of I-82 was completed in 1988. In the early 2000s, Oregon highway officials examined plans to extend I-82 further south through [[eastern Oregon]] and towards [[California]], but rejected them from further consideration.\n\n==Route description==\n\nI-82 travels {{convert|143.6|mi|km|0}}<ref name=\"FHWA log\"/> through a part of the [[Inland Northwest (United States)|Inland Northwest]] in a generally northwest\u2013southeast direction along the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers.<ref name=\"WSDOT-Map\">{{cite map |year=2014 |title=Washington State Highways 2014\u20132015 |scale=1:842,000 |url=https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2006/06/13/TouristMapFront_withoutHillshade.pdf |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |postscript=none |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}, with [https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Publications/HighwayMap/view.htm inset maps].</ref> The four-lane divided highway forms part of the link between [[Seattle]] and the inland West, which includes [[Boise, Idaho]] and [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]].<ref>{{cite web |date=March 29, 2018 |title=Corridor Sketch Summary \u2013 I-82: Union Gap to Oregon Border (Umatilla) |url=https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2018/02/05/CSS513-i82-UnionGap-OregonBorderUmatilla.pdf |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |date=December 1972 |title=Draft Environmental Statement: Interstate 82/182, Prosser, Washington to Interstate 80N in Oregon |page=1 |publisher=Washington State Department of Highways, Oregon State Highway Division |oclc=16701863 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heQ0AQAAMAAJ&pg=SA1-PA1#v=onepage |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Port of Grandview: Transportation |url=http://portofgrandview.org/transportation/ |publisher=[[Port of Grandview]] |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> I-82 is a component of the [[Interstate Highway System]] and is also designated as an important national highway under the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Highway System Routes \u2013 Washington State |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/travel/hpms/NHSRoutes.htm |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |date=March 25, 2015 |title=National Highway System: Oregon |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/oregon/or_oregon.pdf |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> It is also listed as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the Washington state government.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 26, 2009 |title=Transportation Commission List of Highways of Statewide Significance |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2006/03/16/HSSlist2009mod2.pdf |publisher=[[Washington State Transportation Commission]] |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref> I-82 has one [[auxiliary Interstate Highway|auxiliary route]], [[Interstate 182|I-182]], a spur route that serves the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]] region.<ref>{{cite web |date=December 31, 2017 |title=Table 2: Auxiliary Routes of the Dwight D.
