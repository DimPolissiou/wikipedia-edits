This is because of the wide variety of habitats the Parks Trust has created, from old grassland managed as wildflower meadows, through patches of thorn scrub to extensive marsh. [[Primula veris|cowslips]] and [[Sanguisorba minor|salad burnet]] flower in the spring, followed in summer to the customary flowers of traditional hay meadow: [[Galium verum|lady's bedstraw]] and [[Lotus corniculatus|birdsfoot trefoil]].\n\nBancroft [[p\u00e9tanque]] Piste, which is near the Roman villa site, is provided by the Parks Trust free of charge. Also known as boules, p\u00e9tanque is a traditional game played with steel balls on any sandy or gravelly surface across a large part of Europe.\n\nThe Bancrofts comprise just half the H2/H3/V5/V6 grid square, which is divided by the [[West Coast Main Line]]; the line is also the parish boundary, with Stacey Bushes (in [[Wolverton and Greenleys]] parish) on the other side of the tracks.
