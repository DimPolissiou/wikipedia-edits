The small Congressional Library was housed in the [[United States Capitol]] for most of the 19th century until the early 1890s. Most of the original collection had been destroyed by the British in 1814 during the [[War of 1812]], and the library sought to restore its collection in 1815. They bought [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s entire personal collection of 6,487 books.  After a period of slow growth, another fire struck the library in its Capitol chambers in 1851, again destroying a large amount of the collection, including many of Jefferson's books.  After the [[American Civil War]], the Library of Congress grew rapidly in both size and importance, which sparked a campaign to purchase replacement copies for volumes that had been burned. The library received the right of transference of all copyrighted works to deposit two copies of books, maps, illustrations, and diagrams printed in the United States. It also began to build its collections, and its development culminated between 1888 and 1894 with the construction of a separate, extensive library building across the street from the Capitol.\n\nThe library's primary mission is to research inquiries made by members of Congress, carried out through the [[Congressional Research Service]]. The library is open to the public, although only high-ranking government officials and library employees may check out books and materials.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Loc contruction.jpg|thumb|right|alt=indigo progress construction photographs of the Library of Congress Jefferson Building|Construction of the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] from July 8, 1888 to May 15, 1894]]\n\n===1800\u20131851: Origin and Jefferson's contribution===\n\n[[James Madison]] is credited with the idea of creating a congressional library, first making such a proposition in 1783.<ref name=\":4\">Murray, Stuart.

However, he believed that all subjects had a place in the Library of Congress.

With the addition of his collection, the Library of Congress was transformed from a specialist's library to a more general one.<ref>Murray, Stuart A.P. The Library: An Illustrated History. Skyhorse Publishing, 2012. 9781616084530, pp. 161</ref> His original collection was organized into a scheme based on [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Works by Francis Bacon#Scientific works|organization of knowledge]]. Specifically, he grouped his books into Memory, Reason, and Imagination, which broke down into 44 more subdivisions. The library followed Jefferson's organization scheme until the late 19th century, when librarian [[Herbert Putnam]] began work on a more flexible Library of Congress Classification structure that now applies to more than 138 million items.\n\nIn 1851, a fire destroyed two thirds of the Jefferson collection, with only 2,000 books remaining.

He built broad bipartisan support for it as a national library and a legislative resource, aided by an overall expansion of the federal government and a favorable political climate. He began comprehensively collecting [[Americana]] and [[American literature]], led the construction of a new building to house the library, and transformed the librarian of Congress position into one of strength and independence.  Between 1865 and 1870, Congress appropriated funds for the construction of the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], placed all copyright registration and deposit activities under the library's control, and restored the international book exchange. The library also acquired the vast libraries of the Smithsonian and of historian [[Peter Force]], strengthening its scientific and Americana collections significantly. By 1876, the Library of Congress had 300,000 volumes and was tied with the [[Boston Public Library]] as the nation's largest library. It moved from the Capitol building to its new headquarters in 1897 with more than 840,000 volumes, 40 percent of which had been acquired through copyright deposit.<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n[[File:Hl026001.jpg|thumb|right|alt=piles of books waiting to be shelved in Thomas Jefferson building|Some of the Library of Congress' holdings awaiting shelving inside the newly opened Thomas Jefferson Building in 1897]]\n\nA year before the library's move to its new location, the Joint Library Committee held a session of hearings to assess the condition of the library and plan for its future growth and possible reorganization. Spofford and six experts sent by the [[American Library Association]]<ref>These included future Librarian of Congress [[Herbert Putnam]] and [[Melvil Dewey]] of the [[New York State Library]].</ref> testified that the library should continue its expansion towards becoming a true national library. Congress more than doubled the library's staff from 42 to 108 based on the hearings, and with the assistance of senators [[Justin Morrill]] of Vermont and [[Daniel W. Voorhees]] of Indiana, and established new administrative units for all aspects of the collection. Congress also strengthened the office of Librarian of Congress to govern the library and make staff appointments, as well as requiring Senate approval for presidential appointees to the position.<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\n===1897\u20131939: Post-reorganization===\n[[File:The Library of Congress, Washington-LCCN2008678216 (cropped).jpg|thumb|alt=bird's eye view color postcard of Library of Congress Jefferson building|The Library of Congress in 1902]]\n[[File:South Reading Room, with murals by Ezra Winter.

Spofford's successor [[John Russell Young]], though only in office for two years, overhauled the library's bureaucracy, used his connections as a former diplomat to acquire more materials from around the world, and established the library's first assistance programs for the [[Blindness|blind]] and physically disabled.  Young's successor [[Herbert Putnam]] held the office for forty years from 1899 to 1939, entering into the position two years before the library became the first in the United States to hold one million volumes.<ref name=\"loc history\"/> Putnam focused his efforts on making the library more accessible and useful for the public and for other libraries. He instituted the interlibrary loan service, transforming the Library of Congress into what he referred to as a \"library of last resort\".<ref name=\"interlibrary loan\">{{cite web| title=Interlibrary Loan (Collections Access, Management and Loan Division, Library of Congress)| url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/loan/| date=October 25, 2007| publisher=Library of Congress website| accessdate =December 4, 2007}}</ref> Putnam also expanded library access to \"scientific investigators and duly qualified individuals\" and began publishing [[primary sources]] for the benefit of scholars.<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\nPutnam's tenure also saw increasing diversity in the library's acquisitions. In 1903, he persuaded President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to transfer by executive order the papers of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] from the State Department to the Library of Congress. Putnam expanded foreign acquisitions as well, including the 1904 purchase of a four-thousand volume library of [[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]], the 1906 purchase of G. V. Yudin's eighty-thousand volume Russian library, the 1908 Schatz collection of early opera [[librettos]], and the early 1930s purchase of the Russian Imperial Collection, consisting of 2,600 volumes from the library of the [[Romanov family]] on a variety of topics. Collections of [[Hebraica]] and Chinese and Japanese works were also acquired.  Congress even took the initiative to acquire materials for the library in one occasion, when in 1929 Congressman [[Ross Collins]] of Mississippi successfully proposed the $1.5 million purchase of Otto Vollbehr's collection of [[incunabula]], including one of three remaining perfect vellum copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Snapp |first=Elizabeth |title=The Acquisition of the Vollbehr Collection of Incunabula for the Library of Congress |journal=The Journal of Library History |volume=10 |issue=2 |date=April 1975 |pages=152\u2013161 |publisher=University of Texas Press |jstor=25540624 }} (restricted access)</ref><ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|alt=Gutenberg bible open to page|A copy of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] on display at the Library of Congress]]\nIn 1914, Putnam established the [[Legislative Reference Service]] as a separative administrative unit of the library. Based in the [[Progressive era]]'s philosophy of science as a problem-solver, and modeled after successful research branches of state legislatures, the LRS would provide informed answers to Congressional research inquiries on almost any topic.  In 1965, Congress passed an act allowing the Library of Congress to establish a trust fund board to accept donations and endowments, giving the library a role as a patron of the arts. The library received the donations and endowments of prominent individuals such as [[John D. Rockefeller]], James B. Wilbur and [[Archer M. Huntington]]. Gertrude Clarke Whittall donated five [[List of Stradivarius instruments#Violins|Stradivarius violins]] to the library and [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]]'s donations paid for a [[concert hall]] within the Library of Congress building and the establishment of an [[honorarium]] for the Music Division. A number of chairs and consultantships were established from the donations, the most well-known of which is the [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Poet Laureate Consultant]].<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\nThe library's expansion eventually filled the library's Main Building, despite shelving expansions in 1910 and 1927, forcing the library to expand into a new structure. Congress acquired nearby land in 1928 and approved construction of the Annex Building (later the John Adams Building) in 1930. Although delayed during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] years, it was completed in 1938 and opened to the public in 1939.<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\n===1939\u2013present: Modern history===\n[[File:Erotica at Library of Congress, Washington D.C. 02223u original.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=mural painting titled ''Erotica'', by George Randolph Bars|''Erotica'', mural painting by [[George Randolph Barse]] (1861\u20131938) in the Library of Congress]]\n[[File:Minerva of Peace.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=mosaic wall decoration ''Minerva of Peace mosaic'' by Elihu Vedder|[[Elihu Vedder]]'s ''Minerva of Peace mosaic'']]\n\nWhen Putnam retired in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed [[Archibald MacLeish]] as his successor. Occupying the post from 1939 to 1944 during the height of World War II, MacLeish became the most visible librarian of Congress in the library's history. MacLeish encouraged librarians to oppose [[totalitarianism]] on behalf of democracy; dedicated the South Reading Room of the Adams Building to Thomas Jefferson, commissioning artist [[Ezra Winter]] to paint four themed murals for the room; and established a \"democracy alcove\" in the Main Reading Room of the Jefferson Building for important documents such as the Declaration, Constitution and ''[[The Federalist Papers]]''. The Library of Congress even assisted during the war effort, ranging from the storage of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution]] in [[Fort Knox]] for safekeeping to researching weather data on the [[Himalayas]] for [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilots.  MacLeish resigned in 1944 to become Assistant Secretary of State, and President [[Harry Truman]] appointed [[Luther H. Evans]] as librarian of Congress. Evans, who served until 1953, expanded the library's acquisitions, cataloging and bibliographic services as much as the fiscal-minded Congress would allow, but his primary achievement was the creation of Library of Congress Missions around the world. Missions played a variety of roles in the postwar world: the mission in San Francisco assisted participants in the [[meeting that established the United Nations]], the mission in Europe acquired European publications for the Library of Congress and other American libraries, and the mission in Japan aided in the creation of the [[National Diet Library]].<ref name=\"loc history\"/> \nEvans' successor [[Lawrence Quincy Mumford]] took over in 1953. Mumford's tenure, lasting until 1974, saw the initiation of the construction of the James Madison Memorial Building, the third Library of Congress building. Mumford directed the library during a period of increased educational spending, the windfall of which allowed the library to devote energies towards establishing new acquisition centers abroad, including in [[Cairo]] and New Delhi. In 1967, the library began experimenting with [[book preservation]] techniques through a Preservation Office, which grew to become the largest library research and conservation effort in the United States.  Mumford's administration also saw the last major public debate about the Library of Congress' role as both a legislative library and a national library. A 1962 memorandum by Douglas Bryant of the [[Harvard University Library]], compiled at the request of Joint Library Committee chairman [[Claiborne Pell]], proposed a number of institutional reforms, including expansion of national activities and services and various organizational changes, all of which would shift the library more towards its national role over its legislative role. Bryant even suggested possibly changing the name of the Library of Congress, which was rebuked by Mumford as \"unspeakable violence to tradition\".  Debate continued within the library community until the [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970]] shifted the library back towards its legislative roles, placing greater focus on research for Congress and congressional committees and renaming the Legislative Reference Service to the [[Congressional Research Service]].<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\nAfter Mumford retired in 1974, Gerald Ford appointed [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] as librarian. Boorstin's first challenge was the move to the new Madison Building, which took place between 1980 and 1982. The move released pressures on staff and shelf space, allowing Boorstin to focus on other areas of library administration such as acquisitions and collections. Taking advantage of steady budgetary growth, from $116 million in 1975 to over $250 million by 1987, Boorstin actively participated in enhancing ties with scholars, authors, publishers, cultural leaders, and the business community. His active and prolific role changed the post of librarian of Congress so that by the time he retired in 1987, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"perhaps the leading intellectual public position in the nation\".\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan nominated [[James H. Billington]] as the 13th librarian of Congress in 1987, and the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed the appointment.<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{Cite web|title = Key Milestones of James H.

Onsite access to the Library of Congress was also increased when Billington advocated successfully for an underground connection between the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center and the library in 2008 to increase congressional usage and public tours of the library's Thomas Jefferson Building.<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/>\n\nUnder Billington, the library launched a [[mass deacidification]] program in 2001, which has extended the lifespan of almost 4 million volumes and 12 million manuscript sheets; and new collection storage modules at Fort Meade, the first opening in 2002, to preserve and make accessible more than 4 million items from the library's analog collections. Billington established the Library Collections Security Oversight Committee in 1992 to improve protection of collections, and also the Library of Congress Congressional Caucus in 2008 to draw attention to the library's curators and collections. He created the library's first Young Readers Center in the Jefferson Building in 2009, and the first large-scale summer intern (Junior Fellows) program for university\nstudents in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 2015 Junior Fellows Summer Intern Program Home (Library of Congress)|url = https://www.loc.gov/hr/jrfellows/|website = Loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}</ref> Under Billington, the library also sponsored the Gateway to Knowledge in 2010\u20132011, a mobile exhibition to 90 sites covering all states east of the Mississippi in a specially designed 18-wheel truck, increasing public access to library collections off-site, particularly for rural populations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gateway to Knowledge \u2013 Educational Resources \u2013 Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/gateway/resources.html|website = Loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}</ref>\n\nBillington raised more than half a billion dollars of private support to supplement Congressional appropriations for library collections, programs, and digital outreach. These private funds helped the library to continue its growth and outreach in the face of a 30% decrease in staffing caused mainly by legislative appropriations cutbacks. He created the library's first development office for private fundraising in 1987, and, in 1990, established the James Madison Council, the library's first national private sector donor-support group. In 1987, Billington also asked the GAO to conduct the first library-wide audit, and he created the first Office of the Inspector General at the library to provide regular independent review of library operations. This precedent led to regular annual financial audits, leading to unmodified (\"clean\") opinions from 1995 onwards.<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/>\n\nIn April 2010, it announced plans to archive all public communication on [[Twitter]], including all communication since Twitter's launch in March 2006.<ref name=Grier>{{cite news| first=Peter| last=Grier| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2010/0416/Twitter-hits-Library-of-Congress-Would-Founding-Fathers-tweet| title=Twitter hits Library of Congress: Would Founding Fathers tweet?| work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=16 April 2010 |accessdate=2015-01-04}}</ref> {{As of|2015}}, the Twitter archive remains unfinished.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zimmer|first1=Michael|title=The Twitter Archive at the Library of Congress: Challenges for information practice and information policy|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5619/4653|website=First Monday}}</ref>\n\nBefore retiring in 2015, after 28 years of service, Billington had come \"under pressure\" as librarian of Congress.<ref>\"[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article41942157.html Librarian of Congress gets a Due Date]\" by Maria Recio, McClatchy DC, Oct. 30. 2015</ref> This followed a [[Government Accountability Office]] report which revealed a \"work environment lacking central oversight\" and faulted Billington for \"ignoring repeated calls to hire a chief information officer, as required by law.\"<ref>\"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/americas-national-library-is-behind-the-digital-curve-a-new-report-finds/2015/03/31/fad54c3a-d3fd-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html America's 'national library' is lacking in leadership, yet another report finds]\" by Peggy McGlone, The Washington Post, March 31, 2015.</ref>\n\nWhen Billington announced his plans to retire in 2015, commentator George Weigel described the Library of Congress as \"one of the last refuges in Washington of serious bipartisanship and calm, considered conversation,\" and \"one of the world's greatest cultural centers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = America's Next 'Minister of Culture': Don't Politicize the Appointment|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/419664/americas-next-minister-culture-dont-politicize-appointment|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}</ref>\n\nCarla Hayden was sworn in as the 14th librarian of Congress on September 14, 2016, becoming both the first woman and the first African-American to hold the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/07/13/carla-hayden-confirmed-as-14th-librarian-of-congress/|title=Carla Hayden confirmed as 14th librarian of Congress|first1=Peggy|last1=McGlone|first2=Peggy|last2=McGlone|date=July 13, 2016|website=Washingtonpost.com|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/latest-links/carla-hayden-sworn-september-14/|title=Carla Hayden to be sworn in on September 14 \u2013 American Libraries Magazine|website=Americanlibrariesmagazine.org|accessdate=May 5, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510073226/https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/latest-links/carla-hayden-sworn-september-14/|archivedate=May 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the library announced the Librarian-in-Residence program which aims to support the future generation of librarians by giving them opportunity to gain work experience in five different areas of librarianship including: Acquisitions/Collection Development, Cataloging/Metadata, and Collection Preservation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/librarians/librarians-in-residence/|title=Librarians-in-Residence -|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Holdings==\n[[File:Library of Congress and lawn.jpg|alt=photograph of west colonnade by Carol M.

After realizing that this plan would be too expensive and inefficient, and with the rise of the Internet, the library decided to instead make digitized material available over the Internet. This project was made official in the National Digital Library Program (NDLP), created in October 1994. By 1999, the NDLP had succeeded in digitizing over 5 million objects and had a budget of $12 million. The library has kept the \"American Memory\" name for its public domain website, which today contains 15 million digital objects, comprising over 7 [[petabyte]]s.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-library-of-last-resort/|title=The Library of Last Resort|last=Chayka|first=Kyle|date=2016-07-14|website=|publisher=n+1 Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235106/https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-library-of-last-resort/|archive-date=January 19, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAmerican Memory is a source for [[public domain]] image resources, as well as audio, video, and archived Web content.

Librarians all over the world consult these catalogs, through the Web or through other media better suited to their needs, when they need to catalog for their collection a book published in the United States. They use the [[Library of Congress Control Number]] to make sure of the exact identity of the book.

It makes determinations about what objects to prioritize based on what is especially important to Congress or potentially interesting for the public. The 15 million digitized items represent less than 10% of the library's total 160-million item collection.\n\nThe library has chosen not to participate in other digital library projects such as [[Google Books]] and the [[Digital Public Library of America]], although it has supported the [[Internet Archive]] project.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====THOMAS and Congress.gov projects====\nIn 1995, the Library of Congress established online archive of the proceedings of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], [[THOMAS]].

One may not remove library items from the reading rooms or the library buildings. Most of the library's general collection of books and journals is in the closed stacks of the Jefferson and Adams Buildings; specialized collections of books and other materials are in closed stacks in all three main library buildings, or are stored off-site. Access to the closed stacks is not permitted under any circumstances, except to authorized library staff, and occasionally, to dignitaries. Only the reading room reference collections are on open shelves.\n\nSince 1902, American libraries have been able to request books and other items through [[interlibrary loan]] from the Library of Congress if these items are not readily available elsewhere. Through this system, the Library of Congress has served as a \"library of last resort\", according to former librarian of Congress [[Herbert Putnam]].<ref name=\"interlibrary loan\"/> The Library of Congress lends books to other libraries with the stipulation that they be used only inside the borrowing library.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/loan/loanweb1.html |title=Subpage Title (Interlibrary Loan, Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref>\n\n==Standards==\nIn addition to its library services, the Library of Congress is also actively involved in various standard activities in areas related to bibliographical and search and retrieve standards.

[[United States Congress]] and is the ''[[de facto]]'' national library of the United States. It is the oldest federal cultural institution in the United States. The library is housed in three buildings on [[Capitol Hill]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; it also maintains the [[National Audio-Visual Conservation Center]] in [[Culpeper, Virginia]].<ref name=\"Fascinating Facts\" /> The library's functions are overseen by the [[librarian of Congress]], and its buildings are maintained by the [[architect of the Capitol]].

The small Congressional Library was housed in the [[United States Capitol]] for most of the 19th century until the early 1890s. Most of the original collection had been destroyed by the British in 1814 during the [[War of 1812]], and the library sought to restore its collection in 1815. They bought [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s entire personal collection of 6,487 books.  After a period of slow growth, another fire struck the library in its Capitol chambers in 1851, again destroying a large amount of the collection, including many of Jefferson's books.  After the [[American Civil War]], the Library of Congress grew rapidly in both size and importance, which sparked a campaign to purchase replacement copies for volumes that had been burned. The library received the right of transference of all copyrighted works to deposit two copies of books, maps, illustrations, and diagrams printed in the United States. It also began to build its collections, and its development culminated between 1888 and 1894 with the construction of a separate, extensive library building across the street from the Capitol.\n\nThe library's primary mission is to research inquiries made by members of Congress, carried out through the [[Congressional Research Service]]. The library is open to the public, although only high-ranking government officials and library employees may check out books and materials.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Loc contruction.jpg|thumb|right|alt=indigo progress construction photographs of the Library of Congress Jefferson Building|Construction of the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] from July 8, 1888 to May 15, 1894]]\n\n===1800\u20131851: Origin and Jefferson's contribution===\n\n[[James Madison]] is credited with the idea of creating a congressional library, first making such a proposition in 1783.<ref name=\":4\">Murray, Stuart.

However, he believed that all subjects had a place in the Library of Congress.

Specifically, he grouped his books into Memory, Reason, and Imagination, which broke down into 44 more subdivisions. The library followed Jefferson's organization scheme until the late 19th century, when librarian [[Herbert Putnam]] began work on a more flexible Library of Congress Classification structure that now applies to more than 138 million items.\n\nIn 1851, a fire destroyed two thirds of the Jefferson collection, with only 2,000 books remaining.

He built broad bipartisan support for it as a national library and a legislative resource, aided by an overall expansion of the federal government and a favorable political climate. He began comprehensively collecting [[Americana]] and [[American literature]], led the construction of a new building to house the library, and transformed the librarian of Congress position into one of strength and independence.  Between 1865 and 1870, Congress appropriated funds for the construction of the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], placed all copyright registration and deposit activities under the library's control, and restored the international book exchange. The library also acquired the vast libraries of the Smithsonian and of historian [[Peter Force]], strengthening its scientific and Americana collections significantly. By 1876, the Library of Congress had 300,000 volumes and was tied with the [[Boston Public Library]] as the nation's largest library. It moved from the Capitol building to its new headquarters in 1897 with more than 840,000 volumes, 40 percent of which had been acquired through copyright deposit.<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n[[File:Hl026001.jpg|thumb|right|alt=piles of books waiting to be shelved in Thomas Jefferson building|Some of the Library of Congress' holdings awaiting shelving inside the newly opened Thomas Jefferson Building in 1897]]\n\nA year before the library's move to its new location, the Joint Library Committee held a session of hearings to assess the condition of the library and plan for its future growth and possible reorganization. Spofford and six experts sent by the [[American Library Association]]<ref>These included future Librarian of Congress [[Herbert Putnam]] and [[Melvil Dewey]] of the [[New York State Library]].</ref> testified that the library should continue its expansion towards becoming a true national library. Congress more than doubled the library's staff from 42 to 108 based on the hearings, and with the assistance of senators [[Justin Morrill]] of Vermont and [[Daniel W. Voorhees]] of Indiana, and established new administrative units for all aspects of the collection. Congress also strengthened the office of Librarian of Congress to govern the library and make staff appointments, as well as requiring Senate approval for presidential appointees to the position.<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\n===1897\u20131939: Post-reorganization===\n[[File:The Library of Congress, Washington-LCCN2008678216 (cropped).jpg|thumb|alt=bird's eye view color postcard of Library of Congress Jefferson building|The Library of Congress in 1902]]\n[[File:South Reading Room, with murals by Ezra Winter.

LCCN2007687090.tif|thumb|Adams Building (opened 1939) \u2013 South Reading Room, with murals by [[Ezra Winter]]]]\nThe Library of Congress, spurred by the 1897 reorganization, began to grow and develop more rapidly. Spofford's successor [[John Russell Young]], though only in office for two years, overhauled the library's bureaucracy, used his connections as a former diplomat to acquire more materials from around the world, and established the library's first assistance programs for the [[Blindness|blind]] and physically disabled.  Young's successor [[Herbert Putnam]] held the office for forty years from 1899 to 1939, entering into the position two years before the library became the first in the United States to hold one million volumes.<ref name=\"loc history\"/> Putnam focused his efforts on making the library more accessible and useful for the public and for other libraries. He instituted the interlibrary loan service, transforming the Library of Congress into what he referred to as a \"library of last resort\".<ref name=\"interlibrary loan\">{{cite web| title=Interlibrary Loan (Collections Access, Management and Loan Division, Library of Congress)| url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/loan/| date=October 25, 2007| publisher=Library of Congress website| accessdate =December 4, 2007}}</ref> Putnam also expanded library access to \"scientific investigators and duly qualified individuals\" and began publishing [[primary sources]] for the benefit of scholars.<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\nPutnam's tenure also saw increasing diversity in the library's acquisitions. In 1903, he persuaded President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to transfer by executive order the papers of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] from the State Department to the Library of Congress. Putnam expanded foreign acquisitions as well, including the 1904 purchase of a four-thousand volume library of [[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]], the 1906 purchase of G. V. Yudin's eighty-thousand volume Russian library, the 1908 Schatz collection of early opera [[librettos]], and the early 1930s purchase of the Russian Imperial Collection, consisting of 2,600 volumes from the library of the [[Romanov family]] on a variety of topics. Collections of [[Hebraica]] and Chinese and Japanese works were also acquired.  Congress even took the initiative to acquire materials for the library in one occasion, when in 1929 Congressman [[Ross Collins]] of Mississippi successfully proposed the $1.5 million purchase of Otto Vollbehr's collection of [[incunabula]], including one of three remaining perfect vellum copies of the [[Gutenberg Bible]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Snapp |first=Elizabeth |title=The Acquisition of the Vollbehr Collection of Incunabula for the Library of Congress |journal=The Journal of Library History |volume=10 |issue=2 |date=April 1975 |pages=152\u2013161 |publisher=University of Texas Press |jstor=25540624 }} (restricted access)</ref><ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|alt=Gutenberg bible open to page|A copy of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] on display at the Library of Congress]]\nIn 1914, Putnam established the [[Legislative Reference Service]] as a separative administrative unit of the library. Based in the [[Progressive era]]'s philosophy of science as a problem-solver, and modeled after successful research branches of state legislatures, the LRS would provide informed answers to Congressional research inquiries on almost any topic.  In 1965, Congress passed an act allowing the Library of Congress to establish a trust fund board to accept donations and endowments, giving the library a role as a patron of the arts. The library received the donations and endowments of prominent individuals such as [[John D. Rockefeller]], James B. Wilbur and [[Archer M. Huntington]]. Gertrude Clarke Whittall donated five [[List of Stradivarius instruments#Violins|Stradivarius violins]] to the library and [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]]'s donations paid for a [[concert hall]] within the Library of Congress building and the establishment of an [[honorarium]] for the Music Division. A number of chairs and consultantships were established from the donations, the most well-known of which is the [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Poet Laureate Consultant]].<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\nThe library's expansion eventually filled the library's Main Building, despite shelving expansions in 1910 and 1927, forcing the library to expand into a new structure. Congress acquired nearby land in 1928 and approved construction of the Annex Building (later the John Adams Building) in 1930. Although delayed during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] years, it was completed in 1938 and opened to the public in 1939.<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\n===1939\u2013present: Modern history===\n[[File:Erotica at Library of Congress, Washington D.C. 02223u original.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=mural painting titled ''Erotica'', by George Randolph Bars|''Erotica'', mural painting by [[George Randolph Barse]] (1861\u20131938) in the Library of Congress]]\n[[File:Minerva of Peace.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=mosaic wall decoration ''Minerva of Peace mosaic'' by Elihu Vedder|[[Elihu Vedder]]'s ''Minerva of Peace mosaic'']]\n\nWhen Putnam retired in 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed [[Archibald MacLeish]] as his successor. Occupying the post from 1939 to 1944 during the height of World War II, MacLeish became the most visible librarian of Congress in the library's history. MacLeish encouraged librarians to oppose [[totalitarianism]] on behalf of democracy; dedicated the South Reading Room of the Adams Building to Thomas Jefferson, commissioning artist [[Ezra Winter]] to paint four themed murals for the room; and established a \"democracy alcove\" in the Main Reading Room of the Jefferson Building for important documents such as the Declaration, Constitution and ''[[The Federalist Papers]]''. The Library of Congress even assisted during the war effort, ranging from the storage of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution]] in [[Fort Knox]] for safekeeping to researching weather data on the [[Himalayas]] for [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilots.  MacLeish resigned in 1944 to become Assistant Secretary of State, and President [[Harry Truman]] appointed [[Luther H. Evans]] as librarian of Congress. Evans, who served until 1953, expanded the library's acquisitions, cataloging and bibliographic services as much as the fiscal-minded Congress would allow, but his primary achievement was the creation of Library of Congress Missions around the world. Missions played a variety of roles in the postwar world: the mission in San Francisco assisted participants in the [[meeting that established the United Nations]], the mission in Europe acquired European publications for the Library of Congress and other American libraries, and the mission in Japan aided in the creation of the [[National Diet Library]].<ref name=\"loc history\"/> \nEvans' successor [[Lawrence Quincy Mumford]] took over in 1953. Mumford's tenure, lasting until 1974, saw the initiation of the construction of the James Madison Memorial Building, the third Library of Congress building. Mumford directed the library during a period of increased educational spending, the windfall of which allowed the library to devote energies towards establishing new acquisition centers abroad, including in [[Cairo]] and New Delhi. In 1967, the library began experimenting with [[book preservation]] techniques through a Preservation Office, which grew to become the largest library research and conservation effort in the United States.  Mumford's administration also saw the last major public debate about the Library of Congress' role as both a legislative library and a national library. A 1962 memorandum by Douglas Bryant of the [[Harvard University Library]], compiled at the request of Joint Library Committee chairman [[Claiborne Pell]], proposed a number of institutional reforms, including expansion of national activities and services and various organizational changes, all of which would shift the library more towards its national role over its legislative role. Bryant even suggested possibly changing the name of the Library of Congress, which was rebuked by Mumford as \"unspeakable violence to tradition\".  Debate continued within the library community until the [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970]] shifted the library back towards its legislative roles, placing greater focus on research for Congress and congressional committees and renaming the Legislative Reference Service to the [[Congressional Research Service]].<ref name=\"loc history\"/>\n\nAfter Mumford retired in 1974, Gerald Ford appointed [[Daniel J. Boorstin]] as librarian. Boorstin's first challenge was the move to the new Madison Building, which took place between 1980 and 1982. The move released pressures on staff and shelf space, allowing Boorstin to focus on other areas of library administration such as acquisitions and collections. Taking advantage of steady budgetary growth, from $116 million in 1975 to over $250 million by 1987, Boorstin actively participated in enhancing ties with scholars, authors, publishers, cultural leaders, and the business community. His active and prolific role changed the post of librarian of Congress so that by the time he retired in 1987, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"perhaps the leading intellectual public position in the nation\".\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan nominated [[James H. Billington]] as the 13th librarian of Congress in 1987, and the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed the appointment.<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{Cite web|title = Key Milestones of James H.

Onsite access to the Library of Congress was also increased when Billington advocated successfully for an underground connection between the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center and the library in 2008 to increase congressional usage and public tours of the library's Thomas Jefferson Building.<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/>\n\nUnder Billington, the library launched a [[mass deacidification]] program in 2001, which has extended the lifespan of almost 4 million volumes and 12 million manuscript sheets; and new collection storage modules at Fort Meade, the first opening in 2002, to preserve and make accessible more than 4 million items from the library's analog collections. Billington established the Library Collections Security Oversight Committee in 1992 to improve protection of collections, and also the Library of Congress Congressional Caucus in 2008 to draw attention to the library's curators and collections. He created the library's first Young Readers Center in the Jefferson Building in 2009, and the first large-scale summer intern (Junior Fellows) program for university\nstudents in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 2015 Junior Fellows Summer Intern Program Home (Library of Congress)|url = https://www.loc.gov/hr/jrfellows/|website = Loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}</ref> Under Billington, the library also sponsored the Gateway to Knowledge in 2010\u20132011, a mobile exhibition to 90 sites covering all states east of the Mississippi in a specially designed 18-wheel truck, increasing public access to library collections off-site, particularly for rural populations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gateway to Knowledge \u2013 Educational Resources \u2013 Library of Congress|url = https://www.loc.gov/gateway/resources.html|website = Loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}</ref>\n\nBillington raised more than half a billion dollars of private support to supplement Congressional appropriations for library collections, programs, and digital outreach. These private funds helped the library to continue its growth and outreach in the face of a 30% decrease in staffing caused mainly by legislative appropriations cutbacks. He created the library's first development office for private fundraising in 1987, and, in 1990, established the James Madison Council, the library's first national private sector donor-support group. In 1987, Billington also asked the GAO to conduct the first library-wide audit, and he created the first Office of the Inspector General at the library to provide regular independent review of library operations. This precedent led to regular annual financial audits, leading to unmodified (\"clean\") opinions from 1995 onwards.<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/>\n\nIn April 2010, it announced plans to archive all public communication on [[Twitter]], including all communication since Twitter's launch in March 2006.<ref name=Grier>{{cite news| first=Peter| last=Grier| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2010/0416/Twitter-hits-Library-of-Congress-Would-Founding-Fathers-tweet| title=Twitter hits Library of Congress: Would Founding Fathers tweet?| work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=16 April 2010 |accessdate=2015-01-04}}</ref> {{As of|2015}}, the Twitter archive remains unfinished.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zimmer|first1=Michael|title=The Twitter Archive at the Library of Congress: Challenges for information practice and information policy|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5619/4653|website=First Monday}}</ref>\n\nBefore retiring in 2015, after 28 years of service, Billington had come \"under pressure\" as librarian of Congress.<ref>\"[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article41942157.html Librarian of Congress gets a Due Date]\" by Maria Recio, McClatchy DC, Oct. 30. 2015</ref> This followed a [[Government Accountability Office]] report which revealed a \"work environment lacking central oversight\" and faulted Billington for \"ignoring repeated calls to hire a chief information officer, as required by law.\"<ref>\"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/americas-national-library-is-behind-the-digital-curve-a-new-report-finds/2015/03/31/fad54c3a-d3fd-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html America's 'national library' is lacking in leadership, yet another report finds]\" by Peggy McGlone, The Washington Post, March 31, 2015.</ref>\n\nWhen Billington announced his plans to retire in 2015, commentator George Weigel described the Library of Congress as \"one of the last refuges in Washington of serious bipartisanship and calm, considered conversation,\" and \"one of the world's greatest cultural centers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = America's Next 'Minister of Culture': Don't Politicize the Appointment|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/419664/americas-next-minister-culture-dont-politicize-appointment|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}</ref>\n\nCarla Hayden was sworn in as the 14th librarian of Congress on September 14, 2016, becoming both the first woman and the first African-American to hold the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/07/13/carla-hayden-confirmed-as-14th-librarian-of-congress/|title=Carla Hayden confirmed as 14th librarian of Congress|first1=Peggy|last1=McGlone|first2=Peggy|last2=McGlone|date=July 13, 2016|website=Washingtonpost.com|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/latest-links/carla-hayden-sworn-september-14/|title=Carla Hayden to be sworn in on September 14 \u2013 American Libraries Magazine|website=Americanlibrariesmagazine.org|accessdate=May 5, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510073226/https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/latest-links/carla-hayden-sworn-september-14/|archivedate=May 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the library announced the Librarian-in-Residence program which aims to support the future generation of librarians by giving them opportunity to gain work experience in five different areas of librarianship including: Acquisitions/Collection Development, Cataloging/Metadata, and Collection Preservation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/librarians/librarians-in-residence/|title=Librarians-in-Residence -|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Holdings==\n[[File:Library of Congress and lawn.jpg|alt=photograph of west colonnade by Carol M.

After realizing that this plan would be too expensive and inefficient, and with the rise of the Internet, the library decided to instead make digitized material available over the Internet. This project was made official in the National Digital Library Program (NDLP), created in October 1994. By 1999, the NDLP had succeeded in digitizing over 5 million objects and had a budget of $12 million. The library has kept the \"American Memory\" name for its public domain website, which today contains 15 million digital objects, comprising over 7 [[petabyte]]s.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-library-of-last-resort/|title=The Library of Last Resort|last=Chayka|first=Kyle|date=2016-07-14|website=|publisher=n+1 Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235106/https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-library-of-last-resort/|archive-date=January 19, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAmerican Memory is a source for [[public domain]] image resources, as well as audio, video, and archived Web content. Nearly all of the lists of holdings, the ''catalogs'' of the library, can be consulted directly on its web site. Librarians all over the world consult these catalogs, through the Web or through other media better suited to their needs, when they need to catalog for their collection a book published in the United States. They use the [[Library of Congress Control Number]] to make sure of the exact identity of the book. Digital images are also available at [[Snapshots of the Past]], which provides archival prints.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.snapshotsofthepast.com/about-us|title=About Us|website=Snapshots of the Past|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>\n\nThe library has a budget of between $6\u20138 million each year for digitization, meaning that not all works can be digitized. It makes determinations about what objects to prioritize based on what is especially important to Congress or potentially interesting for the public. The 15 million digitized items represent less than 10% of the library's total 160-million item collection.\n\nThe library has chosen not to participate in other digital library projects such as [[Google Books]] and the [[Digital Public Library of America]], although it has supported the [[Internet Archive]] project.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====THOMAS and Congress.gov projects====\nIn 1995, the Library of Congress established online archive of the proceedings of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], [[THOMAS]]. The THOMAS website included the full text of proposed legislation, as well as bill summaries and statuses, [[Congressional Record]] text, and the Congressional Record Index. The THOMAS system received major updates in 2005 and 2010. A migration to a more modernized Web system, [[Congress.gov]], began in 2012, and the THOMAS system was retired in 2016.<ref>David Gewirtz, [https://www.zdnet.com/article/thomas-gov-an-exclusive-inside-look-at-the-retirement-and-transition-of-a-classic-web-1-0/ So long, Thomas.gov: Inside the retirement of a classic Web 1.0 application], ZDNet (May 4, 2016).</ref> Congress.gov is a joint project of the Library of Congress, the House, the Senate and the [[Government Publishing Office]].<ref>Adam Mazmanian, [https://fcw.com/articles/2016/04/28/thomas-loc-retired.aspx Library of Congress to retire Thomas], ''[[Federal Computer Week]]'' (April 28, 2016).</ref>\n\n==Library of Congress buildings==\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson Building Aerial by Carol M.

The library's Capitol Hill buildings are all connected by underground passageways, so that a library user need pass through security only once in a single visit. The library also has off-site storage facilities for less commonly requested materials.\n\n===Thomas Jefferson Building===\n{{Main|Thomas Jefferson Building}}\nThe Thomas Jefferson Building is located between [[Independence Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Independence Avenue]] and East Capitol Street on First Street SE. It first opened in 1897 as the main building of the library and is the oldest of the three buildings. Known originally as the Library of Congress Building or Main Building, it took its present name on June 13, 1980.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/ |title=On These Walls: Inscriptions and Quotations in the Buildings of the Library of Congress |last=Cole |first=John |publisher=Scala Arts Publishers Inc. |year=2008 |isbn=978-1857595451 |chapter=The Thomas Jefferson Building |access-date=2018-04-23 |chapter-url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/walls/jeff1.html}}</ref>\n\n===John Adams Building===\n{{Main|John Adams Building}}\nThe John Adams Building is located between Independence Avenue and East Capitol Street on 2nd Street SE, the block adjacent to the Jefferson Building. The building was originally known as The Annex to the Main Building, which had run out of space.

The theater hosts regular free screenings of classic and contemporary movies and television shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/pickford/ |title=Mary Pickford Theater Film Schedule |website=Moving Image Research Center |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=2018-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation===\n{{Main|National Audio-Visual Conservation Center}}\nThe Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation is the Library of Congress's newest building, opened in 2007 and located in [[Culpeper, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/avconservation/packard/|title=The Packard Campus \u2013 A/V Conservation (Library of Congress)|website=Loc.gov|accessdate=2017-05-05}}</ref> It was constructed out of a former [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] storage center and [[Cold War]] bunker. The campus is designed to act as a single site to store all of the library's movie, television, and sound collections. It is named to honor [[David Woodley Packard]], whose [[Packard Humanities Institute]] oversaw design and construction of the facility. The centerpiece of the complex is a reproduction [[Art Deco]] movie theater that presents free movie screenings to the public on a semi-weekly basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/events/#eventlist9 |title=Library of Congress events listing |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref>\n\n==Digital Millennium Copyright Act==\n{{Main|Digital Millennium Copyright Act#Anti-circumvention exemptions|l1=Digital Millennium Copyright Act}}\n{{See also|Librarian of Congress|Register of Copyrights}}\n\nThe Library of Congress, through both the librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights, is responsible for authorizing exceptions to [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html#1201 Section 1201] of [[Title 17 of the United States Code]] as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This process is done every three years, with the Register receiving proposals from the public and acting as an advisor to the librarian, who issues a ruling on what is exempt.  After three years have passed, the ruling is no longer valid and a new ruling on exemptions must be made.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.copyright.gov/1201/ |title=Section 1201: Exemptions to Prohibition Against Circumvention of Technological Measures Protecting Copyrighted Works| work=United States Copyright Office| year=2013| accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2013/13-041.html|title=Statement Regarding White House Response to 1201 Rulemaking |publisher=Library of Congress|year=2013|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Access==\nThe library is open for academic research to anyone with a Reader Identification Card. One may not remove library items from the reading rooms or the library buildings. Most of the library's general collection of books and journals is in the closed stacks of the Jefferson and Adams Buildings; specialized collections of books and other materials are in closed stacks in all three main library buildings, or are stored off-site. Access to the closed stacks is not permitted under any circumstances, except to authorized library staff, and occasionally, to dignitaries. Only the reading room reference collections are on open shelves.\n\nSince 1902, American libraries have been able to request books and other items through [[interlibrary loan]] from the Library of Congress if these items are not readily available elsewhere. Through this system, the Library of Congress has served as a \"library of last resort\", according to former librarian of Congress [[Herbert Putnam]].<ref name=\"interlibrary loan\"/> The Library of Congress lends books to other libraries with the stipulation that they be used only inside the borrowing library.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/loan/loanweb1.html |title=Subpage Title (Interlibrary Loan, Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}</ref>\n\n==Standards==\nIn addition to its library services, the Library of Congress is also actively involved in various standard activities in areas related to bibliographical and search and retrieve standards. Areas of work include [[MARC standards]], [[Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard]] (METS), [[Metadata Object Description Schema]] (MODS), [[Z39.50]] and [[Search/Retrieve Web Service]] (SRW), and [[Search/Retrieve via URL]] (SRU).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/|title=Standards at the Library of Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=Loc.gov|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Law Library of Congress]] seeks to further legal scholarship by providing opportunities for scholars and practitioners to conduct significant legal research.

It has an area of about {{convert|250|acre|ha|order=flip}}. The park is a synopsis of [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian culture]], with virtually all aspects of daily life in Indonesia's 26 (in 1975) [[Provinces of Indonesia|provinces]] encapsulated in separate pavilions with the collections of ''[[rumah adat]]'' as the example of [[Indonesian architecture|Indonesian vernacular architecture]], [[National costume of Indonesia|clothing]], [[Dance in Indonesia|dances]] and [[Traditions of Indonesia|traditions]] are all depicted impeccably.

It came about at a convention on 8 Cendana Street at March 13, 1970. Through this recreational site, she hoped to cultivate national pride in more Indonesian people.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/> A project called \"Indonesian Miniature Project\" was started by Harapan Kita Foundation in 1972. The concept of this culture-based recreational area was inspired by Indonesia's unparalleled natural riches and local folk diversity.\n\n==Characteristics==\nTMII was originally located on a public area of 145 ha, as farms and fields. Later, the team was able to convert these fields into a suitable location for the construction. The [[topography]] of TMII is rather hilly, consistent with what the builders required. The team claimed the advantage of utilizing this uneven terrain was the ability to create interesting and diverse landscapes and enclosures, as well as reflecting the various characteristics of the Indonesian environment.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/>\n\n==Parts of TMII==\n[[File:Taman Mini Indonesia Indah Map en.svg|center|900px]]\n\n===Venues of Indonesian Provinces===\n[[File:Jaipongan Langit Biru 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Jaipongan]] dance performance in West Java pavilion in TMII.]]\n[[File:Indonesia in miniature, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.jpg|thumb|The miniature of [[Indonesian Archipelago]] in the center lake viewed from the cable car.]]\n[[File:TMII West Sumatra.jpg|thumb|[[West Sumatra]] pavilion in TMII.]]\n\nSince each Indonesian province maintains its own unique and distinct cultures, shelters, attire and dialects, TMII built a model of each of the houses from Indonesian provinces. TMII attempted not only to reconstruct the homes of the various provinces, but also to create a realistic model of the environment and shelters of the various people of Indonesia.<ref name='TMIIanj'>[http://www.tamanmini.com/anjungan/ Anjungan]</ref> The venues, which are situated around the main lake in a similar fashion to the different islands of the [[Indonesian archipelago]], are thematically divided into six areas in respect to the main islands of Indonesia; [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Kalimantan]] ([[Borneo]]), [[Sulawesi]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]].

Each provinces pavilions also equipped with small stage, amphitheatre or auditorium for traditional dance performances, traditional music performances or traditional ceremonies that usually held in Sundays. Some of these pavilions also equipped with cafeterias featuring traditional [[Indonesian cuisine]]s and also souvenir shops offering various handicrafts, T-shirts and souvenirs.\n\nSince 1975 until the 2000s, the original design of TMII consist of a model of the houses from the 27 provinces of Indonesia, including [[East Timor]]. But after the secession of East Timor from Indonesia in 2002, the East Timor pavilion changed its status to become the Museum of East Timor. Also since Indonesia now consist of [[Provinces of Indonesia|33 provinces]], currently the new province pavilions of [[Bangka Belitung]], [[Banten]], [[West Sulawesi]], [[North Maluku]], [[Gorontalo (province)|Gorontalo]], [[Riau Islands]], and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] is being built in northeast part of the park.\n\nAfter the recognition of [[Indonesian Chinese]] [[Chinese culture|culture]] as the integral part of Indonesian culture in 2000, the new [[Indonesian Chinese]] pavilion and a [[Confucian temple]] was built within the park.\n\n===Religious Buildings===\nThe religious buildings of several official faiths is meant to showcase the inter-faiths tolerance and religious harmony of Indonesia.

It has an area of about {{convert|250|acre|ha|order=flip}}.

It came about at a convention on 8 Cendana Street at March 13, 1970. Through this recreational site, she hoped to cultivate national pride in more Indonesian people.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/> A project called \"Indonesian Miniature Project\" was started by Harapan Kita Foundation in 1972. The concept of this culture-based recreational area was inspired by Indonesia's unparalleled natural riches and local folk diversity.\n\n==Characteristics==\nTMII was originally located on a public area of 145 ha, as farms and fields. Later, the team was able to convert these fields into a suitable location for the construction. The [[topography]] of TMII is rather hilly, consistent with what the builders required. The team claimed the advantage of utilizing this uneven terrain was the ability to create interesting and diverse landscapes and enclosures, as well as reflecting the various characteristics of the Indonesian environment.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/>\n\n==Parts of TMII==\n[[File:Taman Mini Indonesia Indah Map en.svg|center|900px]]\n\n===Venues of Indonesian Provinces===\n[[File:Jaipongan Langit Biru 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Jaipongan]] dance performance in West Java pavilion in TMII.]]\n[[File:Indonesia in miniature, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.jpg|thumb|The miniature of [[Indonesian Archipelago]] in the center lake viewed from the cable car.]]\n[[File:TMII West Sumatra.jpg|thumb|[[West Sumatra]] pavilion in TMII.]]\n\nSince each Indonesian province maintains its own unique and distinct cultures, shelters, attire and dialects, TMII built a model of each of the houses from Indonesian provinces.

Each pavilions featured in typical [[vernacular]] [[Indonesian architecture]] of each provinces. Examples of Indonesian traditional vernacular houses are: [[Joglo]] and Omah Kudus [[Javanese people|Javanese]] houses of [[Central Java]] and [[Yogyakarta]] pavilion; [[Minangkabau people|Minang]] [[Rumah Gadang]] of [[West Sumatra]] pavilion; [[Malay houses]] of [[Jambi]] and [[Riau]] provinces; [[Toraja]]n [[Tongkonan]] and Bugis house of [[South Sulawesi]] pavilion; and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] house compound with intricately carved [[candi bentar]] split gate and [[Paduraksa|kori agung]] gate.\n\nIt also displays various traditional costumes, wedding costumes, dance costumes, also ethnography artifacts such as weapons and daily tools, models of traditional architecture are in display to describes the way of life of its people. Each provinces pavilions also equipped with small stage, amphitheatre or auditorium for traditional dance performances, traditional music performances or traditional ceremonies that usually held in Sundays. Some of these pavilions also equipped with cafeterias featuring traditional [[Indonesian cuisine]]s and also souvenir shops offering various handicrafts, T-shirts and souvenirs.\n\nSince 1975 until the 2000s, the original design of TMII consist of a model of the houses from the 27 provinces of Indonesia, including [[East Timor]].

Practical Joke drew post position 19 but Rosario was able to guide him over to the rail to save ground around the first turn. In the final turn, Practical Joke moved to the outside and made a strong run to advance to fourth in mid-stretch before tiring slightly and finishing fifth.

Practical Joke rated in fourth behind the early pacemakers, but was trapped on the inside as they entered the stretch.

After being bumped at the start, Practical Joke rated in the middle of the pack trailed by McCraken and Girvin. Turning into the stretch, McCraken made his move and opened a one-length lead while Practical Joke and Girvin started closing ground on the outside.

Rosario started asking Practical Joke to go around the final turn, and Practical Joke unleashed a sustained rally, winning by 1 1/4 lengths with a time of 1:21.96 for seven furlongs. With the win, Practical Joke earned the third grade one victory of his career. Brown stated after the race: \"To cut back all the way to seven-eighths after a tough race in the Haskell, I'm so proud of this horse. It was his third race in seven weeks.

Pussycat Sr. aka Puddy Tat | date=July 23, 2012}}</ref> Most of his appearances have him often chasing [[Tweety]], [[Speedy Gonzales]], or [[Hippety Hopper]]. Sylvester appeared in 103 cartoons in the [[golden age of American animation]], only behind [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Porky Pig]], and [[Daffy Duck]]. Three of his cartoons won Academy Awards, the most for any starring Looney Tunes character: they are ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'', and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''.\n\n==Animation history==\n\n===Development===\nSylvester predecessors appeared from 1939\u20131944. ''[[Naughty but Mice]]'' was the first. ''[[Notes to You]]'' was remade in color in one of Sylvester's cartoons, ''[[Back Alley Oproar]]''. ''[[The Hep Cat]]'' features another version, as well as ''[[Birdy and the Beast]]'', which features [[Tweety]]. Before Sylvester's appearance in the cartoons, Blanc voiced a character named Sylvester on ''[[Judy Canova|The Judy Canova Show]]'' using the voice that would eventually become associated with the cat.<ref>''[[The Judy Canova Show]]'', September 7, 1943, as rebroadcast on XM Radio's Old Time Radio channel August 13, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Personality and catchphrases==\nSylvester shows a lot of pride in himself and never gives up. Despite (or perhaps because of) his pride and persistence, Sylvester is, with rare exceptions, placed squarely on the \"loser\" side of the Looney Tunes winner/loser hierarchy.\n\nIn many cartoons, Sylvester is shown intentionally sticking out his tongue while speaking, putting emphasis that the lisp is intentional. Sylvester is also known for spraying people he's talking to with the saliva from his lisping, which is a trait rarely shared by Daffy. A common gag used for both Sylvester and Daffy is a tendency to go on a long rant, complaining about a subject and then ending it by saying \"sakes.\"\n\nSylvester's trademark exclamation is \"''Sufferin' [[succotash]]!''\", which is said to be a [[Minced oath]] of \"''Suffering Savior''\".\n\nHe shows a different personality when paired with [[Porky Pig]] in explorations of spooky places, in which he does not speak, behaves as a scaredy-cat, and always seems to see the scary things Porky does not see and gets scolded by him for it every time.\n\nSylvester, who for the most part always played the antagonist role, is featured playing the protagonist role in a couple of cartoons while having to deal with the canine duo of [[Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier]] after being chased around. In 1952's ''[[Tree for Two]]'' by [[Friz Freleng]], Sylvester is cornered in the back alley and this would result in Spike getting mauled by a [[black panther]] that had escaped from a zoo. In the 1954 film ''[[Dr. Jerkyl's Hide]]'', Sylvester pummels Spike (here called \"Alfie\") thanks to a potion that transforms him into a feline monster. After Spike's ordeal, Sylvester would have the courage and confidence to confront Chester, only to be beaten and tossed away by the little dog.\n\nPerhaps Sylvester's most developed role is in a series of [[Robert McKimson]]-directed shorts, in which the character is a hapless mouse-catching instructor to his dubious son, [[Sylvester Junior]], with the \"mouse\" being a powerful [[Hippety Hopper|baby kangaroo]] which he constantly mistakes for a \"king-size mouse\". His alternately confident and bewildered episodes bring his son to shame, while Sylvester himself is reduced to nervous breakdowns.\n\nSylvester also had atypical roles in a few cartoons:\n\n* ''[[Kitty Kornered]]'' (1946), a [[Bob Clampett]] cartoon in which a black-nosed, yellow-eyed Sylvester was teamed with three other cats to oust owner [[Porky Pig]] from his house.\n* ''[[Back Alley Oproar]]'' (1948), a [[Friz Freleng]] cartoon (actually a remake of the 1941 short ''[[Notes to You]]'') wherein Sylvester pesters the sleep-deprived [[Elmer Fudd]] by performing several amazing musical numbers in the alley (and even a sweet [[lullaby]] (\"go to sleep... go to sleep... close your big bloodshot eyes...\") to temporarily ease Elmer back to [[dream world (plot device)|the dream world]], though ''very'' temporarily.\n* ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950), a [[Chuck Jones]] cartoon in which Sylvester plays the [[Basil Rathbone]]-like villain to [[Daffy Duck]]'s [[Errol Flynn]]-esque hero.\n* ''[[Red Riding Hoodwinked]]'' (1955) Sylvester co-stars with an absent-minded [[Big Bad Wolf]] in which each not only tries to get their particular \"prey\" (Sylvester vs. Tweety and the Wolf vs. Little Red Riding Hood) but they both nearly come to blows with each other playing \"Grandma\" (\"Trying to muscle in on this racket\")\n\nIn the [[television series]] ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', Sylvester appeared as the mentor of [[Furrball]]. The character also starred in ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]''. In the series, he plays the [[Narration|narrator]] at the beginning of episodes.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{Main|List of cartoons featuring Sylvester}}\nThe character debuted in [[Friz Freleng]]'s ''[[Life With Feathers]]'' (1945). Freleng's 1947 cartoon ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'' was the first pairing of Tweety with Sylvester, and the [[Bob Clampett]]-directed ''[[Kitty Kornered]]'' (1946) was Sylvester's first pairing with [[Porky Pig]].\n\nHe also appears in a handful of cartoons with [[Elmer Fudd]], such as a series of cartoons underwritten by the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] extolling [[economy of the United States|the American economic system]].\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Sylvester appeared in various Warner Bros. television specials, and in the 1980s, he appeared in the feature-film [[Product bundling|compilations]].\n\nHe has died more times than any other Looney Tunes character, having died in ''[[Peck Up Your Troubles]]'', ''[[I Taw a Putty Tat]]'', ''[[Back Alley Oproar]]'', ''[[Mouse Mazurka]]'', ''[[Bad Ol' Putty Tat]]'', ''[[Ain't She Tweet]]'', ''[[Satan's Waitin']]'', ''[[Muzzle Tough]]'', ''[[Sandy Claws (film)|Sandy Claws]]'', ''[[Tweety's Circus]]'', ''[[Too Hop To Handle]]'', ''[[Tree Cornered Tweety]]'', ''[[Tweet and Lovely]]'', ''[[Trick or Tweet]]'', ''[[The Wild Chase]]'', and ''[[Museum Scream]]''. He was also cast in the role of the [[Jacob Marley]]-like ghost in ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]].''\n\nA baby version of Sylvester is part of the title cast of characters in ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]''.\n\nSylvester is featured in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' (2011\u201314) voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]. He is shown living with Granny alongside Tweety. In \"Point, Laser Point,\" it is revealed that Sylvester was attracted by a glowing red dot that was on his mother's necklace when he was young as experienced through hypnotic therapy done by Witch Lezah.

Pussycat Sr. aka Puddy Tat | date=July 23, 2012}}</ref> Most of his appearances have him often chasing [[Tweety]], [[Speedy Gonzales]], or [[Hippety Hopper]]. Sylvester appeared in 103 cartoons in the [[golden age of American animation]], only behind [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Porky Pig]], and [[Daffy Duck]]. Three of his cartoons won Academy Awards, the most for any starring Looney Tunes character: they are ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'', ''[[Speedy Gonzales (film)|Speedy Gonzales]]'', and ''[[Birds Anonymous]]''.\n\n==Animation history==\n\n===Development===\nSylvester predecessors appeared from 1939\u20131944. ''[[Naughty but Mice]]'' was the first. ''[[Notes to You]]'' was remade in color in one of Sylvester's cartoons, ''[[Back Alley Oproar]]''. ''[[The Hep Cat]]'' features another version, as well as ''[[Birdy and the Beast]]'', which features [[Tweety]]. Before Sylvester's appearance in the cartoons, Blanc voiced a character named Sylvester on ''[[Judy Canova|The Judy Canova Show]]'' using the voice that would eventually become associated with the cat.<ref>''[[The Judy Canova Show]]'', September 7, 1943, as rebroadcast on XM Radio's Old Time Radio channel August 13, 2008.</ref>\n\n==Personality and catchphrases==\nSylvester shows a lot of pride in himself and never gives up. Despite (or perhaps because of) his pride and persistence, Sylvester is, with rare exceptions, placed squarely on the \"loser\" side of the Looney Tunes winner/loser hierarchy.\n\nIn many cartoons, Sylvester is shown intentionally sticking out his tongue while speaking, putting emphasis that the lisp is intentional. Sylvester is also known for spraying people he's talking to with the saliva from his lisping, which is a trait rarely shared by Daffy. A common gag used for both Sylvester and Daffy is a tendency to go on a long rant, complaining about a subject and then ending it by saying \"sakes.\"\n\nSylvester's trademark exclamation is \"''Sufferin' [[succotash]]!''\", which is said to be a [[Minced oath]] of \"''Suffering Savior''\".\n\nHe shows a different personality when paired with [[Porky Pig]] in explorations of spooky places, in which he does not speak, behaves as a scaredy-cat, and always seems to see the scary things Porky does not see and gets scolded by him for it every time.\n\nSylvester, who for the most part always played the antagonist role, is featured playing the protagonist role in a couple of cartoons while having to deal with the canine duo of [[Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier]] after being chased around. In 1952's ''[[Tree for Two]]'' by [[Friz Freleng]], Sylvester is cornered in the back alley and this would result in Spike getting mauled by a [[black panther]] that had escaped from a zoo. In the 1954 film ''[[Dr. Jerkyl's Hide]]'', Sylvester pummels Spike (here called \"Alfie\") thanks to a potion that transforms him into a feline monster. After Spike's ordeal, Sylvester would have the courage and confidence to confront Chester, only to be beaten and tossed away by the little dog.\n\nPerhaps Sylvester's most developed role is in a series of [[Robert McKimson]]-directed shorts, in which the character is a hapless mouse-catching instructor to his dubious son, [[Sylvester Junior]], with the \"mouse\" being a powerful [[Hippety Hopper|baby kangaroo]] which he constantly mistakes for a \"king-size mouse\". His alternately confident and bewildered episodes bring his son to shame, while Sylvester himself is reduced to nervous breakdowns.\n\nSylvester also had atypical roles in a few cartoons:\n\n* ''[[Kitty Kornered]]'' (1946), a [[Bob Clampett]] cartoon in which a black-nosed, yellow-eyed Sylvester was teamed with three other cats to oust owner [[Porky Pig]] from his house.\n* ''[[Back Alley Oproar]]'' (1948), a [[Friz Freleng]] cartoon (actually a remake of the 1941 short ''[[Notes to You]]'') wherein Sylvester pesters the sleep-deprived [[Elmer Fudd]] by performing several amazing musical numbers in the alley (and even a sweet [[lullaby]] (\"go to sleep... go to sleep... close your big bloodshot eyes...\") to temporarily ease Elmer back to [[dream world (plot device)|the dream world]], though ''very'' temporarily.\n* ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950), a [[Chuck Jones]] cartoon in which Sylvester plays the [[Basil Rathbone]]-like villain to [[Daffy Duck]]'s [[Errol Flynn]]-esque hero.\n* ''[[Red Riding Hoodwinked]]'' (1955) Sylvester co-stars with an absent-minded [[Big Bad Wolf]] in which each not only tries to get their particular \"prey\" (Sylvester vs. Tweety and the Wolf vs. Little Red Riding Hood) but they both nearly come to blows with each other playing \"Grandma\" (\"Trying to muscle in on this racket\")\n\nIn the [[television series]] ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', Sylvester appeared as the mentor of [[Furrball]]. The character also starred in ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]''. In the series, he plays the [[Narration|narrator]] at the beginning of episodes.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{Main|List of cartoons featuring Sylvester}}\nThe character debuted in [[Friz Freleng]]'s ''[[Life With Feathers]]'' (1945). Freleng's 1947 cartoon ''[[Tweetie Pie]]'' was the first pairing of Tweety with Sylvester, and the [[Bob Clampett]]-directed ''[[Kitty Kornered]]'' (1946) was Sylvester's first pairing with [[Porky Pig]].\n\nHe also appears in a handful of cartoons with [[Elmer Fudd]], such as a series of cartoons underwritten by the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] extolling [[economy of the United States|the American economic system]].\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Sylvester appeared in various Warner Bros. television specials, and in the 1980s, he appeared in the feature-film [[Product bundling|compilations]].\n\nHe has died more times than any other Looney Tunes character, having died in ''[[Peck Up Your Troubles]]'', ''[[I Taw a Putty Tat]]'', ''[[Back Alley Oproar]]'', ''[[Mouse Mazurka]]'', ''[[Bad Ol' Putty Tat]]'', ''[[Ain't She Tweet]]'', ''[[Satan's Waitin']]'', ''[[Muzzle Tough]]'', ''[[Sandy Claws (film)|Sandy Claws]]'', ''[[Tweety's Circus]]'', ''[[Too Hop To Handle]]'', ''[[Tree Cornered Tweety]]'', ''[[Tweet and Lovely]]'', ''[[Trick or Tweet]]'', ''[[The Wild Chase]]'', and ''[[Museum Scream]]''. He was also cast in the role of the [[Jacob Marley]]-like ghost in ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]].''\n\nA baby version of Sylvester is part of the title cast of characters in ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]''.\n\nSylvester is featured in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' (2011\u201314) voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]. He is shown living with Granny alongside Tweety. In \"Point, Laser Point,\" it is revealed that Sylvester was attracted by a glowing red dot that was on his mother's necklace when he was young as experienced through hypnotic therapy done by Witch Lezah. It was also revealed that his mother (voiced by [[Estelle Harris]]) has retired to [[Florida]] (with Sylvester's mother being disappointed that Sylvester never kept wearing his [[Retainer (orthodontic device)|retainer]], never remembered where she lives in Florida, and has not caught Tweety yet).
