The game is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]].'' Square Enix developed the remake as a multi-part series, with the first entry released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on April 10, 2020, with timed exclusivity for one year.\n\nPlayers control mercenary [[Cloud Strife]] as he and an [[eco-terrorist]] group known as [[AVALANCHE]] oppose the [[Shinra Electric Power Company]], a powerful [[megacorporation]], from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time]] [[Action game|action]] with [[Strategy video game|strategic]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements.\n\n''Remake'' was announced in 2015 following years of fan requests and rumors. Several key staff members returned, including character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director and main character designer, director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as producer, writer [[Kazushige Nojima]], and music composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' retells [[Final Fantasy VII#Plot|the story of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'']]. Players control [[Cloud Strife]], a former Shinra soldier turned mercenary who joins the [[eco-terrorist]] group AVALANCHE to fight the Shinra Corporation, who have been draining the planet's life energy. The game is a full [[Video game remake|remake]] with real-time polygonal graphics, as opposed to the [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] environments of the original.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n\nExploration and battle mechanics both take place in real-time, like ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The game features an altered \"[[Active Time Battle]]\" (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks. Once it is filled, the player can halt the action and use special abilities such as magic, items, and special moves. The player can also assign these special abilities to shortcut buttons, allowing them to play entirely in real-time without pausing. Each special ability uses up a segment of the ATB bar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake still has ATB \u2026 kinda |url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |accessdate=June 12, 2019 |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=June 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617105924/https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The player can also switch between party members at any time.

While the game has more real-time elements, strategic elements still remain, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[Cloud Strife]] is a former first-class SOLDIER, the elite warriors of the Shinra Electric Power Company which rules the metropolis city of Midgar. Shinra drains spiritual energy called mako from the planet, using massive reactors, in order to power Midgar and develop new technologies. Disillusioned with Shinra, Cloud joins Avalanche as a mercenary, an eco-terrorist organization led by the temperamental [[Barret Wallace]]. Cloud and Avalanche bomb a mako reactor, and the resulting explosion results in heavy collateral damage. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories and hallucinations of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], an enigmatic former high-ranking SOLDIER, and meets the flower peddler [[Aerith Gainsborough]]. Cloud also fights off strange ghost-like hooded creatures with Avalanche and becomes reacquainted with his childhood friend [[Tifa Lockhart]] who is herself involved with the terrorists.\n\nAfter bombing a second reactor with Avalanche, Cloud is unwillingly separated from his group. He meets Aerith again, who is being chased by Shinra. Aerith is revealed to be the last descendant of the ancients, the original stewards of the planet who have magical powers. Shinra believes they can use her power for their own gains. Cloud escorts Aerith back to her home and invites him to stay for the night, but her mother secretly requests that he stay away from Aerith. Cloud leaves, but Aerith sneaks out and follows him to take him back to Sector 7. At the entrance to Sector 7, they see Tifa entering Wall Market, a lawless walled in city. They pursue and reunite with Tifa, who is trying to gain information from Wall Market's crime lord Don Corneo. \n\nAfter infiltrating his organization, Don Corneo reveals that Shinra plans to collapse a piece of the \"plate,\" home to Midgar's upper class, onto the slums of Sector 7 to retaliate for Avalanche's destruction of the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan, and the plate falls. The slums suffer severe casualties, including several members of Avalanche, and Aerith is captured by Shinra.\n\nWhile clearing the rubble left by the destruction of the slum, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they infiltrate Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she is subjected to the same. After rescuing Aerith, the group also meets a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII, being held captive by Shinra's scientist Hojo. Red XIII explains that the strange ghost-like hooded creatures the group has been fighting are called Whispers. They exist to ensure that the course of destiny is not altered, and they will use their power to correct deviations, even if it means bringing someone back from the dead. Meanwhile, Sephiroth steals the mysterious Jenova experiment, thought to be connected to the extinction of the ancients, from Shinra, and sends Avalanche to the lower levels of the Shinra building.\n\nIn a confrontation at the top of Shinra headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra, and also impales Barret, but the Whispers heal Barret. The president's son Rufus becomes the new de facto leader of the company. Meanwhile, the building becomes engulfed in Whispers. Cloud and his allies flee the scene via the Midgar Highway. At the end of the highway, the characters find Sephiroth waiting for them, who opens a portal and enters it. Aerith alters the portal, stating that they will fight for freedom from their destiny. The group enters the portal and battles a large Whisper which appears to be a deity controlling destiny. After defeating the Whisper, Sephiroth confronts the group, unleashing Supernova upon Midgar and separating them, before engaging Cloud. As Cloud is pushed back, he receives aid from the others and eventually push him to a corner, preventing him from launching another Supernova, but Sephiroth commands the Whispers to battle Avalanche. Cloud fights through the Whispers and confronts Sephiroth only for Sephiroth to teleport both of them to a metaphysical realm Sephiroth calls the Edge of Creation. Sephiroth urges Cloud to join him so together they can defy fate. Cloud refuses and fights Sephiroth but is no match for him alone and is soon disarmed but spared as Sephiroth cryptically warns Cloud that he will have seven seconds to defy fate, and then departs. After Cloud returns to his group, they agree that Sephiroth is an even greater threat to the Planet than Shinra and commit to defeating him.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> The game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> It features newly arranged and orchestrated tracks from the original game, in addition to original material such as \"Hollow\", a theme song by Uematsu.<ref name=\"Music\"/> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" />\n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nRather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with the lighting engine Enlighten.<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n==Release==\nRumors of a ''Final Fantasy VII'' remake appeared in 2014.<ref name=\"RemakeRumor\"/> It was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015|2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) during the [[PlayStation]] conference, and received a standing ovation.<ref name=\"GSremake\"/><ref name=\"4Govation\"/> [[Visual Works]] created the announcement trailer.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\" /> Square Enix's stock prices rose to their highest rating since November 2008, and the [[YouTube]] release of the reveal trailer garnered over 10 million views in the following two weeks.<ref name=\"IGNstocks\" /><ref name=\"VIIRtrailer\" /> The game was next showcased at the 2015 PlayStation Experience, demonstrating cutscenes and gameplay from the opening sequence.<ref name=\"WiredPSE\"/>\n\nDuring the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary [[opening ceremony]] event hosted by Square Enix in [[Tokyo]] on January 31, 2017 \u2014 the 20th anniversary of ''Final Fantasy VII''\u2014 the game's first piece of CGI key art was unveiled, along with announcements for a collaboration event with ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GamaAnniversary\"/> On February 18, Nomura revealed two screenshots, showing off the updated [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]].<ref name=\"Magic2017showing\"/> Due to its lack of footage since 2015, switch to internal development, and other projects Nomura was involved in, there were concerns about the status of the project. Speaking following E3 2018, Nomura stated that the game was in development, with his full attention shifted to it when ''Kingdom Hearts III'' was completed.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/><ref name=\"Nomura2018b\"/>\n\nAfter years without substantial footage, a teaser trailer was shown during PlayStation's May 2019 State of Play broadcast. Kitase announced that the team had wanted to \"try something new\" on the State of Play broadcast by showing the trailer.<ref name=\"RemakeSoP\"/> The release date, March 3, 2020, was revealed the following month in a second teaser trailer during an orchestral concert dedicated to the [[Music of the Final Fantasy VII series|music of ''Final Fantasy VII'']] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"2020REL\"/> Further release details were announced at the company's [[E3 2019]] press conference, including different editions of ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeFirstInfo\"/> Kitase later clarified at the event that Square Enix had yet to determine the number of games in the ''Remake'' series, adding that they were in the process of planning the second installment.<ref name=\"RemakeScale\"/>\n\nAn extended gameplay showcase and demo was playable at E3 2019, demonstrating parts of the opening mission, including some of the exploration, combat system, and first boss battle.

Rimeiku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Enix]]. The game is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]].'' Square Enix developed the remake as a multi-part series, with the first entry released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on April 10, 2020, with timed exclusivity for one year.\n\nPlayers control mercenary [[Cloud Strife]] as he and an [[eco-terrorist]] group known as [[AVALANCHE]] oppose the [[Shinra Electric Power Company]], a powerful [[megacorporation]], from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time]] [[Action game|action]] with [[Strategy video game|strategic]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements.\n\n''Remake'' was announced in 2015 following years of fan requests and rumors. Several key staff members returned, including character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director and main character designer, director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as producer, writer [[Kazushige Nojima]], and music composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' retells [[Final Fantasy VII#Plot|the story of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'']]. Players control [[Cloud Strife]], a former Shinra soldier turned mercenary who joins the [[eco-terrorist]] group AVALANCHE to fight the Shinra Corporation, who have been draining the planet's life energy. The game is a full [[Video game remake|remake]] with real-time polygonal graphics, as opposed to the [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] environments of the original.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n\nExploration and battle mechanics both take place in real-time, like ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The game features an altered \"[[Active Time Battle]]\" (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks. Once it is filled, the player can halt the action and use special abilities such as magic, items, and special moves. The player can also assign these special abilities to shortcut buttons, allowing them to play entirely in real-time without pausing. Each special ability uses up a segment of the ATB bar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake still has ATB \u2026 kinda |url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |accessdate=June 12, 2019 |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=June 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617105924/https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The player can also switch between party members at any time.

While the game has more real-time elements, strategic elements still remain, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[Cloud Strife]] is a former first-class SOLDIER, the elite warriors of the Shinra Electric Power Company which rules the metropolis city of Midgar. Shinra drains spiritual energy called mako from the planet, using massive reactors, in order to power Midgar and develop new technologies. Disillusioned with Shinra, Cloud joins Avalanche as a mercenary, an eco-terrorist organization led by the temperamental [[Barret Wallace]]. Cloud and Avalanche bomb a mako reactor, and the resulting explosion results in heavy collateral damage. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories and hallucinations of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], an enigmatic former high-ranking SOLDIER, and meets the flower peddler [[Aerith Gainsborough]]. Cloud also fights off strange ghost-like hooded creatures with Avalanche and becomes reacquainted with his childhood friend [[Tifa Lockhart]] who is herself involved with the terrorists.\n\nAfter bombing a second reactor with Avalanche, Cloud is unwillingly separated from his group. He meets Aerith again, who is being chased by Shinra. Aerith is revealed to be the last descendant of the ancients, the original stewards of the planet who have magical powers. Shinra believes they can use her power for their own gains. Cloud escorts Aerith back to her home and invites him to stay for the night, but her mother secretly requests that he stay away from Aerith. Cloud leaves, but Aerith sneaks out and follows him to take him back to Sector 7. At the entrance to Sector 7, they see Tifa entering Wall Market, a lawless walled in city. They pursue and reunite with Tifa, who is trying to gain information from Wall Market's crime lord Don Corneo. \n\nAfter infiltrating his organization, Don Corneo reveals that Shinra plans to collapse a piece of the \"plate,\" home to Midgar's upper class, onto the slums of Sector 7 to retaliate for Avalanche's destruction of the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan, and the plate falls. The slums suffer severe casualties, including several members of Avalanche, and Aerith is captured by Shinra.\n\nWhile clearing the rubble left by the destruction of the slum, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they infiltrate Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she is subjected to the same. After rescuing Aerith, the group also meets a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII, being held captive by Shinra's scientist Hojo. Red XIII explains that the strange ghost-like hooded creatures the group has been fighting are called Whispers. They exist to ensure that the course of destiny is not altered, and they will use their power to correct deviations, even if it means bringing someone back from the dead. Meanwhile, Sephiroth steals the mysterious Jenova experiment, thought to be connected to the extinction of the ancients, from Shinra, and sends Avalanche to the lower levels of the Shinra building.\n\nIn a confrontation at the top of Shinra headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra, and also impales Barret, but the Whispers heal Barret. The president's son Rufus becomes the new de facto leader of the company. Meanwhile, the building becomes engulfed in Whispers. Cloud and his allies flee the scene via the Midgar Highway. At the end of the highway, the characters find Sephiroth waiting for them, who opens a portal and enters it. Aerith alters the portal, stating that they will fight for freedom from their destiny. The group enters the portal and battles a large Whisper which appears to be a deity controlling destiny. After defeating the Whisper, Sephiroth confronts the group, unleashing Supernova upon Midgar and separating them, before engaging Cloud. As Cloud is pushed back, he receives aid from the others and eventually push him to a corner, preventing him from launching another Supernova, but Sephiroth commands the Whispers to battle Avalanche. Cloud fights through the Whispers and confronts Sephiroth only for Sephiroth to teleport both of them to a metaphysical realm Sephiroth calls the Edge of Creation. Sephiroth urges Cloud to join him so together they can defy fate. Cloud refuses and fights Sephiroth but is no match for him alone and is soon disarmed but spared as Sephiroth cryptically warns Cloud that he will have seven seconds to defy fate, and then departs. After Cloud returns to his group, they agree that Sephiroth is an even greater threat to the Planet than Shinra and commit to defeating him.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> The game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> It features newly arranged and orchestrated tracks from the original game, in addition to original material such as \"Hollow\", a theme song by Uematsu.<ref name=\"Music\"/> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" />\n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nRather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with the lighting engine Enlighten.<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n==Release==\nRumors of a ''Final Fantasy VII'' remake appeared in 2014.<ref name=\"RemakeRumor\"/> It was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015|2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) during the [[PlayStation]] conference, and received a standing ovation.<ref name=\"GSremake\"/><ref name=\"4Govation\"/> [[Visual Works]] created the announcement trailer.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\" /> Square Enix's stock prices rose to their highest rating since November 2008, and the [[YouTube]] release of the reveal trailer garnered over 10 million views in the following two weeks.<ref name=\"IGNstocks\" /><ref name=\"VIIRtrailer\" /> The game was next showcased at the 2015 PlayStation Experience, demonstrating cutscenes and gameplay from the opening sequence.<ref name=\"WiredPSE\"/>\n\nDuring the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary [[opening ceremony]] event hosted by Square Enix in [[Tokyo]] on January 31, 2017 \u2014 the 20th anniversary of ''Final Fantasy VII''\u2014 the game's first piece of CGI key art was unveiled, along with announcements for a collaboration event with ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GamaAnniversary\"/> On February 18, Nomura revealed two screenshots, showing off the updated [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]].<ref name=\"Magic2017showing\"/> Due to its lack of footage since 2015, switch to internal development, and other projects Nomura was involved in, there were concerns about the status of the project. Speaking following E3 2018, Nomura stated that the game was in development, with his full attention shifted to it when ''Kingdom Hearts III'' was completed.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/><ref name=\"Nomura2018b\"/>\n\nAfter years without substantial footage, a teaser trailer was shown during PlayStation's May 2019 State of Play broadcast.

Originally, the gang was set up to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other gangs in the Los Angeles area. Over time, the gang grew into a more traditional criminal organization. MS-13 is defined by its cruelty, and its rivalry with the [[18th Street Gang]].\n\nMany MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992, or upon being arrested, facilitating the spread of the gang to Central America. The gang is currently active in many parts of the continental United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Most members are [[Central America]]n, Salvadorans in particular.\n\nAs an international gang, its history is closely tied to [[United States\u2013El Salvador relations]]. In 2018, the gang's US membership of up to 10,000 accounted for less than 1% of the 1.4 million gang members in the United States, and a similar share of gang murders. The gang is often referenced by the United States' [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to advocate for [[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigrant policies]].\n\n== Description ==\n=== Etymology ===\nThere is some dispute about the etymology of the name. Some sources state the gang is named for La Mara, a street in [[San Salvador]], and the Salvatrucha guerrillas who fought in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/APFN/MS-13.HTM|title=America's Most Dangerous Gang|author=Domash, Shelly Feuer|publisher=apfn.org}}</ref> Additionally, the word ''mara'' means gang in [[Central American Spanish|Caliche slang]] and is taken from ''[[Army ant|marabunta]]'', the name of a fierce type of ant. \"Salvatrucha\" may be a combination of the words ''Salvadoran'' and ''trucha'', a Caliche word for being alert. The term \"Salvatruchas\" has been explained as a reference to Salvadorian peasants trained to become guerrilla fighters, referred to as the \"[[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]].\" The \u201813\u2019 is believed to stand for the letter M, the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, but it is also been rumored to pay homage to a California prison gang, the Mexican Mafia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|title=MS-13: Gangs infiltrating the suburbs of Washington, DC|website=dcspotlight.com|publisher=DC Spotlight Newspaper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614063408/https://dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_MS13.jpg|thumb|An MS [[Gang signal|gang sign]] and tattoos]]\nCentral Americans are the primary targets of violence and threats of violence by MS-13.<ref name=\"Rose\" /> Many of the victims are minors.<ref name=\"Demick\" /> Minors also make up the majority of suspects arrested for killings attributed to MS-13.

As such, Salvadorans began to immigrate without documents in increasing numbers. They mostly settled in cities with large undocumented populations, like Los Angeles. Salvadoran asylum claims were neglected until the 1991 case [[American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) Settlement Agreement|American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh]]. The case's settlement agreement required Guatemalan and Salvadoran asylum claims to be reevaluated, as long as they had entered the U.S. by 1990. By this point, the Civil War was already drawing to a close after more than a decade of fighting. Before ABC v. Thornburg and even after, Salvadoran immigrants were left highly vulnerable to exploitation. In the very beginning, MS-13 was a group of young, delinquent, heavy metal fans who lived in Los Angeles. However, the undocumented community in Los Angeles was subject to severe racial prejudices and persecution. Under these conditions, MS-13 began to mutate into a gang. Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from the other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans, Asians, and African-Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/06/28/in-nva-gang-a-brutal-sense-of-belonging/3d85a511-9afb-4780-9368-12437e807394/|title=In N.Va.

Deras was a former member of Salvadoran special forces, [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|trained in Panama by United States Green Berets]]. On gaining leadership of an MS-13 clique in 1990, he used his military training to discipline the gang and improve its logistical operations. It was after this point that the gang began to grow in power. MS-13's rivalry with the [[18th Street gang|18th Street Gang]] also began in this period. MS-13 and 18th Street were initially friendly, since they were some of the only gangs to allow Salvadorans to join. What exactly caused their alliance to fall apart is uncertain. Most versions point to a fight over a girl in 1989. In the incident, an MS-13 gangster was killed, which led to a cycle of vengeance that has escalated into an intense and generalized animosity between the two gangs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salanegra.elfaro.net/es/201208/cronicas/9301/I-El-origen-del-odio.htm|title=I.

Large-scale deportations began shortly after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992. As a part of the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], the post-war Salvadoran government was required to stop using the standing army as a police force and form a new national police service. However, the ruling political party, [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]], was a descendant of the wartime military government. To favor military allies, it delayed the formation of the [[National Civil Police of El Salvador|Polic\u00eda Nacional Civil]]. When the PNC was finally organized 1993, parts of the police force were created by integrating the armed forces. Some of the members of the nascent police force were known war criminals. The lack of a proper police force meant that deported gangsters faced little opposition when establishing MS-13 in El Salvador. To compound the issue, the post-war period was marked by the existence of a large number of uncontrolled arms left over from the conflict, which allowed MS-13 to become a significant arms trafficker. This remains one of its primary revenue sources today, alongside extortion and assassination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Captured Peace Elites and Peacebuilding in El Salvador|author=Wade, Christine J.|date=2016|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780896802988|oclc=1020654434}}</ref> In addition, the economic struggles of the post-war period, alongside neoliberal trade reforms likely contributed to the growth of MS-13.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultura y contra-cultura en la posmodernidad : el lenguaje en las maras centroamericanas|author=Maria Eugenia Rojas Rodriguez|date=2008|publisher=Alma Mater|oclc=912767426}}</ref>\n\n=== Attempts at suppression ===\nGang violence in El Salvador peaked in the 1990s, then declined in the early 2000s. Even so, they became a key part of political discourse. ARENA presidencies implemented the [[La Mano Dura|Mano Dura and Super Mano Dura]] policies to combat gangs. External observers and gangsters themselves believe these policies increased the power of gangs in El Salvador.\n\nThe Mano Dura policies were followed by a truce between MS-13 and their perpetual rivals, the 18th Street Gang. Under the direction of the president [[Mauricio Funes]], the first Salvadoran President representing the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party, government and gang representatives negotiated unofficially.  The terms required gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for transfers to lower security prisons.  In addition, gangs would receive benefits from the government for every firearm they surrendered. While homicides fell during the truce, gangs no longer had to worry as much about turf wars. Instead, they focused on recruitment, organization, and extortion. The truce did not protect most Salvadorans from extortion. This, along with reports of government leniency towards imprisoned gangsters, led to the truce being highly unpopular and controversial.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFunes's successor as the FMLN presidential candidate, [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]], campaigned on returning to a tough approach on gangs. After S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n took the Presidency in 2014, the truce was understood to be over. Since the gang truce ended, the number of extrajudicial killings by police forces has grown dramatically.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-violence-idUSKBN1FQ0E1|title=U.N. finds possible extrajudicial killings in El Salvador gang...|date=2018-02-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en}}</ref>  Throughout the truce, Salvadoran gangs were able to focus on expansion and internal regulation instead of inter-gang conflict.  When the truce ended, the gangs had built up their forces significantly. As such, the truce breakdown saw a return to record levels of violence, with the gangs being much stronger and better organized than before. In 2015, El Salvador had the highest national homicide rate per capita in the world, largely due to escalating violence between MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang. Participants in the original truce negotiations have since been prosecuted. The trials revealed significant corruption, such as government negotiators encouraging gangs to increase the homicide rate to keep everyone at the negotiating table.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/08/26/traducing-el-salvadors-truce|title=Traducing El Salvador's truce|date=2017-08-26|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-12-06|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to MS-13 in the U.S. has taken varied forms.

Torres tipped authorities to the plan after he and four MS-13 members were stopped by [[NYPD]] detectives for hassling passersby on Northern Boulevard in [[Queens, New York|Queens]], New York. He told police he had information to pass on; he was debriefed on October 22 at [[Rikers Island]], where he was being held on a warrant issued in Virginia, according to court papers. Torres said \"the order for the murder came from gang leadership in El Salvador\", ICE agent Sean Sweeney wrote in an affidavit for a new warrant charging Torres with conspiracy. Torres, who belonged to an MS-13 \"clique\" in Virginia, said he was put in charge, and traveled to New York in August \"for the specific purpose of participating in the planning and execution of the murder plot\", Sweeney wrote. Gang members were trying to obtain a high-powered rifle to penetrate the agent's bulletproof vest. Another MS-13 informant told authorities the agent was marked for death because the gang was \"exceedingly angry\" at him for arresting many members in the past three years, the affidavit states. The murder was supposed to be carried out by the Flushing clique, according to the informant. Federal prosecutors have indicted numerous MS-13 gang members on racketeering, extortion, prostitution, kidnapping, illegal immigration, money laundering, murder, people smuggling, arms trafficking, human trafficking and drug trafficking charges; the targeted special agent was the lead federal investigator on many of the federal cases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/11/04/2009-11-04_ms13_gang_puts_out_hit_on_fbi_agent_assigned_to_crackdown.html|title=MS-13 gang leaders puts out hit on ICE agent assigned to crackdown|last1=Marzulli|first1=John|date=November 4, 2009|work=Daily News|accessdate=June 9, 2012|publisher=NYDailyNews.com}}</ref>\n[[File:Sinaloa Cartel Hierarchy.JPG|thumb|Sinaloa Cartel hierarchy in early 2008]]\n\nIn August 2011, six San Francisco MS-13 members were convicted of racketeering and conspiracy, including three murders, in what was the city's largest-scope gang trial in many years.

Originally, the gang was set up to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other gangs in the Los Angeles area. Over time, the gang grew into a more traditional criminal organization. MS-13 is defined by its cruelty, and its rivalry with the [[18th Street Gang]].\n\nMany MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992, or upon being arrested, facilitating the spread of the gang to Central America. The gang is currently active in many parts of the continental United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Most members are [[Central America]]n, Salvadorans in particular.\n\nAs an international gang, its history is closely tied to [[United States\u2013El Salvador relations]]. In 2018, the gang's US membership of up to 10,000 accounted for less than 1% of the 1.4 million gang members in the United States, and a similar share of gang murders. The gang is often referenced by the United States' [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to advocate for [[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigrant policies]].\n\n== Description ==\n=== Etymology ===\nThere is some dispute about the etymology of the name. Some sources state the gang is named for La Mara, a street in [[San Salvador]], and the Salvatrucha guerrillas who fought in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/APFN/MS-13.HTM|title=America's Most Dangerous Gang|author=Domash, Shelly Feuer|publisher=apfn.org}}</ref> Additionally, the word ''mara'' means gang in [[Central American Spanish|Caliche slang]] and is taken from ''[[Army ant|marabunta]]'', the name of a fierce type of ant. \"Salvatrucha\" may be a combination of the words ''Salvadoran'' and ''trucha'', a Caliche word for being alert. The term \"Salvatruchas\" has been explained as a reference to Salvadorian peasants trained to become guerrilla fighters, referred to as the \"[[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]].\" The \u201813\u2019 is believed to stand for the letter M, the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, but it is also been rumored to pay homage to a California prison gang, the Mexican Mafia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|title=MS-13: Gangs infiltrating the suburbs of Washington, DC|website=dcspotlight.com|publisher=DC Spotlight Newspaper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614063408/https://dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_MS13.jpg|thumb|An MS [[Gang signal|gang sign]] and tattoos]]\nCentral Americans are the primary targets of violence and threats of violence by MS-13.<ref name=\"Rose\" /> Many of the victims are minors.<ref name=\"Demick\" /> Minors also make up the majority of suspects arrested for killings attributed to MS-13.

As such, Salvadorans began to immigrate without documents in increasing numbers. They mostly settled in cities with large undocumented populations, like Los Angeles. Salvadoran asylum claims were neglected until the 1991 case [[American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) Settlement Agreement|American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh]]. The case's settlement agreement required Guatemalan and Salvadoran asylum claims to be reevaluated, as long as they had entered the U.S. by 1990. By this point, the Civil War was already drawing to a close after more than a decade of fighting. Before ABC v. Thornburg and even after, Salvadoran immigrants were left highly vulnerable to exploitation. In the very beginning, MS-13 was a group of young, delinquent, heavy metal fans who lived in Los Angeles. However, the undocumented community in Los Angeles was subject to severe racial prejudices and persecution. Under these conditions, MS-13 began to mutate into a gang. Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from the other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans, Asians, and African-Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/06/28/in-nva-gang-a-brutal-sense-of-belonging/3d85a511-9afb-4780-9368-12437e807394/|title=In N.Va.

Deras was a former member of Salvadoran special forces, [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|trained in Panama by United States Green Berets]]. On gaining leadership of an MS-13 clique in 1990, he used his military training to discipline the gang and improve its logistical operations. It was after this point that the gang began to grow in power. MS-13's rivalry with the [[18th Street gang|18th Street Gang]] also began in this period. MS-13 and 18th Street were initially friendly, since they were some of the only gangs to allow Salvadorans to join. What exactly caused their alliance to fall apart is uncertain. Most versions point to a fight over a girl in 1989. In the incident, an MS-13 gangster was killed, which led to a cycle of vengeance that has escalated into an intense and generalized animosity between the two gangs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salanegra.elfaro.net/es/201208/cronicas/9301/I-El-origen-del-odio.htm|title=I.

Large-scale deportations began shortly after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992. As a part of the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], the post-war Salvadoran government was required to stop using the standing army as a police force and form a new national police service. However, the ruling political party, [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]], was a descendant of the wartime military government. To favor military allies, it delayed the formation of the [[National Civil Police of El Salvador|Polic\u00eda Nacional Civil]]. When the PNC was finally organized 1993, parts of the police force were created by integrating the armed forces. Some of the members of the nascent police force were known war criminals. The lack of a proper police force meant that deported gangsters faced little opposition when establishing MS-13 in El Salvador. To compound the issue, the post-war period was marked by the existence of a large number of uncontrolled arms left over from the conflict, which allowed MS-13 to become a significant arms trafficker. This remains one of its primary revenue sources today, alongside extortion and assassination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Captured Peace Elites and Peacebuilding in El Salvador|author=Wade, Christine J.|date=2016|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780896802988|oclc=1020654434}}</ref> In addition, the economic struggles of the post-war period, alongside neoliberal trade reforms likely contributed to the growth of MS-13.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultura y contra-cultura en la posmodernidad : el lenguaje en las maras centroamericanas|author=Maria Eugenia Rojas Rodriguez|date=2008|publisher=Alma Mater|oclc=912767426}}</ref>\n\n=== Attempts at suppression ===\nGang violence in El Salvador peaked in the 1990s, then declined in the early 2000s. Even so, they became a key part of political discourse. ARENA presidencies implemented the [[La Mano Dura|Mano Dura and Super Mano Dura]] policies to combat gangs. External observers and gangsters themselves believe these policies increased the power of gangs in El Salvador.\n\nThe Mano Dura policies were followed by a truce between MS-13 and their perpetual rivals, the 18th Street Gang. Under the direction of the president [[Mauricio Funes]], the first Salvadoran President representing the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party, government and gang representatives negotiated unofficially.  The terms required gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for transfers to lower security prisons.  In addition, gangs would receive benefits from the government for every firearm they surrendered. While homicides fell during the truce, gangs no longer had to worry as much about turf wars. Instead, they focused on recruitment, organization, and extortion. The truce did not protect most Salvadorans from extortion. This, along with reports of government leniency towards imprisoned gangsters, led to the truce being highly unpopular and controversial.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFunes's successor as the FMLN presidential candidate, [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]], campaigned on returning to a tough approach on gangs. After S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n took the Presidency in 2014, the truce was understood to be over. Since the gang truce ended, the number of extrajudicial killings by police forces has grown dramatically.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-violence-idUSKBN1FQ0E1|title=U.N. finds possible extrajudicial killings in El Salvador gang...|date=2018-02-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en}}</ref>  Throughout the truce, Salvadoran gangs were able to focus on expansion and internal regulation instead of inter-gang conflict.  When the truce ended, the gangs had built up their forces significantly. As such, the truce breakdown saw a return to record levels of violence, with the gangs being much stronger and better organized than before. In 2015, El Salvador had the highest national homicide rate per capita in the world, largely due to escalating violence between MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang. Participants in the original truce negotiations have since been prosecuted. The trials revealed significant corruption, such as government negotiators encouraging gangs to increase the homicide rate to keep everyone at the negotiating table.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/08/26/traducing-el-salvadors-truce|title=Traducing El Salvador's truce|date=2017-08-26|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-12-06|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to MS-13 in the U.S. has taken varied forms.

In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Love Spell Potential]]\", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.\n\nIn season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep15|The Locomotive Manipulation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 6, 2014|season=7|number=15}}</ref> Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy. The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]\", when he finally admits being in love with her: \"I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

In [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|the series finale]], both Sheldon and Amy are recipients of the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for their discovery of super asymmetry which they first worked on moments before their wedding. In Amy's speech, she encourages young girls around the world to study whatever they want.

After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5\u00bc-inch [[floppy disk]]).

He also has a maternal aunt, Charlene, which was revealed in ''Young Sheldon'' when his mother told Meemaw that she made dinner for \u201cCharlene and Edward\u201d more times than her. Sheldon had another uncle, named Carl Cooper, who was killed by a badger while cleaning a chimney and another uncle that may have done things to children that were legal in Oklahoma per \"The Clean Room Infiltration\".\n\nIn \"The Engagement Reaction\", Sheldon mentions that his aunt Ruth died a week after being infected by a pathogen she contracted in the hospital where she visited Sheldon's uncle Roger, and that their ashes are now stored in a coffee can on Sheldon's mother's mantle.

Of the three, Sheldon is openly dismissive of Howard and constantly [[wikt:opine|opines]] that a master's degree in engineering demonstrates a lesser intellect than that of the others, who all possess science doctorates.

Their relationship continues in season 4, although Sheldon often points out that they are not in a romantic relationship (stating that she \"is a girl who is a friend, but is not my girlfriend\").

In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Love Spell Potential]]\", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.\n\nIn season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep15|The Locomotive Manipulation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 6, 2014|season=7|number=15}}</ref> Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy. The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]\", when he finally admits being in love with her: \"I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

In [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|the series finale]], both Sheldon and Amy are recipients of the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for their discovery of super asymmetry which they first worked on moments before their wedding. In Amy's speech, she encourages young girls around the world to study whatever they want. Instead of giving a self-centered speech, Sheldon [[The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_12)#speech|thanks]] his family, his friends and his wife Amy for always supporting him.\n\nHe once idolized fictional prodigy [[Wesley Crusher]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', portrayed by Wil Wheaton, until Wheaton did not show up at a convention attended by Sheldon in 1995. Sheldon had spent 15 hours on a bus travelling to the convention during which time he was forced to break his rule about urinating in a moving vehicle.

Now on the front of Hitchin Library.]]\nThe name of the town also is associated with the small river that runs through it, most picturesquely in front of the east end of [[St. Mary's Church, Hitchin|St. Mary's Church]], the town's parish church. The river is noted on maps as the [[River Hiz]]. Contrary to how most people now pronounce the name, that is to say as spelt, the 'z' is an abbreviated character for a 'tch' sound in the Domesday Book<ref>Johnston, James B., The Place-Names of England and Wales, London, 1915, p. 305</ref> (as in the name of the town). It would have been pronounced 'River Hitch'. ''The Hicca Way'' is an eight-mile walking route along the River Hiz Valley, believed to have been used for trade between the Danes and English in the Anglo-Saxon age.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It is also likely that Hitch Wood, which lies some half a dozen miles south of the town also derives its name from the Hicce tribe, who gave their name to Hitchin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prestonherts.co.uk/page148.html|title=Preston Herts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[St. Mary's Church, Hitchin|St. Mary's Church]] is remarkably large for a town of its size and was once a Minster. The size of the church is evidence of how Hitchin prospered from the wool trade. It is the largest parish church in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Hitchin Through Time|last = Madgin|first = Hugh|publisher = Amberley Publishing|year = 2009|isbn = 1848687451|location = Britain & Ireland|pages = }}</ref> Most of the church dates from the 15th century, with its tower dating from around 1190. During the laying of a new floor in the church in 1911, foundations of a more ancient church building were found. In form, they appear to be a [[basilica]]n church of a 7th-century type, with a later enlarged [[chancel]] and [[transept]]s, perhaps added in the 10th century. This makes the church older than the story (not recorded before the 15th century) that the church was founded by [[Offa]], king of [[Mercia]] 757-796.\n\nIn 1697, Hitchin (and the nearby village of [[Offley]]) were subject to what is thought to have been the most severe [[hail]]storm in recorded British history. Hailstones over 4&nbsp;inches in diameter were reported<ref>Tailor, Robert (May 1697), \"Account of a Great Hailstorm\", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (Great Britain)''; vol. 19, pp. 577-578</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bucks Head sign.png|thumb|The Buck's Head pub sign, depicting Henry VIII's supposed escapade in Hitchin]] -->\nThe town flourished on the wool trade, and located near the [[Icknield Way]] and by the 17th century Hitchin was a staging post for coaches coming from [[London]]. By the middle of the 19th century the railway had arrived, and with it a new way of life for Hitchin. The [[corn exchange]] was built in the [[market place]] and within a short time Hitchin established itself as a major centre for grain trading.\n\nThe latter half of the 20th century has also brought great changes in communication to Hitchin. Motorways have shortened the journey time and brought [[Luton]], a few miles away on the [[M1 motorway|M1]], and the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 (M)]] even closer. By the close of the 20th century, Hitchin had developed a strong commuter interest being midway between London and Cambridge. Hitchin also developed a fairly strong [[Sikh]] community based around the [[Walsworth]] area.\n\nDuring the medieval period, both a priory (Newbigging, now known as The Biggin) and a friary (now known as [[Hitchin Priory]]) were established, both of which closed during [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. They were never reformed, although The Biggin was for many years used as [[almshouse]]s.\n\nThe [[British Schools Museum]] in Hitchin is home to the world's only surviving complete [[Lancasterian Schoolroom]], which was built in 1837 to teach boys by the [[Lancasterian method]] ([[peer tutoring]]). This unique community project demonstrates the foundation of education for all.\n\nGirton College \u2013 a pioneer in women's education \u2013 was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of College for Women at Benslow House in Hitchin, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London. It was thought to be less 'risky' and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning. The college moved to Cambridge a few years later and adopted its present name, [[Girton College]].\n\n==Government==\nHitchin is in the [[Non-metropolitan district|local government district]] of [[North Hertfordshire]] which was formed in 1974 by the amalgamation of rural and urban councils. There is now no town council in Hitchin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Councils and Politics|url=http://www.hitchinforum.org.uk/about-hitchin/council-mp/|publisher=Hitchin Forum|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref> Residents elect 13 members to the [[North Hertfordshire District Council]]. There are five electoral wards in Hitchin: [[Bearton]], [[Highbury Ward|Highbury]], [[Hitchin Oughton|Oughton]], Priory and [[Walsworth]].\n\nThe town is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by the constituency of [[Hitchin and Harpenden (UK Parliament constituency)|Hitchin and Harpenden]].

Between 1983 and 1997 Hitchin was included in the constituency of [[North Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Hertfordshire]]. Before that it was in the constituency of [[Hitchin (UK Parliament constituency)|Hitchin]].\n\nIn the [[European Parliament]], Hitchin was represented by the [[East of England (European Parliament constituency)|East of England]] constituency, which elected 7 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]]. Prior to 1999 and the adoption of [[proportional representation]], it was in the European constituency of [[Hertfordshire (European Parliament constituency)|Hertfordshire]].\n\n==Transport==\n\n=== Rail ===\n{{See also|Hitchin railway station}}\n[[Hitchin railway station]] is on the [[East Coast Main Line|Great Northern Line]], and is also on the [[Cambridge Line]] as the last stop before it diverges towards Cambridge, {{Convert|1.42|km|mi|abbr=}} to the north east of the Hitchin.

Now on the front of Hitchin Library.]]\nThe name of the town also is associated with the small river that runs through it, most picturesquely in front of the east end of [[St. Mary's Church, Hitchin|St. Mary's Church]], the town's parish church. The river is noted on maps as the [[River Hiz]]. Contrary to how most people now pronounce the name, that is to say as spelt, the 'z' is an abbreviated character for a 'tch' sound in the Domesday Book<ref>Johnston, James B., The Place-Names of England and Wales, London, 1915, p. 305</ref> (as in the name of the town). It would have been pronounced 'River Hitch'. ''The Hicca Way'' is an eight-mile walking route along the River Hiz Valley, believed to have been used for trade between the Danes and English in the Anglo-Saxon age.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It is also likely that Hitch Wood, which lies some half a dozen miles south of the town also derives its name from the Hicce tribe, who gave their name to Hitchin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prestonherts.co.uk/page148.html|title=Preston Herts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[St. Mary's Church, Hitchin|St. Mary's Church]] is remarkably large for a town of its size and was once a Minster. The size of the church is evidence of how Hitchin prospered from the wool trade. It is the largest parish church in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Hitchin Through Time|last = Madgin|first = Hugh|publisher = Amberley Publishing|year = 2009|isbn = 1848687451|location = Britain & Ireland|pages = }}</ref> Most of the church dates from the 15th century, with its tower dating from around 1190. During the laying of a new floor in the church in 1911, foundations of a more ancient church building were found. In form, they appear to be a [[basilica]]n church of a 7th-century type, with a later enlarged [[chancel]] and [[transept]]s, perhaps added in the 10th century. This makes the church older than the story (not recorded before the 15th century) that the church was founded by [[Offa]], king of [[Mercia]] 757-796.\n\nIn 1697, Hitchin (and the nearby village of [[Offley]]) were subject to what is thought to have been the most severe [[hail]]storm in recorded British history. Hailstones over 4&nbsp;inches in diameter were reported<ref>Tailor, Robert (May 1697), \"Account of a Great Hailstorm\", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (Great Britain)''; vol. 19, pp. 577-578</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bucks Head sign.png|thumb|The Buck's Head pub sign, depicting Henry VIII's supposed escapade in Hitchin]] -->\nThe town flourished on the wool trade, and located near the [[Icknield Way]] and by the 17th century Hitchin was a staging post for coaches coming from [[London]]. By the middle of the 19th century the railway had arrived, and with it a new way of life for Hitchin. The [[corn exchange]] was built in the [[market place]] and within a short time Hitchin established itself as a major centre for grain trading.\n\nThe latter half of the 20th century has also brought great changes in communication to Hitchin. Motorways have shortened the journey time and brought [[Luton]], a few miles away on the [[M1 motorway|M1]], and the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 (M)]] even closer. By the close of the 20th century, Hitchin had developed a strong commuter interest being midway between London and Cambridge. Hitchin also developed a fairly strong [[Sikh]] community based around the [[Walsworth]] area.\n\nDuring the medieval period, both a priory (Newbigging, now known as The Biggin) and a friary (now known as [[Hitchin Priory]]) were established, both of which closed during [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. They were never reformed, although The Biggin was for many years used as [[almshouse]]s.\n\nThe [[British Schools Museum]] in Hitchin is home to the world's only surviving complete [[Lancasterian Schoolroom]], which was built in 1837 to teach boys by the [[Lancasterian method]] ([[peer tutoring]]). This unique community project demonstrates the foundation of education for all.\n\nGirton College \u2013 a pioneer in women's education \u2013 was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of College for Women at Benslow House in Hitchin, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London. It was thought to be less 'risky' and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning. The college moved to Cambridge a few years later and adopted its present name, [[Girton College]].\n\n==Government==\nHitchin is in the [[Non-metropolitan district|local government district]] of [[North Hertfordshire]] which was formed in 1974 by the amalgamation of rural and urban councils. There is now no town council in Hitchin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Councils and Politics|url=http://www.hitchinforum.org.uk/about-hitchin/council-mp/|publisher=Hitchin Forum|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref> Residents elect 13 members to the [[North Hertfordshire District Council]].

Before that it was in the constituency of [[Hitchin (UK Parliament constituency)|Hitchin]].\n\nIn the [[European Parliament]], Hitchin was represented by the [[East of England (European Parliament constituency)|East of England]] constituency, which elected 7 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]]. Prior to 1999 and the adoption of [[proportional representation]], it was in the European constituency of [[Hertfordshire (European Parliament constituency)|Hertfordshire]].\n\n==Transport==\n\n=== Rail ===\n{{See also|Hitchin railway station}}\n[[Hitchin railway station]] is on the [[East Coast Main Line|Great Northern Line]], and is also on the [[Cambridge Line]] as the last stop before it diverges towards Cambridge, {{Convert|1.42|km|mi|abbr=}} to the north east of the Hitchin.

Military Science was subsequently approved as a subject for the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science general degrees from 1913, and was taught under the Faculty of Arts and also the Faculty of Engineering.\n\nIn 1926 the intervention of William Norton Medlicott prevented the Department of History from ridding itself of the lectureship in Military History.<ref>http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=66374&back=</ref> With [[War Office]] support the Military Studies Department was established in 1926 and formed part of the Faculty of Arts, with Major General [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Sir Frederick Barton Maurice]] holding the Chair. It became known as the War Studies Department in 1943 but was discontinued in 1948, although the subject continued to be taught under the Department of Medieval and Modern History.\n\nFollowing the [[World War II]], there was an initiative by senior members of [[University of London]] notably [[Lionel Robbins, Baron Robbins|Lionel Robbins]], [[Charles Webster (historian)|Sir Charles Webster]] and [[Sir (William) Keith Hancock|Keith Hancock]], to revive Military Studies at the University. In 1953, [[Michael Howard (historian)|Sir Michael Howard]] was appointed to the Lectureship in Military Studies, and by 1962 Sir Michael was able to reinstate the Department of War Studies to offer postgraduate courses.\n\nA Bachelor of Arts degree in War Studies was offered from 1992 onwards.

It became known as the War Studies Department in 1943 but was discontinued in 1948, although the subject continued to be taught under the Department of Medieval and Modern History.\n\nFollowing the [[World War II]], there was an initiative by senior members of [[University of London]] notably [[Lionel Robbins, Baron Robbins|Lionel Robbins]], [[Charles Webster (historian)|Sir Charles Webster]] and [[Sir (William) Keith Hancock|Keith Hancock]], to revive Military Studies at the University. In 1953, [[Michael Howard (historian)|Sir Michael Howard]] was appointed to the Lectureship in Military Studies, and by 1962 Sir Michael was able to reinstate the Department of War Studies to offer postgraduate courses.\n\nA Bachelor of Arts degree in War Studies was offered from 1992 onwards. The department became part of the School of Humanities in 1989 and the School of Social Science and Public Policy in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/kclca/collection/k/10ki4655 |title=King's College London: Department of War Studies Records |publisher=King's Collections |accessdate=17 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121043821/http://www.kingscollections.org/catalogues/kclca/collection/k/10ki4655 |archivedate=21 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 the department celebrated its 50th anniversary, with a series of celebratory events to mark the occasion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2012/01Jan/War-Studies-celebrates-50-years.aspx |title=  War Studies celebrates 50 years|publisher=King's College London |accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Notable alumni and students==\n{{See also|List of King's College London alumni|}}\n\n[[File:Maroufalbakhit.jpg|thumb|right|Prime Minister of Jordan [[Marouf al-Bakhit]]|155px]]\n[[File:Nataliagherman.jpg|thumb|right|Prime Minister of Moldova [[Natalia Gherman]]|155px]]\n[[File:Argentina- John Freeman (8473848056).jpg|thumb|right|Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands [[John Freeman (diplomat)|John Freeman]]|155px]]\n[[File:Siradrianbradshaw.jpg|thumb|Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe [[Adrian Bradshaw|Sir Adrian Bradshaw]]|155px]] \n[[File:Sir Robert Fry - Self Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Commandant General Royal Marines [[Robert Fry|Sir Robert Fry]]|155px]]\n[[File:Stuart Skeates.jpg|thumb|Commandant of RMA Sandhurst [[Stuart Skeates]]|155px]]\n\n===Government and politics===\n*[[Marouf al-Bakhit]] (PhD 1990), former Prime Minister of Jordan<ref name=\"Biography of Marouf al-Bakhit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalinsight.com/Perspective/PerspectiveDetail2538.htm|title=Biography of Marouf al-Bakhit|accessdate=22 December 2008}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n*[[Martin Bourke]] (MA 1970), former Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands<ref name=\"Martin Bourke\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U8222|title=Martin Bourke|publisher=[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n*[[Tan Chuan-Jin]] (MA 1999), Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore\n*[[Kayode Fayemi]] (PhD 1987), Nigeria's Minister of Solid Minerals Development\n*[[Mark Francois]] (MA 1987), Conservative Member of UK Parliament\n*[[Christopher Geidt|Sir Christopher Geidt]] (MA 1987), former [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign]] (Queen Elizabeth II)\n*[[Natalia Gherman]] (MA 1999), former Deputy Prime Minister of Moldova\n*[[John Hillen]] (MA 1993), former US Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs\n*[[Dan Jarvis]] (MA 2011), Labour Member of UK Parliament\n*[[Nickolay Mladenov]] (MA 1996), UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process\n*[[Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160ediv\u00fd]] (MA 1994), Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic to NATO\n*[[Keith Simpson (politician)|Keith Simpson]] (postgraduate research 1972), Conservative Member of Parliament\n*[[Pritam Singh (Singaporean politician)|Pritam Singh]] (MA 2004), Singaporean Member of Parliament\n*[[Shaun Spiers]] (MA 1985), former Labour Member of the European Parliament\n*[[Eleni Stavrou]] (MA; PhD), Member of the Cyprus House of Representatives\n\n===Military, security and diplomacy===\n*[[A.T.M.
