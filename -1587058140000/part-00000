Review decisions need to be initiated by an appeal from a previous applicant, most commonly referred to as \"aggrieved party\", or a Federal or State Attorney-General.\n\n{{As of|2020}}, the board comprises a convenor, deputy convenor and five other board members. The current convenor is former senator [[Sue Knowles]], who was appointed in January 2019 to a two-year term.<ref name=board>{{cite news|url=https://www.classification.gov.au/about-us/classification-review-board|title=Classification Review Board|publisher=Government of Australia|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Organizations==\nThe Classification Review Board is a statutory body established by the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw%5Cmanagement.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200401401?OpenDocument Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (Cth)].  This Act also provides a basis for the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/management.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200508203?OpenDocument National Classification Code] which guides their decision making. As the State and Territory governments retain responsibility for enforcing censorship and could withdraw from, or ignore the national classification scheme if they so wished, any changes to the national classification scheme must be agreed to by all the State and Territory Censorship Ministers (usually Attorneys-General). South Australia is the only state to maintain a separate [https://web.archive.org/web/20100705122212/http://www.agd.sa.gov.au/about_us/saclass_council.php Classification Council] which can override national classification decisions applicable within the state.\n\nThe Classification Review Board does not censor material by ordering cuts or changes. However, they are able to effectively censor media by refusing classification and making the media illegal for hire, exhibit and import to Australia.\n\n==Classification decisions==\nThere have been various films and video games that have appealed the ratings as set by the Australian Classification board. Appeals include:\n\n=== 2019 ===\n* '''''[[Hellboy (2019 film)|Hellboy]]''''' \u2013 [[Roadshow Entertainment]] failed to appeal the film's R18+ rating for an MA15+, because the cumulative impact of the violence was not mitigated enough by the fantasy context.\n* '''''[[Rocketman (film)|Rocketman]]''''' \u2013 Successfully appealed from MA15+ to an M rating due to the film's lone use of c**t being used as an act of self-reflection rather than as an aggressive insult directed at another.\n\n=== 2018 ===\n* '''''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]''''' \u2013 The film's original version received an M rating for 'Action violence'. A cut version was sent and received the same M rating. [[Paramount Pictures]] appealed the cut version's rating and won a PG rating because the themes, violence and language were deemed to be mild in impact.\n* '''''[[We Happy Few]]''' \u2013'' [[Gearbox Publishing]] appealed the game's RC rating on behalf of [[Compulsion Games]] and won, obtaining an R18+. The board found that the use of drugs in the game do not relate to incentives or rewards. The game's Lightbearer DLC was banned in August 2019 for drug use relating to incentives and rewards; Gearbox has yet to appeal the DLC's ban.\n\n===2017===\n*'''''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]''''' \u2013 [[StudioCanal]] successfully lowered the film's rating from R18+ to MA15+. The main reason being that the most graphic images were dimly lit and only fleetingly seen.\n*'''''[[Split (2017 film)|Split]]''''' \u2013 ''Consumers of Mental Health WA'' failed to appeal the film's M rating for an MA15+ because the content and complex mental illness theme was judged to be only moderate in impact and justified by context.\n\n===2016===\n*'''''[[Embrace (film)|Embrace]]''''' - Dropped from MA15+ to M as the detailed depictions of nudity had an educational context.\n*'''''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]''''' - Failed to lower its MA15+ rating due a strong sense of menace throughout.\n*'''''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'''''  - Dropped from M to PG as the violence lacked blood, injury or depictions of dead bodies.\n*'''''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'''''  - Dropped from MA15+ to M due the lack of depiction involving serious bodily harm.\n\n===2015===\n*'''''[[Blinky Bill the Movie]]''''' - Dropped from PG to G to due the themes being of a very low threat of menace.\n*'''''[[Boychoir (film)|Boychoir]]''''' - Dropped from PG to G due to the car crash scene lacking injury detail.\n\n===2014===\n*'''''[[Blended (film)|Blended]]''''' - Dropped from M to PG due to the sexual references being discreetly implied.\n\n===2013===\n*Australian Attorney-General George Brandis tried to appeal the MA15+ rating of 12 video games, believing they should be upgraded to R18+ due to being given adult ratings in other countries. The appeal failed and every single game kept their MA15+ rating.\n*'''''[[American Hustle]]''''' - Dropped from MA15+ to M as the elements of aggressive coarse language were infrequent.\n*'''''[[Behind the Candelabra]]''''' - Dropped from MA15+ to M as the film's depiction of drug use dealt with the consequences of addiction and the sex scenes were discreet.\n*'''''[[Children's Island (film)|Children's Island]]''''' - The [[Australian Federal Police]] successfully appealed the film's R18+, banning it due to child pornography concerns.\n*'''''[[Inside Llewyn Davis]]''''' - Dropped from MA15+ to M as the elements of aggressive course course language were infrequent.\n*'''''[[Rampage (2009 film)|Rampage (2009)]]''''' - Australian Attorney-General George Brandis tried to appeal the film's MA15+ rating but failed as despite the frequent scenes of strong violence, the film never glorified its depiction of violent content.\n*'''''[[Saints Row IV]]''''' - Failed to appeal RC rating due to interactive drug use related to incentives and rewards. The game was passed as an MA15+ a few years later when it was re-released alongside the [[Saints Row: Gat out of Hell|Gat Out of Hell]] expansion.\n\n===2012===\n*'''''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''''' \u2013 Originally classified MA15+ for strong sci-fi violence specifically the birth scene, it was later downgraded to an M classification due to said scene being mitigated by a medical context.\n\n===2011===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/InformationCentre_MediaReleases_2011MediaReleases</ref>\n*'''''[[The House of the Dead: Overkill|The House of the Dead: Overkill \u2013 Extended Cut]]''''' \u2013 Sega successfully appealed its ban for an MA15+ on the basis that the over-the-top violence mitigated the impact.\n*'''''[[We Dare]]''''' \u2013 Federal Attorney-General [[Brendan O'Connor (politician)|Brendan O'Connor]] failed to appeal the game's rating and thus stuck with its PG rating on the basis that the sexual references were only mild in impact.\n*'''''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]''''' \u2013 Warner Bros. failed its appeal to attain an MA15+ rating due to violence being of a high degree; this was due to the lack of an R18+ for video games at the time, hence the game was subsequently refused classification for a second time. Has since been re-rated R18+ uncut after said rating's introduction.\n*'''''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1]]''''' Originally received an MA15+ classification due to the strong themes involving an intense birth scene. It was later downgraded to an M rating due to the fantasy nature of the themes.\n\n===2010===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_reviewBoarddecisions-2010</ref>\n*'''''[[The Karate Kid (2010 film)|The Karate Kid]]''''' \u2013 Lowered its M rating to a PG due to the consensus being that the violence was not detailed and was relatively infrequent within the narrative.\n*'''''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom|Salo]]''''' \u2013 Federal Attorney-General Brendan O'Conner tried to appeal its R18+ rating. It was originally banned since 1997 but was recently re-rated by the classification board. The film was again awarded an R18+ rating due to the additional three hours of extras which give context to the film, the same reason as the classification board.\n\n===2009===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoarddecisions-2009</ref>\n*'''''[[Alien vs Predator]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its RC rating and won, attaining an MA15+. The reason they deemed it as suitable for 15-year-olds is its science fiction context and how the mutilations were randomly generated and the player had no control over it.\n*'''''[[Charlie Wilson's War (film)|Charlie Wilson's War]]''''' \u2013 Bob Debus, the Minister for Home Affairs at the time, appealed the M rating of the film as he thought the nudity should have given the film a higher and restricted MA15+. He failed and the film retained the same rating of M, though with the added consumer advice of 'partial nudity'.\n*'''''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th (2009 remake)]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its R18+ rating but lost due to how the violence frequently dwells on detail.\n*'''Hydrolord the Game''' (board game) \u2013 Bob Debus, the Minister for Home Affairs at the time, tried to appeal the M rating of this board game to cause it to receive a restricted rating of 'Category 1 18+' due to drug references, the board found that the drug references were very discreet thus awarding it the same rating of M.\n*'''''[[Julie & Julia]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its M rating and won in which it was re-rated PG for 'Infrequent coarse language'. It won the appeal as the word \"fuck\" was used briefly and can easily be missed and is used in context to calm another character down.\n*'''''[[Left 4 Dead 2]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its RC rating but lost. This was due to the relentlessly graphic and detailed depictions of violence and gore throughout the game and thus could not be accommodated at the MA15+ rating. The game later received an R18+ classification.\n*'''''[[The Loved Ones (film)|The Loved Ones]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its R18+ and won, it was then re-rated MA15+. This was due to that the most violent scenes generally had a dark comedic overtone to it thus reducing the impact.\n*'''''[[Stone Bros.]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its MA15+ but failed. This was due to how, despite the film showing negative effects on drugs, there are certain scenes explicitly detailing how to actually form them.\n\n===2008===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_Boarddecisions-2008</ref>\n*'''''[[F.E.A.R. 2]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its RC rating and was awarded with a MA15+. The board found that the violence was expected in its genre and the most violent events occurred without player control.\n*'''''[[Open Season 2]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its PG rating but failed as the violence was a bit too intense for younger viewers.\n*'''''[[Space Chimps]]''''' \u2013 Successfully appealed its PG rating and won its G rating as the comedic overtone lessened the impact to young children.\n\n===2007===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoardDecisions-2007</ref>\n*'''''[[300 (film)|300]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal and its R18+ was downgraded to a MA15+ due to how unrealistic the CGI effects were causing all the violence to be highly stylized.\n*'''''[[30 days of night (film)|30 Days of Night]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal and was awarded an MA15+ rating over its previous R18+. The reason was that it took place in a clear fantasy environment and that the vampires bled black blood lessening the impact.\n*'''''[[Notes on a Scandal (film)|Notes on a Scandal]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal and stayed with its MA15+ rating due to how sensitive the public is to sex with a minor even with the film's implied sex scenes.\n*'''''[[Sleuth (2007 film)|Sleuth]]''''' (remake) \u2013 Successfully appealed its MA15+ rating for an M rating. The board found that the two uses of 'cunt' was, while aggressive, still infrequent.\n*'''''[[Saw IV]]''''' \u2013 Was originally rated R18+ due to the violent/sadistic content and graphic bloodshed. It was decreased to MA15+ based on the content being similar to the previous installments, which were rated MA15+. The notable scenes were the eye gouging, autopsy scene, hair scalping scene and hammer bashing scenes.\n*[[Sea Patrol (season 1)|'''''Sea Patrol'' (season 1)''']] \u2013 Lost its appeal and stayed with its M rating due to certain scenes dwelling on detail of blood.\n\n===2006===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoarddecisions-2006</ref>\n*'''''[[Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]''''' \u2013 Federal Attorney-General Phil Ruddock  applied to appeal the MA15+ of the rating to force into the RC (banned) territory. He succeeded and banned the game as the board noted that while all the violence, coarse language and drug references may be accommodated within the MA15+ category, the theme proved to be high impact due to the glorification of graffiti.\n*'''''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal of the M rating due to violence being too frequent to fit within the PG classification.\n*'''''[[Stormbreaker (film)|Stormbreaker]]''''' \u2013 As with ''Eragon'', lost its appeal of the M rating due to the frequency of the violence.\n*'''''[[River Queen]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal for lowering its MA15+ rating for an M rating. This was due to the historical context of the film mitigating the impact.\n*'''''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal due to the dark nature of the film being deemed too impactful to fit into the PG category.\n*'''''[[Big Momma's House 2]]''''' \u2013 Won  its appeal to lower its M rating into a PG rating. This was due to the overall comedic tone lessening the impact of the violence.\n\nAll appeals before 2006 were done when the review board was not owned by the Attorney-general's department but instead when it was overlooked by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC).\n\n===2005===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoarddecisions-2005</ref>\n*'''''[[50 Cent Bulletproof]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal to drop its RC banning due to the frequent detailed violence.\n*'''''[[A History of Violence]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal for a MA15+ rating as while the violence was very detailed and realistic, it was infrequent within the film.\n*'''''[[Mysterious Skin]]''''' \u2013 Attorney-general Phil Ruddock once again tried to get another film banned.

The corporate body is responsible for reviewing classification decisions made by the [[Australian Classification Board]] concerning [[film]]s, [[video game]]s and [[publication]]s for exhibition, sale or hire in [[Australia]]. Review decisions need to be initiated by an appeal from a previous applicant, most commonly referred to as \"aggrieved party\", or a Federal or State Attorney-General.\n\n{{As of|2020}}, the board comprises a convenor, deputy convenor and five other board members. The current convenor is former senator [[Sue Knowles]], who was appointed in January 2019 to a two-year term.<ref name=board>{{cite news|url=https://www.classification.gov.au/about-us/classification-review-board|title=Classification Review Board|publisher=Government of Australia|access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Organizations==\nThe Classification Review Board is a statutory body established by the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw%5Cmanagement.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200401401?OpenDocument Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (Cth)].  This Act also provides a basis for the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/management.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200508203?OpenDocument National Classification Code] which guides their decision making. As the State and Territory governments retain responsibility for enforcing censorship and could withdraw from, or ignore the national classification scheme if they so wished, any changes to the national classification scheme must be agreed to by all the State and Territory Censorship Ministers (usually Attorneys-General). South Australia is the only state to maintain a separate [https://web.archive.org/web/20100705122212/http://www.agd.sa.gov.au/about_us/saclass_council.php Classification Council] which can override national classification decisions applicable within the state.\n\nThe Classification Review Board does not censor material by ordering cuts or changes. However, they are able to effectively censor media by refusing classification and making the media illegal for hire, exhibit and import to Australia.\n\n==Classification decisions==\nThere have been various films and video games that have appealed the ratings as set by the Australian Classification board. Appeals include:\n\n=== 2019 ===\n* '''''[[Hellboy (2019 film)|Hellboy]]''''' \u2013 [[Roadshow Entertainment]] failed to appeal the film's R18+ rating for an MA15+, because the cumulative impact of the violence was not mitigated enough by the fantasy context.\n* '''''[[Rocketman (film)|Rocketman]]''''' \u2013 Successfully appealed from MA15+ to an M rating due to the film's lone use of c**t being used as an act of self-reflection rather than as an aggressive insult directed at another.\n\n=== 2018 ===\n* '''''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]''''' \u2013 The film's original version received an M rating for 'Action violence'. A cut version was sent and received the same M rating. [[Paramount Pictures]] appealed the cut version's rating and won a PG rating because the themes, violence and language were deemed to be mild in impact.\n* ''[[We Happy Few|'''We Happy Few''']] \u2013'' [[Gearbox Publishing]] appealed the game's RC rating on behalf of [[Compulsion Games]] and won, obtaining an R18+. The board found that the use of drugs in the game do not relate to incentives or rewards. The game's Lightbearer DLC was banned in August 2019 for drug use relating to incentives and rewards; Gearbox has yet to appeal the DLC's ban.\n\n===2017===\n*'''''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]''''' \u2013 [[StudioCanal]] successfully lowered the film's rating from R18+ to MA15+. The main reason being that the most graphic images were dimly lit and only fleetingly seen.\n*'''''[[Split (2017 film)|Split]]''''' \u2013 ''Consumers of Mental Health WA'' failed to appeal the film's M rating for an MA15+ because the content and complex mental illness theme was judged to be only moderate in impact and justified by context.\n\n===2016===\n*'''''[[Embrace (film)|Embrace]]''''' - Dropped from MA15+ to M as the detailed depictions of nudity had an educational context.\n*'''''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]''''' - Failed to lower its MA15+ rating due a strong sense of menace throughout.\n*'''''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'''''  - Dropped from M to PG as the violence lacked blood, injury or depictions of dead bodies.\n*'''''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'''''  - Dropped from MA15+ to M due the lack of depiction involving serious bodily harm.\n\n===2015===\n*'''''[[Blinky Bill the Movie]]''''' - Dropped from PG to G to due the themes being of a very low threat of menace.\n*'''''[[Boychoir (film)|Boychoir]]''''' - Dropped from PG to G due to the car crash scene lacking injury detail.\n\n===2014===\n*'''''[[Blended (film)|Blended]]''''' - Dropped from M to PG due to the sexual references being discreetly implied.\n\n===2013===\n*Australian Attorney-General George Brandis tried to appeal the MA15+ rating of 12 video games, believing they should be upgraded to R18+ due to being given adult ratings in other countries. The appeal failed and every single game kept their MA15+ rating.\n*'''''[[American Hustle]]''''' - Dropped from MA15+ to M as the elements of aggressive coarse language were infrequent.\n*'''''[[Behind the Candelabra]]''''' - Dropped from MA15+ to M as the film's depiction of drug use dealt with the consequences of addiction and the sex scenes were discreet.\n*'''''[[Children's Island (film)|Children's Island]]''''' - The [[Australian Federal Police]] successfully appealed the film's R18+, banning it due to child pornography concerns.\n*'''''[[Inside Llewyn Davis]]''''' - Dropped from MA15+ to M as the elements of aggressive course course language were infrequent.\n*'''''[[Rampage (2009 film)|Rampage (2009)]]''''' - Australian Attorney-General George Brandis tried to appeal the film's MA15+ rating but failed as despite the frequent scenes of strong violence, the film never glorified its depiction of violent content.\n*'''''[[Saints Row IV]]''''' - Failed to appeal RC rating due to interactive drug use related to incentives and rewards. The game was passed as an MA15+ a few years later when it was re-released alongside the [[Saints Row: Gat out of Hell|Gat Out of Hell]] expansion.\n\n===2012===\n*'''''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''''' \u2013 Originally classified MA15+ for strong sci-fi violence specifically the birth scene, it was later downgraded to an M classification due to said scene being mitigated by a medical context.\n===2011===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/InformationCentre_MediaReleases_2011MediaReleases</ref>\n*'''''[[The House of the Dead: Overkill|The House of the Dead: Overkill \u2013 Extended Cut]]''''' \u2013 Sega successfully appealed its ban for an MA15+ on the basis that the over-the-top violence mitigated the impact.\n*'''''[[We Dare]]''''' \u2013 Federal Attorney-General [[Brendan O'Connor (politician)|Brendan O'Connor]] failed to appeal the game's rating and thus stuck with its PG rating on the basis that the sexual references were only mild in impact.\n*'''''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]''''' \u2013 Warner Bros. failed its appeal to attain an MA15+ rating due to violence being of a high degree; this was due to the lack of an R18+ for video games at the time, hence the game was subsequently refused classification for a second time. Has since been re-rated R18+ uncut after said rating's introduction.\n*'''''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1]]''''' Originally received an MA15+ classification due to the strong themes involving an intense birth scene. It was later downgraded to an M rating due to the fantasy nature of the themes.\n\n===2010===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_reviewBoarddecisions-2010</ref>\n*'''''[[The Karate Kid (2010 film)|The Karate Kid]]''''' \u2013 Lowered its M rating to a PG due to the consensus being that the violence was not detailed and was relatively infrequent within the narrative.\n*'''''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom|Salo]]''''' \u2013 Federal Attorney-General Brendan O'Conner tried to appeal its R18+ rating. It was originally banned since 1997 but was recently re-rated by the classification board. The film was again awarded an R18+ rating due to the additional three hours of extras which give context to the film, the same reason as the classification board.\n\n===2009===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoarddecisions-2009</ref>\n*'''''[[Alien vs Predator]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its RC rating and won, attaining an MA15+. The reason they deemed it as suitable for 15-year-olds is its science fiction context and how the mutilations were randomly generated and the player had no control over it.\n*'''''[[Charlie Wilson's War (film)|Charlie Wilson's War]]''''' \u2013 Bob Debus, the Minister for Home Affairs at the time, appealed the M rating of the film as he thought the nudity should have given the film a higher and restricted MA15+. He failed and the film retained the same rating of M, though with the added consumer advice of 'partial nudity'.\n*'''''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th (2009 remake)]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its R18+ rating but lost due to how the violence frequently dwells on detail.\n*'''Hydrolord the Game''' (board game) \u2013 Bob Debus, the Minister for Home Affairs at the time, tried to appeal the M rating of this board game to cause it to receive a restricted rating of 'Category 1 18+' due to drug references, the board found that the drug references were very discreet thus awarding it the same rating of M.\n*'''''[[Julie & Julia]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its M rating and won in which it was re-rated PG for 'Infrequent coarse language'. It won the appeal as the word \"fuck\" was used briefly and can easily be missed and is used in context to calm another character down.\n*'''''[[Left 4 Dead 2]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its RC rating but lost. This was due to the relentlessly graphic and detailed depictions of violence and gore throughout the game and thus could not be accommodated at the MA15+ rating. The game later received an R18+ classification.\n*'''''[[The Loved Ones (film)|The Loved Ones]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its R18+ and won, it was then re-rated MA15+. This was due to that the most violent scenes generally had a dark comedic overtone to it thus reducing the impact.\n*'''''[[Stone Bros.]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its MA15+ but failed. This was due to how, despite the film showing negative effects on drugs, there are certain scenes explicitly detailing how to actually form them.\n\n===2008===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_Boarddecisions-2008</ref>\n*'''''[[F.E.A.R. 2]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its RC rating and was awarded with a MA15+. The board found that the violence was expected in its genre and the most violent events occurred without player control.\n*'''''[[Open Season 2]]''''' \u2013 Appealed its PG rating but failed as the violence was a bit too intense for younger viewers.\n*'''''[[Space Chimps]]''''' \u2013 Successfully appealed its PG rating and won its G rating as the comedic overtone lessened the impact to young children.\n\n===2007===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoardDecisions-2007</ref>\n*'''''[[300 (film)|300]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal and its R18+ was downgraded to a MA15+ due to how unrealistic the CGI effects were causing all the violence to be highly stylized.\n*'''''[[30 days of night (film)|30 Days of Night]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal and was awarded an MA15+ rating over its previous R18+. The reason was that it took place in a clear fantasy environment and that the vampires bled black blood lessening the impact.\n*'''''[[Notes on a Scandal (film)|Notes on a Scandal]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal and stayed with its MA15+ rating due to how sensitive the public is to sex with a minor even with the film's implied sex scenes.\n*'''''[[Sleuth (2007 film)|Sleuth]]''''' (remake) \u2013 Successfully appealed its MA15+ rating for an M rating. The board found that the two uses of 'cunt' was, while aggressive, still infrequent.\n*'''''[[Saw IV]]''''' \u2013 Was originally rated R18+ due to the violent/sadistic content and graphic bloodshed. It was decreased to MA15+ based on the content being similar to the previous installments, which were rated MA15+. The notable scenes were the eye gouging, autopsy scene, hair scalping scene and hammer bashing scenes.\n*[[Sea Patrol (season 1)|'''''Sea Patrol'' (season 1)''']] \u2013 Lost its appeal and stayed with its M rating due to certain scenes dwelling on detail of blood.\n\n===2006===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoarddecisions-2006</ref>\n*'''''[[Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]''''' \u2013 Federal Attorney-General Phil Ruddock  applied to appeal the MA15+ of the rating to force into the RC (banned) territory. He succeeded and banned the game as the board noted that while all the violence, coarse language and drug references may be accommodated within the MA15+ category, the theme proved to be high impact due to the glorification of graffiti.\n*'''''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal of the M rating due to violence being too frequent to fit within the PG classification.\n*'''''[[Stormbreaker (film)|Stormbreaker]]''''' \u2013 As with ''Eragon'', lost its appeal of the M rating due to the frequency of the violence.\n*'''''[[River Queen]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal for lowering its MA15+ rating for an M rating. This was due to the historical context of the film mitigating the impact.\n*'''''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal due to the dark nature of the film being deemed too impactful to fit into the PG category.\n*'''''[[Big Momma's House 2]]''''' \u2013 Won  its appeal to lower its M rating into a PG rating. This was due to the overall comedic tone lessening the impact of the violence.\n\nAll appeals before 2006 were done when the review board was not owned by the Attorney-general's department but instead when it was overlooked by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC).\n\n===2005===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoarddecisions-2005</ref>\n*'''''[[50 Cent Bulletproof]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal to drop its RC banning due to the frequent detailed violence.\n*'''''[[A History of Violence]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal for a MA15+ rating as while the violence was very detailed and realistic, it was infrequent within the film.\n*'''''[[Mysterious Skin]]''''' \u2013 Attorney-general Phil Ruddock once again tried to get another film banned. He failed due to how the film does not glorify sexual abuse of children.\n*'''''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal for an M rating due to the historical context of the film mitigating the impact.\n*'''''[[Wolf Creek (film)|Wolf Creek]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal and stayed as an R18+ due to how realistic and frequent the violence is.\n*'''''[[Wedding Crashers]]''''' \u2013 Was awarded a downgrade to an M rating due to the sexual references being while frequent, only moderate in impact.\n*'''''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]''''' \u2013 Was awarded an M rating, down from its MA15+ due to how the violence was generally undetailed and stylised.\n*'''''[[Guess Who (film)|Guess Who]]''''' \u2013 Lost its appeal and stayed with its M rating due to how frequent the sexual references are.\n*'''''[[9 Songs]]''''' \u2013  Won its appeal for an R18+, it was originally given an X18+ but due to a technicality in the guidelines of how even fetishes are not allowed in the X18+ category, something which the classification board overlooked, they awarded it an R18+ based upon artistic merit.\n*'''''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal for a PG rating due to how highly stylised the violence was.\n\n===2002===\n<ref>http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/classification.nsf/Page/ClassificationinAustralia_Whoweare_ClassificationReviewBoardDecisions_ReviewBoarddecisions-2002</ref>\n*'''''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]''''' \u2013 Won its appeal for a G rating due to there being a low sense of threat for children.\n*'''''[[Baise-Moi]]''''' \u2013 The General-attorney succeeded in appealing its R18+ rating.

The 38th depression, 9th typhoon and 3rd super typhoon of the [[2019 Pacific typhoon season]], it was the strongest typhoon in decades to strike mainland Japan; and one of the largest typhoons ever recorded at a peak diameter of 825 nautical miles (950&nbsp;mi; 1529&nbsp;km) It was also the costliest Pacific typhoon on record, surpassing [[Typhoon Mireille]]'s record by more than US$5 billion (when not adjusted for inflation).<ref>http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Realtime/index.php?loc=northwestpacific</ref>\n\nHagibis developed from a tropical wave located a couple hundred miles north of the [[Marshall Islands]] on October 2, 2019. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a red tropical cyclone formation alert - noting that the disturbance could undergo rapid intensification upon being identified as a tropical depression. On the next day, October 3, both the Japanese Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 20W. The depression stayed at the same intensity as it travelled west toward the Mariana Islands on October 4, but on October 5, 20W began undergoing [[rapid intensification]] and early that day, the system was issued with the name \"Hagibis\" by the JMA, which means speed in Filipino. Sea surface temperatures and wind shear became extremely favourable for tropical cyclogenesis and Hagibis underwent [[explosive intensification]] on October 6, and became a category 5 super typhoon in under 12 hours - the second of the [[2019 Pacific typhoon season]]. Edging closer to the uninhabited areas of the Mariana Islands, Hagibis displayed excellent convection as well as a well defined circulation. The system developed a pinhole [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] and made landfall on the Northern Mariana Islands, at peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph) and a central pressure of 915 [[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] (27.02 [[Inch of mercury|inHg]]). {{citation needed|date= December 2019}}\n\nLand interaction did not affect Hagibis too much, but as the system continued to mature, it underwent an [[eyewall replacement cycle]], which is usual for all tropical cyclones of a similar intensity. The inner eyewall was robbed of its needed moisture and Hagibis began to weaken, but it formed a large and cloud-filled eye, which then became clear and it reached its second peak. Travelling toward Japan, Hagibis encountered high vertical wind shear and its inner eyewall began to degrade, and the outer eyewalls rapidly eroded as its center began to be exposed. On October 12, Hagibis made landfall on Japan at 19:00 p.m JST (10:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the [[Izu Peninsula]] near [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]].  Then, an hour later at 20:00 p.m. JST, (11:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), Hagibis made its second landfall on Japan in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. Wind shear was now at 60 knots (69&nbsp;mph; 111&nbsp;km/h), and Hagibis' structure became torn apart as it sped at 34 knots (39&nbsp;mph; 63&nbsp;km/h) north-northeast toward more hostile conditions. On October 13, Hagibis became an [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] low and the JMA and JTWC issued their final advisories on the system. Hagibis caused catastrophic destruction across much of eastern Japan. A large tornado also struck the [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara area]] of [[Chiba Prefecture]].<ref name=\"earthquake nyt\">{{cite web |last1=Motoko |first1=Rich |title=Typhoon Hagibis Slams Into Japan, After Landslides, Floods and a Quake |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/world/asia/typhoon-hagibis.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=12 October 2019 |date=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Hagibis 2019 track.png}}\nIn early October, a poorly-organized and broad area of storms persisted over {{cvt|1500|km}} east of [[Guam]].

The 38th depression, 9th typhoon and 3rd super typhoon of the [[2019 Pacific typhoon season]], it was the strongest typhoon in decades to strike mainland Japan; and one of the largest typhoons ever recorded at a peak diameter of 825 nautical miles (950&nbsp;mi; 1529&nbsp;km) It was also the costliest Pacific typhoon on record, surpassing [[Typhoon Mireille]]'s record by more than US$5 billion (when not adjusted for inflation).<ref>http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Realtime/index.php?loc=northwestpacific</ref>\n\nHagibis developed from a tropical wave located a couple hundred miles north of the [[Marshall Islands]] on October 2. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a red tropical cyclone formation alert - noting that the disturbance could undergo rapid intensification upon being identified as a tropical depression. On the next day, October 3, both the Japanese Meteorological Agency and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 20W. The depression stayed at the same intensity as it travelled west toward the Mariana Islands on October 4, but on October 5, 20W began undergoing [[rapid intensification]] and early that day, the system was issued with the name \"Hagibis\" by the JMA, which means speed in Filipino. Sea surface temperatures and wind shear became extremely favourable for tropical cyclogenesis and Hagibis underwent [[explosive intensification]] on October 6, and became a category 5 super typhoon in under 12 hours - the second of the [[2019 Pacific typhoon season]]. Edging closer to the uninhabited areas of the Mariana Islands, Hagibis displayed excellent convection as well as a well defined circulation. The system developed a pinhole [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] and made landfall on the Northern Mariana Islands, at peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph) and a central pressure of 915 [[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] (27.02 [[Inch of mercury|inHg]]). {{citation needed|date= December 2019}}\n\nLand interaction did not affect Hagibis too much, but as the system continued to mature, it underwent an [[eyewall replacement cycle]], which is usual for all tropical cyclones of a similar intensity. The inner eyewall was robbed of its needed moisture and Hagibis began to weaken, but it formed a large and cloud-filled eye, which then became clear and it reached its second peak. Travelling toward Japan, Hagibis encountered high vertical wind shear and its inner eyewall began to degrade, and the outer eyewalls rapidly eroded as its center began to be exposed. On October 12, Hagibis made landfall on Japan at 19:00 p.m JST (10:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the [[Izu Peninsula]] near [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]].  Then, an hour later at 20:00 p.m. JST, (11:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), Hagibis made its second landfall on Japan in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. Wind shear was now at 60 knots (69&nbsp;mph; 111&nbsp;km/h), and Hagibis' structure became torn apart as it sped at 34 knots (39&nbsp;mph; 63&nbsp;km/h) north-northeast toward more hostile conditions. On October 13, Hagibis became an [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] low and the JMA and JTWC issued their final advisories on the system. Hagibis caused catastrophic destruction across much of eastern Japan. A large tornado also struck the [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara area]] of [[Chiba Prefecture]].<ref name=\"earthquake nyt\">{{cite web |last1=Motoko |first1=Rich |title=Typhoon Hagibis Slams Into Japan, After Landslides, Floods and a Quake |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/world/asia/typhoon-hagibis.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=12 October 2019 |date=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Hagibis 2019 track.png}}\nIn early October, a poorly-organized and broad area of storms persisted over {{cvt|1500|km}} east of [[Guam]].

Mild strengthening was forecast shortly after Hagibis downgraded to a Category 3 typhoon, but that failed to occur as it neared land and its outer rainbands began to erode.\n\nAfter gradual weakening, Hagibis made landfall on [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]] as a Category 2 equivalent system, with 1-minute sustained winds of {{cvt|155|km/h}} at around 08:30&nbsp;UTC on 12&nbsp;October.

At the height of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], it was exceptionally vulnerable to any [[downturn]] in real estate values.\n\nThe bankruptcy triggered a one-day drop in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] of 4.5%, at the time, the largest decline since the [[September 11 attacks#Economic|September 11, 2001 attacks]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Subprime mortgage crisis}}\n\n===Rise of mortgage origination (1997\u20132006)===\nLehman was one of the first [[Wall Street]] firms to move into the business of [[mortgage origination]]. In 1997, Lehman bought Colorado-based lender Aurora Loan Services, an [[Alt-A]] lender. In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender [[BNC Mortgage LLC]]. Lehman quickly became a force in the [[subprime lending|subprime market]]. By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending.  By 2004, this number topped $40 billion.

From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. In such a highly leveraged structure, a three- to five-percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Exposure to the mortgage market===\nLehman borrowed significant amounts to fund its investing in the years leading to its bankruptcy in 2008, a process known as [[Leverage (finance)|leveraging]] or gearing. A significant portion of this investment was in housing-related assets, making it vulnerable to a downturn in that market. One measure of this risk-taking was its leverage ratio, a measure of the ratio of assets to owners equity, which increased from approximately 24:1 in 2003 to 31:1 by 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/d11MXs.t5Bb.htm#1stPage|title=Lehman 2007 Annual Report-See Item 6 on Page 29 for ratios|website=Secinfo.com|access-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref> While generating tremendous profits during the boom, this vulnerable position meant that just a 3\u20134% decline in the value of its assets would entirely eliminate its book value of equity.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robin Blackburn|url=http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=2715|title=Blackburn-The Subprime Crisis-New Left Review-March/April 2008|website=Newleftreview.org|access-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref> Investment banks such as Lehman were not subject to the same regulations applied to depository banks to restrict their risk-taking.<ref>{{cite news|last=Labaton|first=Stephen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html?em|title=NYT-Agency 04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up More Debt-October, 2008|work=The New York Times|date=October 2, 2008|access-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2007, Lehman closed its [[subprime lender]], BNC Mortgage, eliminating 1,200 positions in 23 locations, and took a $25-million after-tax charge and a $27-million reduction in [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]].

Lehman's loss resulted from having held onto large positions in subprime and other lower-rated mortgage [[tranche]]s when securitizing the underlying mortgages. Whether Lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds, or made a conscious decision to hold them, is unclear.  In any event, huge losses accrued in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities throughout 2008.  In the second fiscal quarter, Lehman reported losses of $2.8 billion and decided to raise $6 billion in additional capital by offering new shares.<ref name=\"nytimes-crisis\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/business/29wall.html?em|title=Struggling Lehman Plans to Lay Off 1,500|author=Jenny Anderson|author2=Eric Dash|work=The New York Times|date=August 29, 2008|access-date=August 29, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512034244/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/business/29wall.html?em|archive-date=May 12, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2008/06/09/lehman-raising-6-billion-in-capital-expects-2-8-billion-loss/|title=Lehman raising $6 billion in capital, expects $2.8 billion loss|author=|date=June 9, 2008|website=mercurynews.com}}</ref> In the first half of 2008 alone, Lehman stock lost 73% of its value as the credit market continued to tighten.<ref name=\"nytimes-crisis\"/> In August 2008, Lehman reported that it intended to release 6% of its work force, 1,500 people, just ahead of its third-quarter-reporting deadline in September.<ref name=\"nytimes-crisis\"/>\n\nOn August 22, 2008, shares in Lehman closed up 5% (16% for the week) on reports that the state-controlled [[Korea Development Bank]] was considering buying Lehman.<ref>New York Times, World Business, article by Jenny Anderson and Landon Thomas, August 22, 2008.</ref>  Most of those gains were quickly eroded as news emerged that Korea Development Bank was \"facing difficulties pleasing regulators and attracting partners for the deal\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid={9E9BDC4C-06D1-4EBD-971B-FCD4A4249F24}&siteid=yhoof2|title=Financials slip as Korea snags weigh on Lehman and Merrill \u2013 MarketWatch|publisher=Marketwatch.com|access-date=September 14, 2008}}</ref> It culminated on September 9, 2008, when Lehman's shares plunged 45% to $7.79, after it was reported that the state-run South Korean firm had put talks on hold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB5zn0q4MyPe4UpwVXIT03heWOEA|title=AFP: Lehman Brothers in freefall as hopes fade for new capital|publisher=Google|date=|access-date=September 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421002953/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB5zn0q4MyPe4UpwVXIT03heWOEA|archive-date=April 21, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nInvestor confidence continued to erode as Lehman's stock lost roughly half its value and pushed the [[S&P 500]] down 3.4% on September 9, 2008.

In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender [[BNC Mortgage LLC]]. Lehman quickly became a force in the [[subprime lending|subprime market]]. By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending.  By 2004, this number topped $40 billion.

Whether Lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds, or made a conscious decision to hold them, is unclear.  In any event, huge losses accrued in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities throughout 2008.

One Lehman executive described Hudson Castle as an \"alter ego\" of Lehman.

Just before his birth, his mother dreamed that she gave birth to a flaming torch. This dream was interpreted by the [[oracle|seer]] [[Aesacus]] as a foretelling of the downfall of Troy, and he declared that the child would be the ruin of his homeland.

Though Paris was indeed born before nightfall, he was spared by Priam. Hecuba was also unable to kill the child, despite the urging of the [[priest]]ess of [[Apollo]], one [[Sibyl|Herophile]]. Instead, Paris's father prevailed upon his chief herdsman, [[Agelaus]], to remove the child and kill him. The herdsman, unable to use a weapon against the infant, left him exposed on [[Mount Ida]], hoping he would perish there (cf. [[Oedipus]]). He was, however, suckled by a she-bear. Returning after nine days, Agelaus was astonished to find the child still alive and brought him home in a backpack ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''p\u1e17ra'', hence by [[folk etymology]] Paris\u2019s name) to rear as his own.

She was a [[nymph]] from Mount Ida in [[Phrygia]]. Her father was [[Cebren]], a [[river-god]] or, according to other sources, she was the daughter of [[Oeneus]]. She was skilled in the arts of [[prophecy]] and [[medicine]], which she had been taught by [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and [[Apollo]], respectively. When Paris later left her for Helen, she told him that if he ever was wounded, he should come to her, for she could heal any injury, even the most serious wounds.\n\nParis's chief distraction at this time was to pit Agelaus's [[bull]]s against one another. One bull began to win these bouts consistently. Paris began to set it against rival herdsmen's own prize bulls and it defeated them all. Finally, Paris offered a golden crown to any bull that could defeat his champion. [[Ares]] responded to this challenge by transforming himself into a bull and easily winning the contest. Paris gave the crown to Ares without hesitation. It was this apparent honesty in judgment that prompted the gods of [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Olympus]] to have Paris arbitrate the divine contest between [[Hera]], [[Aphrodite]], and [[Athena]].\n\n===Judgment of Paris===\n{{main|Judgement of Paris}}\n\n[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[El Juicio de Paris]]'' by [[Enrique Simonet]], c. 1904. Paris is studying Aphrodite, who is standing before him naked. The other two goddesses watch nearby.]]\n\nIn celebration of the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], Lord [[Zeus]], father of the [[Greek pantheon]], hosted a banquet on [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]].  Every deity and demi-god had been invited, except [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of strife (no one wanted a troublemaker at a wedding).  For revenge, Eris threw the golden [[Apple of Discord]] inscribed with \"[[apple of discord|t\u0113i kallist\u0113i]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"For the most beautiful\"&nbsp;\u2013 into the party, provoking a squabble among the attendant goddesses over for whom it had been meant.\n\nThe goddesses thought to be the most beautiful were [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]], and each one claimed the apple. They started a quarrel so they asked Zeus to choose one of them. Knowing that choosing any of them would bring him the hatred of the other two, Zeus did not want to take part in the decision. He thus appointed Paris to select the most beautiful.\n\n[[Image:Julgamento-de-p\u00e1ris.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Judgement of Paris]], [[Capodimonte porcelain]] ([[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]])]]\n\nEscorted by [[Hermes]], the three goddesses bathed in the spring of Mount Ida and approached Paris as he herded his cattle. Having been given permission by Zeus to set any conditions he saw fit, Paris required that the goddesses undress before him<ref>{{cite book|title=Myths and Legends|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|author=Neil Phillip}}</ref> (alternatively, the goddesses themselves chose to disrobe to show all their beauty). Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so the goddesses attempted to bribe him to choose among them. Hera offered ownership of all of Europe and Asia. Athena offered skill in battle, wisdom and the abilities of the greatest warriors. Aphrodite offered the love of the most beautiful woman on Earth: Helen of Sparta. Paris chose Aphrodite and therefore Helen.\n\nHelen was already married to King [[Menelaus]] of Sparta (a fact Aphrodite neglected to mention), so Paris had to raid Menelaus's house to steal Helen from him - according to some accounts, she fell in love with Paris and left willingly.\n\nThe Greeks' expedition to retrieve Helen from Paris in Troy is the mythological basis of the Trojan War. This triggered the war because Helen was famous for her beauty throughout [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]] (ancient Greece), and had many suitors of extraordinary ability. Therefore, following [[Odysseus]]'s advice, her father [[Tyndareus]] made all suitors promise to defend Helen's marriage to the man he chose for her.  When Paris took her to Troy, Menelaus invoked this oath.  Helen's other suitors&nbsp;\u2013 who between them represented the lion's share of Achaea's strength, wealth and military prowess&nbsp;\u2013 were obliged to help bring her back.  Thus, the whole of Greece moved against Troy in force and the [[Trojan War]] began.\n\n===Trojan War===\n[[File:The face that launched 1,000 ships.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Abduction of Helen'', ceiling fresco, Venetian, mid-18th century]]\n[[File:Helene Paris David.jpg|thumb|''The Love of Helen and Paris'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (oil on canvas, 1788, Louvre, Paris)]]\n\nHomer's ''[[Iliad]]'' casts Paris as unskilled and cowardly. Although Paris readily admits his shortcomings in battle, his brother [[Hector]] scolds and belittles him after he runs away from a duel with Menelaus that was to determine the end of the war.<ref>e.g., ''Iliad'', book 3, lines 38\u201357.</ref> His preference for bow and arrow emphasizes this, since he does not follow the code of honor shared by the other heroes.\n\nEarly in the epic, Paris and Menelaus duel in an attempt to end the war without further bloodshed.  Menelaus easily defeats Paris, though [[Aphrodite]] spirits him away before Menelaus can finish the duel. Paris is returned to his bedchambers, where Aphrodite forces Helen to be with him.<ref>''Iliad'', book 3, lines 340\u2013419.</ref>\n\nParis's second attempt at combat is equally fated: rather than engage the Greek hero [[Diomedes]] in hand-to-hand combat, Paris wounds Diomedes with an arrow through the foot.\n\nLater, after slaying Hector and other heroes, [[Achilles]] dies by an arrow of Paris with Apollo's help. According to Hyginus (Fabulae, 107) Apollo disguised himself as Paris.\n\nLater in the war, after [[Philoctetes]] mortally wounds Paris, Helen makes her way to [[Mount Ida]] where she begs Paris's first wife, the nymph [[Oenone]], to heal him. Still bitter that Paris had spurned her for his birthright in the city and then forgotten her for Helen, Oenone refuses. Helen returns alone to Troy, where Paris dies later the same day. In another version, Paris himself, in great pain, visits [[Oenone]] to plead for healing but is refused and dies on the mountainside. When Oenone hears of his funeral, she runs to his funeral pyre and throws herself in its fire.<ref>{{cite book |translator1=Way, A.S. |author=Quintus Smyrnaeus |title=The Fall of Troy |at=Book 10, 259\u2013489 |series=Loeb Classics |volume=19 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge MA |year=1913 |url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheOinone.html}}</ref>\n\nAfter Paris's death, his brother [[Deiphobus]] married Helen and was then killed by [[Menelaus]] in the sack of Troy.\n\n==Later treatments==\n[[Image:Statue of Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''Paris'', in \"[[Phrygian cap|Phrygian dress]]\", a second-century CE [[Roman sculpture|Roman marble]] (The King's Library, [[British Museum]])]]\n\n* [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Henri Meilhac]] and [[Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy]]'s 1864 operetta ''[[La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne]]'' tells a droll version of the seduction of Helen by Paris, who is the lead male role.\n* The 1951 Swedish film ''[[Sk\u00f6na Helena]]'' is an adapted version of Offenbach's operetta, starring [[Max Hansen (tenor)|Max Hansen]] and [[Eva Dahlbeck]].\n* In the 1956 film ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'', Paris, as the main character, is portrayed as a heroic character who at first worships peace and love but is later forced to take up arms against the treacherous Greeks.\n* In prose he appears as the main character in [[Rudolf Hagelstange]]'s 1959 book ''Spielball der G\u00f6tter'' (Game of Gods).\n* In the 1961 film ''[[Guerra di Troia|Trojan Horse]]'', Paris is played by [[Warner Bentivegna]].\n* In the 1962 film ''[[The Fury of Achilles]]'', Paris is played by [[Roberto Risso]].\n* The Judgment of Paris and its aftermath are the subject of [[Michael Tippett]]'s [[1962 in music|1962]] opera ''[[King Priam]]''.\n* In 1986 the song ''Crimes of Paris'' by [[Elvis Costello]] on his album [[Blood & Chocolate]] asks the question, \"Who'll pay for the Crimes of Paris, who's gonna pay for the Crimes of Paris?\"\n* In [[Aaron Allston]]'s 1993 novel ''[[Galatea in 2-D]]'', a painting of Paris, brought to life, is used against a painting of Achilles brought to life.\n* In the 2003 TV miniseries ''[[Helen of Troy (TV miniseries)|Helen of Troy]]'', the character Paris, played by actor [[Matthew Marsden]], is killed by [[Agamemnon]].\n* The story was also made into a 2003 musical, ''[[Paris (2003 musical)|Paris]]'', written by [[Jon English]] and [[David Mackay (producer)|David Mackay]].

It was this apparent honesty in judgment that prompted the gods of [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Olympus]] to have Paris arbitrate the divine contest between [[Hera]], [[Aphrodite]], and [[Athena]].\n\n===Judgment of Paris===\n{{main|Judgement of Paris}}\n\n[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[El Juicio de Paris]]'' by [[Enrique Simonet]], c. 1904. Paris is studying Aphrodite, who is standing before him naked. The other two goddesses watch nearby.]]\n\nIn celebration of the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], Lord [[Zeus]], father of the [[Greek pantheon]], hosted a banquet on [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]].  Every deity and demi-god had been invited, except [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of strife (no one wanted a troublemaker at a wedding).  For revenge, Eris threw the golden [[Apple of Discord]] inscribed with \"[[apple of discord|t\u0113i kallist\u0113i]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"For the most beautiful\"&nbsp;\u2013 into the party, provoking a squabble among the attendant goddesses over for whom it had been meant.\n\nThe goddesses thought to be the most beautiful were [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]], and each one claimed the apple. They started a quarrel so they asked Zeus to choose one of them. Knowing that choosing any of them would bring him the hatred of the other two, Zeus did not want to take part in the decision. He thus appointed Paris to select the most beautiful.\n\n[[Image:Julgamento-de-p\u00e1ris.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Judgement of Paris]], [[Capodimonte porcelain]] ([[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]])]]\n\nEscorted by [[Hermes]], the three goddesses bathed in the spring of Mount Ida and approached Paris as he herded his cattle. Having been given permission by Zeus to set any conditions he saw fit, Paris required that the goddesses undress before him<ref>{{cite book|title=Myths and Legends|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|author=Neil Phillip}}</ref> (alternatively, the goddesses themselves chose to disrobe to show all their beauty). Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so the goddesses attempted to bribe him to choose among them. Hera offered ownership of all of Europe and Asia. Athena offered skill in battle, wisdom and the abilities of the greatest warriors. Aphrodite offered the love of the most beautiful woman on Earth: Helen of Sparta. Paris chose Aphrodite and therefore Helen.\n\nHelen was already married to King [[Menelaus]] of Sparta (a fact Aphrodite neglected to mention), so Paris had to raid Menelaus's house to steal Helen from him - according to some accounts, she fell in love with Paris and left willingly.\n\nThe Greeks' expedition to retrieve Helen from Paris in Troy is the mythological basis of the Trojan War. This triggered the war because Helen was famous for her beauty throughout [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]] (ancient Greece), and had many suitors of extraordinary ability. Therefore, following [[Odysseus]]'s advice, her father [[Tyndareus]] made all suitors promise to defend Helen's marriage to the man he chose for her.  When Paris took her to Troy, Menelaus invoked this oath.  Helen's other suitors&nbsp;\u2013 who between them represented the lion's share of Achaea's strength, wealth and military prowess&nbsp;\u2013 were obliged to help bring her back.  Thus, the whole of Greece moved against Troy in force and the [[Trojan War]] began.\n\n===Trojan War===\n[[File:The face that launched 1,000 ships.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Abduction of Helen'', ceiling fresco, Venetian, mid-18th century]]\n[[File:Helene Paris David.jpg|thumb|''The Love of Helen and Paris'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (oil on canvas, 1788, Louvre, Paris)]]\n\nHomer's ''[[Iliad]]'' casts Paris as unskilled and cowardly. Although Paris readily admits his shortcomings in battle, his brother [[Hector]] scolds and belittles him after he runs away from a duel with Menelaus that was to determine the end of the war.<ref>e.g., ''Iliad'', book 3, lines 38\u201357.</ref> His preference for bow and arrow emphasizes this, since he does not follow the code of honor shared by the other heroes.\n\nEarly in the epic, Paris and Menelaus duel in an attempt to end the war without further bloodshed.  Menelaus easily defeats Paris, though [[Aphrodite]] spirits him away before Menelaus can finish the duel. Paris is returned to his bedchambers, where Aphrodite forces Helen to be with him.<ref>''Iliad'', book 3, lines 340\u2013419.</ref>\n\nParis's second attempt at combat is equally fated: rather than engage the Greek hero [[Diomedes]] in hand-to-hand combat, Paris wounds Diomedes with an arrow through the foot.\n\nLater, after slaying Hector and other heroes, [[Achilles]] dies by an arrow of Paris with Apollo's help. According to Hyginus (Fabulae, 107) Apollo disguised himself as Paris.\n\nLater in the war, after [[Philoctetes]] mortally wounds Paris, Helen makes her way to [[Mount Ida]] where she begs Paris's first wife, the nymph [[Oenone]], to heal him. Still bitter that Paris had spurned her for his birthright in the city and then forgotten her for Helen, Oenone refuses. Helen returns alone to Troy, where Paris dies later the same day. In another version, Paris himself, in great pain, visits [[Oenone]] to plead for healing but is refused and dies on the mountainside. When Oenone hears of his funeral, she runs to his funeral pyre and throws herself in its fire.<ref>{{cite book |translator1=Way, A.S. |author=Quintus Smyrnaeus |title=The Fall of Troy |at=Book 10, 259\u2013489 |series=Loeb Classics |volume=19 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge MA |year=1913 |url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheOinone.html}}</ref>\n\nAfter Paris's death, his brother [[Deiphobus]] married Helen and was then killed by [[Menelaus]] in the sack of Troy.\n\n==Later treatments==\n[[Image:Statue of Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''Paris'', in \"[[Phrygian cap|Phrygian dress]]\", a second-century CE [[Roman sculpture|Roman marble]] (The King's Library, [[British Museum]])]]\n\n* [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Henri Meilhac]] and [[Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy]]'s 1864 operetta ''[[La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne]]'' tells a droll version of the seduction of Helen by Paris, who is the lead male role.\n* The 1951 Swedish film ''[[Sk\u00f6na Helena]]'' is an adapted version of Offenbach's operetta, starring [[Max Hansen (tenor)|Max Hansen]] and [[Eva Dahlbeck]].\n* In the 1956 film ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'', Paris, as the main character, is portrayed as a heroic character who at first worships peace and love but is later forced to take up arms against the treacherous Greeks.\n* In prose he appears as the main character in [[Rudolf Hagelstange]]'s 1959 book ''Spielball der G\u00f6tter'' (Game of Gods).\n* In the 1961 film ''[[Guerra di Troia|Trojan Horse]]'', Paris is played by [[Warner Bentivegna]].\n* In the 1962 film ''[[The Fury of Achilles]]'', Paris is played by [[Roberto Risso]].\n* The Judgment of Paris and its aftermath are the subject of [[Michael Tippett]]'s [[1962 in music|1962]] opera ''[[King Priam]]''.\n* In 1986 the song ''Crimes of Paris'' by [[Elvis Costello]] on his album [[Blood & Chocolate]] asks the question, \"Who'll pay for the Crimes of Paris, who's gonna pay for the Crimes of Paris?\"\n* In [[Aaron Allston]]'s 1993 novel ''[[Galatea in 2-D]]'', a painting of Paris, brought to life, is used against a painting of Achilles brought to life.\n* In the 2003 TV miniseries ''[[Helen of Troy (TV miniseries)|Helen of Troy]]'', the character Paris, played by actor [[Matthew Marsden]], is killed by [[Agamemnon]].\n* The story was also made into a 2003 musical, ''[[Paris (2003 musical)|Paris]]'', written by [[Jon English]] and [[David Mackay (producer)|David Mackay]].
