It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Eckert released a shorter revised summary instead, and his (and therefore FIFA's) reluctance to publish the full report caused Garcia to resign in protest.<ref name=\"3BhYq\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame.

FIFA World Cup tournament.<ref name=\"fifa_20180316\" /><ref name=\"jkNow\" />\n\nVAR operations for all games are operating from a single headquarters in Moscow, which receives live video of the games and are in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems are in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens are used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact in several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15 June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, with this phenomenon being partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology has been both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Every city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia decreased the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government, and also in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was further reduced to 11 and number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, 3 (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) have been extensively renovated and the other 9 stadiums to be used are brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion has been spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter stated in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head Chris Unger visited St Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the Local Organising Committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues used, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium \u2013 the two largest stadiums in Russia \u2013 were used most, both hosting seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara all hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk all hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:Bel-Tun (26).jpg|thumb|Exterior of Otkrytie Arena in Moscow]]\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, 9 of the 12 stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other 3 were renovated for the tournament.<ref name=\"bVCgh\" />\n* Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.

football|football]] tournament contested by [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\nThe 22-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Z\u00fcrich]] on 2&nbsp;December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name=\"WFQKr\" /> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.<ref name=\"kKxiB\" />\n\nThe voting results were:<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2018 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n!rowspan=2|Bidders\n!colspan=2|Votes\n|-\n!Round 1\n!Round 2\n|-\n|'''Russia'''\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|9\n|{{yes|13}}\n|-\n|Portugal / Spain\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|-\n|Belgium / Netherlands\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|-\n|England\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|{{no result|Eliminated}}\n|}\n\n===Criticism===\nThe English [[Football Association]] (FA) and others raised concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members. They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref name=\"sRBCC\" /> The 2014 [[Garcia Report]], an internal investigation led by [[Michael J. Garcia]], was withheld from public release by [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]], FIFA's head of adjudication on ethical matters. Eckert released a shorter revised summary instead, and his (and therefore FIFA's) reluctance to publish the full report caused Garcia to resign in protest.<ref name=\"3BhYq\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. [[Greg Dyke]] called for a re-examination of the affair and [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] called for a boycott of the World Cup.<ref name=\"zt9ZM\" /><ref name=\"2xMiJ\" />\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations\u2014the 209 [[List of FIFA Member Associations|FIFA member associations]] except automatically qualified hosts Russia\u2014applied to enter the qualifying process.<ref name=\"riaYh\" /> [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] were later disqualified before playing their first matches,<ref name=\"zimbabwe\" /><ref name=\"indonesia\" /> while [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], who joined FIFA on 13&nbsp;May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.<ref name=\"k8fRX\" /> Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.<ref name=\"fifa20150320\" /><ref name=\"hstri\" /> The first qualification game, between [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] and [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]], began in [[Dili]] on 12&nbsp;March 2015 as part of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC's qualification]],<ref name=\"45Ip9\" /> and the main qualifying draw took place at the [[Konstantinovsky Palace]] in [[Strelna]], [[Saint Petersburg]], on 25&nbsp;July 2015.<ref name=\"L1urj\" /><ref name=\"crlmz\" /><ref name=\"lzli9\" /><ref name=\"press release\" />\n\nOf the 32&nbsp;nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20&nbsp;countries competed at the previous tournament in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|smallest country in terms of population]] to reach the World Cup.<ref name=\"oGTMb\" /> Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.

(VARs) into the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]], on 16 March 2018, the [[FIFA Council]] took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.<ref name=\"fifa_20180316\" /><ref name=\"jkNow\" />\n\nVAR operations for all games are operating from a single headquarters in Moscow, which receives live video of the games and are in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems are in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens are used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact in several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15 June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, with this phenomenon being partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology has been both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Every city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia decreased the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government, and also in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was further reduced to 11 and number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, 3 (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) have been extensively renovated and the other 9 stadiums to be used are brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion has been spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter stated in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head Chris Unger visited St Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the Local Organising Committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues used, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium \u2013 the two largest stadiums in Russia \u2013 were used most, both hosting seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara all hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.

The construction officially started on 21 July 2014. The project was completed on 21 April 2018.\n* Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new). The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main arena of Volgograd was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.

Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7 June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n===Response to Skripal poisoning===\nIn response to the March 2018 [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]], British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.<ref name=\"AypwF\" /> Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.<ref name=\"1CS7B\" /> Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\".<ref name=\"aXQLQ\" /> The [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] denounced [[Boris Johnson]]'s statements that compared the event to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] held in [[Nazi Germany]] as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism]]\".<ref name=\"0aw0J\" />\n\nThe British [[Foreign Office]] and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\".<ref name=\"qKSXy\" /><ref name=\"WNLwc\" /> English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.<ref name=\"sOFhm\" /><ref name=\"XWjIW\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony (2018-06-14) 11.jpg|thumb|Russia received widespread praise as World Cup hosts.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

Through job analysis, the analyst needs to understand what the important tasks of the job are, how they are carried out, and the necessary human qualities needed to complete the job successfully.\n\nThe process of job analysis involves the analyst describing the duties of the incumbent, then the nature and conditions of work, and finally some basic qualifications. After this, the job analyst has completed a form called a ''job psychograph'', which displays the mental requirements of the job.<ref>Wilson, M. (2007). A history of job analysis. In L. Koppes, Historical perspectives in industrial and organizational psychology. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates</ref> The measure of a sound job analysis is a valid task list. This list contains the functional or duty areas of a position, the related tasks,  and the basic training recommendations. Subject matter experts (incumbents) and supervisors for the position being analyzed need to validate this final list in order to validate the job analysis.<ref name=\"Hartley, D.E. 1999\">Hartley, D.E. (1999). Job analysis at the speed of reality. Amherst, Mass.: HRD Press.</ref>\n\nJob analysis is crucial for first, helping individuals develop their careers, and also for helping organizations develop their employees in order to maximize talent. The outcomes of job analysis are key influences in designing learning, developing performance interventions, and improving processes.<ref>Franklin, M. (2005). Guide to Job Analysis. American Society for Training and Development.</ref> The application of job analysis techniques makes the implicit assumption that information about a job as it presently exists may be used to develop programs to recruit, select, train, and appraise people for the job as it will exist in the future.<ref>Schneider, B. and Konz, A. M. (1989), Strategic job analysis. Hum. Resour. Manage., 28: 51\u201363.</ref>\n\nJob analysts are typically industrial-organizational (I-O) psychologists or human resource officers who have been trained by, and are acting under the supervision of an I-O psychologist. One of the first I-O psychologists to introduce job analysis was [[Morris Viteles]]. In 1922, he used job analysis in order to select employees for a trolley car company. Viteles' techniques could then be applied to any other area of employment using the same process.<ref>Viteles, M.S. (1922). Job specifications and diagnostic tests of job competency designed for the auditing division of a street railway company. Psychological Clinic. 14, 83-105.</ref>\n\nJob analysis was also conceptualized by two of the founders of I-O psychology, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] in the early 20th century.[1] Since then, experts have presented many different systems to accomplish job analysis that have become increasingly detailed over the decades. However, evidence shows that the root purpose of job analysis, understanding the behavioral requirements of work, has not changed in over 85 years.<ref name=\"Wilson, M. 2007\">Wilson, M. (2007). A history of job analysis. In L. Koppes, Historical perspectives in industrial and organizational psychology. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nOne of the main  purposes of conducting job analysis is to prepare [[job description]]s and [[job specification]]s which in turn helps hire the right quality of workforce into an organization. The general purpose of job analysis is to document the requirements of a job and the work performed.  Job and [[task analysis]] is performed as a basis for later improvements, including: definition of a job domain; description of a job; development of [[performance appraisal]]s, [[personnel selection]], selection systems, promotion criteria, training needs assessment, legal defense of selection processes, and compensation plans.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite web|url= http://esrccoi.group.shef.ac.uk/pdf/whatis/job_analysis.pdf|title= What is Job Analysis?|author= Robinson, M.|publisher= Institute of Work Psychology|accessdate= April 18, 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061007131458/http://esrccoi.group.shef.ac.uk/pdf/whatis/job_analysis.pdf|archivedate= October 7, 2006}}</ref> The human performance improvement industry uses job analysis to make sure training and development activities are focused and effective.<ref name=\"Hartley, D.E. 1999\"/> In the fields of [[human resources]] (HR) and [[industrial psychology]], job analysis is often used to gather information for use in personnel selection, training, classification, and/or compensation.<ref name=\"Cascio\">Cascio, W. F., & Aguinis, H. (2005).  Applied Psychology in Human Resource Management</ref>\n\nIndustrial psychologists use job analysis to determine the physical requirements of a job to determine whether an individual who has suffered some diminished capacity is capable of performing the job with, or without, some accommodation. Edwin Flieshman, Ph.D. is credited with determining the underlying factors of human physical fitness.<ref name=Fleishman>Fleishman, E.A. (1964). The Structure and Measurement of Physical Fitness</ref> Professionals developing [[certification]] [[exams]] use job analysis (often called something slightly different, such as \"task analysis\" or \"work analysis\") to determine the elements of the domain which must be sampled in order to create a content valid exam. When a job analysis is conducted for the purpose of valuing the job (i.e., determining the appropriate compensation for incumbents) this is called \"job evaluation.\"\n\nJob analysis aims to answer questions such as:\n\n* Why does the job exist?\n* What physical and mental activities does the worker undertake?\n* When is the job to be performed?\n* Where is the job to be performed?\n* Under What conditions it is to be performed?\n\n==Procedures==\nAs stated before, the purpose of job analysis is to combine the task demands of a job with our knowledge of human attributes and produce a theory of behavior for the job in question. There are two ways to approach building that theory, meaning there are two different approaches to job analysis.<ref name=\"Brannick, M.T. 2007\">Brannick, M.T., Levine, E.L., & Morgeson, F.P. (2007). Job and work analysis: methods, research and applications for human resource management (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref>\n\n===Task-oriented===\nTask-oriented procedures focus on the actual activities involved in performing work.<ref name=\"Robinson\"/> This procedure takes into consideration work duties, responsibilities, and functions. The job analyst then develops task statements which clearly state the tasks that are performed with great detail. After creating task statements, job analysts rate the tasks on scales indicating importance, difficulty, frequency, and consequences of error. Based on these ratings, a greater sense of understanding of a job can be attained.<ref name=\"Muchinsky\">{{cite book |title= Psychology Applied to Work |last= Muchinsky |first= Paul M. |year= 2012 |publisher= Hypergraphic Press, Inc. |location= Summerfield, NC |isbn= 978-0-578-07692-8}}</ref> [[Task analysis]], such as cognitively oriented task analysis (COTA), are techniques used to describe job expertise. For example, the job analysts may tour the job site and observe workers performing their jobs. During the tour the analyst may collect materials that directly or indirectly indicate required skills (duty statements, instructions, safety manuals, quality charts, etc.).<ref name=\"Cascio\"/>\n\n[[Functional job analysis]] (FJA)<ref name=\"Schmitt\">{{cite journal |last1= Schmitt|first1= N.|last2= Fine|first2= S. A.|year= 1983|title= Inter-Rater Reliability of Judgements of Functional Levels and Skill Requirements of Jobs Based on Written Task Statements|journal= Journal of Occupational Psychology|volume= 56|issue= 2|pages= 121\u2013127|doi= 10.1111/j.2044-8325.1983.tb00119.x}}<!--|accessdate= April 18, 2012--></ref> is a classic example of a task-oriented technique. Developed by Fine and Cronshaw in 1944, work elements are scored in terms of relatedness to data (0\u20136), people (0\u20138), and things (0\u20136), with lower scores representing greater complexity. Incumbents, considered [[Subject-matter expert|subject matter experts]] (SMEs), are relied upon, usually in a panel, to report elements of their work to the job analyst. Using incumbent reports, the analyst uses Fine's terminology to compile statements reflecting the work being performed in terms of data, people, and things. The [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]] uses elements of the FJA in defining jobs.<ref name=\"Muchinsky\"/>\n\n===Worker-oriented===\nWorker-oriented procedures aim to examine the human attributes needed to perform the job successfully.<ref name=\"Robinson\"/> These human attributes have been commonly classified into four categories: ''knowledge'', ''skills'', ''abilities'', and ''other characteristics'' (KSAO). ''Knowledge'' is the information people need in order to perform the job. ''Skills'' are the proficiencies needed to perform each task. ''Abilities'' are the attributes that are relatively stable over time. ''Other characteristics'' are all other attributes, usually personality factors.<ref name=\"Muchinsky\"/> The KSAOs required for a job are inferred from the most frequently-occurring, important tasks. In a worker-oriented job analysis, the skills are inferred from tasks and the skills are rated directly in terms of importance of frequency. This often results in data that immediately imply the important KSAOs. However, it can be hard for SMEs to rate skills directly.\n\nThe Fleishman Job Analysis System (F-JAS) developed by [[Edwin A. Fleishman]] represents a worker-oriented approach. Fleishman factor-analyzed large data sets to discover a common, minimum set of KSAOs across different jobs. His system of 73 specific scales measure three broad areas: Cognitive (Verbal Abilities; Idea Generation & Reasoning Abilities; Quantitative Abilities; Memory; Perceptual Abilities; Spatial Abilities; and Attentiveness), Psychomotor (Fine Manipulative Abilities; Control Movement Abilities; and Reaction Time and Speed Abilities), and Physical (Physical Strength Abilities; Endurance; Flexibility, Balance, and Coordination; Visual Abilities; and Auditory and Speech Abilities).\n\nJobScan is a measurement instrument which defines the personality dynamics within a specific type of job.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vtc-ted.org/documents/JobScan.pdf|title= People Fitting Positions|accessdate= April 18, 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061006092848/http://www.vtc-ted.org/documents/JobScan.pdf|archivedate= October 6, 2006}}</ref> By collecting PDP [[ProScan Survey]] results of actual performers and results of job dynamics analysis surveys completed by knowledgeable people related to a specific job, JobScan provides a suggested ideal job model for that position. Although it does not evaluate the intellect or experience necessary to accomplish a task, it does deal with the personality of the type of work itself.\n\n==Example==\nFor the job of a snow-cat operator at a ski slope, a work or task-oriented job analysis might include this statement:\nOperates Bombardier Sno-cat, usually at night, to smooth out snow rutted by skiers and snowboard riders and new snow that has fallen.\nOn the other hand, a worker-oriented job analysis might include this statement:\nEvaluates terrain, snow depth, and snow condition and chooses the correct setting for the depth of the snow cat, as well as the number of passes necessary on a given ski slope.<ref name=\"Brannick, M.T. 2007\"/>\n\nJob analysis methods have evolved using both task-oriented and worker-oriented approaches. Since the end result of both approaches is a statement of KSAOs, neither can be considered the \"correct\" way to conduct job analysis. Because worker-oriented job analyses tend to provide more generalized human behavior and behavior patterns and are less tied to the technological parts of a job, they produce data more useful for developing training programs and giving feed back to employees in the form of performance appraisal information. Also, the volatility that exists in the typical workplace of today can make specific task statements less valuable in isolation. For these reasons, employers are significantly more likely to use worker-oriented approaches to job analysis today than they were in the past.<ref name=\"Brannick, M.T. 2007\"/>\n\n==Knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics (KSAOs)==\nRegardless of which approach to job analysis is taken, the next step in the process is to identify the attributes\u2014the KSAOs that an incumbent needs for either performing the tasks at hand or executing the human behaviors described in the job analysis.<ref name=\"Peterson, N.G. 1999\">Peterson, N.G., Mumford, M.D., Borman, W.C., Jeanneret, P.R., & Fleishman, E.A. (Eds.) (1999). An occupational information system for the 21st century. Washington, D.C: American Psychological Association.</ref>\n* '''Knowledge''': \"A collection of discrete but related facts and information about a particular domain...acquired through formal education or training, or accumulated through specific experiences.\"\n* '''Skill''': \"A practiced act\".\n* '''Ability''': \"The stable capacity to engage in a specific behavior\"\n* '''Other characteristics''': \"Personality variables, interests, training, and experiences\" <ref name=\"Peterson, N.G. 1999\"/>\n\nFinally, once the appropriate KSAOs are identified, tests and other assessment techniques can be chosen to measure those KSAOs.  Over the years, experts have presented several different systems and methods to accomplish job analysis. Many forms of systems are no longer in use, but those systems that still exist have become increasingly detailed over the decades with a greater concentration on tasks and less concentration on human attributes. That trend, however, has reversed in recent years for the better. Newer methods and systems have brought I-O psychology back to an examination of the ''behavioral'' aspects of work.<ref name=\"Wilson, M. 2007\"/>\n\nThere are several ways to conduct a job analysis, including: interviews with incumbents and supervisors, work methods of analysis can be laborious and time consuming, and there is always a tendency on the part of management to over analyze some jobs and under analyze some others. These traditional job analysis methods include: one-on-one interviewing; behavioral event interviews; phone interviews; surveys; work assessments; Developing a Curriculum (DACUM); job analysis worksheets; observations and procedural review.<ref>Hartley, D.E. (1999).</ref> Job analysis at the speed of reality. Amherst, Mass.: HRD Press. All of these methods can be used to gather information for job analysis. The DACUM process developed in the late 1960s has been viewed as the fastest method used, but it can still can take two or three days to obtain a validated task list.\n# '''Observation''': This was the first method of job analysis used by I-O psychologists. The process involves simply watching incumbents perform their jobs and taking notes. Sometimes they ask questions while watching, and commonly they even perform job tasks themselves. Near the end of World War II, Morris Viteles studied the job of navigator on a submarine. He attempted to steer the submarine toward Bermuda. After multiple misses by over 100 miles in one direction or another, one officer suggested that Viteles raise the periscope, look for clouds, and steer toward them since clouds tend to form above or near land masses. The vessel reached Bermuda shortly after that suggestion. The more jobs one seriously observes, the better one's understanding becomes of both the jobs in question and work in general.\n# '''Interviews''': It is essential to supplement observation by talking with incumbents. These interviews are most effective when structured with a specific set of questions based on observations, other analyses of the types of jobs in question, or prior discussions with human resources representatives, trainers, or managers knowledgeable about jobs.\n# '''Critical incidents and work diaries''': The critical incident technique asks subject matter experts to identify critical aspects of behavior or performance in a particular job that led to success or failure. For example, the supervisor of an electric utility repairman might report that in a very time-pressing project, the repairman failed to check a blueprint and as a result cut a line, causing a massive power loss. In fact, this is what happened in Los Angeles in September 2005 when half the city lost power over a period of 12 hours. The second method, a work diary, asks workers and/or supervisors to keep a log of activities over a prescribed period of time. They may be asked to simply write down what they were doing at 15 minutes after the hour for each hour of the work day. Or, they may list everything they have done up to a break.\n# '''Questionnaires and surveys''': Expert incumbents or supervisors often respond to questionnaires or surveys as a part of job analysis. These questionnaires include task statements in the form of worker behaviors. Subject matter experts are asked to rate each statement form their experience on a number of different dimensions like importance to overall job success, frequency performance and whether the task must be performed on the first day of work or can be learned gradually on the job. Questionnaires also ask incumbents to rate the importance of KSAOs for performing tasks, and may ask the subject matter experts to rate work context. Unlike the results of observations and interviews, the questionnaire responses can be statistically analyzed to provide a more objective record of the components of the job. To a greater and greater extent, these questionnaires and surveys are being administered online to incumbents.\n# '''Position Analysis Questionnaire''': The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) is a well-known job analysis instrument. Although it is labeled a questionnaire, the PAQ is actually designed to be completed by a trained job analyst who interviews the SMEs (e.g., job incumbents and their supervisors).[2] The PAQ was designed to measure job component validity of attributes presented in aptitude tests. Job component validity is the relationship between test scores and skills required for good job performance. There are 195 behavior-related statements in the PAQ divided into six major sections: information input, mental process, work output, relationships with others, job context, and other job characteristics.\n#  '''Checklists''': Checklists are also used as a job analysis method, specifically with areas like the Air Force. In the checklist method, the incumbent checks the tasks he or she performs from a list of task statements that describe the job. The checklist is preceded by some sort of job analysis and is usually followed by the development of work activity compilations or job descriptions. The scope of task statements listed depends upon the judgment of the checklist constructor.<ref>Morsh, J. E. (1964), Job Analysis in the United States Air Force. Personnel Psychology, 17: 7\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Six steps==\n# Decide how to use the information since this will determine the data to collect and how to collect it. Some data collection techniques such as interviewing the employee and asking what the job entails are good for writing job descriptions and selecting employees for the job. Other techniques like the position analysis questionnaire do not provide qualitative information for job descriptions. Rather, they provide numerical ratings for each job and can be used to compare jobs for compensation purposes.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\">Premeaux, Shane R., Noe, Robert M., & Wayne, Mondy R. (2002). Human Resource Management (8th ed). Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall.</ref>\n# Review appropriate background information like organization charts, process charts, and job descriptions. ''Organization charts'' show the organization-wide work division, how the job in question relates to other jobs, and where the job fits in the overall organization. The chart should show the title of each position and, through connecting lines, show reports to whom and with whom the job incumbent communicates. A ''process chart'' provides a more detailed picture of the work flow. In its simplest, most organic form, a process chart shows the flow of inputs to and outputs from the job being analyzed. Finally, the existing job description (if there is one) usually provides a starting point for building the revised job description.\n# Select representative positions. This is because there may be too many similar jobs to analyze. For example, it is usually unnecessary to analyze jobs of 200 assembly workers when a sample of 10 jobs will be sufficient.\n# Actually analyze the job by collecting data on job activities, necessary employee behaviors and actions, working conditions, and human traits and abilities required to perform the job. For this step, one or more than one methods of job analysis may be needed\n# Verify the job analysis information with the worker performing the job and with his or her immediate supervisor. This will help confirm that the information is factually correct and complete. This review can also help gain the employee's acceptance of the job analysis data and conclusions by giving that person a chance to review and modify descriptions of the job activities.\n# Develop a job description and job specification. These are two tangible products of the job analysis process. The ''job description'' is a written statement that describes the activities and responsibilities of the job as well as its important features such as working conditions and safety hazards. The ''job specification'' summarizes the personal qualities, traits, skills, and background required for completing a certain job. These two may be completely separate or in the same document.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\n==Uses of information==\n# '''Recruitment and selection''': Job analysis provides information about what the job entails and what human characteristics are required in order to perform these activities. This information, in the form of job descriptions and specifications, helps management officials decide what sort of people they need to recruit and hire and select.\n# '''Compensation''': Job analysis information is crucial for estimating the value of each job and its appropriate compensation. Compensation (salary and bonus) usually depends on the job's required skill and education level, safety hazards, degree of responsibility, etc. -- all factors which can be assessed through job analysis. Also, many employers group jobs into classes. Job analysis provides the information to determine the relative worth of each job and its appropriate class.\n# '''Performance appraisal''': A performance appraisal compares each employee's actual performance with his or her performance standards. Managers use job analysis to determine the job's specific activities and performance standards.\n# '''Training''': The job description should show the activities and skills, and therefore training, that the job requires\n# '''Discovering unassigned duties''': Job Analysis can also help reveal unassigned duties. For example, a company's production manager says an employee is responsible for ten duties, such as production scheduling and raw material purchasing. Missing, however, is any reference to managing raw material inventories. On further study, it is revealed that none of the other manufacturing employees are responsible for inventory management, either. From review of other jobs like these, it is clear that someone should be managing raw material inventories. Therefore, an essential unassigned duty has been revealed.\n# '''EEO compliance''': Job analysis plays a large role in EEO compliance. United States Federal Agencies' Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection stipulate that job analysis is a necessary step in validating all major personnel activities. For example, employers must be able to show that their selection criteria and job performance are actually related. Doing this requires knowing what the job entails, which in turn requires job analysis.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n'''Additional purposes''': In addition to the 6 purposes above, Ash and Levine<ref>Ash, R. A., & Levine, E. L. (1980). A framework for evaluating job analysis methods. ''Personnel Psychology'', 57, 53-59</ref> listed determining KSAOs needed for promotion, determining [[workplace hazards]] to make jobs safer, job [[classification]], [[job description]], [[job design|designing the content of jobs]], and [[strategic human resource planning]].\n\n==Job Analysis at the Speed of Reality (JASR)==\nThe Job Analysis at the Speed of Reality (JASR) method for job analysis is a reliable, proven method to quickly create validated task lists. The end product, which can be used for many purposes, is the basis for many potential training opportunities. This method is a tested process that helps analysts complete a job analysis of a typical job with a group of subject matter experts and managers in two to three hours then deliver a validated task list.<ref>Hartley, D.E. (1999). Job analysis at the speed of reality. Amherst, Mass.: HRD Press. The JASR method of job analysis is based on four principles.</ref>\n# Job incumbents should know their jobs better than anyone else. They can provide accurate, timely content information about the job.\n# JASR participants want to spend a minimum amount of time providing job data during a session and business leadership wants to minimize disruption to business operations.\n# Since JASR participants do not spend as much time thinking about training as training professionals do, they do not require much orientation to the process.\n# JASR uses the quickest methods and best possible technology to complete the job analysis.<ref name=\"Hartley, D.E. 1999\"/>\n\n==Systems==\nFor many years, the U.S. Department of Labor published the [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]] (DOT), which was a comprehensive description of over 20,000 jobs. However, the Department replaced the DOT with O*NET online database, which includes all occupations from the DOT plus an additional 3,500. This makes O*NET very useful for job analysis.<ref>Bohlander, G., & Snell, S. (2009). Managing human resources. Independence: Cengage Learning.</ref>\n\nThe O*NET<ref>[http://online.onetcenter.org/ \"O*Net\"]</ref> (an online resource which has replaced the Dictionary of Occupational Titles) lists job requirements for a variety of jobs and is often considered basic, generic, or initial job analysis data. Everyone can use this database at no cost and is continually updated by observing workers from each occupation. O*NET also has a Career Exploration Tool which is an assessment to help workers and students who are searching for new careers. Data available from O*NET includes physical requirements, educational level, and some mental requirements. Task-based statements describing the work performed are derived from the [[functional job analysis]] technique. O*NET also provides links to salary data at the US national, state and city level for each job.\n\nO*NET was designed with several features in mind, including:\n* The inclusion of multiple descriptors and content domains to capture the range of ways that work can be described\n* The development of cross-job descriptors in order to enable comparisons between various jobs\n* The use of a taxonomic approach to occupational classification to enable full coverage within a content domain\n\nUsing these principles, a content model was developed that identified six content domains and specific categories within each domain. These six domains and categories within them include:\n# '''Worker characteristics''': enduring individual attributes that influence the capacities workers can develop - abilities, occupational values and interests, and work styles\n# '''Worker requirements''': general attributes developed through education and experience, thus are more amenable to change than worker characteristics - knowledge skills and education\n# '''Occupational requirements''': descriptors of the work itself rather than the worker -  Generalized work activities, work context, and organizational context\n# '''Experience requirements''': types and quantities of experience required for specific occupations - worker experience in other jobs, related training, on-the-job training, and certification requirements\n# '''Individual occupation characteristics''': reflects labor demand, supply, and other labor market information\n# '''Occupation-specific requirements''': information unique to a particular job - occupation-specific skills and knowledge, tasks and duties, and equipment used <ref>Rogelberg, S.G. (2007). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref>\n\n==In modern United States==\n\nOver the past years, the concept of job analysis has been changing dramatically. One observer put it: \"The modern world is on the verge of another huge leap in creativity and productivity, but the job is not going to be part of tomorrow's economic reality. There still is and will always be an enormous amount of work to do, but it is not going to be contained in the familiar envelopes we call jobs. In fact, many organizations are today well along the path toward being \"de-jobbed.\".\"<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\nJobs and job descriptions, until recently, tended to follow their prescriptions and to be fairly detailed and specific. By the mid-1900s writers were reacting to what they viewed as \"dehumanizing\" aspects of pigeonholing workings into highly repetitive and specialized jobs; many proposed solutions like job enlargement, job rotation, and job enrichment. ''Job enlargement'' means assigning workers additional same-level tasks, thus increasing the number of activities they perform. ''Job rotation'' means systematically moving workers from one job to another. Psychologist Frederick Herzberg argued that the best way to motivate workers is to build opportunities for challenge and achievement into their jobs through job enrichment. ''Job enrichment'' means re-designing jobs in a way that increases the opportunities for the worker to experience feelings of responsibility, achievement, growth and recognition.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\nWhether enriched, specialized or enlarged, workers still generally have specific jobs to do, and these jobs have required job descriptions. In many firms today, however, jobs are becoming more amorphous and difficult to define. In other words, the trend is toward ''dejobbing''.\n\n''Dejobbing,'' broadening the responsibilities of the company's jobs, and encouraging employees to not limit themselves to what's on their job descriptions, is a result of the changes taking place in business today. Organizations need to grapple with trends like rapid product and technological changes, and a shift to a service economy. This has increased the need for firms to be responsive, flexible, and generally more competitive. In turn, the organizational methods managers use to accomplish this have helped weaken the meaning of a job as a well-defined and clearly delineated set of responsibilities. Here are some methods that have contributed to this weakening of JOB's meaning:\n\n* Flatter organizations: Instead of traditional pyramid-shaped organizations with seven or more management layers, [[flat organization]]s with only three or four levels are becoming more prevalent\n* Work teams: Managers increasingly organize tasks around teams and processes rather than around specialized functions. In an organization like this, employees' jobs change daily and there is an intentional effort to avoid having employees view their jobs as a specific set of responsibilities. An example of this in action in information technology is the [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] methodology in software development, which specifically states that within the Scrum process, the only recognised title for team members is \"team member\" - although in practice many IT organizations ignore this aspect of Scrum as it is perceived as \"too radical\" for them to cope with.\n*The Boundaryless Organization: In a ''boundaryless organization,'' the widespread use of teams and similar structural mechanisms reduces and makes more permeable the boundaries that typically separate departments and hierarchical levels. These organizations foster responsiveness by encouraging employees to rid themselves of the 'it's not my job' attitudes that typically create walls between one employee's area and another's. Instead, the focus is on defining the project or task at hand in terms of the overall best interests of the organization, therefore further reducing the idea of a job as a clearly defined set of duties.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\nMost firms today continue to use job analysis and rely on jobs as traditionally defined. More firms are moving toward new organizational configurations built around jobs that are broad and could change daily. Also, modern job analysis and job design techniques could help companies implement high-performance strategies.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Industrial & organizational psychology]]\n* [[Staffing models]]\n* [[Task analysis]]\n* [[Work sampling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*Fleishman, E.A.

Through job analysis, the analyst needs to understand what the important tasks of the job are, how they are carried out, and the necessary human qualities needed to complete the job successfully.\n\nThe process of job analysis involves the analyst describing the duties of the incumbent, then the nature and conditions of work, and finally some basic qualifications. After this, the job analyst has completed a form called a ''job psychograph'', which displays the mental requirements of the job.<ref>Wilson, M. (2007). A history of job analysis. In L.

Manage., 28: 51\u201363.</ref>\n\nJob analysts are typically industrial-organizational (I-O) psychologists or human resource officers who have been trained by, and are acting under the supervision of an I-O psychologist. One of the first I-O psychologists to introduce job analysis was [[Morris Viteles]]. In 1922, he used job analysis in order to select employees for a trolley car company. Viteles' techniques could then be applied to any other area of employment using the same process.<ref>Viteles, M.S. (1922).

However, evidence shows that the root purpose of job analysis, understanding the behavioral requirements of work, has not changed in over 85 years.<ref name=\"Wilson, M. 2007\">Wilson, M. (2007).

The general purpose of job analysis is to document the requirements of a job and the work performed.  Job and [[task analysis]] is performed as a basis for later improvements, including: definition of a job domain; description of a job; development of [[performance appraisal]]s, [[personnel selection]], selection systems, promotion criteria, training needs assessment, legal defense of selection processes, and compensation plans.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite web|url= http://esrccoi.group.shef.ac.uk/pdf/whatis/job_analysis.pdf|title= What is Job Analysis?|author= Robinson, M.|publisher= Institute of Work Psychology|accessdate= April 18, 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061007131458/http://esrccoi.group.shef.ac.uk/pdf/whatis/job_analysis.pdf|archivedate= October 7, 2006}}</ref> The human performance improvement industry uses job analysis to make sure training and development activities are focused and effective.<ref name=\"Hartley, D.E. 1999\"/> In the fields of [[human resources]] (HR) and [[industrial psychology]], job analysis is often used to gather information for use in personnel selection, training, classification, and/or compensation.<ref name=\"Cascio\">Cascio, W. F., & Aguinis, H. (2005).  Applied Psychology in Human Resource Management</ref>\n\nIndustrial psychologists use job analysis to determine the physical requirements of a job to determine whether an individual who has suffered some diminished capacity is capable of performing the job with, or without, some accommodation. Edwin Flieshman, Ph.D. is credited with determining the underlying factors of human physical fitness.<ref name=Fleishman>Fleishman, E.A. (1964). The Structure and Measurement of Physical Fitness</ref> Professionals developing [[certification]] [[exams]] use job analysis (often called something slightly different, such as \"task analysis\" or \"work analysis\") to determine the elements of the domain which must be sampled in order to create a content valid exam. When a job analysis is conducted for the purpose of valuing the job (i.e., determining the appropriate compensation for incumbents) this is called \"job evaluation.\"\n\nJob analysis aims to answer questions such as:\n\n* Why does the job exist?\n* What physical and mental activities does the worker undertake?\n* When is the job to be performed?\n* Where is the job to be performed?\n* Under What conditions it is to be performed?\n\n==Procedures==\nAs stated before, the purpose of job analysis is to combine the task demands of a job with our knowledge of human attributes and produce a theory of behavior for the job in question. There are two ways to approach building that theory, meaning there are two different approaches to job analysis.<ref name=\"Brannick, M.T. 2007\">Brannick, M.T., Levine, E.L., & Morgeson, F.P.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref>\n\n===Task-oriented===\nTask-oriented procedures focus on the actual activities involved in performing work.<ref name=\"Robinson\"/> This procedure takes into consideration work duties, responsibilities, and functions. The job analyst then develops task statements which clearly state the tasks that are performed with great detail. After creating task statements, job analysts rate the tasks on scales indicating importance, difficulty, frequency, and consequences of error. Based on these ratings, a greater sense of understanding of a job can be attained.<ref name=\"Muchinsky\">{{cite book |title= Psychology Applied to Work |last= Muchinsky |first= Paul M. |year= 2012 |publisher= Hypergraphic Press, Inc. |location= Summerfield, NC |isbn= 978-0-578-07692-8}}</ref> [[Task analysis]], such as cognitively oriented task analysis (COTA), are techniques used to describe job expertise.

Developed by Fine and Cronshaw in 1944, work elements are scored in terms of relatedness to data (0\u20136), people (0\u20138), and things (0\u20136), with lower scores representing greater complexity. Incumbents, considered [[Subject-matter expert|subject matter experts]] (SMEs), are relied upon, usually in a panel, to report elements of their work to the job analyst. Using incumbent reports, the analyst uses Fine's terminology to compile statements reflecting the work being performed in terms of data, people, and things. The [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]] uses elements of the FJA in defining jobs.<ref name=\"Muchinsky\"/>\n\n===Worker-oriented===\nWorker-oriented procedures aim to examine the human attributes needed to perform the job successfully.<ref name=\"Robinson\"/> These human attributes have been commonly classified into four categories: ''knowledge'', ''skills'', ''abilities'', and ''other characteristics'' (KSAO). ''Knowledge'' is the information people need in order to perform the job. ''Skills'' are the proficiencies needed to perform each task. ''Abilities'' are the attributes that are relatively stable over time. ''Other characteristics'' are all other attributes, usually personality factors.<ref name=\"Muchinsky\"/> The KSAOs required for a job are inferred from the most frequently-occurring, important tasks. In a worker-oriented job analysis, the skills are inferred from tasks and the skills are rated directly in terms of importance of frequency. This often results in data that immediately imply the important KSAOs. However, it can be hard for SMEs to rate skills directly.\n\nThe Fleishman Job Analysis System (F-JAS) developed by [[Edwin A. Fleishman]] represents a worker-oriented approach. Fleishman factor-analyzed large data sets to discover a common, minimum set of KSAOs across different jobs. His system of 73 specific scales measure three broad areas: Cognitive (Verbal Abilities; Idea Generation & Reasoning Abilities; Quantitative Abilities; Memory; Perceptual Abilities; Spatial Abilities; and Attentiveness), Psychomotor (Fine Manipulative Abilities; Control Movement Abilities; and Reaction Time and Speed Abilities), and Physical (Physical Strength Abilities; Endurance; Flexibility, Balance, and Coordination; Visual Abilities; and Auditory and Speech Abilities).\n\nJobScan is a measurement instrument which defines the personality dynamics within a specific type of job.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.vtc-ted.org/documents/JobScan.pdf|title= People Fitting Positions|accessdate= April 18, 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061006092848/http://www.vtc-ted.org/documents/JobScan.pdf|archivedate= October 6, 2006}}</ref> By collecting PDP [[ProScan Survey]] results of actual performers and results of job dynamics analysis surveys completed by knowledgeable people related to a specific job, JobScan provides a suggested ideal job model for that position. Although it does not evaluate the intellect or experience necessary to accomplish a task, it does deal with the personality of the type of work itself.\n\n==Example==\nFor the job of a snow-cat operator at a ski slope, a work or task-oriented job analysis might include this statement:\nOperates Bombardier Sno-cat, usually at night, to smooth out snow rutted by skiers and snowboard riders and new snow that has fallen.\nOn the other hand, a worker-oriented job analysis might include this statement:\nEvaluates terrain, snow depth, and snow condition and chooses the correct setting for the depth of the snow cat, as well as the number of passes necessary on a given ski slope.<ref name=\"Brannick, M.T. 2007\"/>\n\nJob analysis methods have evolved using both task-oriented and worker-oriented approaches. Since the end result of both approaches is a statement of KSAOs, neither can be considered the \"correct\" way to conduct job analysis. Because worker-oriented job analyses tend to provide more generalized human behavior and behavior patterns and are less tied to the technological parts of a job, they produce data more useful for developing training programs and giving feed back to employees in the form of performance appraisal information. Also, the volatility that exists in the typical workplace of today can make specific task statements less valuable in isolation. For these reasons, employers are significantly more likely to use worker-oriented approaches to job analysis today than they were in the past.<ref name=\"Brannick, M.T. 2007\"/>\n\n==Knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics (KSAOs)==\nRegardless of which approach to job analysis is taken, the next step in the process is to identify the attributes\u2014the KSAOs that an incumbent needs for either performing the tasks at hand or executing the human behaviors described in the job analysis.<ref name=\"Peterson, N.G. 1999\">Peterson, N.G., Mumford, M.D., Borman, W.C., Jeanneret, P.R., & Fleishman, E.A. (Eds.) (1999). An occupational information system for the 21st century. Washington, D.C: American Psychological Association.</ref>\n* '''Knowledge''': \"A collection of discrete but related facts and information about a particular domain...acquired through formal education or training, or accumulated through specific experiences.\"\n* '''Skill''': \"A practiced act\".\n* '''Ability''': \"The stable capacity to engage in a specific behavior\"\n* '''Other characteristics''': \"Personality variables, interests, training, and experiences\" <ref name=\"Peterson, N.G. 1999\"/>\n\nFinally, once the appropriate KSAOs are identified, tests and other assessment techniques can be chosen to measure those KSAOs.  Over the years, experts have presented several different systems and methods to accomplish job analysis. Many forms of systems are no longer in use, but those systems that still exist have become increasingly detailed over the decades with a greater concentration on tasks and less concentration on human attributes. That trend, however, has reversed in recent years for the better. Newer methods and systems have brought I-O psychology back to an examination of the ''behavioral'' aspects of work.<ref name=\"Wilson, M. 2007\"/>\n\nThere are several ways to conduct a job analysis, including: interviews with incumbents and supervisors, work methods of analysis can be laborious and time consuming, and there is always a tendency on the part of management to over analyze some jobs and under analyze some others. These traditional job analysis methods include: one-on-one interviewing; behavioral event interviews; phone interviews; surveys; work assessments; Developing a Curriculum (DACUM); job analysis worksheets; observations and procedural review.<ref>Hartley, D.E. (1999).</ref> Job analysis at the speed of reality. Amherst, Mass.: HRD Press. All of these methods can be used to gather information for job analysis. The DACUM process developed in the late 1960s has been viewed as the fastest method used, but it can still can take two or three days to obtain a validated task list.\n# '''Observation''': This was the first method of job analysis used by I-O psychologists. The process involves simply watching incumbents perform their jobs and taking notes. Sometimes they ask questions while watching, and commonly they even perform job tasks themselves. Near the end of World War II, Morris Viteles studied the job of navigator on a submarine. He attempted to steer the submarine toward Bermuda. After multiple misses by over 100 miles in one direction or another, one officer suggested that Viteles raise the periscope, look for clouds, and steer toward them since clouds tend to form above or near land masses. The vessel reached Bermuda shortly after that suggestion. The more jobs one seriously observes, the better one's understanding becomes of both the jobs in question and work in general.\n# '''Interviews''': It is essential to supplement observation by talking with incumbents. These interviews are most effective when structured with a specific set of questions based on observations, other analyses of the types of jobs in question, or prior discussions with human resources representatives, trainers, or managers knowledgeable about jobs.\n# '''Critical incidents and work diaries''': The critical incident technique asks subject matter experts to identify critical aspects of behavior or performance in a particular job that led to success or failure. For example, the supervisor of an electric utility repairman might report that in a very time-pressing project, the repairman failed to check a blueprint and as a result cut a line, causing a massive power loss. In fact, this is what happened in Los Angeles in September 2005 when half the city lost power over a period of 12 hours. The second method, a work diary, asks workers and/or supervisors to keep a log of activities over a prescribed period of time. They may be asked to simply write down what they were doing at 15 minutes after the hour for each hour of the work day. Or, they may list everything they have done up to a break.\n# '''Questionnaires and surveys''': Expert incumbents or supervisors often respond to questionnaires or surveys as a part of job analysis. These questionnaires include task statements in the form of worker behaviors. Subject matter experts are asked to rate each statement form their experience on a number of different dimensions like importance to overall job success, frequency performance and whether the task must be performed on the first day of work or can be learned gradually on the job. Questionnaires also ask incumbents to rate the importance of KSAOs for performing tasks, and may ask the subject matter experts to rate work context. Unlike the results of observations and interviews, the questionnaire responses can be statistically analyzed to provide a more objective record of the components of the job. To a greater and greater extent, these questionnaires and surveys are being administered online to incumbents.\n# '''Position Analysis Questionnaire''': The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) is a well-known job analysis instrument. Although it is labeled a questionnaire, the PAQ is actually designed to be completed by a trained job analyst who interviews the SMEs (e.g., job incumbents and their supervisors).[2] The PAQ was designed to measure job component validity of attributes presented in aptitude tests. Job component validity is the relationship between test scores and skills required for good job performance. There are 195 behavior-related statements in the PAQ divided into six major sections: information input, mental process, work output, relationships with others, job context, and other job characteristics.\n#  '''Checklists''': Checklists are also used as a job analysis method, specifically with areas like the Air Force. In the checklist method, the incumbent checks the tasks he or she performs from a list of task statements that describe the job. The checklist is preceded by some sort of job analysis and is usually followed by the development of work activity compilations or job descriptions. The scope of task statements listed depends upon the judgment of the checklist constructor.<ref>Morsh, J. E. (1964), Job Analysis in the United States Air Force. Personnel Psychology, 17: 7\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Six steps==\n# Decide how to use the information since this will determine the data to collect and how to collect it. Some data collection techniques such as interviewing the employee and asking what the job entails are good for writing job descriptions and selecting employees for the job. Other techniques like the position analysis questionnaire do not provide qualitative information for job descriptions. Rather, they provide numerical ratings for each job and can be used to compare jobs for compensation purposes.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\">Premeaux, Shane R., Noe, Robert M., & Wayne, Mondy R. (2002). Human Resource Management (8th ed). Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall.</ref>\n# Review appropriate background information like organization charts, process charts, and job descriptions. ''Organization charts'' show the organization-wide work division, how the job in question relates to other jobs, and where the job fits in the overall organization. The chart should show the title of each position and, through connecting lines, show reports to whom and with whom the job incumbent communicates. A ''process chart'' provides a more detailed picture of the work flow. In its simplest, most organic form, a process chart shows the flow of inputs to and outputs from the job being analyzed. Finally, the existing job description (if there is one) usually provides a starting point for building the revised job description.\n# Select representative positions. This is because there may be too many similar jobs to analyze. For example, it is usually unnecessary to analyze jobs of 200 assembly workers when a sample of 10 jobs will be sufficient.\n# Actually analyze the job by collecting data on job activities, necessary employee behaviors and actions, working conditions, and human traits and abilities required to perform the job. For this step, one or more than one methods of job analysis may be needed\n# Verify the job analysis information with the worker performing the job and with his or her immediate supervisor. This will help confirm that the information is factually correct and complete. This review can also help gain the employee's acceptance of the job analysis data and conclusions by giving that person a chance to review and modify descriptions of the job activities.\n# Develop a job description and job specification. These are two tangible products of the job analysis process. The ''job description'' is a written statement that describes the activities and responsibilities of the job as well as its important features such as working conditions and safety hazards. The ''job specification'' summarizes the personal qualities, traits, skills, and background required for completing a certain job. These two may be completely separate or in the same document.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\n==Uses of information==\n# '''Recruitment and selection''': Job analysis provides information about what the job entails and what human characteristics are required in order to perform these activities. This information, in the form of job descriptions and specifications, helps management officials decide what sort of people they need to recruit and hire and select.\n# '''Compensation''': Job analysis information is crucial for estimating the value of each job and its appropriate compensation. Compensation (salary and bonus) usually depends on the job's required skill and education level, safety hazards, degree of responsibility, etc. -- all factors which can be assessed through job analysis. Also, many employers group jobs into classes. Job analysis provides the information to determine the relative worth of each job and its appropriate class.\n# '''Performance appraisal''': A performance appraisal compares each employee's actual performance with his or her performance standards. Managers use job analysis to determine the job's specific activities and performance standards.\n# '''Training''': The job description should show the activities and skills, and therefore training, that the job requires\n# '''Discovering unassigned duties''': Job Analysis can also help reveal unassigned duties. For example, a company's production manager says an employee is responsible for ten duties, such as production scheduling and raw material purchasing. Missing, however, is any reference to managing raw material inventories. On further study, it is revealed that none of the other manufacturing employees are responsible for inventory management, either. From review of other jobs like these, it is clear that someone should be managing raw material inventories. Therefore, an essential unassigned duty has been revealed.\n# '''EEO compliance''': Job analysis plays a large role in EEO compliance. United States Federal Agencies' Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection stipulate that job analysis is a necessary step in validating all major personnel activities. For example, employers must be able to show that their selection criteria and job performance are actually related. Doing this requires knowing what the job entails, which in turn requires job analysis.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n'''Additional purposes''': In addition to the 6 purposes above, Ash and Levine<ref>Ash, R. A., & Levine, E. L. (1980). A framework for evaluating job analysis methods. ''Personnel Psychology'', 57, 53-59</ref> listed determining KSAOs needed for promotion, determining [[workplace hazards]] to make jobs safer, job [[classification]], [[job description]], [[job design|designing the content of jobs]], and [[strategic human resource planning]].\n\n==Job Analysis at the Speed of Reality (JASR)==\nThe Job Analysis at the Speed of Reality (JASR) method for job analysis is a reliable, proven method to quickly create validated task lists. The end product, which can be used for many purposes, is the basis for many potential training opportunities. This method is a tested process that helps analysts complete a job analysis of a typical job with a group of subject matter experts and managers in two to three hours then deliver a validated task list.<ref>Hartley, D.E. (1999). Job analysis at the speed of reality. Amherst, Mass.: HRD Press. The JASR method of job analysis is based on four principles.</ref>\n# Job incumbents should know their jobs better than anyone else. They can provide accurate, timely content information about the job.\n# JASR participants want to spend a minimum amount of time providing job data during a session and business leadership wants to minimize disruption to business operations.\n# Since JASR participants do not spend as much time thinking about training as training professionals do, they do not require much orientation to the process.\n# JASR uses the quickest methods and best possible technology to complete the job analysis.<ref name=\"Hartley, D.E. 1999\"/>\n\n==Systems==\nFor many years, the U.S. Department of Labor published the [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]] (DOT), which was a comprehensive description of over 20,000 jobs. However, the Department replaced the DOT with O*NET online database, which includes all occupations from the DOT plus an additional 3,500. This makes O*NET very useful for job analysis.<ref>Bohlander, G., & Snell, S. (2009). Managing human resources. Independence: Cengage Learning.</ref>\n\nThe O*NET<ref>[http://online.onetcenter.org/ \"O*Net\"]</ref> (an online resource which has replaced the Dictionary of Occupational Titles) lists job requirements for a variety of jobs and is often considered basic, generic, or initial job analysis data. Everyone can use this database at no cost and is continually updated by observing workers from each occupation. O*NET also has a Career Exploration Tool which is an assessment to help workers and students who are searching for new careers. Data available from O*NET includes physical requirements, educational level, and some mental requirements. Task-based statements describing the work performed are derived from the [[functional job analysis]] technique. O*NET also provides links to salary data at the US national, state and city level for each job.\n\nO*NET was designed with several features in mind, including:\n* The inclusion of multiple descriptors and content domains to capture the range of ways that work can be described\n* The development of cross-job descriptors in order to enable comparisons between various jobs\n* The use of a taxonomic approach to occupational classification to enable full coverage within a content domain\n\nUsing these principles, a content model was developed that identified six content domains and specific categories within each domain. These six domains and categories within them include:\n# '''Worker characteristics''': enduring individual attributes that influence the capacities workers can develop - abilities, occupational values and interests, and work styles\n# '''Worker requirements''': general attributes developed through education and experience, thus are more amenable to change than worker characteristics - knowledge skills and education\n# '''Occupational requirements''': descriptors of the work itself rather than the worker -  Generalized work activities, work context, and organizational context\n# '''Experience requirements''': types and quantities of experience required for specific occupations - worker experience in other jobs, related training, on-the-job training, and certification requirements\n# '''Individual occupation characteristics''': reflects labor demand, supply, and other labor market information\n# '''Occupation-specific requirements''': information unique to a particular job - occupation-specific skills and knowledge, tasks and duties, and equipment used <ref>Rogelberg, S.G. (2007). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref>\n\n==In modern United States==\n\nOver the past years, the concept of job analysis has been changing dramatically. One observer put it: \"The modern world is on the verge of another huge leap in creativity and productivity, but the job is not going to be part of tomorrow's economic reality. There still is and will always be an enormous amount of work to do, but it is not going to be contained in the familiar envelopes we call jobs. In fact, many organizations are today well along the path toward being \"de-jobbed.\".\"<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\nJobs and job descriptions, until recently, tended to follow their prescriptions and to be fairly detailed and specific. By the mid-1900s writers were reacting to what they viewed as \"dehumanizing\" aspects of pigeonholing workings into highly repetitive and specialized jobs; many proposed solutions like job enlargement, job rotation, and job enrichment. ''Job enlargement'' means assigning workers additional same-level tasks, thus increasing the number of activities they perform. ''Job rotation'' means systematically moving workers from one job to another. Psychologist Frederick Herzberg argued that the best way to motivate workers is to build opportunities for challenge and achievement into their jobs through job enrichment. ''Job enrichment'' means re-designing jobs in a way that increases the opportunities for the worker to experience feelings of responsibility, achievement, growth and recognition.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\nWhether enriched, specialized or enlarged, workers still generally have specific jobs to do, and these jobs have required job descriptions. In many firms today, however, jobs are becoming more amorphous and difficult to define. In other words, the trend is toward ''dejobbing''.\n\n''Dejobbing,'' broadening the responsibilities of the company's jobs, and encouraging employees to not limit themselves to what's on their job descriptions, is a result of the changes taking place in business today. Organizations need to grapple with trends like rapid product and technological changes, and a shift to a service economy. This has increased the need for firms to be responsive, flexible, and generally more competitive. In turn, the organizational methods managers use to accomplish this have helped weaken the meaning of a job as a well-defined and clearly delineated set of responsibilities. Here are some methods that have contributed to this weakening of JOB's meaning:\n\n* Flatter organizations: Instead of traditional pyramid-shaped organizations with seven or more management layers, [[flat organization]]s with only three or four levels are becoming more prevalent\n* Work teams: Managers increasingly organize tasks around teams and processes rather than around specialized functions. In an organization like this, employees' jobs change daily and there is an intentional effort to avoid having employees view their jobs as a specific set of responsibilities. An example of this in action in information technology is the [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]] methodology in software development, which specifically states that within the Scrum process, the only recognised title for team members is \"team member\" - although in practice many IT organizations ignore this aspect of Scrum as it is perceived as \"too radical\" for them to cope with.\n*The Boundaryless Organization: In a ''boundaryless organization,'' the widespread use of teams and similar structural mechanisms reduces and makes more permeable the boundaries that typically separate departments and hierarchical levels. These organizations foster responsiveness by encouraging employees to rid themselves of the 'it's not my job' attitudes that typically create walls between one employee's area and another's. Instead, the focus is on defining the project or task at hand in terms of the overall best interests of the organization, therefore further reducing the idea of a job as a clearly defined set of duties.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\nMost firms today continue to use job analysis and rely on jobs as traditionally defined. More firms are moving toward new organizational configurations built around jobs that are broad and could change daily. Also, modern job analysis and job design techniques could help companies implement high-performance strategies.<ref name=\"Premeaux, Shane R. 2002\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Industrial & organizational psychology]]\n* [[Staffing models]]\n* [[Task analysis]]\n* [[Work sampling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*Fleishman, E.A.

Using the term ''sex worker'' rather than ''prostitute'' also allows more members of the sex industry to be represented and helps ensure that individuals who are actually prostitutes are not singled out and associated with the negative connotations of ''prostitute.'' In addition, choosing to use the term ''sex worker'' rather than ''prostitute'' shows ownership over the individuals' career choice. Some argue that those who prefer the term ''sex worker'' wish to separate their occupation from their person. Describing someone as a sex worker recognizes that the individual may have many different facets, and are not necessarily defined by their job.\n\nAccording to one view, [[sex work]] is different from [[sexual exploitation]], or the forcing of a person to commit sexual acts, in that sex work is voluntary \"and is seen as the commercial exchange of sex for money or goods\".<ref name=Burnes>{{cite book |last1=Burnes |first1=Theodore R. |editor1-last=Nadal |editor1-first=Kevin L. |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Psychology and Gender |date=2017 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |pages=1467\u20131470 |chapter=Sex Work|doi=10.4135/9781483384269.n494|isbn=9781483384283 }}</ref> In an attempt to further clarify the broad term that ''sex work'' is, John E.

For example, while pornography is legal in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most parts of the US. However, in other regions of the world, both pornography and prostitution are illegal; in others, both are legal. One example of a country in which pornography, prostitution, and all professions encompassed under the umbrella of sex work are all legal is New Zealand. Under the Prostitution Reform Act of New Zealand, laws and regulations have been put into place in order to ensure the safety and protection of its sex workers. For example, since the implementation of the Prostitution Reform Act, \"any person seeking to open a larger brothel, where more than four sex workers will be working requires a Brothel Operators Certificate, which certifies them as a suitable person to exercise control over sex workers in the workplace.

In one study, women involved in sex work were interviewed and asked if they thought it should be made legal. They answered that they thought it should not, as it would put women at higher risk from violent customers if it were considered legitimate work, and they would not want their friends or family entering the sex industry to earn money. Another argument is that legalizing sex work would increase the demand for it, and women should not be treated as sexual merchandise. A study showed that in countries that have legalized prostitution, there was an increase in child prostitution. An argument against legalizing sex work is to keep children from being involved in this industry. The studies also showed that legalizing sex work lead to an increase in sex trafficking, which is another reason people give for making sex work illegal.<ref name=\"Janice G.

One major argument for legalizing prostitution is that women should have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. The government should not have a say in what they do for work, and if they want to sell their bodies it is their own decision. Another common argument for legalizing prostitution is that enforcing prostitution laws is a waste of money. This is because prostitution has always, and will continue to persist despite whatever laws and regulations are implemented against it. In arguing for the decriminalization of sex work, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands expanded upon this argument in court when stating that, \"prostitution has existed for a long time and will continue to do so\u2026Prohibition is not the way to proceed\u2026One should allow for voluntary prostitution. The authorities can then regulate prostitution, [and] it can become healthy, safe, transparent, and cleansed from criminal side-effects.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weitzer|first1=Ronald John|title=Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business|year=2012|publisher=NYU Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ercUCgAAQBAJ|isbn=9780814794630}}</ref> People who wish to legalize prostitution do not see enforcing laws against sex work as effective and think the money is better spent elsewhere. Many people also argue that legalization of prostitution will lead to less harm for the sex workers. They argue that the decriminalization of sex work will decrease the exploitation of sex workers by third parties such as pimps and managers. A final argument for the legalization of sex work is that prostitution laws are unconstitutional. Some argue that these laws go against people's rights to free speech, privacy, etc.{{sfn|Weitzer|1991}}\n\n== Risk reduction ==\nRisk reduction in sex work is a highly debated topic. \"Abolitionism\" and \"nonabolitionism\" or \"empowerment\" are regarded as opposing ways in which risk reduction is approached.<ref name=\"Traffic Violations\">{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Penelope|title=Traffic Violations: Determining the Meaning of Violence in Sexual Trafficking versus Sex Work|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=March 2005|volume=20|issue=3|pages=343\u2013360|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120915113821/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-15|accessdate=24 April 2014|doi=10.1177/0886260504272509|pmid=15684141|df=}}</ref>  While abolitionism would call for an end to all sex work, empowerment would encourage the formation of networks among sex workers and enable them to prevent STIs and other health risks by communicating with each other.<ref name=\"Reframing Sex Worker Health\">{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Joseph|author2=Astrid Tuminez|title=Reframing the Interpretation of Sex Worker Health: A Behavioral\u2013Structural Approach|journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=204|issue=5|pages=S1206\u201310|doi=10.1093/infdis/jir534|pmid=22043033|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_5/S1206.short|accessdate=14 March 2014|pmc=3205084}}</ref> Both approaches aim to reduce rates of disease and other negative effects of sex work.\n\nIn addition, sex workers themselves have disputed the dichotomous nature of abolitionism and nonabolitionism, advocating instead a focus on sex workers' rights.

They face biological, personal, relational, and structural risks that all increase their chances of getting HIV. Biological factors include incorrect condom usage because of erectile dysfunction from hormones taken to become more feminine and receptive anal intercourse without a condom which is a high risk for developing HIV. Personal factors include mental health issues that lead to increased sexual risk, such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse provoked through lack of support, violence, etc. Structural risks include involvement in sex work being linked to poverty, substance abuse, and other factors that are more prevalent in transgender women based on their tendency to be socially marginalized and not accepted for challenging gender norms. The largest risk for HIV is unprotected sex with male partners, and studies have been emerging that show men who have sex with transgender women are more likely to use drugs than men that do not.<ref name=\"Tonia Potiat - HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers\">{{cite journal|last=Potiat|first=Tonia|title=HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers|journal=The Lancet|date=January 23, 2015|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60833-3|pmid=25059941|volume=385|issue=9964|pages=274\u2013286|pmc=4320978}}</ref>\n\nCondom use is one way to mitigate the risk of contracting an STI. However, negotiating condom use with one's clients and partners is often an obstacle to practicing safer sex.

Othering involves constructing oneself as superior to one's peers, and the dancer persona provides an internal boundary that separates the \"authentic\" from the stripper self. This practice creates a lot of stress for the dancers, in turn leading many to resort to using drugs and alcohol to cope. Since it is so widespread, the use of drugs has become normalized in the exotic dance scene.<br>Despite this normalization, passing as nonusers, or covering as users of less maligned drugs, is necessary. This is because strippers concurrently attribute a strong moral constitution to those that resist the drug atmosphere; it is a testament to personal strength and will power. It is also an occasion for dancers to \"other\" fellow strippers. Valorizing resistance to the drug space discursively positions \"good\" strippers against such a drug locale and indicates why dancers are motivated to closet hard drug use.<br>Stigma causes strippers to hide their lifestyles from friends and family alienating themselves from a support system. Further, the stress of trying to hide their lifestyles from others due to fear of scrutiny affects the mental health of dancers. Stigma is a difficult area to address because it is more abstract, but it would be helpful to work toward normalizing sex work as a valid way of making a living. This normalization of sex work would relieve the stress many dancers experience increasing the likelihood that they will be open about their work. Being open will allow them access to a viable support system and reduce the othering and drug use so rampant in the sex industry.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tyndale | first1 = Maticka | year = 2000 | title = Exotic dancing and health | url = | journal = Women & Health | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 87\u2013108 | doi=10.1300/j013v31n01_06| pmid = 11005222 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barton | first1 = B | year = 2007 | title = Managing the toll of stripping boundary setting among exotic dancers | url = | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | volume = 36 | issue = 5| page = 571 | doi=10.1177/0891241607301971}}</ref>\n\n=== Forced sex work ===\n{{see also|Sexual slavery|Sex trafficking}}\nForced sex work is when an individual enters into any sex trade due to coercion rather than by choice.

Because sex work is illegal in many places where they wish to organize, it is difficult to communicate with other sex workers in order to organize. There is also concern with the legitimacy of sex work as a career and an activity that merits formal organizing, largely because of the sexism often present in sex work and the devaluation of sex work as not comparable to other paid labor and employment.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\"/>\n\nA factor affecting the unionization of sex work is that many sex workers belong to populations that historically have not had a strong representation in labor unions. While this unionization can be viewed as a way of empowering sex workers and granting them agency within their profession, it is also criticized as implicitly lending its approval to sexism and power imbalances already present in sex work. Unionization also implies a submission to or operation within the systems of capitalism, which is of concern to some feminists.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\">{{cite journal|last=Gall|first=Gregor|title=Sex worker unionisation: an exploratory study of emerging collective organisation|journal=Industrial Relations Journal|date=1 January 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=70\u201388|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2338.2007.00436.x}}</ref>\n\n====Unionizing exotic dancers====\n''Independent contractor vs Employee''<br>Performers in general are problematic to categorize because they often exercise a high level of control over their work product, one characteristic of an independent contractor. Additionally, their work can be artistic in nature and often done on a freelance basis. Often, the work of performers does not possess the obvious attributes of employees such as regular working hours, places or duties. Consequently, employers misclassify them because they are unsure of their workers' status, or they purposely misclassify them to take advantage of independent contractors' low costs. Exotic dance clubs are one such employer that purposely misclassify their performers as independent contractors.\n\nThere are additional hurdles in terms of self-esteem and commitment to unionize. On the most basic level, dancers themselves must have the desire to unionize for collective action. For those who wish not to conform to group activity or want to remain independent, a union may seem as controlling as club management since joining a union would obligate them to pay dues and abide by decisions made through majority vote, with or without their personal approval.\n\nIn the ''Lusty Lady'' case study, this strip club was the first all-woman-managed club to successfully unionize in 1996. Some of the working conditions they were able to address included \"protest[ing] racist hiring practices, customers being allowed to videotape dancers without their consent via one-way mirrors, inconsistent disciplinary policies, lack of health benefits, and an overall dearth of job security\".  Unionizing exotic dancers can certainly bring better work conditions and fair pay, but it is difficult to do at times because of their dubious employee categorization. Also, as is the case with many other unions, dancers are often reluctant to join them. This reluctance can be due to many factors, ranging from the cost of joining a union to the dancers believing they do not need union support because they will not be exotic dancers for a long enough period of time to justify joining a union.<ref>Brooks, S.

Using the term ''sex worker'' rather than ''prostitute'' also allows more members of the sex industry to be represented and helps ensure that individuals who are actually prostitutes are not singled out and associated with the negative connotations of ''prostitute.'' In addition, choosing to use the term ''sex worker'' rather than ''prostitute'' shows ownership over the individuals' career choice. Some argue that those who prefer the term ''sex worker'' wish to separate their occupation from their person. Describing someone as a sex worker recognizes that the individual may have many different facets, and are not necessarily defined by their job.\n\nAccording to one view, [[sex work]] is different from [[sexual exploitation]], or the forcing of a person to commit sexual acts, in that sex work is voluntary \"and is seen as the commercial exchange of sex for money or goods\".<ref name=Burnes>{{cite book |last1=Burnes |first1=Theodore R. |editor1-last=Nadal |editor1-first=Kevin L. |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Psychology and Gender |date=2017 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |pages=1467\u20131470 |chapter=Sex Work|doi=10.4135/9781483384269.n494|isbn=9781483384283 }}</ref> In an attempt to further clarify the broad term that ''sex work'' is, John E.

For example, while pornography is legal in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most parts of the US. However, in other regions of the world, both pornography and prostitution are illegal; in others, both are legal. One example of a country in which pornography, prostitution, and all professions encompassed under the umbrella of sex work are all legal is New Zealand. Under the Prostitution Reform Act of New Zealand, laws and regulations have been put into place in order to ensure the safety and protection of its sex workers. For example, since the implementation of the Prostitution Reform Act, \"any person seeking to open a larger brothel, where more than four sex workers will be working requires a Brothel Operators Certificate, which certifies them as a suitable person to exercise control over sex workers in the workplace.

In one study, women involved in sex work were interviewed and asked if they thought it should be made legal. They answered that they thought it should not, as it would put women at higher risk from violent customers if it were considered legitimate work, and they would not want their friends or family entering the sex industry to earn money. Another argument is that legalizing sex work would increase the demand for it, and women should not be treated as sexual merchandise. A study showed that in countries that have legalized prostitution, there was an increase in child prostitution. An argument against legalizing sex work is to keep children from being involved in this industry. The studies also showed that legalizing sex work lead to an increase in sex trafficking, which is another reason people give for making sex work illegal.<ref name=\"Janice G.

One major argument for legalizing prostitution is that women should have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. The government should not have a say in what they do for work, and if they want to sell their bodies it is their own decision. Another common argument for legalizing prostitution is that enforcing prostitution laws is a waste of money. This is because prostitution has always, and will continue to persist despite whatever laws and regulations are implemented against it. In arguing for the decriminalization of sex work, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands expanded upon this argument in court when stating that, \"prostitution has existed for a long time and will continue to do so\u2026Prohibition is not the way to proceed\u2026One should allow for voluntary prostitution. The authorities can then regulate prostitution, [and] it can become healthy, safe, transparent, and cleansed from criminal side-effects.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weitzer|first1=Ronald John|title=Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business|year=2012|publisher=NYU Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ercUCgAAQBAJ|isbn=9780814794630}}</ref> People who wish to legalize prostitution do not see enforcing laws against sex work as effective and think the money is better spent elsewhere. Many people also argue that legalization of prostitution will lead to less harm for the sex workers. They argue that the decriminalization of sex work will decrease the exploitation of sex workers by third parties such as pimps and managers. A final argument for the legalization of sex work is that prostitution laws are unconstitutional. Some argue that these laws go against people's rights to free speech, privacy, etc.{{sfn|Weitzer|1991}}\n\n== Risk reduction ==\nRisk reduction in sex work is a highly debated topic. \"Abolitionism\" and \"nonabolitionism\" or \"empowerment\" are regarded as opposing ways in which risk reduction is approached.<ref name=\"Traffic Violations\">{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Penelope|title=Traffic Violations: Determining the Meaning of Violence in Sexual Trafficking versus Sex Work|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=March 2005|volume=20|issue=3|pages=343\u2013360|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120915113821/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-15|accessdate=24 April 2014|doi=10.1177/0886260504272509|pmid=15684141|df=}}</ref>  While abolitionism would call for an end to all sex work, empowerment would encourage the formation of networks among sex workers and enable them to prevent STIs and other health risks by communicating with each other.<ref name=\"Reframing Sex Worker Health\">{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Joseph|author2=Astrid Tuminez|title=Reframing the Interpretation of Sex Worker Health: A Behavioral\u2013Structural Approach|journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=204|issue=5|pages=S1206\u201310|doi=10.1093/infdis/jir534|pmid=22043033|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_5/S1206.short|accessdate=14 March 2014|pmc=3205084}}</ref> Both approaches aim to reduce rates of disease and other negative effects of sex work.\n\nIn addition, sex workers themselves have disputed the dichotomous nature of abolitionism and nonabolitionism, advocating instead a focus on sex workers' rights.

They face biological, personal, relational, and structural risks that all increase their chances of getting HIV. Biological factors include incorrect condom usage because of erectile dysfunction from hormones taken to become more feminine and receptive anal intercourse without a condom which is a high risk for developing HIV. Personal factors include mental health issues that lead to increased sexual risk, such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse provoked through lack of support, violence, etc. Structural risks include involvement in sex work being linked to poverty, substance abuse, and other factors that are more prevalent in transgender women based on their tendency to be socially marginalized and not accepted for challenging gender norms. The largest risk for HIV is unprotected sex with male partners, and studies have been emerging that show men who have sex with transgender women are more likely to use drugs than men that do not.<ref name=\"Tonia Potiat - HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers\">{{cite journal|last=Potiat|first=Tonia|title=HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers|journal=The Lancet|date=January 23, 2015|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60833-3|pmid=25059941|volume=385|issue=9964|pages=274\u2013286|pmc=4320978}}</ref>\n\nCondom use is one way to mitigate the risk of contracting an STI. However, negotiating condom use with one's clients and partners is often an obstacle to practicing safer sex. While there is not much data on rates of violence against sex workers, many sex workers do not use condoms due to the fear of resistance and violence from clients.

Othering involves constructing oneself as superior to one's peers, and the dancer persona provides an internal boundary that separates the \"authentic\" from the stripper self. This practice creates a lot of stress for the dancers, in turn leading many to resort to using drugs and alcohol to cope. Since it is so widespread, the use of drugs has become normalized in the exotic dance scene.<br>Despite this normalization, passing as nonusers, or covering as users of less maligned drugs, is necessary. This is because strippers concurrently attribute a strong moral constitution to those that resist the drug atmosphere; it is a testament to personal strength and will power. It is also an occasion for dancers to \"other\" fellow strippers. Valorizing resistance to the drug space discursively positions \"good\" strippers against such a drug locale and indicates why dancers are motivated to closet hard drug use.<br>Stigma causes strippers to hide their lifestyles from friends and family alienating themselves from a support system. Further, the stress of trying to hide their lifestyles from others due to fear of scrutiny affects the mental health of dancers. Stigma is a difficult area to address because it is more abstract, but it would be helpful to work toward normalizing sex work as a valid way of making a living. This normalization of sex work would relieve the stress many dancers experience increasing the likelihood that they will be open about their work. Being open will allow them access to a viable support system and reduce the othering and drug use so rampant in the sex industry.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tyndale | first1 = Maticka | year = 2000 | title = Exotic dancing and health | url = | journal = Women & Health | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 87\u2013108 | doi=10.1300/j013v31n01_06| pmid = 11005222 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barton | first1 = B | year = 2007 | title = Managing the toll of stripping boundary setting among exotic dancers | url = | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | volume = 36 | issue = 5| page = 571 | doi=10.1177/0891241607301971}}</ref>\n\n=== Forced sex work ===\n{{see also|Sexual slavery|Sex trafficking}}\nForced sex work is when an individual enters into any sex trade due to coercion rather than by choice.

The IUSW advocates for the rights of all sex workers, whether they chose freely or were coerced to enter the trade, and promotes policies that benefit the interests of sex workers both in the UK and abroad.<ref name=\"IUSW: Who We Are\">{{cite web|title=IUSW: Who We Are|url=http://www.iusw.org/iusw-who-we-are/|publisher=International Union of Sex Workers|accessdate=15 March 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315075748/http://www.iusw.org/iusw-who-we-are/|archivedate=15 March 2014|df=}}</ref> Many regions are home to sex worker unions, including Latin America, Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Africa.<ref name=\"Sex worker organizations around the world\">{{cite web|title=Sex Worker Rights Organizations and Projects Around the World|url=http://www.bayswan.org/orgs.html|publisher=Prostitutes' Education Network}}</ref>\n\nIn unionizing, many sex workers face issues relating to communication and to the legality of sex work. Because sex work is illegal in many places where they wish to organize, it is difficult to communicate with other sex workers in order to organize. There is also concern with the legitimacy of sex work as a career and an activity that merits formal organizing, largely because of the sexism often present in sex work and the devaluation of sex work as not comparable to other paid labor and employment.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\"/>\n\nA factor affecting the unionization of sex work is that many sex workers belong to populations that historically have not had a strong representation in labor unions. While this unionization can be viewed as a way of empowering sex workers and granting them agency within their profession, it is also criticized as implicitly lending its approval to sexism and power imbalances already present in sex work. Unionization also implies a submission to or operation within the systems of capitalism, which is of concern to some feminists.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\">{{cite journal|last=Gall|first=Gregor|title=Sex worker unionisation: an exploratory study of emerging collective organisation|journal=Industrial Relations Journal|date=1 January 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=70\u201388|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2338.2007.00436.x}}</ref>\n\n====Unionizing exotic dancers====\n''Independent contractor vs Employee''<br>Performers in general are problematic to categorize because they often exercise a high level of control over their work product, one characteristic of an independent contractor. Additionally, their work can be artistic in nature and often done on a freelance basis. Often, the work of performers does not possess the obvious attributes of employees such as regular working hours, places or duties. Consequently, employers misclassify them because they are unsure of their workers' status, or they purposely misclassify them to take advantage of independent contractors' low costs. Exotic dance clubs are one such employer that purposely misclassify their performers as independent contractors.\n\nThere are additional hurdles in terms of self-esteem and commitment to unionize. On the most basic level, dancers themselves must have the desire to unionize for collective action. For those who wish not to conform to group activity or want to remain independent, a union may seem as controlling as club management since joining a union would obligate them to pay dues and abide by decisions made through majority vote, with or without their personal approval.\n\nIn the ''Lusty Lady'' case study, this strip club was the first all-woman-managed club to successfully unionize in 1996. Some of the working conditions they were able to address included \"protest[ing] racist hiring practices, customers being allowed to videotape dancers without their consent via one-way mirrors, inconsistent disciplinary policies, lack of health benefits, and an overall dearth of job security\".  Unionizing exotic dancers can certainly bring better work conditions and fair pay, but it is difficult to do at times because of their dubious employee categorization. Also, as is the case with many other unions, dancers are often reluctant to join them. This reluctance can be due to many factors, ranging from the cost of joining a union to the dancers believing they do not need union support because they will not be exotic dancers for a long enough period of time to justify joining a union.<ref>Brooks, S.

The champion of the Canadian Junior Hockey League wins the [[Centennial Cup]].\n\nThe CJHL spans the majority of Canada, from the [[Pacific Coast]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]].  The only regional organizations of [[Hockey Canada]] to currently not have member teams or a league are [[Hockey Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[Hockey North]].  In addition to Hockey NL and Hockey North, [[Hockey New Brunswick]] and [[Hockey PEI]] do not have their own leagues, but have teams from their region playing under [[Hockey Nova Scotia]] with the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginning===\nIn 1970, the [[Ontario Major Junior Hockey League]], [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]], and [[Western Hockey League|Western Canada Hockey League]] broke away from the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) and became its own governing body (what would become the [[Canadian Hockey League]]).  These new \"Major Junior\" leagues were given exclusive permission to compete for the [[Memorial Cup]], which had been Canada's Junior \"A\" championship prior to 1970.\n\nIn May 1970, CAHA chairman [[Frank McKinnon]] tabled a motion at the organization's Annual General Meeting to allow the remaining Junior \"A\" leagues to compete at a national level for their own championship.  The motion was granted and McKinnon and the [[Hockey Manitoba|Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association]] donated the [[Manitoba Centennial Trophy]] to the new championship in honor of 100 years of ice hockey in [[Manitoba]].\n\n'''Leagues'''\nThe leagues that would be involved in that first year were:\n*[[British Columbia Hockey League|British Columbia Junior Hockey League]] (BCJHL)\n*[[Alberta Junior Hockey League]] (AJHL)\n*[[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League|Saskatchewan Amateur Junior Hockey League]] (SAJHL)\n*[[Manitoba Junior Hockey League]] (MJHL)\n*[[Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League]] (SOJHL)\n*[[Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League]] (TBJHL)\n*[[Central Junior A Hockey League]] (CJHL)\n*[[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association]] (NOJHA)\n*[[Maritime Junior A Hockey League (1968\u20131971)|Maritime Junior A Hockey League]] (MJAHL)\n*[[New Brunswick Junior Hockey League]] (NBJHL)\n\nIn 1971, the [[Hockey Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland Amateur Hockey Association]] jumped on board by allowing their provincial Junior champion to compete in the Centennial Cup playdowns. `This lasted until 1977.  Also in 1971, the Maritime Junior A Hockey League folded, leaving the [[Charlottetown Islanders (MJHL)|Charlottetown Islanders]] (the defending [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]] champions) to enter the Centennial Cup playdowns as an independent team.  Also in 1971, the [[Newfoundland Junior A Hockey League]] entered the fray. In 1972, the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association]] folded when two of its teams ([[Sudbury Wolves]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]]) jumped to Major Junior. The Charlottetown Islanders closed their doors after a marginal performance in the 1972 playdowns.  Two new leagues came in 1972, the [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League (1972-1987)|Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]] was created as a rival league to the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League. The SOJHL was more in [[Southwestern Ontario]], while the OPJHL focused more on the [[Greater Toronto Area]].  The other new league was the [[Quebec Junior A Hockey League]].\n\nIn 1973, the [[Island Junior Hockey League (1973\u20131991)|Island Junior Hockey League]] of [[Prince Edward Island]] made the jump from Junior B to Junior A.  In 1975, the [[Eastern Junior A Hockey League]] ascended to Junior A from the Junior B ranks in [[Cape Breton Island]].  Then, in 1977, the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League|Metro Valley Junior Hockey League]] jumped from Junior B to Junior A in mainland [[Nova Scotia]].  After one year of playing head-to-head for the provincial Junior A title, the EJHL folded and left the MVJHL as the only league in Nova Scotia. After various attempts to create a stable Junior A system in Newfoundland, the NAHA and its teams pulled out of National play in 1977.  The Southern Ontario league folded in 1977, the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League]] was promoted to Junior A in 1978 and the [[NorMan Junior Hockey League]] was promoted to Junior A in [[Manitoba]] in 1979. A second league was founded in [[British Columbia]] in 1974, the [[Pacific Coast Junior Hockey League]] was created to compete with the British Columbia Junior Hockey League - this league was absorbed by the BCJHL in 1979.  A year later, the [[Peace-Cariboo Junior Hockey League]] was promoted from Junior B in East-Central British Columbia.  That same year, the Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League folded.  They were replaced by a single team, the [[Thunder Bay Flyers|Thunder Bay Kings]] later to be the two-time [[Centennial Cup]] champion [[Thunder Bay Flyers]].\n\nThe summer of 1982 saw the folding of the Quebec Junior A League.  In 1983, the [[New Brunswick Junior Hockey League]] folded and merged with the Metro Valley Junior Hockey League.  In 1985, the NorMan Junior Hockey League faltered and folded.  In 1987, the OPJHL, then known as the Ontario Junior Hockey League, folded after dropping to only four teams.  During the [[1988 Centennial Cup]] playoff run, the [[Black Lake Miners]] of [[Quebec]] were allowed to enter as an independent team.  That summer, the [[QJAAAHL|Quebec Provincial Junior Hockey League]] was formed, rebranded the [[Quebec Junior AAA Hockey League]] in 1997. In 1989, Newfoundland would take a second shot at Junior A with the promotion of the [[St. John's Junior Hockey League]]. The league dropped back to Junior B in 1991.  Also in 1991, the [[Island Junior Hockey League (1973\u20131991)|Island Junior Hockey League]] folded and merged with the Metro Valley league.  The Metro Valley League now had all three Maritime provinces incorporated in it and decided to change its name to the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League]].  Out West in 1991, the Peace-Cariboo league expanded south into the [[Kootenays]] and rebranded itself as the [[Rocky Mountain Junior Hockey League]].  In 1993, [[Southern Ontario]] came back in a big way with two leagues\u2014the [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]] and the [[Metro Junior A Hockey League]].  By 1998, the two leagues would merge under the Ontario Provincial banner with 37 teams under its belt.  In 1999, the Rocky Mountain Junior Hockey League folded.  In 2000, the Thunder Bay Flyers folded, having competed strictly in the [[United States Hockey League]] since the 1996-97 season.  A year later, their void was filled by the [[Superior International Junior Hockey League]].  In 2008, the Ontario Provincial League rebranded itself the Ontario Junior Hockey League, just to be divided into two leagues in 2009 (Central Canadian Hockey League and Ontario Junior A Hockey League), and be reunited in time for playoffs that year under the Ontario Junior Hockey League banner. In 2010, the Central Junior A Hockey League became the [[Central Canada Hockey League]].\n\n===Governance===\nIn 1990, the western Junior A leagues in Canada would form the Canada West Association. This organization would be the catalyst for the creation of the Canadian Junior A Hockey League in 1993. In 2008, the league was rebranded the \"Canadian Junior Hockey League\".\n\nThe CJAHL was formed in November 1993, with [[Fred Page]] appointed as chairman of the board, and [[Ron Boileau]] as president. The original leagues included:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esportsdesk.com/leagues/custom_page.cfm?leagueID=7647&clientID=2957&pageID=661|title=CJAHL History|website=Esportsdesk.com|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>\n*[[British Columbia Hockey League]]\n*[[Rocky Mountain Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Alberta Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Manitoba Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Thunder Bay Flyers]] (Representative of [[Hockey Northwestern Ontario]])\n*[[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]]\n*[[Metro Junior A Hockey League]]\n*[[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Central Junior A Hockey League]]\n*[[QJAAAHL|Quebec Provincial Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Maritime Junior A Hockey League]]\n\n====Trophies====\nTo determine a National Champion, the winners of each league playdown in three regional championships\u2014the [[Fred Page Cup]] (Eastern Region - [[Maritimes]], [[Quebec]], [[Ottawa District]]), the [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]] (Central Region - [[Southern Ontario]], [[Northeastern Ontario]], [[Northwestern Ontario]]), the [[ANAVET Cup]] (Western Region - [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]]), and the [[Doyle Cup]] (Pacific Region - [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]). The winners of the four regional playoffs and a host city play in the [[Centennial Cup]] national Junior A championship.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThere are a variety of trophies no longer used for the national playdown system.  The [[Abbott Cup]] and [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]] were awarded to Western and Eastern Canadian Champions respectively, the winners of which would square off for the [[Manitoba Centennial Cup]], the National Championship. The Abbott Cup was no longer a major trophy after the [[1989 Centennial Cup]] when both the [[Doyle Cup]] and [[ANAVET Cup]] champions were granted entrance into the Centennial Cup round robin.  The western leagues briefly returned to an all-western Canadian championship known as the [[Western Canada Cup]] from 2013 to 2017.  The Dudley Hewitt Cup became the Central Canada championship after the [[1978 Centennial Cup]], but might have been awarded to an All-Eastern Champion briefly after 1982. In the early 1990s, the [[Callaghan Cup]] was replaced by the [[Fred Page Cup]].  The Callaghan Cup was originally awarded to the Atlantic Junior \"A\" Champion between the winner of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]], but after the three major [[Maritimes|Maritime]] leagues merged and Newfoundland's final league departed the trophy had no real use.  In 1995, the [[Quebec Provincial Junior Hockey League]] donated the [[Fred Page Cup]] to create an Eastern Canadian championship between the Maritimes, Quebec, and the [[Ottawa District]] of [[Ontario]].  The [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]] used to represent all of Ontario and Quebec, but with so many leagues in that region in the mid-1990s and the MJAHL's champion getting a direct ride to the National Championship, the Fred Page Cup became a necessity.{{Awkward|date=March 2020}}{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe Manitoba Centennial Cup was the Grand Championship of Junior \"A\" hockey in Canada from 1970 until 1995, when it was replaced by the corporately sponsored [[Royal Bank Cup]], later known as the RBC Cup.  The sponsorship ended after the 2017-18 season; the championship is once again known as the Centennial Cup.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n\nIn 2005, the CJAHL created the CJAHL Prospects Game (now called the CJHL Prospects Game) where top players compete in a Team West versus Team East format for the President's Cup in front of the scouting community.  In 2006, in conjunction with the [[Hockey Canada]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]] was formed.  At the WJAC, a prospects team from the five western leagues and the five eastern leagues of the CJHL host national prospect teams from around the world in an international tournament hosted by a town with a CJHL franchise.

The champion of the Canadian Junior Hockey League wins the [[Centennial Cup]].\n\nThe CJHL spans the majority of Canada, from the [[Pacific Coast]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]].  The only regional organizations of [[Hockey Canada]] to currently not have member teams or a league are [[Hockey Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[Hockey North]].  In addition to Hockey NL and Hockey North, [[Hockey New Brunswick]] and [[Hockey PEI]] do not have their own leagues, but have teams from their region playing under [[Hockey Nova Scotia]] with the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginning===\nIn 1970, the [[Ontario Major Junior Hockey League]], [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]], and [[Western Hockey League|Western Canada Hockey League]] broke away from the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA) and became its own governing body (what would become the [[Canadian Hockey League]]).  These new \"Major Junior\" leagues were given exclusive permission to compete for the [[Memorial Cup]], which had been Canada's Junior \"A\" championship prior to 1970.\n\nIn May 1970, CAHA chairman [[Frank McKinnon]] tabled a motion at the organization's Annual General Meeting to allow the remaining Junior \"A\" leagues to compete at a national level for their own championship.  The motion was granted and McKinnon and the [[Hockey Manitoba|Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association]] donated the [[Manitoba Centennial Trophy]] to the new championship in honour of 100 years of ice hockey in [[Manitoba]].\n\n'''Leagues'''\nThe leagues that would be involved in that first year were:\n*[[British Columbia Hockey League|British Columbia Junior Hockey League]] (BCJHL)\n*[[Alberta Junior Hockey League]] (AJHL)\n*[[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League|Saskatchewan Amateur Junior Hockey League]] (SAJHL)\n*[[Manitoba Junior Hockey League]] (MJHL)\n*[[Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League]] (SOJHL)\n*[[Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League]] (TBJHL)\n*[[Central Junior A Hockey League]] (CJHL)\n*[[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association]] (NOJHA)\n*[[Maritime Junior A Hockey League (1968\u20131971)|Maritime Junior A Hockey League]] (MJAHL)\n*[[New Brunswick Junior Hockey League]] (NBJHL)\n\nIn 1971, the [[Hockey Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland Amateur Hockey Association]] jumped on board by allowing their provincial Junior champion to compete in the Centennial Cup playdowns.  This lasted until 1977.  Also in 1971, the Maritime Junior A Hockey League folded, leaving the [[Charlottetown Islanders (MJHL)|Charlottetown Islanders]] (the defending [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]] champions) to enter the Centennial Cup playdowns as an independent team.  Also in 1971, the [[Newfoundland Junior A Hockey League]] entered the fray.  In 1972, the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association]] folded when two of its teams ([[Sudbury Wolves]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]]) jumped to Major Junior.  The Charlottetown Islanders closed their doors after a marginal performance in the 1972 playdowns.  Two new leagues came in 1972, the [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League (1972-1987)|Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]] was created as a rival league to the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League.  The SOJHL was more in [[Southwestern Ontario]], while the OPJHL focused more on the [[Greater Toronto Area]].  The other new league was the [[Quebec Junior A Hockey League]].\n\nIn 1973, the [[Island Junior Hockey League (1973\u20131991)|Island Junior Hockey League]] of [[Prince Edward Island]] made the jump from Junior B to Junior A.  In 1975, the [[Eastern Junior A Hockey League]] ascended to Junior A from the Junior B ranks in [[Cape Breton Island]].  Then, in 1977, the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League|Metro Valley Junior Hockey League]] jumped from Junior B to Junior A in mainland [[Nova Scotia]].  After one year of playing head-to-head for the provincial Junior A title, the EJHL folded and left the MVJHL as the only league in Nova Scotia.  After various attempts to create a stable Junior A system in Newfoundland, the NAHA and its teams pulled out of National play in 1977.  The Southern Ontario league folded in 1977, the [[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League]] was promoted to Junior A in 1978 and the [[NorMan Junior Hockey League]] was promoted to Junior A in [[Manitoba]] in 1979.  A second league was founded in [[British Columbia]] in 1974, the [[Pacific Coast Junior Hockey League]] was created to compete with the British Columbia Junior Hockey League - this league was absorbed by the BCJHL in 1979.  A year later, the [[Peace-Cariboo Junior Hockey League]] was promoted from Junior B in East-Central British Columbia.  That same year, the Thunder Bay Junior A Hockey League folded.  They were replaced by a single team, the [[Thunder Bay Flyers|Thunder Bay Kings]] later to be the two-time [[Centennial Cup]] champion [[Thunder Bay Flyers]].\n\nThe summer of 1982 saw the folding of the Quebec Junior A League.  In 1983, the [[New Brunswick Junior Hockey League]] folded and merged with the Metro Valley Junior Hockey League.  In 1985, the NorMan Junior Hockey League faltered and folded.  In 1987, the OPJHL, then known as the Ontario Junior Hockey League, folded after dropping to only four teams.  During the [[1988 Centennial Cup]] playoff run, the [[Black Lake Miners]] of [[Quebec]] were allowed to enter as an independent team.  That summer, the [[QJAAAHL|Quebec Provincial Junior Hockey League]] was formed, rebranded the [[Quebec Junior AAA Hockey League]] in 1997.  In 1989, Newfoundland would take a second shot at Junior A with the promotion of the [[St. John's Junior Hockey League]].  The league dropped back to Junior B in 1991.  Also in 1991, the [[Island Junior Hockey League (1973\u20131991)|Island Junior Hockey League]] folded and merged with the Metro Valley league.  The Metro Valley League now had all three Maritime provinces incorporated in it and decided to change its name to the [[Maritime Junior A Hockey League]].  Out West in 1991, the Peace-Cariboo league expanded south into the [[Kootenays]] and rebranded itself as the [[Rocky Mountain Junior Hockey League]].  In 1993, [[Southern Ontario]] came back in a big way with two leagues\u2014the [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]] and the [[Metro Junior A Hockey League]].  By 1998, the two leagues would merge under the Ontario Provincial banner with 37 teams under its belt.  In 1999, the Rocky Mountain Junior Hockey League folded.  In 2000, the Thunder Bay Flyers folded, having competed strictly in the [[United States Hockey League]] since the 1996-97 season.  A year later, their void was filled by the [[Superior International Junior Hockey League]].  In 2008, the Ontario Provincial League rebranded itself the Ontario Junior Hockey League, just to be divided into two leagues in 2009 (Central Canadian Hockey League and Ontario Junior A Hockey League), and be reunited in time for playoffs that year under the Ontario Junior Hockey League banner.  In 2010, the Central Junior A Hockey League became the [[Central Canada Hockey League]].\n\n===Governance===\nIn 1990, the western Junior A leagues in Canada would form the Canada West Association.  This organization would be the catalyst for the creation of the Canadian Junior A Hockey League in 1993. In 2008, the league was rebranded the \"Canadian Junior Hockey League\".\n\nThe CJAHL was formed in November 1993, with [[Fred Page]] appointed as chairman of the board, and [[Ron Boileau]] as president. The original leagues included:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esportsdesk.com/leagues/custom_page.cfm?leagueID=7647&clientID=2957&pageID=661|title=CJAHL History|website=Esportsdesk.com|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>\n*[[British Columbia Hockey League]]\n*[[Rocky Mountain Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Alberta Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Manitoba Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Thunder Bay Flyers]] (Representative of [[Hockey Northwestern Ontario]])\n*[[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]]\n*[[Metro Junior A Hockey League]]\n*[[Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Central Junior A Hockey League]]\n*[[QJAAAHL|Quebec Provincial Junior Hockey League]]\n*[[Maritime Junior A Hockey League]]\n\n====Trophies====\nTo determine a National Champion, the winners of each league playdown in three regional championships\u2014the [[Fred Page Cup]] (Eastern Region - [[Maritimes]], [[Quebec]], [[Ottawa District]]), the [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]] (Central Region - [[Southern Ontario]], [[Northeastern Ontario]], [[Northwestern Ontario]]), the [[ANAVET Cup]] (Western Region - [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]]), and the [[Doyle Cup]] (Pacific Region - [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]).  The winners of the four regional playoffs and a host city play in the [[Centennial Cup]] national Junior A championship.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThere are a variety of trophies no longer used for the national playdown system.  The [[Abbott Cup]] and [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]] were awarded to Western and Eastern Canadian Champions respectively, the winners of which would square off for the [[Manitoba Centennial Cup]], the National Championship.  The Abbott Cup was no longer a major trophy after the [[1989 Centennial Cup]] when both the [[Doyle Cup]] and [[ANAVET Cup]] champions were granted entrance into the Centennial Cup round robin.  The western leagues briefly returned to an all-western Canadian championship known as the [[Western Canada Cup]] from 2013 to 2017.  The Dudley Hewitt Cup became the Central Canada championship after the [[1978 Centennial Cup]], but might have been awarded to an All-Eastern Champion briefly after 1982. In the early 1990s, the [[Callaghan Cup]] was replaced by the [[Fred Page Cup]].  The Callaghan Cup was originally awarded to the Atlantic Junior \"A\" Champion between the winner of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]], but after the three major [[Maritimes|Maritime]] leagues merged and Newfoundland's final league departed the trophy had no real use.  In 1995, the [[Quebec Provincial Junior Hockey League]] donated the [[Fred Page Cup]] to create an Eastern Canadian championship between the Maritimes, Quebec, and the [[Ottawa District]] of [[Ontario]].  The [[Dudley Hewitt Cup]] used to represent all of Ontario and Quebec, but with so many leagues in that region in the mid-1990s and the MJAHL's champion getting a direct ride to the National Championship, the Fred Page Cup became a necessity.{{Awkward|date=March 2020}}{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe Manitoba Centennial Cup was the Grand Championship of Junior \"A\" hockey in Canada from 1970 until 1995, when it was replaced by the corporately sponsored [[Royal Bank Cup]], later known as the RBC Cup.  The sponsorship ended after the 2017-18 season; the championship is once again known as the Centennial Cup.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n\nIn 2005, the CJAHL created the CJAHL Prospects Game (now called the CJHL Prospects Game) where top players compete in a Team West versus Team East format for the President's Cup in front of the scouting community.  In 2006, in conjunction with the [[Hockey Canada]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]] was formed.  At the WJAC, a prospects team from the five western leagues and the five eastern leagues of the CJHL host national prospect teams from around the world in an international tournament hosted by a town with a CJHL franchise.  From 2011 on, the CJHL Prospects Game became an event at the World Junior A Challenge.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Current leagues ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- \n!League !!

The songs were written by [[Yip Harburg|Edgar \"Yip\" Harburg]] (lyrics) and [[Harold Arlen]] (music). The musical score and the incidental music were composed by Stothart.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The Wizard of Oz Judy Garland Terry 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale and Terry the Dog as Toto]]\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are between 400 and 700 words.-->\n[[Dorothy Gale]] lives with her dog [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] on a [[Kansas]] farm belonging to her [[Aunt Em]] and [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]].  One day, Toto bites neighbor Miss Almira Gulch on the leg, leading her to obtain an order from the sheriff to [[Animal euthanasia|euthanize]] him.  In spite of Dorothy's pleas and Aunt Em's resistance, Miss Gulch takes Toto away in a basket, but Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy; she decides to run away in order to ensure that Toto won't be euthanized.  Not far from the farm, she meets [[Professor Marvel]], a kind fortune teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em may be dying of a broken heart.  Horrified, Dorothy rushes home as a storm approaches; a [[tornado]] forms, and Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the farmhands take shelter in the [[storm cellar]] as Dorothy arrives home. Unable to be heard begging for entry, Dorothy seeks shelter in her bedroom. The window is blown in from its frame and hits Dorothy on the head, knocking her unconscious.  The house is sent spinning into the air, and she awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle, who transforms into a witch on a broomstick.\n\nThe house lands in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]] in the [[Land of Oz]]. [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch of the North]] and the [[Munchkin]]s welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the [[Wicked Witch of the East]].  Her sister, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], arrives to claim her [[ruby slippers]], but Glinda transfers them onto Dorothy's feet first.  Enraged, the Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy and vanishes.  Glinda tells Dorothy to keep the slippers on and follow the [[yellow brick road]] to the [[Emerald City]], where she can ask the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] to help her return home.  On her journey, Dorothy meets the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who wants a brain, the [[Tin Woodman]], who desires a heart, and the [[Cowardly Lion]], who needs courage.  Dorothy invites them to accompany her to Emerald City, where they can also ask the Wizard for help.  Despite the Witch's attempts to stop them, they reach the Emerald City and are eventually allowed to see the Wizard, who appears as a ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke.  He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.\n\nAs the foursome and Toto make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch captures Dorothy and plots to kill her and retrieve the slippers. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don their uniforms and free Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase and surround them.  The Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, causing Dorothy to toss a bucket of water, inadvertently splashing the Witch, who melts away; the guards rejoice and give Dorothy her broomstick.\n\nUpon their return to the Emerald City, the Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises until Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the \"Wizard\" as a middle-aged man operating machinery and speaking into a microphone. Admitting to being a [[humbug]], he insists that he is \"a good man but a bad wizard.\" The Wizard then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his [[hot air balloon]], revealing that he is also from Kansas and was originally a carnival worker before a tornado brought him to the Emerald City, whereupon he accepted the job as Wizard due to [[Great Depression|hard times]].\n\nAs Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, Toto becomes distracted by a cat and leaps from Dorothy's arms. As Dorothy pursues Toto, the balloon disembarks with the Wizard, leaving her behind. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy that the ruby slippers have the power to return her to Kansas. After sharing a tearful farewell with Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, Dorothy follows Glinda's instructions: she must close her eyes, tap her heels together three times, and state repeatedly, \"There's no place like home.\" Dorothy complies and she wakes up in her bedroom surrounded by her family and friends, including Toto.  Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real and says she will never run away from home again before declaring, \"There's no place like home!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{For|a list of all the munchkin actors/actresses in the film|Munchkin#Actors and actresses}} <!--There were a-lot of roles with the munchkin characters-->\n\n[[File:The Wizard of Oz Lahr Garland Bolger Haley 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8| The [[Cowardly Lion]], [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]], and [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]] are the film's main characters.]]\nCast listing:\n* [[Judy Garland]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as (in order of appearance) Professor Marvel/The Gatekeeper/The Carriage Driver/The Guard/[[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard of Oz]]\n* [[Ray Bolger]] as \"Hunk\" / [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]]\n* [[Jack Haley]] as \"Hickory\" / [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]]\n* [[Bert Lahr]] as \"Zeke\" / The [[Cowardly Lion]]\n* [[Billie Burke]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]]\n* [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Miss Almira Gulch / [[Wicked Witch of the West|The Wicked Witch of the West]]\n* [[Charley Grapewin]] as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]\n* [[Pat Walshe]] as Nikko the [[Winged monkeys|Winged Monkey]] King\n* [[Clara Blandick]] as [[Auntie Em]]\n* [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]\n* [[Mitchell Lewis]] as the Winkie Guard Captain (credited only in the [[IMAX]] version)\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as the voice of [[Juliet]] in the Tin Man's song \"[[If I Only Had a Heart]]\" (uncredited)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-adriana-caselotti-1277975.html |title=Obituary: Adriana Caselotti |last=Sibley |first=Brian |date=February 10, 1997 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProduction on the film began when [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytale folklore could still be successful.<ref name=\"Fricke2\">{{Cite book |title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History |last=Fricke |first=John |authorlink=John Fricke |last2=Scarfone |first2=Jay |last3=Stillman |first3=William |year=1986 |publisher=Warner Books, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-446-51446-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 }}</ref><ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" /> In January 1938, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] bought the rights to L. Frank Baum\u2019s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|hugely popular novel]] from [[Samuel Goldwyn]], who had toyed with the idea of making the film as a vehicle for [[Eddie Cantor]] who was under contract to the Goldwyn studios and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" />\n\nThe script went through several writers and revisions before the final shooting.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s assistant, [[William Cannon (director)|William H. Cannon]], had submitted a brief four-page outline.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements of the story. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was literally scaring crows from cornfields, while the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity, torture that softened him into somebody gentler and kinder.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> His vision was similar to [[Larry Semon]]'s [[The Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] of the story in which the magical elements are absent.\n\nAfterward, LeRoy hired screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who soon delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes and a few weeks later, a further 56 pages. He also hired [[Noel Langley]] and poet [[Ogden Nash]] to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline, Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. He{{who|date=August 2017}} turned in three more, this time incorporating the songs that had been written by [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]]. [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They would be responsible for making sure the story stayed true to the Baum book. However, producer [[Arthur Freed]] was unhappy with their work and reassigned it to Langley.<ref name=Coan>{{cite news|last=Coan|first=Stephen|title=KZN's very own screen wizard|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&global%5B_id%5D=73897|accessdate=April 24, 2014|newspaper=The Witness|date=December 22, 2011}}</ref> During filming, [[Victor Fleming]] and [[John Lee Mahin]] revised the script further, adding and cutting some scenes.

And he \u2013 there was eleven screenwriters on that \u2013 and he pulled the whole thing together, wrote his own lines and gave the thing a coherence and unity which made it a work of art.

Because of a perceived need to attract a youthful audience through appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called \"The Jitterbug\", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical and [[operetta]] and went up against Dorothy in a singing contest in which her swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for [[Betty Jaynes (actress)|Betty Jaynes]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fordin | first = Hugh | title = World of Entertainment | publisher = Avon Books  | location =  | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-380-00754-7 }}</ref> The plan was later dropped.\n\nAnother scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was an epilogue scene back in Kansas after Dorothy's return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for an agricultural college and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, but is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, \"I think I'll miss you most of all.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433010|title=Hollywood Reporter|date= October 20, 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\nMuch attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others. It took the studio's art department almost a week to settle on the shade of yellow used for the yellow brick road.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Gerald |year=2001 |title=Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland |publisher=Delta |isbn=978-0-385-33515-7 |page=94}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{See also|Munchkin#In the 1939 film}}\n\nSeveral actresses were reportedly considered for the part of Dorothy, including [[Shirley Temple]], at the time, the most prominent child star; [[Deanna Durbin]], a relative newcomer, with a recognised operatic voice; and [[Judy Garland]], the most experienced of the three. Officially, the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues.\n\n[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ebsen's costume test as the Tin Man]]\n[[Ray Bolger]] was originally cast as the Tin Man and [[Buddy Ebsen]] was to play the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol [[Fred Stone]] had done [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|on stage in 1902]]; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, \"I'm not a tin performer; I'm fluid\"), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired.<ref name=\"cemeteryguide.com\">[http://www.cemeteryguide.com/bolger.html Cemetery Guide, ''Hollywood Remains to Be Seen'', Mark Masek].</ref> Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow's distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous \"wobbly-walk\" of Stone's Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.<ref>Fricke, John and Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref>\n\n[[Bert Lahr]] was signed for the Cowardly Lion on July 25, 1938; the next month, [[Charles Grapewin]] was cast as Uncle Henry on August 12.\n\n[[W. C. Fields]] was originally chosen for the title role of the Wizard, a role turned down by [[Ed Wynn]] as he thought the part was too small, but the studio ran out of patience after protracted haggling over Fields' fee. [[Wallace Beery]] lobbied for the role, but the studio refused to spare him during the long shooting schedule. Instead, another contract player, [[Frank Morgan]], was cast on September 22.\n\nAn extensive talent search produced over a hundred [[Dwarfism|little people]] to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to already be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor [[Jerry Maren]], the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to ${{Inflation|index=US|value=125|start_year=1938|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). [[Meinhardt Raabe]], who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary ''The Making of the Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They then had to photograph and catalog each Munchkin in his or her costume so that they could correctly apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.\n\n[[Gale Sondergaard]] was originally cast as the Wicked Witch. She became unhappy when the witch's persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the wicked queen in Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'') into the familiar \"ugly hag\". She turned down the role and was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the [[DVD]] that she had no regrets about turning down the part, and would go on to play a glamorous villainess in Fox's version of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[The Blue Bird (1940 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' in 1940; Margaret Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939).\n\nAccording to Aljean Harmetz, the \"gone-to-seed\" coat worn by Morgan as the wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum's widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a concocted studio rumor.<ref>[[Michael Patrick Hearn|Hearn, Michael Patrick]].

Thorpe initially shot about two weeks of footage, nine days in total, involving Dorothy's first encounter with the Scarecrow, as well as a number of sequences in the Wicked Witch's castle, such as Dorothy's rescue, which, though unreleased, comprises the only footage of [[Buddy Ebsen]]'s Tin Man.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Practical PHP and MySQL web site databases : a simplified approach|last=West, Adrian W.|isbn=978-1430260776|location=New York|oclc=859580733|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Ebsen replaced by Haley ====\nThe production faced the challenge of simulating the Tin Man's costume.

As director, Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor's creative realignment, as producer LeRoy had already pronounced his satisfaction with the new course the film was taking.\n\nProduction on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months, from October 1938 to March 1939. Most of the cast worked six days a week and had to arrive as early as 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to be fitted with makeup and costumes, and often did not leave until 7 pm or later. Cumbersome makeup and costumes were made even more uncomfortable by the daylight-bright lighting the early Technicolor process required, which could heat the set to over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C). Bolger later said that the frightening nature of the costumes prevented most of the Oz principals from eating in the studio commissary;<ref>{{Cite AV media|people=Interview of [[Ray Bolger]]|title=The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic|publisher=Jack Haley Jr Productions|date=1990}}</ref> the toxicity of Hamilton's copper-based makeup forced her to eat a liquid diet on shoot days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leopold|first1=Ted|title='The Wizard of Oz' at 75: Did you know...?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/25/showbiz/the-wizard-of-oz-75th-anniversary/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=September 1, 2017|date=August 25, 2014|quote=Margaret Hamilton's copper-based makeup as the Wicked Witch was poisonous, so she lived on a liquid diet during the film, and the makeup was carefully cleaned off her each day.}}</ref> It took as many as twelve takes to have Toto run alongside the actors as they skipped down the yellow brick road.\n\nAll the Oz sequences were filmed in three-strip Technicolor.<ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\">''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Making of a Movie Classic'' (1990).

The first take ran well, but in the second take, the burst of fire came too soon as a result of which the flames set fire to her green and copper-based face paint, causing third-degree burns on her hands and face.

When the film became a hit in 1939, Vidor chose not to take public credit for his contribution until the death of his friend Fleming in 1949.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Special effects, makeup and costumes===\n[[A.

Gillespie used [[muslin]] cloth to make the tornado flexible after a previous attempt with [[rubber]] failed. He hung the 35 feet of muslin from a steel [[gantry crane|gantry]] and connected the bottom to a rod. By moving the gantry and rod, he was able to create the illusion of a tornado moving across the stage.

The music was composed by [[Harold Arlen]], and the lyrics were written by [[Yip Harburg]], both of whom won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"Over the Rainbow\". The song was ranked first in two lists: the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s \"[[Songs of the Century|365 Songs of the Century]]\".\n\nMGM composer [[Herbert Stothart]], a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in recognition of his original score.\n\n[[Georgie Stoll]] was associate conductor and screen credit was given to [[George Bassman]], [[Murray Cutter]], [[Ken Darby]] and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements (as usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)\n\nThe songs were recorded in the studio's scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Therefore, while he had to be dropped from the cast due to illness from the aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained in the soundtrack (as noted in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). In the group vocals of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", his voice can be heard. Haley spoke with a distinct [[Boston accent]], thus did not pronounce the ''r'' in ''wizard''. By contrast, Ebsen was a [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]], like Garland, and pronounced it. Haley rerecorded Ebsen's solo parts later.\n\nBolger's original recording of \"[[If I Only Had a Brain]]\" had been far more sedate compared to the version heard in the film; during the filming, Cukor and LeRoy decided that a more energetic rendition would better suit Dorothy's initial meeting with the Scarecrow and the song was rerecorded as such. At first thought to be lost, a copy of the original version was discovered in 2009.<ref>[http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513210807/http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain |date=May 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n====Song list====\n* \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale\n* Munchkinland Sequence:\n** \"Come Out&nbsp;{{nbsp}}...\" \u2013 Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins\n** \"It Really Was No Miracle\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy, Billy Bletcher and the Munchkins\n** \"We Thank You Very Sweetly\" \u2013 Frank Cucksey and Joseph Koziel\n** \"[[Ding-Dong!

Hail! The Witch is Dead!\", sung upon the return to the Emerald City]]\nSome musical pieces filmed were deleted in the editing process.\n\nThe song \"The Jitterbug\", written in a swing style, was intended for the sequence in which the group is journeying to the Witch's castle. Due to time constraints, the song was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage for the song has been lost, although silent home film footage of rehearsals for the number has survived. The sound recording for the song, however, is intact and was included in the two-CD [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] deluxe edition of the film soundtrack, as well as on the VHS and DVD editions of the film. A reference to \"The Jitterbug\" remains in the film: the Witch remarks to her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because \"I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.\"\n\nAnother musical number cut before release occurred right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" (blended with \"[[We're Off to See the Wizard]]\" and \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\") with the lyrics altered to \"Hail! Hail! The Witch is Dead!\" This started with the Witch's guard saying \"Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!\" and dissolved to a huge celebration of the citizens of the Emerald City singing the song as they accompany Dorothy and her friends to see the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio still exists and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record deluxe edition of the film soundtrack.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack \u2013 The Deluxe Edition'', 2-CD set, original recording remastered, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] # 71964 (July 18, 1995)</ref>\n\nIn addition, a brief reprise of \"Over the Rainbow\" was intended to be sung by Garland while Dorothy is trapped in the Witch's castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. The original soundtrack recording still exists, however, and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993 onwards.<ref>Warner Bros. 2005 ''The Wizard of Oz'' Deluxe DVD edition, program notes and audio extras.</ref>\n\n====Underscoring====\nExtensive edits in the film's final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film. However, the film was fully [[Underscoring|underscored]], with instrumental snippets from the film's various [[leitmotif]]s throughout. There was also some recognizable popular music, including:\n* Excerpts from [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s \"The Happy Farmer\", at several points early in the film, including the opening scene when Dorothy and Toto are hurrying home after their encounter with Miss Gulch, when Toto escapes from her, and when the house is \"riding\" the tornado.\n* An excerpt of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s \"Opus 16, #2\", when Toto escapes from the Witch's castle.\n* An excerpt of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Night on Bald Mountain]]\", when Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion are trying to escape from the Witch's castle.\n* \"[[In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree]]\", when Dorothy and the Scarecrow discover the anthropomorphic apple trees.\n* \"[[Gaudeamus Igitur]]\" during the Wizard's presentation of awards to the group.\n* \"[[Home! Sweet Home!]]\", in part of the underscore of the closing scene, at Dorothy's house in Kansas.\n\n(The above list is excerpted from the liner notes on the Rhino Records collection.)\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Principal photography]] concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939; nonetheless, reshoots and pick-up shots were filmed throughout April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. After the deletion of the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise during subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back one more time to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" scene without the song; the footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was simply reused.\n\nAfter Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pick-ups for the scene in which she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy chose to have stand-in Betty Danko perform the scene, instead; as a result, Danko was severely injured doing the scene due to a malfunction in the smoke mechanism.<ref>''The Making of the Wizard of Oz \u2013 Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM \u2013 and the Miracle of Production #1060'', 10th Edition, Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc./Random House, 1989.</ref>\n\nAt this point, the film began a long arduous post-production. [[Herbert Stothart]] had to compose the film's background score, while [[A. Arnold Gillespie]] had to perfect the various special effects that the film required, including many of the rear projection shots. The MGM art department also had to create the various matte paintings for the background of many of the scenes.\n\nOne significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone; however, because this was too expensive and labor-intensive, it was abandoned and MGM used a simpler and less expensive variation of the process. During the reshoots in May, the inside of the farm house was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame; once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland; if one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy as she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\n\n[[Test screening]]s of the film began on June 5, 1939.<ref name=\"geo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|title=\"The Wizard of Oz\"...&nbsp;A Movie Timeline|author=Jim's \"Wizard of Oz\" Website Directory|publisher=geocities.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114114015/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|archivedate=November 14, 2007|accessdate=September 10, 2007}}</ref> ''Oz'' initially ran nearly two hours long. LeRoy and Fleming knew that at least 15 minutes needed to be deleted to get the film down to a manageable running time; the average film in 1939 ran for just about 90 minutes. Three sneak previews in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California]], helped guide LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\n\nOne song that was almost deleted was \"Over the Rainbow\". MGM had felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the [[Academy Award]] for Best Song of the Year, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her theme song.\n\nAfter the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Wizard of Oz (Oconomowoc) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A memorial commemorating the film's world premiere at the Strand Theatre in [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin]] on August 12, 1939]]\n\nThe film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] on August 10, 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/7892|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> The film's first sneak preview was held in [[San Bernardino, California]].<ref>Down The Yellow Brick Road: The Making of The Wizard Of Oz\"McClelland, 1976 Publisher Pyramid Publications (Harcourt Brace Jonavich)</ref>\nThe film was previewed in three [[test market]]s: on August 11, 1939, at [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and [[Dennis, Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite web| title= Hello, yellow brick road | url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/51361182.html | date= July 21, 2009 | first= Scott|last= Williams | publisher= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | accessdate=October 21, 2011| quote=John Fricke, a historian who has written books about ''The Wizard of Oz'', said that MGM executives arranged advance screenings in a handful of small communities to find out how audiences would respond to the musical adventure, which cost nearly $3 million to produce.

While these were considerable earnings, the high production cost, in association with various distribution and other costs, meant the movie initially recorded a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/> It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5 million (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.5|1949|r=0}}}} million today). However, for all the risks and cost that MGM undertook to produce the film, it was considered at least more successful than anyone thought it would be. According to Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography ''Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland'', \"Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures.\" Finch also writes that after the success of the film, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top-ten box office stars in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finch |first=Christofer |title=Rainbow: The Stormy Life Of Judy Garland |year=1975 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-28407-5 |page=84}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and honors===\n\n====Academy Awards====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Awards\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], but lost to ''Gone with the Wind'', also directed by Fleming.

One day, Toto bites neighbor Miss Almira Gulch on the leg, leading her to obtain an order from the sheriff to [[Animal euthanasia|euthanize]] him.  In spite of Dorothy's pleas and Aunt Em's resistance, Miss Gulch takes Toto away in a basket, but Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy; she decides to run away in order to ensure that Toto won't be euthanized.  Not far from the farm, she meets [[Professor Marvel]], a kind fortune teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em may be dying of a broken heart.  Horrified, Dorothy rushes home as a storm approaches; a [[tornado]] forms, and Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the farmhands take shelter in the [[storm cellar]] as Dorothy arrives home. Unable to be heard begging for entry, Dorothy seeks shelter in her bedroom. The window is blown in from its frame and hits Dorothy on the head, knocking her unconscious.  The house is sent spinning into the air, and she awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle, who transforms into a witch on a broomstick.\n\nThe house lands in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]] in the [[Land of Oz]]. [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch of the North]] and the [[Munchkin]]s welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the [[Wicked Witch of the East]].  Her sister, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], arrives to claim her [[ruby slippers]], but Glinda transfers them onto Dorothy's feet first.  Enraged, the Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy and vanishes.  Glinda tells Dorothy to keep the slippers on and follow the [[yellow brick road]] to the [[Emerald City]], where she can ask the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] to help her return home.  On her journey, Dorothy meets the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who wants a brain, the [[Tin Woodman]], who desires a heart, and the [[Cowardly Lion]], who needs courage.  Dorothy invites them to accompany her to Emerald City, where they can also ask the Wizard for help.  Despite the Witch's attempts to stop them, they reach the Emerald City and are eventually allowed to see the Wizard, who appears as a ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke.  He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.\n\nAs the foursome and Toto make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch captures Dorothy and plots to kill her and retrieve the slippers. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don their uniforms and free Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase and surround them.  The Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, causing Dorothy to toss a bucket of water, inadvertently splashing the Witch, who melts away; the guards rejoice and give Dorothy her broomstick.\n\nUpon their return to the Emerald City, the Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises until Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the \"Wizard\" as a middle-aged man operating machinery and speaking into a microphone. Admitting to being a [[humbug]], he insists that he is \"a good man but a bad wizard.\" The Wizard then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his [[hot air balloon]], revealing that he is also from Kansas and was originally a carnival worker before a tornado brought him to the Emerald City, whereupon he accepted the job as Wizard due to [[Great Depression|hard times]].\n\nAs Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, Toto becomes distracted by a cat and leaps from Dorothy's arms. As Dorothy pursues Toto, the balloon disembarks with the Wizard, leaving her behind. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy that the ruby slippers have the power to return her to Kansas. After sharing a tearful farewell with Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, Dorothy follows Glinda's instructions: she must close her eyes, tap her heels together three times, and state repeatedly, \"There's no place like home.\" Dorothy complies and she wakes up in her bedroom surrounded by her family and friends, including Toto.  Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real and says she will never run away from home again before declaring, \"There's no place like home!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{For|a list of all the munchkin actors/actresses in the film|Munchkin#Actors and actresses}} <!--There were a-lot of roles with the munchkin characters-->\n\n[[File:The Wizard of Oz Lahr Garland Bolger Haley 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8| The [[Cowardly Lion]], [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]], and [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]] are the film's main characters.]]\nCast listing:\n* [[Judy Garland]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as (in order of appearance) Professor Marvel/The Gatekeeper/The Carriage Driver/The Guard/[[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard of Oz]]\n* [[Ray Bolger]] as \"Hunk\" / [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]]\n* [[Jack Haley]] as \"Hickory\" / [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]]\n* [[Bert Lahr]] as \"Zeke\" / The [[Cowardly Lion]]\n* [[Billie Burke]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]]\n* [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Miss Almira Gulch / [[Wicked Witch of the West|The Wicked Witch of the West]]\n* [[Charley Grapewin]] as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]\n* [[Pat Walshe]] as Nikko the [[Winged monkeys|Winged Monkey]] King\n* [[Clara Blandick]] as [[Auntie Em]]\n* [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]\n* [[Mitchell Lewis]] as the Winkie Guard Captain (credited only in the [[IMAX]] version)\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as the voice of [[Juliet]] in the Tin Man's song \"[[If I Only Had a Heart]]\" (uncredited)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-adriana-caselotti-1277975.html |title=Obituary: Adriana Caselotti |last=Sibley |first=Brian |date=February 10, 1997 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProduction on the film began when [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytale folklore could still be successful.<ref name=\"Fricke2\">{{Cite book |title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History |last=Fricke |first=John |authorlink=John Fricke |last2=Scarfone |first2=Jay |last3=Stillman |first3=William |year=1986 |publisher=Warner Books, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-446-51446-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 }}</ref><ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" /> In January 1938, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] bought the rights to L. Frank Baum\u2019s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|hugely popular novel]] from [[Samuel Goldwyn]], who had toyed with the idea of making the film as a vehicle for [[Eddie Cantor]] who was under contract to the Goldwyn studios and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" />\n\nThe script went through several writers and revisions before the final shooting.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s assistant, [[William Cannon (director)|William H. Cannon]], had submitted a brief four-page outline.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements of the story. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was literally scaring crows from cornfields, while the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity, torture that softened him into somebody gentler and kinder.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> His vision was similar to [[Larry Semon]]'s [[The Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] of the story in which the magical elements are absent.\n\nAfterward, LeRoy hired screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who soon delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes and a few weeks later, a further 56 pages. He also hired [[Noel Langley]] and poet [[Ogden Nash]] to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline, Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. He{{who|date=August 2017}} turned in three more, this time incorporating the songs that had been written by [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]]. [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They would be responsible for making sure the story stayed true to the Baum book.

Because of a perceived need to attract a youthful audience through appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called \"The Jitterbug\", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical and [[operetta]] and went up against Dorothy in a singing contest in which her swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for [[Betty Jaynes (actress)|Betty Jaynes]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fordin | first = Hugh | title = World of Entertainment | publisher = Avon Books  | location =  | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-380-00754-7 }}</ref> The plan was later dropped.\n\nAnother scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was an epilogue scene back in Kansas after Dorothy's return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for an agricultural college and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, but is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, \"I think I'll miss you most of all.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433010|title=Hollywood Reporter|date= October 20, 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\nMuch attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others.

Officially, the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues.\n\n[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ebsen's costume test as the Tin Man]]\n[[Ray Bolger]] was originally cast as the Tin Man and [[Buddy Ebsen]] was to play the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol [[Fred Stone]] had done [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|on stage in 1902]]; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, \"I'm not a tin performer; I'm fluid\"), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired.<ref name=\"cemeteryguide.com\">[http://www.cemeteryguide.com/bolger.html Cemetery Guide, ''Hollywood Remains to Be Seen'', Mark Masek].</ref> Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow's distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous \"wobbly-walk\" of Stone's Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.<ref>Fricke, John and Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref>\n\n[[Bert Lahr]] was signed for the Cowardly Lion on July 25, 1938; the next month, [[Charles Grapewin]] was cast as Uncle Henry on August 12.\n\n[[W. C. Fields]] was originally chosen for the title role of the Wizard, a role turned down by [[Ed Wynn]] as he thought the part was too small, but the studio ran out of patience after protracted haggling over Fields' fee. [[Wallace Beery]] lobbied for the role, but the studio refused to spare him during the long shooting schedule. Instead, another contract player, [[Frank Morgan]], was cast on September 22.\n\nAn extensive talent search produced over a hundred [[Dwarfism|little people]] to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to already be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor [[Jerry Maren]], the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to ${{Inflation|index=US|value=125|start_year=1938|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). [[Meinhardt Raabe]], who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary ''The Making of the Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They then had to photograph and catalog each Munchkin in his or her costume so that they could correctly apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.\n\n[[Gale Sondergaard]] was originally cast as the Wicked Witch. She became unhappy when the witch's persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the wicked queen in Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'') into the familiar \"ugly hag\". She turned down the role and was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the [[DVD]] that she had no regrets about turning down the part, and would go on to play a glamorous villainess in Fox's version of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[The Blue Bird (1940 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' in 1940; Margaret Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939).\n\nAccording to Aljean Harmetz, the \"gone-to-seed\" coat worn by Morgan as the wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum's widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a concocted studio rumor.<ref>[[Michael Patrick Hearn|Hearn, Michael Patrick]].

Thorpe initially shot about two weeks of footage, nine days in total, involving Dorothy's first encounter with the Scarecrow, as well as a number of sequences in the Wicked Witch's castle, such as Dorothy's rescue, which, though unreleased, comprises the only footage of [[Buddy Ebsen]]'s Tin Man.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Practical PHP and MySQL web site databases : a simplified approach|last=West, Adrian W.|isbn=978-1430260776|location=New York|oclc=859580733|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Ebsen replaced by Haley ====\nThe production faced the challenge of simulating the Tin Man's costume.

The first take ran well, but in the second take, the burst of fire came too soon as a result of which the flames set fire to her green and copper-based face paint, causing third-degree burns on her hands and face. She spent three months healing before returning to work.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Movie Musicals|last=Aylesworth|first=Thomas|publisher=Gallery Books|year=1984|isbn=978-0-8317-4467-0|location=New York City|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmoviemu0000ayle/page/97 97]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmoviemu0000ayle/page/97}}</ref>\n\n====King Vidor's finishing work as director====\nOn February 12, 1939, Fleming hastily replaced Cukor in directing ''Gone with the Wind''; the next day, Fleming's friend [[King Vidor]] was assigned as director by the studio in order to finish the filming of ''The Wizard of Oz'' (mainly the early sepia-toned Kansas sequences, including Garland's singing of \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" and the [[tornado]]). When the film became a hit in 1939, Vidor chose not to take public credit for his contribution until the death of his friend Fleming in 1949.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Special effects, makeup and costumes===\n[[A. Arnold Gillespie|Arnold Gillespie]] was the [[special effect]]s director for the film. Gillespie worked with the production using five of six visual effects categories for the movie.<ref name=\"Care 45\u201347\"/> To develop the [[tornado]] scene was especially costly. Gillespie used [[muslin]] cloth to make the tornado flexible after a previous attempt with [[rubber]] failed. He hung the 35 feet of muslin from a steel [[gantry crane|gantry]] and connected the bottom to a rod. By moving the gantry and rod, he was able to create the illusion of a tornado moving across the stage. [[Fuller's earth]] was sprayed from both the top and bottom using compressed air hoses to complete the effect.

The music was composed by [[Harold Arlen]], and the lyrics were written by [[Yip Harburg]], both of whom won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"Over the Rainbow\". The song was ranked first in two lists: the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s \"[[Songs of the Century|365 Songs of the Century]]\".\n\nMGM composer [[Herbert Stothart]], a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in recognition of his original score.\n\n[[Georgie Stoll]] was associate conductor and screen credit was given to [[George Bassman]], [[Murray Cutter]], [[Ken Darby]] and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements (as usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)\n\nThe songs were recorded in the studio's scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Therefore, while he had to be dropped from the cast due to illness from the aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained in the soundtrack (as noted in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). In the group vocals of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", his voice can be heard. Haley spoke with a distinct [[Boston accent]], thus did not pronounce the ''r'' in ''wizard''. By contrast, Ebsen was a [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]], like Garland, and pronounced it. Haley rerecorded Ebsen's solo parts later.\n\nBolger's original recording of \"[[If I Only Had a Brain]]\" had been far more sedate compared to the version heard in the film; during the filming, Cukor and LeRoy decided that a more energetic rendition would better suit Dorothy's initial meeting with the Scarecrow and the song was rerecorded as such. At first thought to be lost, a copy of the original version was discovered in 2009.<ref>[http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513210807/http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain |date=May 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n====Song list====\n* \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale\n* Munchkinland Sequence:\n** \"Come Out&nbsp;{{nbsp}}...\" \u2013 Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins\n** \"It Really Was No Miracle\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy, Billy Bletcher and the Munchkins\n** \"We Thank You Very Sweetly\" \u2013 Frank Cucksey and Joseph Koziel\n** \"[[Ding-Dong!

Hail! The Witch is Dead!\", sung upon the return to the Emerald City]]\nSome musical pieces filmed were deleted in the editing process.\n\nThe song \"The Jitterbug\", written in a swing style, was intended for the sequence in which the group is journeying to the Witch's castle. Due to time constraints, the song was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage for the song has been lost, although silent home film footage of rehearsals for the number has survived. The sound recording for the song, however, is intact and was included in the two-CD [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] deluxe edition of the film soundtrack, as well as on the VHS and DVD editions of the film. A reference to \"The Jitterbug\" remains in the film: the Witch remarks to her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because \"I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.\"\n\nAnother musical number cut before release occurred right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" (blended with \"[[We're Off to See the Wizard]]\" and \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\") with the lyrics altered to \"Hail! Hail! The Witch is Dead!\" This started with the Witch's guard saying \"Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!\" and dissolved to a huge celebration of the citizens of the Emerald City singing the song as they accompany Dorothy and her friends to see the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio still exists and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record deluxe edition of the film soundtrack.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack \u2013 The Deluxe Edition'', 2-CD set, original recording remastered, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] # 71964 (July 18, 1995)</ref>\n\nIn addition, a brief reprise of \"Over the Rainbow\" was intended to be sung by Garland while Dorothy is trapped in the Witch's castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. The original soundtrack recording still exists, however, and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993 onwards.<ref>Warner Bros. 2005 ''The Wizard of Oz'' Deluxe DVD edition, program notes and audio extras.</ref>\n\n====Underscoring====\nExtensive edits in the film's final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film. However, the film was fully [[Underscoring|underscored]], with instrumental snippets from the film's various [[leitmotif]]s throughout. There was also some recognizable popular music, including:\n* Excerpts from [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s \"The Happy Farmer\", at several points early in the film, including the opening scene when Dorothy and Toto are hurrying home after their encounter with Miss Gulch, when Toto escapes from her, and when the house is \"riding\" the tornado.\n* An excerpt of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s \"Opus 16, #2\", when Toto escapes from the Witch's castle.\n* An excerpt of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Night on Bald Mountain]]\", when Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion are trying to escape from the Witch's castle.\n* \"[[In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree]]\", when Dorothy and the Scarecrow discover the anthropomorphic apple trees.\n* \"[[Gaudeamus Igitur]]\" during the Wizard's presentation of awards to the group.\n* \"[[Home! Sweet Home!]]\", in part of the underscore of the closing scene, at Dorothy's house in Kansas.\n\n(The above list is excerpted from the liner notes on the Rhino Records collection.)\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Principal photography]] concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939; nonetheless, reshoots and pick-up shots were filmed throughout April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. After the deletion of the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise during subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back one more time to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" scene without the song; the footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was simply reused.\n\nAfter Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pick-ups for the scene in which she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy chose to have stand-in Betty Danko perform the scene, instead; as a result, Danko was severely injured doing the scene due to a malfunction in the smoke mechanism.<ref>''The Making of the Wizard of Oz \u2013 Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM \u2013 and the Miracle of Production #1060'', 10th Edition, Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc./Random House, 1989.</ref>\n\nAt this point, the film began a long arduous post-production. [[Herbert Stothart]] had to compose the film's background score, while [[A. Arnold Gillespie]] had to perfect the various special effects that the film required, including many of the rear projection shots. The MGM art department also had to create the various matte paintings for the background of many of the scenes.\n\nOne significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone; however, because this was too expensive and labor-intensive, it was abandoned and MGM used a simpler and less expensive variation of the process. During the reshoots in May, the inside of the farm house was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame; once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland; if one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy as she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\n\n[[Test screening]]s of the film began on June 5, 1939.<ref name=\"geo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|title=\"The Wizard of Oz\"...&nbsp;A Movie Timeline|author=Jim's \"Wizard of Oz\" Website Directory|publisher=geocities.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114114015/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|archivedate=November 14, 2007|accessdate=September 10, 2007}}</ref> ''Oz'' initially ran nearly two hours long. LeRoy and Fleming knew that at least 15 minutes needed to be deleted to get the film down to a manageable running time; the average film in 1939 ran for just about 90 minutes. Three sneak previews in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California]], helped guide LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\n\nOne song that was almost deleted was \"Over the Rainbow\". MGM had felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the [[Academy Award]] for Best Song of the Year, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her theme song.\n\nAfter the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Wizard of Oz (Oconomowoc) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A memorial commemorating the film's world premiere at the Strand Theatre in [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin]] on August 12, 1939]]\n\nThe film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] on August 10, 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/7892|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> The film's first sneak preview was held in [[San Bernardino, California]].<ref>Down The Yellow Brick Road: The Making of The Wizard Of Oz\"McClelland, 1976 Publisher Pyramid Publications (Harcourt Brace Jonavich)</ref>\nThe film was previewed in three [[test market]]s: on August 11, 1939, at [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and [[Dennis, Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite web| title= Hello, yellow brick road | url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/51361182.html | date= July 21, 2009 | first= Scott|last= Williams | publisher= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | accessdate=October 21, 2011| quote=John Fricke, a historian who has written books about ''The Wizard of Oz'', said that MGM executives arranged advance screenings in a handful of small communities to find out how audiences would respond to the musical adventure, which cost nearly $3 million to produce.

[[Frank Nugent]] considered the film a \"delightful piece of wonder-working which had the youngsters' eyes shining and brought a quietly amused gleam to the wiser ones of the oldsters.

Nor can they, without a few betraying jolts and split-screen overlappings, bring down from the sky the great soap bubble in which Glinda rides and roll it smoothly into place.<ref name=\"nyt1939\"/>\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Nugent, \"Judy Garland's Dorothy is a pert and fresh-faced miss with the wonder-lit eyes of a believer in fairy tales, but the Baum fantasy is at its best when the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion are on the move.\"<ref name=\"nyt1939\"/>\n\nWriting in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', John C. Flinn predicted that the film was \"likely to perform some record-breaking feats of box-office magic,\" noting, \"Some of the scenic passages are so beautiful in design and composition as to stir audiences by their sheer unfoldment.\" He also called Garland \"an appealing figure\" and the musical numbers \"gay and bright.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1939/film/reviews/the-wizard-of-oz-3-1200412289/ |title=Review: 'The Wizard of Oz' |last=Flinn |first=John C. |date=August 16, 1939 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=September 22, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote, \"Even though some persons are not interested in pictures of this type, it is possible that they will be eager to see this picture just for its technical treatment.

While these were considerable earnings, the high production cost, in association with various distribution and other costs, meant the movie initially recorded a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/> It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5 million (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.5|1949|r=0}}}} million today). However, for all the risks and cost that MGM undertook to produce the film, it was considered at least more successful than anyone thought it would be. According to Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography ''Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland'', \"Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures.\" Finch also writes that after the success of the film, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top-ten box office stars in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finch |first=Christofer |title=Rainbow: The Stormy Life Of Judy Garland |year=1975 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-28407-5 |page=84}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and honors===\n\n====Academy Awards====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Awards\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!
