Ethiopia entered through the [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA \u2013 Group 7)|UEFA qualification process]], where it was [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification#Second round|eliminated by Israel]], while the rest entered through the [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification#Africa|CAF qualification process]]. Both Sudan and [[Egypt national football team|U.A.R.]] withdrew as FIFA would not allow them to rearrange matches to avoid the monsoon season, so the four teams formed two two-team groups. In the first group, Morocco and Tunisia both beat each other 2\u20131 at home, and then played a third match at a neutral location ([[Palermo]], [[Italy]]) which ended in a 1\u20131 draw after extra time.

While this was not enough to progress to the next round, African football pride had been restored.\n\n===1982: Algeria wins twice but eliminated===\n\nThis was the first World Cup with 24 teams, and Africa's representation was doubled. So 29 African countries competed for 2 spots in [[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|World Cup qualification]]. In comparison, 21 Asian nations also competed for 2 spots, but 33 European nations competed for 13 spots. 1978 finalists Tunisia were eliminated in the first round by Nigeria on penalties. Four series of knockout rounds were played, with the final two spots going down to Nigeria vs Algeria, and Morocco vs Cameroon. Both ''[[Algeria national football team|Les Fennecs]]'' ''(The [[Fennec Fox|Desert Foxes]])'' of '''Algeria''' and ''[[Cameroon national football team|Les Lions Indomptables]] (The Indomitable Lions)'' of '''Cameroon''' won 2\u20130 away and 2\u20131 at home and qualified for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time.\n\n[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] were placed in [[1982 FIFA World Cup#Group 1|Group 1]], where they surprised everyone by remaining undefeated.

[[Gr\u00e9goire Mbida]] scored Cameroon's first World Cup finals goal. Italy had also drawn its three matches, so also had a goal difference of 0, but had scored two goals to Cameroon's one, so Cameroon were eliminated. This was especially painful because in their opening match against Peru, Cameroon striker [[Roger Milla]] had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside.\n\n[[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] were placed in [[1982 FIFA World Cup#Group 2|Group 2]] with [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]], and [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. The Africans produced a major upset in the first match, beating West Germany 2\u20131 with goals by [[Rabah Madjer]] and [[Lakhdar Belloumi]]. They lost their second match 0\u20132 to Austria, then produced another surprise by beating Chile 3\u20132. The day after the Algeria vs Chile match, West Germany and Austria played [[West Germany v Austria (1982)|the final group match]] in [[Gij\u00f3n]] knowing that a 1\u20130 or 2\u20130 win for West Germany would result in both European teams qualifying at the expense of Algeria on goal difference. West Germany scored after ten minutes, and then both teams appeared to pass the ball aimlessly around for the remaining 80 minutes.\n\nThis performance was widely deplored by all observers. The Spanish crowd shouted, \"Fuera, fuera!\" (\"Out, out!\") while angry Algerian supporters waved banknotes at the players to suggest that the game was [[Match fixing|fixed]]. Even the two sides' fans were disgusted, with an Austrian television commentator advising viewers to turn off their TV sets, a German television commentator refusing to commentate further, and a German fan burning his [[Flag of Germany|national flag]] in protest. Furious Algerian football officials lodged an official protest, but the two teams denied any collusion.

It turned out to be one of the tightest groups in World Cup history, with five draws in six games. Egypt drew 1\u20131 with the Netherlands, drew 0\u20130 with Ireland, but lost their final match 0\u20131 to England. Egypt's only goal of the tournament was a penalty by [[Magdi Abdelghani]] against the Netherlands. Egypt were thus eliminated from World Cup, still without a win after losing their only match in 1930.\n\n[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] were undoubtedly the surprise package of the tournament. In their first match, they shocked [[Diego Maradona]]'s defending champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 1\u20130 through a goal by [[Fran\u00e7ois Omam-Biyik]], despite finishing their match with nine men. In their next match, they defeated [[Romania national football team|Romania]] 2\u20131 thanks to two goals from 38-year-old substitute [[Roger Milla]]. These were Milla's first official goals in the World Cup; he had had a goal against [[Peru national football team|Peru]] wrongly disallowed for offside during the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]]. Having already qualified for the next round, Cameroon then suffered their first loss (after three draws and two wins) in World Cup history, losing 4\u20130 to the already eliminated [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]. In the second round, Cameroon defeated [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] 2\u20131, with Milla again coming on as a second-half substitute to score twice, famously dispossessing Colombian goalkeeper [[Ren\u00e9 Higuita]] for one of them. By this time, Roger Milla, his post-goal celebrations, and Cameroon had firmly implanted themselves in the global footballing consciousness. In the quarter finals, they were seven minutes from qualifying for the semi-finals when [[England national football team|England]] were awarded a penalty. England won the match 3\u20132 after extra time, with three of the five goals coming from penalties (1 for Cameroon, 2 for England).\n\n===1994: Zambian air tragedy, Nigeria reaches Round of 16===\n\n40 African countries entered the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|qualification process]] for 3 spots at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. The extra spot was awarded after the strong performances of Cameroon and Egypt at [[Italia 90]]. However, only 28 played all their matches after [[FIFA]] rejected [[Libya national football team|Libya]] (due to [[United Nations|UN]] sanctions) and 11 other nations withdrew at various stages. There was a new qualification format, with two group stages. The big casualty of the first stage was 1990 finalists [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], as crowd trouble in [[Cairo]] turned a 2\u20131 home victory over [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] into a crucial [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#Group C|0\u20130 draw]] when [[FIFA]] ordered the match replayed at a neutral location.\n\nIn the new second stage of qualification were three groups of three, with winners qualifying for the World Cup. The ''[[Nigeria national football team|Super Eagles]]'' of '''Nigeria''' won [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#Group A 2|Group A]] on goal difference, beating both [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] 4\u20131 in Lagos.

However, they lost their final group match 0\u20131 to Morocco in [[Casablanca]] and '''Morocco''' won [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#Group B 2|Group B]] by one point. Amazingly, the rebuilt ''[[Zambia national football team|Chipolopolo]] (Copper Bullets)'' also went on to reach the finals of the [[1994 African Cup of Nations]].\n\nAt the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] finals in the U.S., [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] drew their first game in [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group B|Group B]] with eventual semi-finalists [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] 2\u20132 and lost their second to eventual winners [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 0\u20133. They were 0\u20133 down to [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in their third match when half-time substitute [[Roger Milla]] scored in the 46th minute (becoming at 42 the oldest man ever to score at the World Cup finals) and sparked brief hopes of a miracle comeback. However, the final score was a 1\u20136 loss to Russia, with [[Oleg Salenko]] netting a record-breaking five goals in vain. In [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group F|Group F]], Morocco lost its three matches by a goal each, 0\u20131 to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], 1\u20132 to [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], and 1\u20132 to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]].\n\nIn [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]], [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] thumped eventual semi-finalists [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 3\u20130, then fell to a 1\u20132 loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] before beating [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 2\u20130. Nigeria, Bulgaria, and Argentina all finished on six points and qualified for the second round. In the [[1994 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|second round]], Nigeria faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. [[Emmanuel Amuneke]] scored in the 25th minute, leaving Nigeria with a 1\u20130 lead two minutes from the next round when [[Roberto Baggio]] scored in the 88th minute. Baggio scored again in extra time to send Nigeria home.\n\nThis was the third successive World Cup where an African team progressed beyond the first stage, after Morocco in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and Cameroon in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]. This was a major factor in FIFA increasing Africa's allocation from 3 to 5 spots as the World Cup expanded from 24 to 32 four years later.\n\n===1998: Nigeria reaches the Round of 16 again===\n\n38 African countries entered the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|qualification process]] for 5 spots at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], the two new spots resulting from the tournament's expansion from 24 to 32 teams. This was the first time that three points, instead of two, were awarded for a win. [[Burundi national football team|Burundi]] won both their first round qualification matches but then had to withdraw due to civil war. [[Sierra Leone national football team|Sierra Leone]], who they had just eliminated, took their place in the second round, and then became the first nation in World Cup qualifying history to be eliminated twice in the same qualifying campaign.<ref name=fifaprel/> Eventually, '''Cameroon''', '''Morocco''', '''Nigeria''', and '''Tunisia''' qualified for the World Cup finals along with newcomers ''[[South Africa national football team|Bafana Bafana]]'' of '''South Africa''', who had only been readmitted to [[FIFA]] in 1992.\n\nThe five African teams all took European coaches ([[Claude Le Roy|three]] [[Henri Michel|French]][[Philippe Troussier|men]], [[Bora Milutinovi\u0107|one Serb]], [[Henryk Kasperczak|one Pole]]) to the finals, making it the first time since 1974 that there was no African coach at the World Cup.<ref name=africoaches>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/piersedwards/2010/03/the_struggle_of_african_coache.html|publisher=BBC Sport Blogs|author=Piers Edwards|title=The struggle of African coaches|date=March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1998 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group A|Group A]], [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] drew their first match 2\u20132 with [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and then lost 0\u20133 to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. The last two matches in the group were played simultaneously (as they had after the [[Disgrace of Gij\u00f3n]] in 1982) \u2013 with ten minutes left, Morocco were leading Scotland 2\u20130 while Brazil led Norway 1\u20130. But Norway scored twice in the 83rd and 88th minutes to beat Brazil 2\u20131.<ref>As of June 2010, [[Norway national football team|Norway]] was still the only country in the world never to be beaten by Brazil, having beaten the South Americans twice and drawn once.</ref> Morocco also scored once more to beat Scotland 3\u20130, but went home.\n\nIn [[1998 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group B|Group B]], [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] drew their first match 1\u20131 with [[Austria national football team|Austria]] (the Austrians equalizing in the 90th minute) but then lost 0\u20133 to [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] could have progressed if they won their final group match against [[Chile national football team|Chile]], but they drew 1\u20131 and went home. During the final match, Cameroon's [[Rigobert Song]] became the first man to pick up red cards at two World Cups \u2013 he was sent off as a 17-year-old [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group B#Brazil v Cameroon|against Brazil in 1994]]. (The second man to be red carded at two World Cups would be [[Zinedine Zidane]] eight years later.)\n\nIn [[1998 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group C|Group C]], [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] began their debut World Cup finals campaign with a 0\u20133 loss to hosts and eventual champions [[France national football team|France]]. They then drew 1\u20131 with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], [[Benni McCarthy]] scoring their first World Cup finals goal. They needed to win big in their final match against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] but could only manage a 2\u20132 draw, giving away two penalties and only managing to equalize late into injury time with their own penalty, taken by brace-scorer [[Shaun Bartlett]].\n\nIn [[1998 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group D|Group D]], [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] opened with a 3\u20132 win over fancied [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and another 1\u20130 win over [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]]. Having qualified for the next stage, they then lost 1\u20133 to [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]. Both Nigeria and Paraguay qualified for the next stage, with Spain losing out despite thumping Bulgaria 6\u20131. However, in the Round of 16, Nigeria were beaten 1\u20134 by [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. All Nigeria's six goals in the tournament came from six different players.<ref>The record for most goals scored at the World Cup with all different goal scorers and no own goals is 7, set by the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] in [[1982 World Cup#Group 6|1982]]. Teams to score six from six players are [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[1954 FIFA World Cup#Group 4|1954]], [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in [[1990 FIFA World Cup Group E|1990]], and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] in [[1998 FIFA World Cup#Group D|1998]].</ref>\n\nIn [[1998 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group G|Group G]], [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] lost their first two matches 0\u20132 to [[England national football team|England]] and 0\u20131 to [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]]. They then managed to draw 1\u20131 with [[Romania national football team|Romania]], who had won their first two matches and topped the group. Thus Tunisia's second appearance at the World Cup (after 1978) ended in them scoring only one goal, a penalty.\n\nThus only 2 of Africa's 5 representatives came away with at least one win. However, there was an African representative in the second round for the fourth time in succession.\n\n===2002: Senegal reaches the quarterfinals===\n\n51 African countries entered the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|qualification process]] for five spots at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. Four of the five 1998 finalists again made it through, with ''[[Senegal national football team|Les Lions de la Teranga]]'' (Teranga Lions<ref>Teranga is the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] word for 'hospitality'.</ref>) of Senegal replacing [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]]. [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] and Morocco topped the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#Group C|same qualification group]] each with four wins, three draws, and a loss, but Senegal had a seven-goal superior goal difference thanks to their 9\u20130 aggregate thrashings of group minnows [[Namibia national football team|Namibia]]. In contrast, the Namibians had managed to hold Morocco to a goalless draw in [[Windhoek]].\n\nLike [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] 12 years earlier, Senegal started with a shock 1\u20130 win over the defending champions and went on to reach the quarter finals. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group A|Group A]], after beating [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130 with a goal from [[Papa Bouba Diop]], they drew 1\u20131 with eventual group winners [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. In their final match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], they were leading 3\u20130 at half-time. In the second half, the South Americans \u2013 for whom a win would have them progress at Senegal's expense \u2013 scored twice, and then a third time with an 88th-minute penalty kick. Senegal survived the frenetic final minutes of the game to hang on to a 3\u20133 result. Thus Denmark and Senegal progressed to the next round while former champions Uruguay and France went home. In the Round of 16, a [[golden goal]] in extra time (to add to his 37th-minute strike) from [[Henri Camara]] took Senegal 2\u20131 past [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] after extra time. But in the quarter-finals against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], they were eliminated by a golden goal four minutes into extra time.\n\nIn [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group B|Group B]], '''South Africa''' drew 2\u20132 with [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] with an injury time penalty, then scored their first ever World Cup win by beating [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] 1\u20130. However a 2\u20133 loss to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] then sent [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] home. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group E|Group E]], '''Cameroon''' drew 1\u20131 with [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], beat [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] 1\u20130, and then lost 0\u20132 to [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group F|Group F]], '''Nigeria''' lost 0\u20131 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], lost 1\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], and having been eliminated, held [[England national football team|England]] to a 0\u20130 draw. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group H|Group H]], '''Tunisia''' lost 0\u20132 to [[Russia national football team|Russia]], drew 1\u20131 with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], and lost 0\u20132 to co-hosts [[Japan national football team|Japan]].\n\nOf Africa's five representatives, three won at least once, but only one progressed beyond the first round. Still, Senegal's surprise run made it the fifth successive time an African nation had made it to the Round of 16, and the second time an African country had reached the quarter finals. Three of the five African nations (South Africa, Nigeria, Tunisia) took a local coach to the World Cup; only one of those three scored a win.\n\n===2006: Ghana reaches the Round of 16===\n\n51 African countries entered the race for 5 spots at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in a [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|qualification process]] that doubled as one for the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]]. In the final qualification round, teams were organized into five groups of six teams, with winners qualifying for the World Cup and the top three for the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|continental tournament]]. More matches were needed to qualify \u2013 while at both the 1998 and 2002 32-team World Cups, 3 of the 5 African teams played only 6 matches to get to the finals, here 3 of the 5 teams that qualified played 12 matches.\nFour of Africa's five representatives to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] finals were debutants, in contrast to [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] when four of five had appeared at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|previous World Cup]].\n\nIn [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 1|Group 1]], '''Togo''' beat 2002 World Cup quarterfinalists [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] by two points. The ''[[Ghana national football team|Black Stars]]'' of '''Ghana''' won [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 3|Group 2]] by five points while in [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 3|Group 3]], ''[[Ivory Coast national football team|Les \u00c9l\u00e9phants]]'' of '''Ivory Coast''' lost both its matches to [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] but won the group since Cameroon drew too often. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 3|Group 5]], '''Tunisia''' won the group one point ahead of 1998 finalists and perennial rivals [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]]. Although Morocco was the only African team (of those who played a match) to remain undefeated, it drew half its matches. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 4|Group 4]], [[Angola national football team|Angola]] and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] both finished with 21 points after 10 matches, with Nigeria having a far superior goal difference thanks largely to scoring five goals against both [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] and 3rd placed [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] in their last two matches. However, it had already been decided that head to head results were to be used to break such ties in [[FIFA World Cup qualification#Group tournaments rules|2006 World Cup Qualification]] before goal difference. The ''[[Angola national football team|Palancas Negras (Black Antelopes)]]'' of '''Angola''', having beaten [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] 2\u20131 on aggregate, qualified for the World Cup.\n\nAt the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup Finals]], [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] lost its first two [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group C|Group C]] matches 1\u20132 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and 1\u20132 to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] before coming back from 0\u20132 down to beat [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] 3\u20132. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]], [[Angola national football team|Angola]] \u2013 the only African team at the finals with a local coach ([[Lu\u00eds Oliveira Gon\u00e7alves]]) \u2013 lost their first match 0\u20131 to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], then drew 0\u20130 with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and 1\u20131 with [[Iran national football team|Iran]]. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]], [[Togo national football team|Togo]] made more news off the pitch with disputes over team bonuses causing coach Otto Pfister to walk out on the team until just before the first match and FIFA officials having to step in to stop players threatening to boycott the second match.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/togo/5092382.stm|title=Togo match goes ahead after row|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 June 2006}}</ref> [[Togo national football team|Togo]] lost 1\u20132 to [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], lost 0\u20132 to [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], and 0\u20132 to eventual finalists [[France national football team|France]].

In the quarter-finals, they were eliminated by [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. Ghana were defeated by Uruguay on penalties after [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] controversially handballed on the [[Association football pitch#Pitch boundary|goal line]] deep into extra time, denying Ghana an almost certain winning goal.

While [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] and [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] both collected disappointing results (apart from Ghana's 2\u20132 draw with later champions Germany, which saw them becoming the only team not to lose against the Germans in the entire tournament) and eventually ended fourth in their group, [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] were also knocked out in the first round after a last-minute penalty kick against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and ended third in Group C, above Japan, whom they had defeated 2\u20131 in their first match.\n\nAfrica's pride, however, was saved by both [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]. The Nigerians kicked off their Group F campaign with a disappointing 0\u20130 draw against [[Iran national football team|Iran]], before eventually defeating debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] 1\u20130. [[Stephen Keshi]]'s team went down 3\u20132 to later finalists [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in their final match, leaving them on the brink of elimination, but Iran lost to the Bosnians 3\u20131 and Nigeria went through to the Round of 16 for the third time in history, after [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]].\n\nAlgeria lost 2\u20131 to a strong [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in their opening match in Group H, a loss which was followed by an unexpected 4\u20132 victory over the [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] in [[Porto Alegre]] in their second match. In their final Group H encounter, a hard-won 1\u20131 draw with [[Russia national football team|Russia]] was enough to send the North Africans through to the next round.\n\nIn the Round of 16, both African teams fell just short to beat the likes of [[France national football team|France]] (Nigeria) and Germany (Algeria), but the fact that two African nations had reached that far, was a reason to be optimistic about the future of African football.\n\nDuring the 2014 edition, Ghana striker [[Asamoah Gyan]] became Africa's all-time leading topscorer at the FIFA World Cup, having scored 6 goals in 3 World Cups, thus exceeding Cameroon veteran [[Roger Milla]]'s 5 goals.\n\n===2018: No African teams in knockout stage for the first time since 1982===\nThe [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Russia]] saw early elimination for [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] and [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] who all lost their first two group games. [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] also lost their first group game against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] 2\u20130, but the team got a win in their second game, over [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] 2\u20130, leaving them with a chance if they could get a result against 2014 finalists [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. However, they lost the decisive game, and were eliminated after finishing third in the group.\n\n[[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] won their opening game against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 2\u20131, and drew their second game against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], leaving them needing a draw in their final game against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] to be sure of progressing. However, they went down 0\u20131, and because Japan lost 0\u20131 as well, Senegal bowed out due to the fair play tiebreaker.\n\n==African firsts at the World Cup==\n\n===World Cup Finals===\n*'''[[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]''': [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], first African country at the World Cup\n*'''1934''': [[Abdulrahman Fawzi]] of [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], first African to score at the World Cup, who scored both Egypt's goals in 2\u20134 loss against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]].

They lost their next match to Poland 1\u20130, missing several chances, and held West Germany to a goalless draw. While this was not enough to progress to the next round, African football pride had been restored.\n\n===1982: Algeria wins twice but eliminated===\n\nThis was the first World Cup with 24 teams, and Africa's representation was doubled. So 29 African countries competed for 2 spots in [[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|World Cup qualification]]. In comparison, 21 Asian nations also competed for 2 spots, but 33 European nations competed for 13 spots. 1978 finalists Tunisia were eliminated in the first round by Nigeria on penalties. Four series of knockout rounds were played, with the final two spots going down to Nigeria vs Algeria, and Morocco vs Cameroon. Both ''[[Algeria national football team|Les Fennecs]]'' ''(The [[Fennec Fox|Desert Foxes]])'' of '''Algeria''' and ''[[Cameroon national football team|Les Lions Indomptables]] (The Indomitable Lions)'' of '''Cameroon''' won 2\u20130 away and 2\u20131 at home and qualified for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time.\n\n[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] were placed in [[1982 FIFA World Cup#Group 1|Group 1]], where they surprised everyone by remaining undefeated. They drew 0\u20130 with [[Peru national football team|Peru]], 0\u20130 with [[Poland national football team|Poland]], and 1\u20131 with [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. [[Gr\u00e9goire Mbida]] scored Cameroon's first World Cup finals goal. Italy had also drawn its three matches, so also had a goal difference of 0, but had scored two goals to Cameroon's one, so Cameroon were eliminated. This was especially painful because in their opening match against Peru, Cameroon striker [[Roger Milla]] had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside.\n\n[[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] were placed in [[1982 FIFA World Cup#Group 2|Group 2]] with [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]], and [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. The Africans produced a major upset in the first match, beating West Germany 2\u20131 with goals by [[Rabah Madjer]] and [[Lakhdar Belloumi]]. They lost their second match 0\u20132 to Austria, then produced another surprise by beating Chile 3\u20132. The day after the Algeria vs Chile match, West Germany and Austria played [[West Germany v Austria (1982)|the final group match]] in [[Gij\u00f3n]] knowing that a 1\u20130 or 2\u20130 win for West Germany would result in both European teams qualifying at the expense of Algeria on goal difference. West Germany scored after ten minutes, and then both teams appeared to pass the ball aimlessly around for the remaining 80 minutes.\n\nThis performance was widely deplored by all observers. The Spanish crowd shouted, \"Fuera, fuera!\" (\"Out, out!\") while angry Algerian supporters waved banknotes at the players to suggest that the game was [[Match fixing|fixed]]. Even the two sides' fans were disgusted, with an Austrian television commentator advising viewers to turn off their TV sets, a German television commentator refusing to commentate further, and a German fan burning his [[Flag of Germany|national flag]] in protest. Furious Algerian football officials lodged an official protest, but the two teams denied any collusion. As nothing could be proved and the two teams had technically broken no rules, FIFA allowed the result to stand.

Finally it came down to four teams playing in two playoffs for the final: Algeria vs Egypt and Tunisia vs Cameroon. [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] beat Tunisia 2\u20130 at home and 1\u20130 away, and qualified for their second World Cup.

It turned out to be one of the tightest groups in World Cup history, with five draws in six games. Egypt drew 1\u20131 with the Netherlands, drew 0\u20130 with Ireland, but lost their final match 0\u20131 to England. Egypt's only goal of the tournament was a penalty by [[Magdi Abdelghani]] against the Netherlands. Egypt were thus eliminated from World Cup, still without a win after losing their only match in 1930.\n\n[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] were undoubtedly the surprise package of the tournament. In their first match, they shocked [[Diego Maradona]]'s defending champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 1\u20130 through a goal by [[Fran\u00e7ois Omam-Biyik]], despite finishing their match with nine men. In their next match, they defeated [[Romania national football team|Romania]] 2\u20131 thanks to two goals from 38-year-old substitute [[Roger Milla]]. These were Milla's first official goals in the World Cup; he had had a goal against [[Peru national football team|Peru]] wrongly disallowed for offside during the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]]. Having already qualified for the next round, Cameroon then suffered their first loss (after three draws and two wins) in World Cup history, losing 4\u20130 to the already eliminated [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]. In the second round, Cameroon defeated [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] 2\u20131, with Milla again coming on as a second-half substitute to score twice, famously dispossessing Colombian goalkeeper [[Ren\u00e9 Higuita]] for one of them. By this time, Roger Milla, his post-goal celebrations, and Cameroon had firmly implanted themselves in the global footballing consciousness. In the quarter finals, they were seven minutes from qualifying for the semi-finals when [[England national football team|England]] were awarded a penalty. England won the match 3\u20132 after extra time, with three of the five goals coming from penalties (1 for Cameroon, 2 for England).\n\n===1994: Zambian air tragedy, Nigeria reaches Round of 16===\n\n40 African countries entered the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|qualification process]] for 3 spots at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. The extra spot was awarded after the strong performances of Cameroon and Egypt at [[Italia 90]]. However, only 28 played all their matches after [[FIFA]] rejected [[Libya national football team|Libya]] (due to [[United Nations|UN]] sanctions) and 11 other nations withdrew at various stages. There was a new qualification format, with two group stages. The big casualty of the first stage was 1990 finalists [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], as crowd trouble in [[Cairo]] turned a 2\u20131 home victory over [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] into a crucial [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#Group C|0\u20130 draw]] when [[FIFA]] ordered the match replayed at a neutral location.\n\nIn the new second stage of qualification were three groups of three, with winners qualifying for the World Cup. The ''[[Nigeria national football team|Super Eagles]]'' of '''Nigeria''' won [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#Group A 2|Group A]] on goal difference, beating both [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] 4\u20131 in Lagos.

However, they lost their final group match 0\u20131 to Morocco in [[Casablanca]] and '''Morocco''' won [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#Group B 2|Group B]] by one point. Amazingly, the rebuilt ''[[Zambia national football team|Chipolopolo]] (Copper Bullets)'' also went on to reach the finals of the [[1994 African Cup of Nations]].\n\nAt the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] finals in the U.S., [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] drew their first game in [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group B|Group B]] with eventual semi-finalists [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] 2\u20132 and lost their second to eventual winners [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 0\u20133. They were 0\u20133 down to [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in their third match when half-time substitute [[Roger Milla]] scored in the 46th minute (becoming at 42 the oldest man ever to score at the World Cup finals) and sparked brief hopes of a miracle comeback. However, the final score was a 1\u20136 loss to Russia, with [[Oleg Salenko]] netting a record-breaking five goals in vain. In [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group F|Group F]], Morocco lost its three matches by a goal each, 0\u20131 to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], 1\u20132 to [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], and 1\u20132 to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]].\n\nIn [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]], [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] thumped eventual semi-finalists [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 3\u20130, then fell to a 1\u20132 loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] before beating [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 2\u20130. Nigeria, Bulgaria, and Argentina all finished on six points and qualified for the second round. In the [[1994 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|second round]], Nigeria faced [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. [[Emmanuel Amuneke]] scored in the 25th minute, leaving Nigeria with a 1\u20130 lead two minutes from the next round when [[Roberto Baggio]] scored in the 88th minute. Baggio scored again in extra time to send Nigeria home.\n\nThis was the third successive World Cup where an African team progressed beyond the first stage, after Morocco in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and Cameroon in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]. This was a major factor in FIFA increasing Africa's allocation from 3 to 5 spots as the World Cup expanded from 24 to 32 four years later.\n\n===1998: Nigeria reaches the Round of 16 again===\n\n38 African countries entered the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|qualification process]] for 5 spots at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], the two new spots resulting from the tournament's expansion from 24 to 32 teams.

[[Burundi national football team|Burundi]] won both their first round qualification matches but then had to withdraw due to civil war.

[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] could have progressed if they won their final group match against [[Chile national football team|Chile]], but they drew 1\u20131 and went home. During the final match, Cameroon's [[Rigobert Song]] became the first man to pick up red cards at two World Cups \u2013 he was sent off as a 17-year-old [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group B#Brazil v Cameroon|against Brazil in 1994]].

Both Nigeria and Paraguay qualified for the next stage, with Spain losing out despite thumping Bulgaria 6\u20131.

They then managed to draw 1\u20131 with [[Romania national football team|Romania]], who had won their first two matches and topped the group. Thus Tunisia's second appearance at the World Cup (after 1978) ended in them scoring only one goal, a penalty.\n\nThus only 2 of Africa's 5 representatives came away with at least one win. However, there was an African representative in the second round for the fourth time in succession.\n\n===2002: Senegal reaches the quarterfinals===\n\n51 African countries entered the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|qualification process]] for five spots at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].

[[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] and Morocco topped the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#Group C|same qualification group]] each with four wins, three draws, and a loss, but Senegal had a seven-goal superior goal difference thanks to their 9\u20130 aggregate thrashings of group minnows [[Namibia national football team|Namibia]]. In contrast, the Namibians had managed to hold Morocco to a goalless draw in [[Windhoek]].\n\nLike [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] 12 years earlier, Senegal started with a shock 1\u20130 win over the defending champions and went on to reach the quarter finals. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group A|Group A]], after beating [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130 with a goal from [[Papa Bouba Diop]], they drew 1\u20131 with eventual group winners [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. In their final match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], they were leading 3\u20130 at half-time. In the second half, the South Americans \u2013 for whom a win would have them progress at Senegal's expense \u2013 scored twice, and then a third time with an 88th-minute penalty kick. Senegal survived the frenetic final minutes of the game to hang on to a 3\u20133 result. Thus Denmark and Senegal progressed to the next round while former champions Uruguay and France went home. In the Round of 16, a [[golden goal]] in extra time (to add to his 37th-minute strike) from [[Henri Camara]] took Senegal 2\u20131 past [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] after extra time. But in the quarter-finals against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], they were eliminated by a golden goal four minutes into extra time.\n\nIn [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group B|Group B]], '''South Africa''' drew 2\u20132 with [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] with an injury time penalty, then scored their first ever World Cup win by beating [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] 1\u20130. However a 2\u20133 loss to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] then sent [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] home. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group E|Group E]], '''Cameroon''' drew 1\u20131 with [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], beat [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] 1\u20130, and then lost 0\u20132 to [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group F|Group F]], '''Nigeria''' lost 0\u20131 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], lost 1\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], and having been eliminated, held [[England national football team|England]] to a 0\u20130 draw. In [[2002 FIFA World Cup \u2013 Group H|Group H]], '''Tunisia''' lost 0\u20132 to [[Russia national football team|Russia]], drew 1\u20131 with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], and lost 0\u20132 to co-hosts [[Japan national football team|Japan]].\n\nOf Africa's five representatives, three won at least once, but only one progressed beyond the first round. Still, Senegal's surprise run made it the fifth successive time an African nation had made it to the Round of 16, and the second time an African country had reached the quarter finals. Three of the five African nations (South Africa, Nigeria, Tunisia) took a local coach to the World Cup; only one of those three scored a win.\n\n===2006: Ghana reaches the Round of 16===\n\n51 African countries entered the race for 5 spots at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in a [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|qualification process]] that doubled as one for the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]]. In the final qualification round, teams were organized into five groups of six teams, with winners qualifying for the World Cup and the top three for the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|continental tournament]]. More matches were needed to qualify \u2013 while at both the 1998 and 2002 32-team World Cups, 3 of the 5 African teams played only 6 matches to get to the finals, here 3 of the 5 teams that qualified played 12 matches.\nFour of Africa's five representatives to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] finals were debutants, in contrast to [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] when four of five had appeared at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|previous World Cup]].\n\nIn [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 1|Group 1]], '''Togo''' beat 2002 World Cup quarterfinalists [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] by two points. The ''[[Ghana national football team|Black Stars]]'' of '''Ghana''' won [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 3|Group 2]] by five points while in [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 3|Group 3]], ''[[Ivory Coast national football team|Les \u00c9l\u00e9phants]]'' of '''Ivory Coast''' lost both its matches to [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] but won the group since Cameroon drew too often. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 3|Group 5]], '''Tunisia''' won the group one point ahead of 1998 finalists and perennial rivals [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]]. Although Morocco was the only African team (of those who played a match) to remain undefeated, it drew half its matches. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CAF Group 4|Group 4]], [[Angola national football team|Angola]] and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] both finished with 21 points after 10 matches, with Nigeria having a far superior goal difference thanks largely to scoring five goals against both [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] and 3rd placed [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] in their last two matches. However, it had already been decided that head to head results were to be used to break such ties in [[FIFA World Cup qualification#Group tournaments rules|2006 World Cup Qualification]] before goal difference. The ''[[Angola national football team|Palancas Negras (Black Antelopes)]]'' of '''Angola''', having beaten [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] 2\u20131 on aggregate, qualified for the World Cup.\n\nAt the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup Finals]], [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] lost its first two [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group C|Group C]] matches 1\u20132 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and 1\u20132 to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] before coming back from 0\u20132 down to beat [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] 3\u20132. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]], [[Angola national football team|Angola]] \u2013 the only African team at the finals with a local coach ([[Lu\u00eds Oliveira Gon\u00e7alves]]) \u2013 lost their first match 0\u20131 to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], then drew 0\u20130 with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and 1\u20131 with [[Iran national football team|Iran]]. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]], [[Togo national football team|Togo]] made more news off the pitch with disputes over team bonuses causing coach Otto Pfister to walk out on the team until just before the first match and FIFA officials having to step in to stop players threatening to boycott the second match.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/togo/5092382.stm|title=Togo match goes ahead after row|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 June 2006}}</ref> [[Togo national football team|Togo]] lost 1\u20132 to [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], lost 0\u20132 to [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], and 0\u20132 to eventual finalists [[France national football team|France]]. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group H|Group H]], [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] drew 2\u20132 with [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], lost 1\u20133 to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] (including an injury time penalty from [[Fernando Torres]]), and 0\u20131 to [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]].\n\nIn [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group E|Group E]], Ghana began with up a 0\u20132 loss to eventual winners [[Italy national football team|Italy]] with a 2\u20130 win over the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and a 2\u20131 win over the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S.]]. Thus the debutants ensured an African representative in the Round of 16 for the sixth successive World Cup. They lost 3\u20130 to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the Round of 16.

Their [[South Africa national football team|national team]] became the first World Cup hosts to get knocked out in the first round. Nigeria, Algeria, Ivory Coast and Cameroon also exited the tournament after the Group stages\n\nHowever, [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] progressed beyond the group stages of the FIFA World Cup for the second time in a row, and defeated the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S.]] 2\u20131 after extra time in the Round of 16, which saw them reach the quarter-finals, becoming the third African nation to do so. In the quarter-finals, they were eliminated by [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. Ghana were defeated by Uruguay on penalties after [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] controversially handballed on the [[Association football pitch#Pitch boundary|goal line]] deep into extra time, denying Ghana an almost certain winning goal.

While [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] and [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] both collected disappointing results (apart from Ghana's 2\u20132 draw with later champions Germany, which saw them becoming the only team not to lose against the Germans in the entire tournament) and eventually ended fourth in their group, [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] were also knocked out in the first round after a last-minute penalty kick against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and ended third in Group C, above Japan, whom they had defeated 2\u20131 in their first match.\n\nAfrica's pride, however, was saved by both [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]. The Nigerians kicked off their Group F campaign with a disappointing 0\u20130 draw against [[Iran national football team|Iran]], before eventually defeating debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] 1\u20130. [[Stephen Keshi]]'s team went down 3\u20132 to later finalists [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in their final match, leaving them on the brink of elimination, but Iran lost to the Bosnians 3\u20131 and Nigeria went through to the Round of 16 for the third time in history, after [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]].\n\nAlgeria lost 2\u20131 to a strong [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in their opening match in Group H, a loss which was followed by an unexpected 4\u20132 victory over the [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] in [[Porto Alegre]] in their second match. In their final Group H encounter, a hard-won 1\u20131 draw with [[Russia national football team|Russia]] was enough to send the North Africans through to the next round.\n\nIn the Round of 16, both African teams fell just short to beat the likes of [[France national football team|France]] (Nigeria) and Germany (Algeria), but the fact that two African nations had reached that far, was a reason to be optimistic about the future of African football.\n\nDuring the 2014 edition, Ghana striker [[Asamoah Gyan]] became Africa's all-time leading topscorer at the FIFA World Cup, having scored 6 goals in 3 World Cups, thus exceeding Cameroon veteran [[Roger Milla]]'s 5 goals.\n\n===2018: No African teams in knockout stage for the first time since 1982===\nThe [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Russia]] saw early elimination for [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] and [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] who all lost their first two group games. [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] also lost their first group game against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] 2\u20130, but the team got a win in their second game, over [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] 2\u20130, leaving them with a chance if they could get a result against 2014 finalists [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. However, they lost the decisive game, and were eliminated after finishing third in the group.\n\n[[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] won their opening game against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 2\u20131, and drew their second game against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], leaving them needing a draw in their final game against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] to be sure of progressing. However, they went down 0\u20131, and because Japan lost 0\u20131 as well, Senegal bowed out due to the fair play tiebreaker.\n\n==African firsts at the World Cup==\n\n===World Cup Finals===\n*'''[[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]''': [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], first African country at the World Cup\n*'''1934''': [[Abdulrahman Fawzi]] of [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], first African to score at the World Cup, who scored both Egypt's goals in 2\u20134 loss against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]].

The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement (1688\u20131720) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament.<ref name=\"Evolution of Prime Minister\">{{cite news|title=George I think you stink\n|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHanoverians/GeorgeI.aspx|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref> Although the sovereign was not stripped of the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|ancient prerogative powers]] and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a prime minister who could command a majority in Parliament.\n\nBy the 1830s, the [[Westminster system]] of government (or cabinet government) had emerged; the prime minister had become ''[[primus inter pares]]'' or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom. The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties, the introduction of mass communication and photography. By the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-\u00e0-vis the Sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet.\n\nPrior to 1902, the prime minister sometimes came from the [[House of Lords]], provided that his government could form a majority in the Commons. However as the power of the aristocracy waned during the 19th century the convention developed that the prime minister should always sit as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) in the lower house, making them answerable only to the Commons in Parliament. As leader of the House of Commons, the prime minister's authority was further enhanced by the [[Parliament Act 1911]] which marginalised the influence of the House of Lords in the law-making process.\n\nThe prime minister is ''[[ex officio]]'' also [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]]. Indeed, certain privileges, such as [[List of residents of 10 Downing Street|residency]] of [[10 Downing Street]], are accorded to prime ministers by virtue of their position as First Lord of the Treasury.\n\nThe status and executive powers of the British prime minister means that the incumbent is consistently ranked as one of the most powerful and influential people in the world.\n\n==Authority==\nThe prime minister is the head of the [[United Kingdom government]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/prime-minister|title=Prime Minister|website=Gov.UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014185426/https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/prime-minister|archive-date=14 October 2017 |url-status=live|access-date=19 May 2018}}</ref> As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower House of the legislature). The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than [[separation of powers|separation]].<ref>[[#Le May|Le May]], 98\u201399. Walter Bagehot, an authority on 19th-century British government, said this unity is \"the efficient secret\" of its constitution. Bagehot's description of the \"efficient part\" of the British constitution is quoted by Le May and many other standard texts: \"The efficient secret of the English Constitution may be described as the close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the executive and legislative powers. No doubt, by the traditional theory, as it exists in all the books, the goodness of our constitution consists in the entire separation of the legislative and executive authorities, but in truth its merit consists in their singular approximation. The connecting link is the Cabinet ... A Cabinet is a combing committee\u2014a hyphen which joins a buckle which fastens the legislative part of the State to the executive part of the State. In its origin it belongs to the one, in its functions it belongs to the other.\"</ref> In the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and [[minister (government)|ministers]], and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public \"face\" and \"voice\" of Her Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the prime minister, the Sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and [[Church of England]] ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.<ref>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp. 245\u2013246</ref>\n\n==Constitutional background==\n{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}\n{{Main|Constitution of the United Kingdom}}\nThe British system of government is based on an [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|uncodified constitution]], meaning that it is not set out in any single document.<ref>[[#King|King]], pp. 3\u20138. King makes the point that much of the British constitution is in fact written and that no constitution is written down in its entirety. The distinctive feature of the British constitution, he says, is that it is not codified.</ref> The British constitution consists of many documents and most importantly for the evolution of the office of the prime minister, it is based on customs known as [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]] that became accepted practice. In 1928, Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] described this characteristic of the British constitution in his memoirs:<blockquote>In this country we live ... under an unwritten Constitution. It is true that we have on the Statute-book great instruments like Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the Bill of Rights which define and secure many of our rights and privileges; but the great bulk of our constitutional liberties and ... our constitutional practices do not derive their validity and sanction from any Bill which has received the formal assent of the King, Lords and Commons. They rest on usage, custom, convention, often of slow growth in their early stages, not always uniform, but which in the course of time received universal observance and respect.<ref>Quoted in [[#Hanchant|Hanchant]], p. 209</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe relationships between the prime minister and the sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet are defined largely by these unwritten conventions of the constitution. Many of the prime minister's executive and legislative powers are actually [[royal prerogative]]s which are still formally vested in the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|sovereign]], who remains the [[head of state]].<ref>[[#Low|Low]], p.155. In 1902, for example, Arthur Balfour said, \"The Prime Minister has no salary as Prime Minister. He has no statutory duties as Prime Minister, his name occurs in no Acts of Parliament, and though holding the most important place in the constitutional hierarchy, he has no place which is recognized by the laws of his country. This is a strange paradox\"</ref> Despite its growing dominance in the constitutional hierarchy, the premiership was given little formal recognition until the 20th century; the [[legal fiction]] was maintained that the Sovereign still governed directly. The position was first mentioned in statute only in 1917, in the schedule of the [[Chequers Estate Act 1917|Chequers Estate Act]]. Increasingly during the 20th century, the office and role of Prime Minister featured in [[statute law]] and official documents; however, the prime minister's powers and relationships with other institutions still largely continue to derive from ancient royal prerogatives and historic and modern constitutional conventions. Prime ministers continue to hold the position of [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and, since November 1968, that of [[Minister for the Civil Service]], the latter giving them authority over the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|civil service]].\n\nUnder this arrangement, Britain might appear to have two executives: the prime minister and the sovereign. The concept of \"[[the Crown]]\" resolves this paradox.<ref>[[#Low|Low]], p. 255 \"There is no distinction,\" said Gladstone, \"more vital to the practice of the British constitution or to the right judgement upon it than the distinction between the Sovereign and the Crown.\"</ref> The Crown symbolises the state's authority to govern: to make laws and execute them, impose taxes and collect them, declare war and make peace. Before the \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\" of 1688, the sovereign exclusively wielded the powers of the Crown; afterwards, Parliament gradually forced monarchs to assume a neutral political position. Parliament has effectively dispersed the powers of the Crown, entrusting its authority to responsible ministers (the prime minister and Cabinet), accountable for their policies and actions to Parliament, in particular the elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\nAlthough many of the sovereign's prerogative powers are still legally intact,<ref group=note>The Sovereign's prerogative powers are sometimes called [[reserve power]]s. They include the sole authority to dismiss a prime minister and government of the day in extremely rare and exceptional circumstances, and other essential powers (such as withholding [[Royal Assent]], and summoning and proroguing Parliament) to preserve the stability of the nation. These reserve powers can be exercised without the consent of Parliament. Reserve powers, in practice, are the court of absolute last resort in resolving situations that fundamentally threaten the security and stability of the nation as a whole and are almost never used.</ref> constitutional conventions have removed the monarch from day-to-day governance, with ministers exercising the royal prerogatives, leaving the monarch in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise and to warn.<ref>[[#Bagehot|Bagehot]], p. 67</ref><ref>[[#Low|Low]], pp 255\u2013258</ref>\n\n==Foundations==\n===Revolutionary Settlement===\n{{See also|Glorious Revolution}}\nBecause the premiership was not intentionally created, there is no exact date when its evolution began. A meaningful starting point, however, is 1688\u201389 when [[James II]] fled [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[Parliament of England]] confirmed [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II]] as joint constitutional monarchs, enacting legislation that limited their authority and that of their successors: the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights (1689)]], the [[Mutiny Acts|Mutiny Bill]] (1689), the [[Triennial Acts|Triennial Bill]] (1694), the [[Treason Act 1695|Treason Act (1696)]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement (1701)]].<ref>[[#Knappen|Knappen]], pp. 448\u2013451</ref> Known collectively as the Revolutionary Settlement, these acts transformed the constitution, shifting the balance of power from the Sovereign to Parliament. They also provided the basis for the evolution of the office of Prime Minister, which did not exist at that time.\n\n===Treasury Bench===\n[[File:British House of Commons 1834.jpg|thumb|Late in the 17th century Treasury Ministers began to attend the Commons regularly. They were given a reserved place, called the Treasury Bench, to the Speaker's right where the prime minister and senior Cabinet members sit today.]]\nThe Revolutionary Settlement gave the Commons control over finances and legislation and changed the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature. For want of money, sovereigns had to summon Parliament annually and could no longer dissolve or prorogue it without its advice and consent. Parliament became a permanent feature of political life.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 371\u2013373</ref> The veto fell into disuse because sovereigns feared that if they denied legislation, Parliament would deny them money. No sovereign has denied [[royal assent]] since Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] vetoed the [[Scottish Militia Bill]] in 1708.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 382</ref>\n\nTreasury officials and other department heads were drawn into Parliament serving as liaisons between it and the sovereign. Ministers had to present the government's policies, and negotiate with Members to gain the support of the majority; they had to explain the government's financial needs, suggest ways of meeting them and give an account of how money had been spent. The Sovereign's representatives attended Commons sessions so regularly that they were given reserved seats at the front, known as the Treasury Bench. This is the beginning of \"unity of powers\": the sovereign's ministers (the Executive) became leading members of Parliament (the Legislature). Today, the prime minister ([[First Lord of the Treasury]]), the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (responsible for [[United Kingdom budget|The Budget]]) and other senior members of the Cabinet sit on the Treasury bench and present policies in much the same way Ministers did late in the 17th century.\n\n===Standing Order 66===\nAfter the Revolution, there was a constant threat that non-government members of Parliament would ruin the country's finances by proposing ill-considered money bills. Vying for control to avoid chaos, the Crown's Ministers gained an advantage in 1706, when the Commons informally declared, \"That this House will receive no petition for any sum of money relating to public Service, but what is recommended from the Crown.\" On 11 June 1713, this non-binding rule became Standing Order 66: that \"the Commons would not vote money for any purpose, except on a motion of a Minister of the Crown.\" Standing Order 66 remains in effect today (though renumbered as no. 48),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmstords/2/2.pdf |date=16 December 2009 |page=65 |title=Standing Orders of the House of Commons |location=London, United Kingdom |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> essentially unchanged for more than three hundred years.<ref>[[#Roseveare|Roseveare]], p. 80</ref>\n\nEmpowering ministers with sole financial initiative had an immediate and lasting impact. Apart from achieving its intended purpose \u2013 to stabilise the budgetary process \u2013 it gave the Crown a leadership role in the Commons; and, the [[Lord Treasurer]] assumed a leading position among ministers.\n\nThe power of financial initiative was not, however, absolute. Only Ministers might initiate money bills, but Parliament now reviewed and consented to them. Standing Order 66 therefore represents the beginnings of Ministerial responsibility and accountability.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 372\u2013373</ref>\n\nThe term \"Prime Minister\" appears at this time as an unofficial title for the leader of the government, usually the Head of the Treasury.<ref>[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p. 50 There are a few instances of the use of \"Prime\" or \"First\" Minister in the 17th century. After the Restoration in 1660, for example, Lord Clarendon was encouraged to assume the title of \"First Minister\" in the new government rather than accept a specific office. According to the Duke of Ormonde, however, \"He (Clarendon) could not consent to enjoy a pension out of the Exchequer under no other title or pretense but being First Minister... [an office] so newly translated out of French into English that it was not enough understood to be liked and everyone would detest it for the burden it was attended with.\"</ref> Jonathan Swift, for example, wrote that in 1713 there had been \"those who are now commonly called Prime Minister among us\", referring to [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], Queen Anne's Lord Treasurers and chief ministers.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 87</ref> Since 1721, every head of the Sovereign's government \u2013 with one exception in the 18th century ([[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]]) and one in the 19th ([[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]) \u2013 has been First Lord of the Treasury.\n\n===Beginnings of the prime minister's party leadership===\nPolitical parties first appeared during the [[Exclusion Crisis]] of 1678\u20131681. The [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], who believed in [[limited monarchy]], wanted to exclude [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], from succeeding to the throne because he was a Roman Catholic. The [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]], who believed in the \"[[Divine Right of Kings]]\", defended James's hereditary claim.\n\nPolitical parties were not well organised or disciplined in the 17th century. They were more like factions, with \"members\" drifting in and out, collaborating temporarily on issues when it was to their advantage, then disbanding when it was not. A major deterrent to the development of opposing parties was the idea that there could only be one \"King's Party\" and to oppose it would be disloyal or even treasonous. This idea lingered throughout the 18th century. Nevertheless it became possible at the end of the 17th century to identify Parliaments and Ministries as being either \"Whig\" or \"Tory\" in composition.\n\n===Cabinet===\nThe modern prime minister is also the leader of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. A convention of the constitution, the modern Cabinet is a group of ministers who formulate policies.<ref name=Barnett249/> As the political heads of government departments Cabinet Ministers ensure that policies are carried out by permanent civil servants. Although the modern prime minister selects ministers, appointment still rests with the sovereign.<ref>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p. 247</ref> With the prime minister as its leader, the Cabinet forms the [[executive branch]] of government.{{#tag:ref|Once in office, the prime minister fills not only Cabinet level positions but many other government offices (up to 90 appointments), selected mostly from the House of Commons, distributing them to party members, partly as a reward for their loyalty.<ref>[[#Jennings|Jennings]], p. 59</ref> The power to make so many appointments to government offices is one of the most effective means the prime minister has of maintaining party discipline in the Commons.|group=note}}\n\nThe term \"Cabinet\" first appears after the Revolutionary Settlement to describe those ministers who conferred privately with the sovereign. The growth of the Cabinet met with widespread complaint and opposition because its meetings were often held in secret and it excluded the ancient [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] (of which the Cabinet is formally a committee) from the sovereign's circle of advisers, reducing it to an honorary body.<ref>[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p. 79. In 1691, for example, a Lord protested, that {{\"'}}Cabinet-Council' is not a word to be found in our Law-books. We know it not before: we took it for a nick-name. Nothing can fall out more unhappily, than to have a distinction made of the 'Cabinet' and 'Privy-Council' ... If some of the Privy-Council men be trusted, and some not, to whom is a gentleman to apply? Must he ask, \"Who is a Cabinet-Counsellor? ... I am sure, these distinctions of some being more trusted than others have given great dissatisfaction.\"</ref> The early Cabinet, like that of today, included the Treasurer and other department heads who sat on the Treasury bench. However, it might also include individuals who were not members of Parliament such as household officers (e.g. the Master of the Horse) and members of the royal family. The exclusion of non-members of Parliament from the Cabinet was essential to the development of ministerial accountability and responsibility.\n\nBoth William and Anne appointed and dismissed Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and followed up on actions. Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was an essential part of evolution of the Premiership. This process began after the Hanoverian Succession. Although [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714\u20131727) attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was bored with the discussions. [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] (1727\u20131760) occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his successor, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] (1760\u20131820), is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign. Thus, the convention that sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance. The prime minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign. These simple executive tasks naturally gave the prime minister ascendancy over his Cabinet colleagues.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 383</ref>\n\nAlthough the first three Hanoverians rarely attended Cabinet meetings they insisted on their prerogatives to appoint and dismiss ministers and to direct policy even if from outside the Cabinet. It was not until late in the 18th century that prime ministers gained control over Cabinet composition (see section [[#Emergence of Cabinet government|Emergence of Cabinet Government]] below).\n\n===\"One Party Government\"===\nBritish governments (or ministries) are generally formed by one party. The prime minister and Cabinet are usually all members of the same political party, almost always the one that has a majority of seats in the House of Commons. Coalition governments (a ministry that consists of representatives from two or more parties) and minority governments (a one-party ministry formed by a party that does not command a majority in the Commons) were relatively rare before the 2010 election, since 2010 there has been both a coalition and minority government. \"One party government\", as this system is sometimes called, has been the general rule for almost three hundred years.\n\nEarly in his reign, William III (1689\u20131702) preferred \"mixed ministries\" (or coalitions) consisting of both Tories and Whigs. William thought this composition would dilute the power of any one party and also give him the benefit of differing points of view. However, this approach did not work well because the members could not agree on a leader or on policies, and often worked at odds with each other.\n\nIn 1697, William formed a homogeneous Whig ministry. Known as the ''Junto'', this government is often cited as the first true Cabinet because its members were all Whigs, reflecting the majority composition of the Commons.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nAnne (1702\u20131714) followed this pattern but preferred Tory Cabinets. This approach worked well as long as Parliament was also predominantly Tory. However, in 1708, when the Whigs obtained a majority, Anne did not call on them to form a government, refusing to accept the idea that politicians could force themselves on her merely because their party had a majority.<ref>[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p.66 \"Is it not hard\", Anne said, \"that men of sense and honour will not promote the good of their country, because everything in the world is not done as they desire?\"</ref> She never parted with an entire Ministry or accepted an entirely new one regardless of the results of an election. Anne preferred to retain a minority government rather than be dictated to by Parliament. Consequently, her chief ministers [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], who were called \"Prime Minister\" by some, had difficulty executing policy in the face of a hostile Parliament.<ref name=\"Smith, pages 379\u2013382\"/><ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 76\u201383</ref>\n\nWilliam's and Anne's experiments with the political composition of the Cabinet illustrated the strengths of one party government and the weaknesses of coalition and minority governments. Nevertheless, it was not until the 1830s that the constitutional convention was established that the Sovereign must select the prime minister (and Cabinet) from the party whose views reflect those of the majority in Parliament. Since then, most ministries have reflected this one party rule.\n\nDespite the \"one party\" convention, prime ministers may still be called upon to lead either minority or coalition governments. A [[minority government]] may be formed as a result of a \"[[hung parliament]]\" in which no single party commands a majority in the House of Commons after a general election or the death, resignation or defection of existing members. By convention, the serving prime minister is given the first opportunity to reach agreements that will allow them to survive a vote of confidence in the House and continue to govern. Until 2017, the last minority government was led by Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] for eight months after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] produced a hung parliament. In the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 general election]], the Labour Party gained 18 seats, giving Wilson a majority of three.\n\nA hung parliament may also lead to the formation of a [[coalition government]] in which two or more parties negotiate a joint programme to command a majority in the Commons. Coalitions have also been formed during times of national crisis such as war. Under such circumstances, the parties agree to temporarily set aside their political differences and to unite to face the national crisis. Coalitions are rare: since 1721, there have been fewer than a dozen.\n\nWhen the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|general election of 2010]] produced a hung parliament, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties agreed to form the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition]], the first coalition in seventy years. The previous coalition in the UK before 2010 was led by Conservative Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] during most of the Second World War, from May 1940 to May 1945. [[Clement Attlee]], the leader of the Labour Party, served as Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 376\u2013379</ref> After the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election of 2015]], the nation returned to one party government after the Tories won an outright majority.\n\n===Treasury Commission===\nThe premiership is still largely a convention of the constitution; its legal authority is derived primarily from the fact that the prime minister is also First Lord of the Treasury. The connection of these two offices \u2013 one a convention, the other a legal office \u2013 began with the [[Hanoverian succession]] in 1714.\n\nWhen George I succeeded to the British throne in 1714, his German ministers advised him to leave the office of [[Lord High Treasurer]] vacant because those who had held it in recent years had grown overly powerful, in effect, replacing the sovereign as head of the government. They also feared that a Lord High Treasurer would undermine their own influence with the new king. They therefore suggested that he place the office in \"commission\", meaning that a committee of five ministers would perform its functions together. Theoretically, this dilution of authority would prevent any one of them from presuming to be the head of the government. The king agreed and created the Treasury Commission consisting of the First Lord of the Treasury, the Second Lord, and three Junior Lords.\n\nNo one has been appointed Lord High Treasurer since 1714; it has remained in commission for three hundred years. The Treasury Commission ceased to meet late in the 18th century but has survived, albeit with very different functions: the First Lord of the Treasury is now the prime minister, the Second Lord is the Chancellor of the Exchequer (and actually in charge of the Treasury), and the Junior Lords are government [[Whip (politics)|Whips]] maintaining party discipline in the House of Commons; they no longer have any duties related to the Treasury, though when [[Delegated legislation in the United Kingdom|subordinate legislation]] requires the consent of the Treasury it is still two of the Junior Lords who sign on its behalf.<ref group=note>See e.g. the various orders prescribing fees to be taken in public offices</ref><ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 107</ref>\n\n==Early prime ministers==\n===\"First\" prime minister===\nSince the office evolved rather than being instantly created, it may not be totally clear-cut who the first prime minister was. However, this appellation is traditionally given to Sir [[Robert Walpole]], who became [[First Lord of the Treasury]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1721.\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste van Loo - Robert Walpole.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Sir [[Robert Walpole]], studio of [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]], 1740. Walpole is generally considered to have been Britain's first prime minister.]]\nIn 1720, the [[South Sea Company]], created to trade in cotton, agricultural goods and slaves, collapsed, causing the financial ruin of thousands of investors and heavy losses for many others, including members of the royal family. King George I called on Robert Walpole, well known for his political and financial acumen, to handle the emergency. With considerable skill and some luck, Walpole acted quickly to restore public credit and confidence, and led the country out of the crisis. A year later, the king appointed him First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the House of Commons \u2013 making him the most powerful minister in the government. Ruthless, crude, and hard-working, he had a \"sagacious business sense\" and was a superb manager of men.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 384</ref> At the head of affairs for the next two decades, Walpole stabilised the nation's finances, kept it at peace, made it prosperous, and secured the [[Hanoverian succession]].<ref>[[#Pike|Pike]], pp. 22\u201323</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of British Prime Ministers |page=10 |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Eccleshall |editor2-first=Graham |editor2-last=Walker |first=Stephen |last=Taylor |chapter=Robert Walpole}}</ref>\n\nWalpole demonstrated for the first time how a chief minister \u2013 a prime minister \u2013 could be the actual head of the government under the new constitutional framework. First, recognising that the sovereign could no longer govern directly but was still the nominal head of the government, he insisted that he was nothing more than the \"King's Servant\".<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 385. He worked tirelessly to maintain the king's confidence, and sometimes resorted to bribery. On the accession of George II in 1727, for example, Walpole gave the new king an additional \u00a3100,000 for his personal use to maintain his offices.</ref> Second, recognising that power had shifted to the Commons, he conducted the nation's business there and made it dominant over the Lords in all matters. Third, recognising that the Cabinet had become the executive and must be united, he dominated the other members and demanded their complete support for his policies. Fourth, recognising that political parties were the source of ministerial strength, he led the Whig party and maintained discipline. In the Commons, he insisted on the support of all Whig members, especially those who held office. Finally, he set an example for future prime ministers by resigning his offices in 1742 after a [[vote of confidence]], which he won by just three votes. The slimness of this majority undermined his power, even though he still retained the confidence of the sovereign.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 77\u201381. The preceding paragraph is a paraphrase of Hearn's famous list of Walpole's contributions to the evolution of the office of prime minister in his book ''Government of England'', p. 220, quoted by Marriott.</ref><ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 385\u2013387</ref>\n\n===Ambivalence and denial===\nFor all his contributions, Walpole was not a prime minister in the modern sense. The king \u2013 not Parliament \u2013 chose him; and the king \u2013 not Walpole \u2013 chose the Cabinet. Walpole set an example, not a precedent, and few followed his example. For over 40 years after Walpole's fall in 1742, there was widespread ambivalence about the position. In some cases, the prime minister was a figurehead with power being wielded by other individuals; in others there was a reversion to the \"chief minister\" model of earlier times in which the sovereign actually governed.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 86. During most periods of British history, there have been chief ministers who have had many of the attributes of a modern prime minister such as [[Dunstan of Glastonbury]] under [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]], [[Ranulf Flambard]] under [[William II of England|William II]], [[Cardinal Wolsey]] and [[Thomas Cromwell]] under [[Henry VIII]], and many others.</ref> At other times, there appeared to be two prime ministers. During [[Great Britain's participation in the Seven Years' War]], for example, the powers of government were divided equally between the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] and [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], leading to them both alternatively being described as Prime Minister. Furthermore, many thought that the title \"Prime Minister\" usurped the sovereign's constitutional position as \"head of the government\" and that it was an affront to other ministers because they were all appointed by and equally responsible to the sovereign.\n\nFor these reasons, there was a reluctance to use the title. Although Walpole is now called the \"first\" prime minister, the title was not commonly used during his tenure. Walpole himself denied it. In 1741, during the attack that led to Walpole's downfall, [[Samuel Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys|Samuel Sandys]] declared that \"According to our Constitution we can have no sole and prime minister\". In his defence, Walpole said \"I unequivocally deny that I am sole or Prime Minister and that to my influence and direction all the affairs of government must be attributed\".<ref name=\"Marriott, p. 88\">[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 88</ref> [[George Grenville]], Prime Minister in the 1760s, said it was \"an odious title\" and never used it.<ref>[[#Low|Low]], p. 156</ref> [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]], the reluctant head of the King's Government during the [[American War of Independence]], \"would never suffer himself to be called Prime Minister, because it was an office unknown to the Constitution\".<ref>[[#Low|Low]], pp. 156\u2013157</ref><ref group=note>The 18th-century ambivalence causes problems for researchers trying to identify who was a prime minister and who was not.

In 1806, for example, one member of the Commons said, \"the Constitution abhors the idea of a prime minister\".

As late as 1904, Arthur Balfour explained the status of his office in a speech at Haddington: \"The Prime Minister has no salary as Prime Minister.

Britain then included [[England and Wales]] and [[Scotland]], but Ireland had its own parliament and government, which were firmly [[Anglo-Irish]] and did not represent the aspirations of most Irishmen. For this and other reasons, Pitt advanced his policy, and after some difficulty in persuading the Irish political class to surrender its control of Ireland under the [[Constitution of 1782]], the new union was created by the [[Acts of Union 1800]]. With effect from 1 January 1801, Great Britain and Ireland were united into a single kingdom, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the [[Parliament of Ireland]] came to an end, and until 1922 British ministers were responsible for all three kingdoms of the British Isles.<ref>J.

[[Bonar Law]], who had been in office as Prime Minister of Great Britain and Ireland for only six weeks, and who had just won the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|general election of November 1922]], thus became the last prime minister whose responsibilities covered both Britain and the whole of Ireland.

During the first 20 years of his reign, George III (1760\u20131820) tried to be his own \"prime minister\" by controlling policy from outside the Cabinet, appointing and dismissing ministers, meeting privately with individual ministers, and giving them instructions. These practices caused confusion and dissension in Cabinet meetings; King George's experiment in personal rule was generally a failure. After the failure of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]]'s ministry (1770\u20131782) in March 1782 due to Britain's defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the ensuing [[vote of no confidence]] by Parliament, the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]] reasserted the prime minister's control over the Cabinet. Rockingham assumed the Premiership \"on the distinct understanding that measures were to be changed as well as men; and that the measures for which the new ministry required the royal consent were the measures which they, while in opposition, had advocated.\" He and his Cabinet were united in their policies and would stand or fall together; they also refused to accept anyone in the Cabinet who did not agree.<ref group=note>This event also marks the beginnings of collective Cabinet responsibility. This principle states that the decisions made by any one Cabinet member become the responsibility of the entire Cabinet.</ref> King George threatened to [[abdication|abdicate]] but in the end reluctantly agreed out of necessity: he had to have a government.\n\nFrom this time, there was a growing acceptance of the position of Prime Minister and the title was more commonly used, if only unofficially.<ref name=\"Smith, pages 379\u2013382\">[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 379\u2013382</ref><ref>[[#Low|Low]], pp. 141\u2013142</ref> Associated initially with the Whigs, the Tories started to accept it. Lord North, for example, who had said the office was \"unknown to the constitution\", reversed himself in 1783 when he said, \"In this country some one man or some body of men like a Cabinet should govern the whole and direct every measure.\"<ref>[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p. 127</ref><ref>Pares, p. 175 in a letter to the King written at the same time, North repeated the idea, \"That in critical times, it is necessary that there should be one directing Minister, who should plan the whole of the operations of government, so far as to make them co-operate zealously & actively with his designs even tho' contrary to their own.\"</ref> In 1803, [[William Pitt the Younger]], also a Tory, suggested to a friend that \"this person generally called the first minister\" was an absolute necessity for a government to function, and expressed his belief that this person should be the minister in charge of the finances.<ref name=\"Marriott, p. 88\"/>\n[[File:William Pitt the Younger at Westminster.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|left|''William Pitt the Younger addressing the House of Commons.'' Pitt's 19 years as Prime Minister followed by Lord Liverpool's 15, led the Tory Party to accept the office as a convention of the constitution.]]\nThe Tories' wholesale conversion started when Pitt was confirmed as Prime Minister in the election of 1784. For the next 17 years until 1801 (and again from 1804 to 1806), Pitt, the Tory, was Prime Minister in the same sense that Walpole, the Whig, had been earlier.\n\nTheir conversion was reinforced after 1810. In that year, George III, who had suffered periodically from mental instability (possibly due to [[porphyria]]), became permanently insane and spent the remaining 10 years of his life unable to discharge his duties. The [[Prince Regent]] was prevented from using the full powers of kingship. The regent became [[George IV]] in 1820, but during his 10-year reign was indolent and frivolous. Consequently, for 20 years the throne was virtually vacant and Tory Cabinets led by Tory prime ministers filled the void, governing virtually on their own.\n\nThe Tories were in power for almost 50 years, except for a Whig ministry from 1806 to 1807. [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] was Prime Minister for 15 years; he and Pitt held the position for 34 years. Under their long, consistent leadership, Cabinet government became a convention of the constitution. Although subtle issues remained to be settled, the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet system of government]] is essentially the same today as it was in 1830.\n{{Gladstone's Cabinet of 1868|align=right|size=330px}}\nUnder this form of government, called the [[Westminster system]], the Sovereign is [[head of state]] and titular head of [[Her Majesty's Government]]. The Sovereign selects as Prime Minister the person who is able to command a working majority in the House of Commons, and invites him or her to form a government. As the actual [[Head of Government]], the prime minister selects the Cabinet, choosing its members from among those in Parliament who agree or generally agree with his or her intended policies. The prime minister then recommends the Cabinet to the Sovereign who confirms the selection by formally appointing them to their offices. Led by the prime minister, the Cabinet is collectively responsible for whatever the government does. The Sovereign does not confer with members privately about policy, nor attend Cabinet meetings. With respect to ''actual'' governance, the monarch has only three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise, and to warn.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp 92\u201393 Bagehot enumerated the three rights of a constitutional Monarch as \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn\"</ref> In practice this means that the Sovereign reviews state papers and meets regularly with the prime minister, usually weekly, when she may advise and warn him or her regarding the proposed decisions and actions of Her Government.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp 78\u201383. Marriott enumerates five characteristics of modern Cabinet Government: 1. exclusion of the sovereign, 2. close correspondence of party affiliation between the Cabinet and the majority in Parliament, 3. homogeneity of the Cabinet, 4. collective responsibility, and 5. ascendency of the prime minister.</ref>\n\n===Loyal Opposition===\n{{Main|Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)}}\nThe modern British system includes not only a government formed by the majority party (or coalition of parties) in the House of Commons but also an organised and open opposition formed by those who are not members of the governing party.<ref name=\"Barnett, p. 245\"/> Called [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition]], they occupy the benches to the Speaker's left. Seated in the front, directly across from the ministers on the Treasury Bench, the leaders of the opposition form a \"shadow government\", complete with a salaried \"shadow prime minister\", the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], ready to assume office if the government falls or loses the next election.\n\n[[File:House of Commons Microcosm.jpg|thumb|left|''The House of Commons early 19th century.''

Seated in the front, the leaders of the opposition form a \"shadow government\", complete with a salaried \"shadow prime minister\" ready to assume office if the government falls or loses the next election.]]\n\nOpposing the King's government was considered disloyal, even treasonous, at the end of the 17th century. During the 18th century this idea waned and finally disappeared as the two party system developed. The expression \"His Majesty's Opposition\" was coined by [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton]]. In 1826, Broughton, a Whig, announced in the Commons that he opposed the report of a Bill. As a joke, he said, \"It was said to be very hard on His Majesty's ministers to raise objections to this proposition. For my part, I think it is much more hard on His Majesty's Opposition to compel them to take this course.\"<ref>[[#Foord|Foord]], p.1 Laughter followed Hobhouse's remark but George Tierney, a leading Whig, repeated the phrase and added a definition. \"My honourable friend,\" he said, \"could not have invented a better phrase to designate us than that which he has adopted, for we are certainly to all intents and purposes a branch of His Majesty's Government.\"</ref> The phrase caught on and has been used ever since. Sometimes rendered as the \"[[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Loyal Opposition]]\", it acknowledges the legitimate existence of the two party system, and describes an important constitutional concept: opposing the government is not treason; reasonable men can honestly oppose its policies and still be loyal to the Sovereign and the nation.\n\nInformally recognized for over a century as a convention of the constitution, the position of Leader of the Opposition was given statutory recognition in 1937 by the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937|Ministers of the Crown Act]].\n\n===Great Reform Act and the premiership===\n{{Main|Reform Act 1832}}\nBritish prime ministers have never been elected directly by the public. A prime minister need not be a party leader; [[David Lloyd George]] was not a party leader during his service as prime Minister during World War I, and neither was Ramsay MacDonald from 1931 to 1935.<ref name=\"blake1993\">{{cite book |title=Churchill |publisher=Clarendon Press |author=Blake, Robert |year=1993 |location=Oxford |pages=262\u2013263 |chapter=How Churchill Became Prime Minister |editor1=Blake, Robert B. |editor2=Louis, William Roger |isbn=978-0-19-820626-2}}</ref> Prime ministers have taken office because they were members of either the Commons or Lords, and either inherited a majority in the Commons or won more seats than the opposition in a general election.\n\n[[File:Charles Grey - 2nd Earl Grey - atop the Grey Momument - Newcastle upon Tyne - England - 140804.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], often called the first modern prime minister]]\n[[File:Inscription Grey Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Inscription on [[Grey's Monument]], Newcastle upon Tyne, England]]\n\nSince 1722, most prime ministers have been members of the Commons; since 1902, all have had a seat there.<ref group=note>Except [[Alec Douglas-Home|Lord Home]], who resigned his peerage to stand in a by-election soon after becoming prime minister</ref> Like other members, they are elected initially to represent only a constituency. Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], for example, represented [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] in County Durham from 1983 to 2007. He became Prime Minister because in 1994 he was elected Labour Party leader and then led the party to victory in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], winning 418 seats compared to 165 for the Conservatives and gaining a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nNeither the sovereign nor the [[House of Lords]] had any meaningful influence over who was elected to the Commons in 1997 or in deciding whether or not Blair would become Prime Minister. Their detachment from the electoral process and the selection of the prime minister has been a convention of the constitution for almost 200 years.\n\nPrior to the 19th century, however, they had significant influence, using to their advantage the fact that most citizens were disenfranchised and seats in the Commons were allocated disproportionately. Through patronage, corruption and bribery, the Crown and Lords \"owned\" about 30% of the seats (called \"pocket\" or \"rotten boroughs\") giving them a significant influence in the Commons and in the selection of the prime minister.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 37\u201338</ref><ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 219\u2013222</ref>\n\nIn 1830, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]], the 2nd [[Earl Grey]] and a life-long Whig, became Prime Minister and was determined to reform the electoral system. For two years, he and his Cabinet fought to pass what has come to be known as the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Bill of 1832]].<ref>[[#Pike|Pike]], pp. 188\u2013194</ref><ref>Minney, p. 216. Contemporaries seemed to sense from the beginning that history was being made. Lord Creevey, for example, recorded in his diary, \"I dined in Downing Street with Lady Grey... After dinner the private secretary to the Prime Minister and myself being alone, I ascertained that although Lord Grey was gone to Brighton ostensibly to prick for Sheriffs for the year, his great object was to put his plan of reform before the King, previous... to its being proposed to the House of Commons. A ticklish operation, this! to propose to a Sovereign a plan for reducing his own power and patronage. However, there is the plan all cut and dry, and the Cabinet unanimous upon it... Grey is determined to fight it out to a dissolution of Parliament, if his plan is beat in the Commons. My eye, what a crisis!\"</ref> The greatness of the Great Reform Bill lay less in substance than in symbolism. As John Bright, a liberal statesman of the next generation, said, \"It was not a good Bill, but it was a great Bill when it passed.\"<ref>Trevelyan, p.272</ref> Substantively, it increased the franchise by 65% to 717,000; with the [[middle class]] receiving most of the new votes. The representation of 56 rotten boroughs was eliminated completely, together with half the representation of 30 others; the freed up seats were distributed to boroughs created for previously disenfranchised areas. However, many rotten boroughs remained and it still excluded millions of working-class men and all women.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 222\u2013223</ref><ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 437\u2013444</ref>\n\nSymbolically, however, the Reform Act exceeded expectations. It is now ranked with [[Magna Carta]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] as one of the most important documents of the British constitutional tradition.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nFirst, the Act removed the sovereign from the election process and the choice of Prime Minister. Slowly evolving for 100 years, this convention was confirmed two years after the passage of the Act. In 1834, King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] dismissed Melbourne as premier, but was forced to recall him when [[Robert Peel]], the king's choice, could not form a working majority. Since then, no sovereign has tried to impose a prime minister on Parliament.\n\nSecond, the Bill reduced the Lords' power by eliminating many of their pocket boroughs and creating new boroughs in which they had no influence. Weakened, they were unable to prevent the passage of more comprehensive electoral reforms in 1867, 1884, 1918 and 1928 when universal equal suffrage was established.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 454, 468, 486, and 489</ref>\n[[File:PunchDizzyReformBill.png|thumb|upright|left|''Disraeli and Gladstone Race to Pass the Reform Bill, Punch, 1867'' The rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone helped to identify the position of Prime Minister with specific personalities. (Disraeli is in the lead looking back over his shoulder at Gladstone.)]]\nUltimately, this erosion of power led to the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which marginalised the Lords' role in the legislative process and gave further weight to the convention that had developed over the previous century<ref group=note>As early as 1839, the former Prime Minister [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] had argued in the House of Lords that \"I have long entertained the view that the Prime Minister of this country, under existing circumstances, ought to have a seat in the other House of Parliament, and that he would have great advantage in carrying on the business of the Sovereign by being there.\" Quoted in [[#Barnett|Barnett]], p. 246</ref> that a prime minister cannot sit in the House of Lords. The last to do so was [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], from 1895 to 1902.<ref group=note>The last prime minister to be a member of the Lords during any part of his tenure was [[Alec Douglas-Home, 14th Earl of Home]] in 1963. Lord Home was the last prime minister who was a hereditary peer, but, within days of attaining office, he disclaimed his peerage, abiding by the convention that the prime minister should sit in the House of Commons. A junior member of his Conservative Party who had already been selected as candidate in a [[1963 Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election|by-election]] in a staunch Conservative seat stood aside, allowing Home to contest and win the by-election, and thus procure a seat in the lower House.</ref> Throughout the 19th century, governments led from the Lords had often suffered difficulties governing alongside ministers who sat in the Commons.<ref>[[#Jennings|Jennings]], p. 21</ref>\n\nGrey set an example and a precedent for his successors. He was ''primus inter pares'' (first among equals), as Bagehot said in 1867 of the prime minister's status. Using his Whig victory as a mandate for reform, Grey was unrelenting in the pursuit of this goal, using every parliamentary device to achieve it. Although respectful toward the king, he made it clear that his constitutional duty was to acquiesce to the will of the people and Parliament.\n\nThe Loyal Opposition acquiesced too. Some disgruntled Tories claimed they would repeal the bill once they regained a majority. But in 1834, Robert Peel, the new Conservative leader, put an end to this threat when he stated in his [[Tamworth Manifesto]] that the bill was \"a final and irrevocable settlement of a great constitutional question which no friend to the peace and welfare of this country would attempt to disturb\".<ref>[[#Pike|Pike]], p. 219</ref>\n\n===Populist prime ministers===\n[[File:Elliott & Fry10a.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] cultivated the public image as a ''man of the people'' by circulating pictures like this of himself cutting down oak trees with an axe. Photo by [[Elliott & Fry]]]]\n\nThe premiership was a reclusive office prior to 1832. The incumbent worked with his Cabinet and other government officials; he occasionally met with the sovereign and attended Parliament when it was in session during the spring and summer. He never went out on the stump to campaign, even during elections; he rarely spoke directly to ordinary voters about policies and issues.\n\nAfter the passage of the [[Great Reform Bill]], the nature of the position changed: prime ministers had to go out among the people. The Bill increased the electorate to 717,000. Subsequent legislation (and population growth) raised it to 2&nbsp;million in 1867, 5.5&nbsp;million in 1884 and 21.4&nbsp;million in 1918. As the franchise increased, power shifted to the people, and prime ministers assumed more responsibilities with respect to party leadership. It naturally fell on them to motivate and organise their followers, explain party policies, and deliver its \"message\". Successful leaders had to have a new set of skills: to give a good speech, present a favourable image, and interact with a crowd. They became the \"voice\", the \"face\" and the \"image\" of the party and ministry.\n\n[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] cultivated a public image as an [[imperialist]] with grand gestures such as conferring on [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] the title \"Empress of India\".]]\n\nRobert Peel, often called the \"model prime minister\",<ref>Rosebery, p. 27. Lord Rosebery, later a prime minister himself, said of Peel: \"the model of all Prime Ministers. It is more than doubtful, indeed, if it be possible in this generation, when the burdens of Empire and of office have so incalculably grown, for any Prime Minister to discharge the duties of his high office with the same thoroughness or in the same spirit as Peel. ... Peel kept a strict supervision over every department: he seems to have been master of the business of each and all of them. ... it is probable that no Prime Minister ever fulfilled so completely and thoroughly the functions of the office, parliamentary, administrative, and general as Sir Robert Peel.\"</ref> was the first to recognise this new role. After the successful Conservative campaign of 1841, J. W. Croker said in a letter to Peel, \"The elections are wonderful, and the curiosity is that all turns on the name of Sir Robert Peel. It's the first time that I remember in our history that the people have chosen the first Minister for the Sovereign. Mr. Pitt's case in '84 is the nearest analogy; but then the people only confirmed the Sovereign's choice; here every Conservative candidate professed himself in plain words to be Sir Robert Peel's man, and on that ground was elected.\"<ref>Hanham, pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n[[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone]] developed this new role further by projecting \"images\" of themselves to the public. Known by their nicknames \"Dizzy\" and the \"Grand Old Man\", their colourful, sometimes bitter, personal and political rivalry over the issues of their time \u2013 Imperialism vs. Anti-Imperialism, expansion of the franchise, labour reform, and Irish Home Rule \u2013 spanned almost twenty years until Disraeli's death in 1881.<ref group=note>Even after death their rivalry continued. When Disraeli died in 1881, Gladstone proposed a state funeral, but Disraeli's will specified that he have a private funeral and be buried next to his wife. Gladstone replied, \"As [Disraeli] lived, so he died\u2014all display, without reality or genuineness.\" Disraeli, for his part, once said that GOM (the acronym for \"Grand Old Man\") really stood for \"God's Only Mistake\".</ref> Documented by the penny press, photographs and political cartoons, their rivalry linked specific personalities with the Premiership in the public mind and further enhanced its status.\n\n[[File:GladstoneandRosebery.gif|thumb|right|''Gladstone During the Midlothian Campaign 1879'' Speaking directly to the people for the first time, Gladstone's Midlothian campaign symbolises a major change in the role of the prime minister. (Gladstone is seated in the centre; Rosebery, a future prime minister, is sitting on the carpet in front.)]]\n\nEach created a different public image of himself and his party. Disraeli, who expanded the Empire to protect British interests abroad, cultivated the image of himself (and the Conservative Party) as \"Imperialist\", making grand gestures such as conferring the title \"[[Empress of India]]\" on Queen Victoria in 1876. Gladstone, who saw little value in the Empire, proposed an anti-Imperialist policy (later called \"Little England\"), and cultivated the image of himself (and the Liberal Party) as \"man of the people\" by circulating pictures of himself cutting down great oak trees with an axe as a hobby.\n\nGladstone went beyond image by appealing directly to the people. In his [[Midlothian campaign]] \u2013 so called because he stood as a candidate for that county \u2013 Gladstone spoke in fields, halls and railway stations to hundreds, sometimes thousands, of students, farmers, labourers and middle class workers. Although not the first leader to speak directly to voters \u2013 both he and Disraeli had spoken directly to party loyalists before on special occasions \u2013 he was the first to canvass an entire constituency, delivering his message to anyone who would listen, encouraging his supporters and trying to convert his opponents. Publicised nationwide, Gladstone's message became that of the party. Noting its significance, [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] said, \"It is a new thing and a very serious thing to see the Prime Minister on the stump.\"<ref>Bigham, p. 318. Disraeli and Victoria thought the tactic was unconstitutional. \"Such conduct\", the Queen said, \"is unheard of and the only excuse is\u2014that he is not quite sane.\"</ref>\n\nCampaigning directly to the people became commonplace. Several 20th-century prime ministers, such as [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Winston Churchill]], were famous for their oratorical skills. After the introduction of radio, motion pictures, television, and the internet, many used these technologies to project their public image and address the nation. [[Stanley Baldwin]], a master of the radio broadcast in the 1920s and 1930s, reached a national audience in his talks filled with homely advice and simple expressions of national pride.<ref>[[#Pike|Pike]], p. 389</ref> [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] also used the radio to great effect, inspiring, reassuring and informing the people with his speeches during the Second World War. Two recent prime ministers, [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Tony Blair]] (who both spent a decade or more as Prime Minister), achieved celebrity status like rock stars, but have been criticised for their more 'presidential' style of leadership. According to [[Anthony King (professor)|Anthony King]], \"The props in Blair's theatre of celebrity included ... his guitar, his casual clothes ... footballs bounced skilfully off the top of his head ... carefully choreographed speeches and performances at Labour Party conferences.\"<ref>[[#King|King]], pp. 319\u2013320</ref>\n\n==Modern premiership==\n===Parliament Act and the premiership===\n{{Main|Parliament Act 1911|Parliament Act 1949|Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949}}\nIn addition to being the leader of a great political party and the head of Her Majesty's Government, the modern prime minister directs the law-making process, enacting into law his or her party's programme. For example, [[Tony Blair]], whose Labour party was elected in 1997 partly on a promise to enact a British Bill of Rights and to create devolved governments for Scotland and Wales, subsequently stewarded through Parliament the [[Human Rights Act (1998)]], the [[Scotland Act (1998)]] and the [[Government of Wales Act (1998)]].\n\nFrom its appearance in the fourteenth century Parliament has been a bicameral legislature consisting of the Commons and the Lords. Members of the Commons are elected; those in the Lords are not. Most Lords are called \"Temporal\" with titles such as Duke, Marquess, Earl, and Viscount. The balance are Lords Spiritual (prelates of the Anglican Church).\n\nFor most of the history of the Upper House, Lords Temporal were landowners who held their estates, titles, and seats as a hereditary right passed down from one generation to the next \u2013 in some cases for centuries. In 1910, for example, there were nineteen whose title was created before 1500.<ref>[[#Tuchman1|Tuchman]], p 391</ref><ref group=note>Following a series of reforms in the twentieth century the Lords now consists almost entirely of appointed members who hold their title only for their own lifetime.  As of 11 June 2012 the Lords had 763 members (excluding 49 who were on leave of absence or otherwise disqualified from sitting), compared to 646 in the Commons.</ref><ref name=\"lords_composition\">{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/analysis_by_composition.cfm |title=House of Lords: Breakdown of Lords by party strength and type of peerage |accessdate=25 May 2008 |date=1 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514004118/http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/analysis_by_composition.cfm |archivedate=14 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hcio/stateparties.cfm |title=House of Commons: State of the parties|accessdate=25 May 2008|date=23 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151016/http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hcio/stateparties.cfm|archivedate=11 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1911, prime ministers had to guide legislation through the Commons and the Lords and obtain majority approval in both houses for it to become law. This was not always easy, because political differences often separated the chambers. Representing the landed aristocracy, Lords Temporal were generally Tory (later Conservative) who wanted to maintain the status quo and resisted progressive measures such as extending the franchise. The party affiliation of members of the Commons was less predictable. During the 18th century its makeup varied because the Lords had considerable control over elections: sometimes Whigs dominated it, sometimes Tories. After the passage of the [[Great Reform Bill]] in 1832, the Commons gradually became more progressive, a tendency that increased with the passage of each subsequent expansion of the franchise.\n\n[[File:Meeting of Asquith cabinet19090001.jpg|thumb|left|''Asquith's Cabinet Reacts to the Lords' Rejection of the \"People's Budget\"\u2014a satirical cartoon, 1909.'' Prime Minister Asquith's government welcomed the Lords' veto of the \"People's Budget\"; it moved the country toward a constitutional crisis over the Lords' legislative powers. (Asquith makes the announcement while David Lloyd George holds down a jubilant Winston Churchill.)]]\n\nIn 1906, the Liberal party, led by Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]], won an overwhelming victory on a platform that promised social reforms for the working class. With 379 seats compared to the Conservatives' 132, the Liberals could confidently expect to pass their legislative programme through the Commons.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 477,</ref><ref>[[#Tuchman1|Tuchman]], p 365. The Liberal majority was actually much larger in practice because on most issues they could rely on the votes of 51 Labour and Lib-Lab representatives and 83 Irish Nationalists. Their majority was so large and unprecedented \u2013 they had more seats than all other parties combined \u2013 that one Conservative called it a \"hideous abnormality\".</ref> At the same time, however, the Conservative Party had a huge majority in the Lords; it could easily veto any legislation passed by the Commons that was against their interests.<ref>Furthermore, [[Arthur Balfour]], the defeated Conservative prime minister and now Leader of the Opposition, declared that the House of Lords was the \"watchdog of the constitution\"; it had an obligation to promote stability by rejecting \"radical\" legislation proposed by \"zealots\" who may have a temporary numerical advantage in the Commons. [[David Lloyd George]], the new Liberal [[President of the Board of Trade]] and a future prime minister, said the Lords \"... is not the watchdog of the British Constitution. It is Mr Balfour's poodle!\" [[#Smith|Smith]], p. 478</ref>\n\nFor five years, the Commons and the Lords fought over one bill after another. The Liberals pushed through parts of their programme, but the Conservatives vetoed or modified others. When the Lords vetoed the \"[[People's Budget]]\" in 1909, the controversy moved almost inevitably toward a constitutional crisis.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp 478\u2013480. Although the Liberals did pass the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906|Trade Disputes Act]], the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906|Workmen's Compensation Act]], the [[Labour Exchanges Act 1909|Labour Exchanges Act]], the [[Trade Boards Act 1909|Trade Boards Act]], and the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1909|Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act]], the Lords vetoed an [[Education Bill]], a land reform bill, a [[Licensing Bill]], and a Plural Voting Bill; they mutilated and mauled an [[Agricultural Holdings Bill]] and an Irish Town Tenants Bill, and they almost rejected the [[Old-Age Pensions Act 1908|Old-Age Pensions Act]].</ref>\n\n[[File:Passing of the Parliament Bill, 1911 - Project Gutenberg eText 19609.jpg|thumb|right|''An important vote: the [[House of Lords]] voting for the [[Parliament Act 1911]].

Asquith]]<ref group=note>Campbell-Bannerman retired and died in 1908.</ref> introduced a bill \"for regulating the relations between the Houses of Parliament\" which would eliminate the Lords' veto power over legislation. Passed by the Commons, the Lords rejected it. In a general election fought on this issue, the Liberals were weakened but still had a comfortable majority. At Asquith's request, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] then threatened to create a sufficient number of new Liberal Peers to ensure the bill's passage. Rather than accept a permanent Liberal majority, the Conservative Lords yielded, and the bill became law.<ref>[[#Knappen|Knappen]], pp 554\u2013555</ref>\n\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]] established the supremacy of the Commons. It provided that the Lords could not delay for more than one month any bill certified by the Speaker of the Commons as a money bill. Furthermore, the Act provided that any bill rejected by the Lords would nevertheless become law if passed by the Commons in three successive sessions provided that two years had elapsed since its original passage. The Lords could still delay or suspend the enactment of legislation but could no longer veto it.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 482,</ref><ref>[[#Knappen|Knappen]], p. 555</ref> Subsequently the Lords \"suspending\" power was reduced to one year by the [[Parliament Act 1949]].\n\nIndirectly, the Act enhanced the already dominant position of Prime Minister in the constitutional hierarchy. Although the Lords are still involved in the legislative process and the prime minister must still guide legislation through both Houses, the Lords no longer have the power to veto or even delay enactment of legislation passed by the Commons. Provided that he or she controls the Cabinet, maintains party discipline, and commands a majority in the Commons, the prime minister is assured of putting through his or her legislative agenda.\n\n===Contemporary theories of prime ministerial power===\n{{redirect|British Presidency|the political units in British India|Presidencies and provinces of British India}} Varying and competing theories of the role and power of the contemporary modern prime minister have emerged in the post-war period, particularly in response to new styles of leadership and governance. The classic view of Cabinet Government was laid out by [[Walter Bagehot]] in ''[[The English Constitution]]'' (1867) in which he described the prime minister as the [[primus inter pares]] (\"first among equals\").<ref name=\"Fairclough 2002, p. ~23\">{{cite book|title=Advanced Government and Politics|last=Fairclough|first=Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-19-913434-2|chapter=6.1 The Primemister|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxqkElM8jiYC&pg=PA23}}</ref> This view was challenged in ''The British Cabinet'' by John P.

P|publisher=Stevens|year=1962|isbn=|location=London|pages=2\u201325}}</ref> This transformation, according to Mackintosh primarily resulted because of the diminishing role of the Cabinet Ministers and because of centralisation of the party machine and the bureaucracy.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Richard Crossman]] also alluded to the presidentialisation of British politics in the ''Introduction'' to the 1963 version of Walter Bagehot's ''The English Constitution''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |title=The English Constitution|last=Crossman|first=Richard|last2=Bagehot|first2=Walter|publisher=Fontana|year=1963|location=London |pages=1\u201357|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> Crossman mentions the Second World War, and its immediate aftermath as a water-shed moment for Britain that led to immense accumulation of power in the hands of the British prime minister<ref name=\":1\" /> These powers, according to Crossman, are so immense that their study require the use of presidential parallels.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n [[File:Churchill waves to crowds.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill waving to crowds after announcing the surrender of [[Nazi Germany]] in May 1945]]\n\n==== Presidentialisation thesis ====\nThe most prominent characterisation of prime ministerial power to emerge is the ''presidentialisation thesis''. This asserts that the prime minister has become more detached from Cabinet, party and Parliament and operates as if the occupant of the office is elected directly by the people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Politics UK|last=Jones|first=Bill|last2=Norton |first2=Philip|last3=Daddow|first3=Oliver|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=Abingdon|page=454}}</ref> The thesis is usually presented with comparisons to the [[President of the United States|American Presidency]]. Thomas Poguntke and Paul Webb define it as:\n\n{{quote|\"the development of increasing leadership power resources and autonomy within the party and the political executive respectively, and increasingly leadership-centered electoral processes.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Presidentialization of Politics: A Comparative Study of Modern Democracies|last=Poguntke|first=Thomas|last2=Webb|first2=Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|location=Oxford |page=5}}</ref>}}\n\nThe thesis has been most popularised by [[Michael Foley (academic)|Michael Foley]], who wrote two books, namely, ''The Rise of the British Presidency'', and ''The British Presidency: Tony Blair and the Politics of Public Leadership'' that are solely dedicated to the subject of presidentialisation in Britain.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Rise of the British Presidency|last=Foley |first=Michael|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1993|location=Manchester|page=283}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The British Presidency: Tony Blair and the Politics of Public Leadership|last=Foley|first=Michael|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000 |location=Manchester}}</ref> Foley writes:\n\n{{quote|The British Prime Minister has to all intents and purposes turned, not into a British version of an American president, but into an authentically British president.<ref name=\":2\" />}}\n\nThe thesis has been widely applied to the [[premiership of Tony Blair]] as many sources such as former ministers have suggested that decision-making was controlled by him and [[Gordon Brown]], and the Cabinet was no longer used for decision-making.<ref>{{cite book|title=British Government in Crisis|last=Foster|first=Christopher|publisher=Hart Publishing|year=2005|chapter=Chapter 12 Blair's Cabinet: Monarchy Returns}}</ref> Former ministers such as [[Clare Short]] and [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]] have criticised the lack of decision-making power in Cabinet.

These authors cite the stark differences between the British parliamentary model, with its principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], and the American presidential model, which has its roots in the principle of [[separation of powers]]. For example, according to John Hart, using the American example to explain the accumulation of power in the hands of the British PM is flawed and that changing dynamics of the British executive can only be studied in Britain's own historical and structural sense.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=John|date=1991|title=President and Prime Minister: Convergence or Divergence|url=|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=44|issue=2|pages=208\u2013225|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pa.a052294}}</ref> The power that a prime minister has over his or her Cabinet colleagues is directly proportional to the amount of support that they have with their political parties and this is often related to whether the party considers them to be an electoral asset or liability. Additionally, when a party is divided into factions a prime minister may be forced to include other powerful party members in the Cabinet for party political cohesion. The prime minister's personal power is also curtailed if their party is in a power-sharing arrangement, or a formal coalition with another party (as happened in the coalition government of 2010 to 2015).<ref name=\"Williams 1998, pp. 113\u2013114\">{{cite book|title=UK Government & Politics|last=Williams|first=Andy |publisher=Heinemann |year=1998|isbn=978-0-435-33158-0|pages=113\u2013114|chapter=Prime ministerial government|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6keDJpK0xL8C&pg=PA113}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Comparative Politics and Government|last=Palekar|first=S.A.|date=2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Therefore, unlike presidents, the prime minister can directly initiate legislation and due to the context British politics functions within, faces fewer \"veto players\" than a president.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Dowding|first=Keith|date=April 2017|title=The Prime Ministerialisation of the British Prime Minister|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=66|issue=3|pages=617\u2013635|doi=10.1093/pa/gss007|doi-access=free}}</ref> Thus, Dowding argues that adding to these powers, makes the prime minister less like presidents, and that what Britain is witnessing can be best explained as ''Prime Ministerialisation'' of British politics.<ref name=\":3\" /> The work of Martin J.

The Core Executive model asserts that prime ministerial power (especially of individual leaders, such as Thatcher and Blair) has been greatly overstated, and, instead, is both dependent upon and constrained by relationships, or \"dependency linkages\", with other institutions in government, such as members of the Cabinet or the Treasury. In this model, prime ministers are seen to have improved their institutional position, but rejects the notion that they dominate government and that they act, or have the ability to act, as Presidents due to the aforementioned dependencies and constraints 'that define decision-making in central government.' Smith emphasises \"complex resource relationships\" (or rather how formal and informal powers are used) and what resources a particular actor possesses. In this case, the prime minister naturally holds more resources than others. These include patronage, control of the Cabinet agenda, appointment of Cabinet Committees and the prime minister's office, as well as collective oversight and the ability to intervene in any policy area. However, all actors possess \"resources\" and government decision making relies upon resource exchange in order to achieve policy goals, not through command alone.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Martin J.|date=2010|title=Intelligence and the Core Executive|journal=Public Policy and Administration|volume=25|issue=1|pages=11\u201328|doi=10.1177/0952076709347072}}</ref> Smith originally used this model to explain the resignation of Margaret Thatcher in 1990, concluding that:\n\n{{quote|Government is not cabinet government or prime ministerial government.

The prime minister then formally [[kissing hands|kisses the hands]] of the sovereign, whose [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative powers]] are thereafter exercised solely on the advice of the prime minister and Her Majesty's Government (\"HMG\"). The prime minister has weekly audiences with the sovereign, whose rights are constitutionally limited: \"to warn, to encourage, and to be consulted\";<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4351/4351-h/4351-h.htm |last=Bagehot |first=Walter |title=The English Constitution |year=1867 |publisher=Project Gutenburg Ebook |accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> the extent of the sovereign's ability to influence the nature of the prime ministerial advice is unknown, but presumably varies depending upon the personal relationship between the sovereign and the prime minister of the day.\n\nThe prime minister will appoint all other cabinet members (who then become active Privy Counsellors) and ministers, although consulting senior ministers on their junior ministers, without any Parliamentary or other control or process over these powers. At any time, the PM may obtain the appointment, dismissal or nominal resignation of any other minister; the PM may resign, either purely personally or with the whole government. The prime minister generally co-ordinates the policies and activities of the Cabinet and Government departments, acting as the main public \"face\" of Her Majesty's Government.\n\nAlthough the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[British Armed Forces]] is legally the sovereign, under constitutional practice the prime minister can declare war, and through the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] (a position which the prime minister may appoint, dismiss or even appoint themselves to), as chair of the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]], exert power over the deployment and disposition of the UK's forces.\n\nThe prime minister makes all the most senior Crown appointments, and most others are made by ministers over whom the prime minister has the power of appointment and dismissal. [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellors]], Ambassadors and [[High Commissioner]]s, senior civil servants, senior military officers, members of important committees and commissions, and other officials are selected, and in most cases may be removed, by the prime minister. The prime minister also formally advises the sovereign on the appointment of archbishops and bishops of the [[Church of England]],<ref name=Barnett249>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p. 249</ref> but the prime minister's discretion is limited by the existence of the [[Crown Nominations Commission]]. The appointment of senior judges, while constitutionally still on the advice of the prime minister, is now made on the basis of recommendations from independent bodies.\n\nPeerages, knighthoods, and most other honours are bestowed by the sovereign only on the advice of the prime minister. The only important British honours over which the prime minister does not have control are the [[Order of the Garter]], the [[Order of the Thistle]], the [[Order of Merit]], the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]], the [[Royal Victorian Order]], and the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]], which are all within the \"personal gift\" of the sovereign.\n\nThe prime minister appoints officials known as the \"Government Whips\", who negotiate for the support of MPs and to discipline dissenters. Party discipline is strong since electors generally vote for individuals on the basis of their party affiliation. Members of Parliament may be expelled from their party for failing to support the Government on important issues, and although this will not mean they must resign as MPs, it will usually make re-election difficult. Members of Parliament who hold ministerial office or political privileges can expect removal for failing to support the prime minister. Restraints imposed by the Commons grow weaker when the Government's party enjoys a large majority in that House, or among the electorate. In most circumstances, however, the prime minister can secure the Commons' support for almost any bill by internal party negotiations, with little regard to Opposition MPs.\n\nHowever, even a government with a healthy majority can on occasion find itself unable to pass legislation. For example, on 9 November 2005, [[Tony Blair]]'s Government was defeated over plans which would have allowed police to detain terror suspects for up to 90 days without charge, and on 31 January 2006, was defeated over certain aspects of proposals to outlaw religious hatred.

In modern practice, when the Government party has an absolute majority in the House, only [[loss of supply]] and the express vote \"that this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government\" are treated as having this effect; dissenters on a minor issue within the majority party are unlikely to force an election with the probable loss of their seats and salaries.\n\nLikewise, a prime minister is no longer just \"first amongst equals\" in HM Government; although theoretically the Cabinet might still outvote the prime minister, in practice the prime minister progressively entrenches his or her position by retaining only personal supporters in the Cabinet. In occasional reshuffles, the prime minister can sideline and simply drop from Cabinet the Members who have fallen out of favour: they remain Privy Counsellors, but the prime minister decides which of them are summoned to meetings. The prime minister is responsible for producing and enforcing the [[Ministerial Code]].\n\n==Precedence, privileges and form of address==\n{{Main|List of peerages held by Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:chequers2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Chequers Court]]'', the prime minister's official country home]]\nBy tradition, before a new prime minister can occupy [[10 Downing Street]], they are required to announce to the country and the world that they have \"kissed hands\" with the reigning monarch, and have thus become Prime Minister.

This reflected the Lord Chancellor's position at the head of the [[Judiciary of England and Wales#Judicial salaries|judicial pay scale]]. The [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] eliminated the Lord Chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister.\n\nThe prime minister is customarily a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and thus entitled to the appellation \"[[The Right Honourable]]\". Membership of the Council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed Prime Minister. Most potential candidates have already attained this status. The only case when a non-privy counsellor was the natural appointment was Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. The issue was resolved by appointing him to the Council immediately prior to his appointment as Prime Minister.\n\nAccording to the now defunct [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], the prime minister is made a privy counsellor as a result of taking office and should be addressed by the official title prefixed by \"The Right Honourable\" and not by a personal name.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2016}} Although this form of address is employed on formal occasions, it is rarely used by the media. As \"prime minister\" is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as \"the prime minister\". The title \"Prime Minister\" (e.g. \"Prime Minister Boris Johnson\") is technically incorrect but is sometimes used erroneously outside the United Kingdom and has more recently become acceptable within it.<ref>An example of \"prime minister\" being used as a title, even by Number 10 Downing Street. {{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/09/pm-attending-european-council-55107|title=PM attends European Council |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> Within the UK, the expression \"Prime Minister Johnson\" is never used, although it, too, is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources.\n\n10 Downing Street, in [[London]], has been the [[official residence|official place of residence]] of the prime minister since 1732; they are entitled to use its staff and facilities, including extensive offices.

The honour bestowed is commonly, but not invariably, membership of the UK's most senior order of chivalry, the [[Order of the Garter]]. The practice of creating a retired prime minister a Knight of the Garter (KG) has been fairly prevalent since the mid\u2013nineteenth century. Upon the retirement of a prime minister who is Scottish, it is likely that the primarily Scottish honour of [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]] (KT) will be used instead of the Order of the Garter, which is generally regarded as an English honour.<ref group=note>This circumstance is somewhat confused, however, as since the Great Reform Act 1832, only seven Scots have served as prime minister. Of these, two \u2013 [[Bonar Law]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]] \u2013 died while still sitting in the Commons, not yet having retired; another, the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]], was appointed to ''both'' the Order of the Garter and the Order of the Thistle; yet another, [[Arthur Balfour]], was appointed to the Order of the Garter, but represented an English constituency and may not have considered himself entirely Scottish; and of the remaining three, the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]] became a KG, [[Alec Douglas-Home]] became a KT, and [[Gordon Brown]] remained in the House of Commons as a [[backbencher]] until 2015.</ref>\n\nHistorically it has also been common to grant prime ministers a [[peerage]] upon retirement from the Commons, elevating the individual to the Lords. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an [[earl]]dom.{{refn|group=note|Churchill was offered a [[Duke of London|dukedom]] but declined.<ref>{{cite book |title=Winston S.

Unusually, he became [[Earl of Stockton]] only in 1984, over twenty years after leaving office.\n\nMacmillan's successors, [[Alec Douglas-Home]], [[Harold Wilson]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], all accepted [[life peer]]ages (although Douglas-Home had previously disclaimed his hereditary title as [[Earl of Home]]). [[Edward Heath]] did not accept a peerage of any kind and nor have any of the prime ministers to retire since 1990, although Heath and Major were later appointed as Knights of the Garter.\n\nThe most recent former prime minister to die was Margaret Thatcher (1979\u20131990) on 8 April 2013. Her death meant that for the first time since 1955 (the year in which the [[Earldom of Attlee]] was created, subsequent to the death of [[Earl Baldwin of Bewdley|Earl Baldwin]] in 1947) the membership of the House of Lords included no former prime minister, a situation which remains the case as of 2020.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Timeline of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by length of tenure]]\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by age]]\n* [[List of current heads of government in the United Kingdom and dependencies]]\n* [[List of fictional Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of peerages held by Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies represented by sitting Prime Ministers]]\n* [[Air transport of the Royal Family and Government of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Children of the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Living Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Prime Ministerial Car (United Kingdom)]]\n* [[Prime Minister's Questions]]\n* [[Records of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Spouse of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Works cited ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |title=The English Constitution |last=Bagehot |first=Walter |year=1963 |ref=Bagehot |publisher=Wm.

The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous [[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of Parliament]], political developments, and accidents of history. The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective. The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement (1688\u20131720) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament.<ref name=\"Evolution of Prime Minister\">{{cite news|title=George I |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHanoverians/GeorgeI.aspx|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref> Although the sovereign was not stripped of the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|ancient prerogative powers]] and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a prime minister who could command a majority in Parliament.\n\nBy the 1830s, the [[Westminster system]] of government (or cabinet government) had emerged; the prime minister had become ''[[primus inter pares]]'' or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom. The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties, the introduction of mass communication and photography. By the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-\u00e0-vis the Sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet.\n\nPrior to 1902, the prime minister sometimes came from the [[House of Lords]], provided that his government could form a majority in the Commons. However as the power of the aristocracy waned during the 19th century the convention developed that the prime minister should always sit as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) in the lower house, making them answerable only to the Commons in Parliament. As leader of the House of Commons, the prime minister's authority was further enhanced by the [[Parliament Act 1911]] which marginalised the influence of the House of Lords in the law-making process.\n\nThe prime minister is ''[[ex officio]]'' also [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]]. Indeed, certain privileges, such as [[List of residents of 10 Downing Street|residency]] of [[10 Downing Street]], are accorded to prime ministers by virtue of their position as First Lord of the Treasury.\n\nThe status and executive powers of the British prime minister means that the incumbent is consistently ranked as one of the most powerful and influential people in the world.\n\n==Authority==\nThe prime minister is the head of the [[United Kingdom government]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/prime-minister|title=Prime Minister|website=Gov.UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014185426/https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/prime-minister|archive-date=14 October 2017 |url-status=live|access-date=19 May 2018}}</ref> As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower House of the legislature). The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than [[separation of powers|separation]].<ref>[[#Le May|Le May]], 98\u201399. Walter Bagehot, an authority on 19th-century British government, said this unity is \"the efficient secret\" of its constitution. Bagehot's description of the \"efficient part\" of the British constitution is quoted by Le May and many other standard texts: \"The efficient secret of the English Constitution may be described as the close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the executive and legislative powers. No doubt, by the traditional theory, as it exists in all the books, the goodness of our constitution consists in the entire separation of the legislative and executive authorities, but in truth its merit consists in their singular approximation. The connecting link is the Cabinet ... A Cabinet is a combing committee\u2014a hyphen which joins a buckle which fastens the legislative part of the State to the executive part of the State. In its origin it belongs to the one, in its functions it belongs to the other.\"</ref> In the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and [[minister (government)|ministers]], and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public \"face\" and \"voice\" of Her Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the prime minister, the Sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and [[Church of England]] ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.<ref>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp. 245\u2013246</ref>\n\n==Constitutional background==\n{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}\n{{Main|Constitution of the United Kingdom}}\nThe British system of government is based on an [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|uncodified constitution]], meaning that it is not set out in any single document.<ref>[[#King|King]], pp. 3\u20138. King makes the point that much of the British constitution is in fact written and that no constitution is written down in its entirety. The distinctive feature of the British constitution, he says, is that it is not codified.</ref> The British constitution consists of many documents and most importantly for the evolution of the office of the prime minister, it is based on customs known as [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]] that became accepted practice. In 1928, Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] described this characteristic of the British constitution in his memoirs:<blockquote>In this country we live ... under an unwritten Constitution. It is true that we have on the Statute-book great instruments like Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the Bill of Rights which define and secure many of our rights and privileges; but the great bulk of our constitutional liberties and ... our constitutional practices do not derive their validity and sanction from any Bill which has received the formal assent of the King, Lords and Commons. They rest on usage, custom, convention, often of slow growth in their early stages, not always uniform, but which in the course of time received universal observance and respect.<ref>Quoted in [[#Hanchant|Hanchant]], p. 209</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe relationships between the prime minister and the sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet are defined largely by these unwritten conventions of the constitution. Many of the prime minister's executive and legislative powers are actually [[royal prerogative]]s which are still formally vested in the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|sovereign]], who remains the [[head of state]].<ref>[[#Low|Low]], p.155. In 1902, for example, Arthur Balfour said, \"The Prime Minister has no salary as Prime Minister. He has no statutory duties as Prime Minister, his name occurs in no Acts of Parliament, and though holding the most important place in the constitutional hierarchy, he has no place which is recognized by the laws of his country. This is a strange paradox\"</ref> Despite its growing dominance in the constitutional hierarchy, the premiership was given little formal recognition until the 20th century; the [[legal fiction]] was maintained that the Sovereign still governed directly. The position was first mentioned in statute only in 1917, in the schedule of the [[Chequers Estate Act 1917|Chequers Estate Act]]. Increasingly during the 20th century, the office and role of Prime Minister featured in [[statute law]] and official documents; however, the prime minister's powers and relationships with other institutions still largely continue to derive from ancient royal prerogatives and historic and modern constitutional conventions. Prime ministers continue to hold the position of [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and, since November 1968, that of [[Minister for the Civil Service]], the latter giving them authority over the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|civil service]].\n\nUnder this arrangement, Britain might appear to have two executives: the prime minister and the sovereign. The concept of \"[[the Crown]]\" resolves this paradox.<ref>[[#Low|Low]], p. 255 \"There is no distinction,\" said Gladstone, \"more vital to the practice of the British constitution or to the right judgement upon it than the distinction between the Sovereign and the Crown.\"</ref> The Crown symbolises the state's authority to govern: to make laws and execute them, impose taxes and collect them, declare war and make peace. Before the \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\" of 1688, the sovereign exclusively wielded the powers of the Crown; afterwards, Parliament gradually forced monarchs to assume a neutral political position. Parliament has effectively dispersed the powers of the Crown, entrusting its authority to responsible ministers (the prime minister and Cabinet), accountable for their policies and actions to Parliament, in particular the elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\nAlthough many of the sovereign's prerogative powers are still legally intact,<ref group=note>The Sovereign's prerogative powers are sometimes called [[reserve power]]s. They include the sole authority to dismiss a prime minister and government of the day in extremely rare and exceptional circumstances, and other essential powers (such as withholding [[Royal Assent]], and summoning and proroguing Parliament) to preserve the stability of the nation. These reserve powers can be exercised without the consent of Parliament. Reserve powers, in practice, are the court of absolute last resort in resolving situations that fundamentally threaten the security and stability of the nation as a whole and are almost never used.</ref> constitutional conventions have removed the monarch from day-to-day governance, with ministers exercising the royal prerogatives, leaving the monarch in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise and to warn.<ref>[[#Bagehot|Bagehot]], p. 67</ref><ref>[[#Low|Low]], pp 255\u2013258</ref>\n\n==Foundations==\n===Revolutionary Settlement===\n{{See also|Glorious Revolution}}\nBecause the premiership was not intentionally created, there is no exact date when its evolution began. A meaningful starting point, however, is 1688\u201389 when [[James II]] fled [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[Parliament of England]] confirmed [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II]] as joint constitutional monarchs, enacting legislation that limited their authority and that of their successors: the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights (1689)]], the [[Mutiny Acts|Mutiny Bill]] (1689), the [[Triennial Acts|Triennial Bill]] (1694), the [[Treason Act 1695|Treason Act (1696)]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement (1701)]].<ref>[[#Knappen|Knappen]], pp. 448\u2013451</ref> Known collectively as the Revolutionary Settlement, these acts transformed the constitution, shifting the balance of power from the Sovereign to Parliament. They also provided the basis for the evolution of the office of Prime Minister, which did not exist at that time.\n\n===Treasury Bench===\n[[File:British House of Commons 1834.jpg|thumb|Late in the 17th century Treasury Ministers began to attend the Commons regularly. They were given a reserved place, called the Treasury Bench, to the Speaker's right where the prime minister and senior Cabinet members sit today.]]\nThe Revolutionary Settlement gave the Commons control over finances and legislation and changed the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature. For want of money, sovereigns had to summon Parliament annually and could no longer dissolve or prorogue it without its advice and consent. Parliament became a permanent feature of political life.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 371\u2013373</ref> The veto fell into disuse because sovereigns feared that if they denied legislation, Parliament would deny them money. No sovereign has denied [[royal assent]] since Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] vetoed the [[Scottish Militia Bill]] in 1708.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 382</ref>\n\nTreasury officials and other department heads were drawn into Parliament serving as liaisons between it and the sovereign. Ministers had to present the government's policies, and negotiate with Members to gain the support of the majority; they had to explain the government's financial needs, suggest ways of meeting them and give an account of how money had been spent. The Sovereign's representatives attended Commons sessions so regularly that they were given reserved seats at the front, known as the Treasury Bench. This is the beginning of \"unity of powers\": the sovereign's ministers (the Executive) became leading members of Parliament (the Legislature). Today, the prime minister ([[First Lord of the Treasury]]), the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (responsible for [[United Kingdom budget|The Budget]]) and other senior members of the Cabinet sit on the Treasury bench and present policies in much the same way Ministers did late in the 17th century.\n\n===Standing Order 66===\nAfter the Revolution, there was a constant threat that non-government members of Parliament would ruin the country's finances by proposing ill-considered money bills. Vying for control to avoid chaos, the Crown's Ministers gained an advantage in 1706, when the Commons informally declared, \"That this House will receive no petition for any sum of money relating to public Service, but what is recommended from the Crown.\" On 11 June 1713, this non-binding rule became Standing Order 66: that \"the Commons would not vote money for any purpose, except on a motion of a Minister of the Crown.\" Standing Order 66 remains in effect today (though renumbered as no. 48),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmstords/2/2.pdf |date=16 December 2009 |page=65 |title=Standing Orders of the House of Commons |location=London, United Kingdom |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> essentially unchanged for more than three hundred years.<ref>[[#Roseveare|Roseveare]], p. 80</ref>\n\nEmpowering ministers with sole financial initiative had an immediate and lasting impact. Apart from achieving its intended purpose \u2013 to stabilise the budgetary process \u2013 it gave the Crown a leadership role in the Commons; and, the [[Lord Treasurer]] assumed a leading position among ministers.\n\nThe power of financial initiative was not, however, absolute. Only Ministers might initiate money bills, but Parliament now reviewed and consented to them. Standing Order 66 therefore represents the beginnings of Ministerial responsibility and accountability.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 372\u2013373</ref>\n\nThe term \"Prime Minister\" appears at this time as an unofficial title for the leader of the government, usually the Head of the Treasury.<ref>[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p. 50 There are a few instances of the use of \"Prime\" or \"First\" Minister in the 17th century. After the Restoration in 1660, for example, Lord Clarendon was encouraged to assume the title of \"First Minister\" in the new government rather than accept a specific office. According to the Duke of Ormonde, however, \"He (Clarendon) could not consent to enjoy a pension out of the Exchequer under no other title or pretense but being First Minister... [an office] so newly translated out of French into English that it was not enough understood to be liked and everyone would detest it for the burden it was attended with.\"</ref> Jonathan Swift, for example, wrote that in 1713 there had been \"those who are now commonly called Prime Minister among us\", referring to [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], Queen Anne's Lord Treasurers and chief ministers.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 87</ref> Since 1721, every head of the Sovereign's government \u2013 with one exception in the 18th century ([[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]]) and one in the 19th ([[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]) \u2013 has been First Lord of the Treasury.\n\n===Beginnings of the prime minister's party leadership===\nPolitical parties first appeared during the [[Exclusion Crisis]] of 1678\u20131681. The [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], who believed in [[limited monarchy]], wanted to exclude [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], from succeeding to the throne because he was a Roman Catholic. The [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]], who believed in the \"[[Divine Right of Kings]]\", defended James's hereditary claim.\n\nPolitical parties were not well organised or disciplined in the 17th century. They were more like factions, with \"members\" drifting in and out, collaborating temporarily on issues when it was to their advantage, then disbanding when it was not. A major deterrent to the development of opposing parties was the idea that there could only be one \"King's Party\" and to oppose it would be disloyal or even treasonous. This idea lingered throughout the 18th century. Nevertheless it became possible at the end of the 17th century to identify Parliaments and Ministries as being either \"Whig\" or \"Tory\" in composition.\n\n===Cabinet===\nThe modern prime minister is also the leader of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. A convention of the constitution, the modern Cabinet is a group of ministers who formulate policies.<ref name=Barnett249/> As the political heads of government departments Cabinet Ministers ensure that policies are carried out by permanent civil servants. Although the modern prime minister selects ministers, appointment still rests with the sovereign.<ref>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p. 247</ref> With the prime minister as its leader, the Cabinet forms the [[executive branch]] of government.{{#tag:ref|Once in office, the prime minister fills not only Cabinet level positions but many other government offices (up to 90 appointments), selected mostly from the House of Commons, distributing them to party members, partly as a reward for their loyalty.<ref>[[#Jennings|Jennings]], p. 59</ref> The power to make so many appointments to government offices is one of the most effective means the prime minister has of maintaining party discipline in the Commons.|group=note}}\n\nThe term \"Cabinet\" first appears after the Revolutionary Settlement to describe those ministers who conferred privately with the sovereign. The growth of the Cabinet met with widespread complaint and opposition because its meetings were often held in secret and it excluded the ancient [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] (of which the Cabinet is formally a committee) from the sovereign's circle of advisers, reducing it to an honorary body.<ref>[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p. 79. In 1691, for example, a Lord protested, that {{\"'}}Cabinet-Council' is not a word to be found in our Law-books. We know it not before: we took it for a nick-name. Nothing can fall out more unhappily, than to have a distinction made of the 'Cabinet' and 'Privy-Council' ... If some of the Privy-Council men be trusted, and some not, to whom is a gentleman to apply? Must he ask, \"Who is a Cabinet-Counsellor? ... I am sure, these distinctions of some being more trusted than others have given great dissatisfaction.\"</ref> The early Cabinet, like that of today, included the Treasurer and other department heads who sat on the Treasury bench. However, it might also include individuals who were not members of Parliament such as household officers (e.g. the Master of the Horse) and members of the royal family. The exclusion of non-members of Parliament from the Cabinet was essential to the development of ministerial accountability and responsibility.\n\nBoth William and Anne appointed and dismissed Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and followed up on actions. Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was an essential part of evolution of the Premiership. This process began after the Hanoverian Succession. Although [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714\u20131727) attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was bored with the discussions. [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] (1727\u20131760) occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his successor, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] (1760\u20131820), is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign. Thus, the convention that sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance. The prime minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign. These simple executive tasks naturally gave the prime minister ascendancy over his Cabinet colleagues.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 383</ref>\n\nAlthough the first three Hanoverians rarely attended Cabinet meetings they insisted on their prerogatives to appoint and dismiss ministers and to direct policy even if from outside the Cabinet. It was not until late in the 18th century that prime ministers gained control over Cabinet composition (see section [[#Emergence of Cabinet government|Emergence of Cabinet Government]] below).\n\n===\"One Party Government\"===\nBritish governments (or ministries) are generally formed by one party. The prime minister and Cabinet are usually all members of the same political party, almost always the one that has a majority of seats in the House of Commons. Coalition governments (a ministry that consists of representatives from two or more parties) and minority governments (a one-party ministry formed by a party that does not command a majority in the Commons) were relatively rare before the 2010 election, since 2010 there has been both a coalition and minority government. \"One party government\", as this system is sometimes called, has been the general rule for almost three hundred years.\n\nEarly in his reign, William III (1689\u20131702) preferred \"mixed ministries\" (or coalitions) consisting of both Tories and Whigs. William thought this composition would dilute the power of any one party and also give him the benefit of differing points of view. However, this approach did not work well because the members could not agree on a leader or on policies, and often worked at odds with each other.\n\nIn 1697, William formed a homogeneous Whig ministry. Known as the ''Junto'', this government is often cited as the first true Cabinet because its members were all Whigs, reflecting the majority composition of the Commons.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nAnne (1702\u20131714) followed this pattern but preferred Tory Cabinets. This approach worked well as long as Parliament was also predominantly Tory. However, in 1708, when the Whigs obtained a majority, Anne did not call on them to form a government, refusing to accept the idea that politicians could force themselves on her merely because their party had a majority.<ref>[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p.66 \"Is it not hard\", Anne said, \"that men of sense and honour will not promote the good of their country, because everything in the world is not done as they desire?\"</ref> She never parted with an entire Ministry or accepted an entirely new one regardless of the results of an election. Anne preferred to retain a minority government rather than be dictated to by Parliament. Consequently, her chief ministers [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], who were called \"Prime Minister\" by some, had difficulty executing policy in the face of a hostile Parliament.<ref name=\"Smith, pages 379\u2013382\"/><ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 76\u201383</ref>\n\nWilliam's and Anne's experiments with the political composition of the Cabinet illustrated the strengths of one party government and the weaknesses of coalition and minority governments. Nevertheless, it was not until the 1830s that the constitutional convention was established that the Sovereign must select the prime minister (and Cabinet) from the party whose views reflect those of the majority in Parliament. Since then, most ministries have reflected this one party rule.\n\nDespite the \"one party\" convention, prime ministers may still be called upon to lead either minority or coalition governments. A [[minority government]] may be formed as a result of a \"[[hung parliament]]\" in which no single party commands a majority in the House of Commons after a general election or the death, resignation or defection of existing members. By convention, the serving prime minister is given the first opportunity to reach agreements that will allow them to survive a vote of confidence in the House and continue to govern. Until 2017, the last minority government was led by Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] for eight months after the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] produced a hung parliament. In the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 general election]], the Labour Party gained 18 seats, giving Wilson a majority of three.\n\nA hung parliament may also lead to the formation of a [[coalition government]] in which two or more parties negotiate a joint programme to command a majority in the Commons. Coalitions have also been formed during times of national crisis such as war. Under such circumstances, the parties agree to temporarily set aside their political differences and to unite to face the national crisis. Coalitions are rare: since 1721, there have been fewer than a dozen.\n\nWhen the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|general election of 2010]] produced a hung parliament, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties agreed to form the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition]], the first coalition in seventy years. The previous coalition in the UK before 2010 was led by Conservative Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] during most of the Second World War, from May 1940 to May 1945. [[Clement Attlee]], the leader of the Labour Party, served as Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 376\u2013379</ref> After the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election of 2015]], the nation returned to one party government after the Tories won an outright majority.\n\n===Treasury Commission===\nThe premiership is still largely a convention of the constitution; its legal authority is derived primarily from the fact that the prime minister is also First Lord of the Treasury. The connection of these two offices \u2013 one a convention, the other a legal office \u2013 began with the [[Hanoverian succession]] in 1714.\n\nWhen George I succeeded to the British throne in 1714, his German ministers advised him to leave the office of [[Lord High Treasurer]] vacant because those who had held it in recent years had grown overly powerful, in effect, replacing the sovereign as head of the government. They also feared that a Lord High Treasurer would undermine their own influence with the new king. They therefore suggested that he place the office in \"commission\", meaning that a committee of five ministers would perform its functions together. Theoretically, this dilution of authority would prevent any one of them from presuming to be the head of the government. The king agreed and created the Treasury Commission consisting of the First Lord of the Treasury, the Second Lord, and three Junior Lords.\n\nNo one has been appointed Lord High Treasurer since 1714; it has remained in commission for three hundred years. The Treasury Commission ceased to meet late in the 18th century but has survived, albeit with very different functions: the First Lord of the Treasury is now the prime minister, the Second Lord is the Chancellor of the Exchequer (and actually in charge of the Treasury), and the Junior Lords are government [[Whip (politics)|Whips]] maintaining party discipline in the House of Commons; they no longer have any duties related to the Treasury, though when [[Delegated legislation in the United Kingdom|subordinate legislation]] requires the consent of the Treasury it is still two of the Junior Lords who sign on its behalf.<ref group=note>See e.g. the various orders prescribing fees to be taken in public offices</ref><ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 107</ref>\n\n==Early prime ministers==\n===\"First\" prime minister===\nSince the office evolved rather than being instantly created, it may not be totally clear-cut who the first prime minister was. However, this appellation is traditionally given to Sir [[Robert Walpole]], who became [[First Lord of the Treasury]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1721.\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste van Loo - Robert Walpole.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Sir [[Robert Walpole]], studio of [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]], 1740. Walpole is generally considered to have been Britain's first prime minister.]]\nIn 1720, the [[South Sea Company]], created to trade in cotton, agricultural goods and slaves, collapsed, causing the financial ruin of thousands of investors and heavy losses for many others, including members of the royal family. King George I called on Robert Walpole, well known for his political and financial acumen, to handle the emergency. With considerable skill and some luck, Walpole acted quickly to restore public credit and confidence, and led the country out of the crisis. A year later, the king appointed him First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the House of Commons \u2013 making him the most powerful minister in the government. Ruthless, crude, and hard-working, he had a \"sagacious business sense\" and was a superb manager of men.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 384</ref> At the head of affairs for the next two decades, Walpole stabilised the nation's finances, kept it at peace, made it prosperous, and secured the [[Hanoverian succession]].<ref>[[#Pike|Pike]], pp. 22\u201323</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of British Prime Ministers |page=10 |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Eccleshall |editor2-first=Graham |editor2-last=Walker |first=Stephen |last=Taylor |chapter=Robert Walpole}}</ref>\n\nWalpole demonstrated for the first time how a chief minister \u2013 a prime minister \u2013 could be the actual head of the government under the new constitutional framework. First, recognising that the sovereign could no longer govern directly but was still the nominal head of the government, he insisted that he was nothing more than the \"King's Servant\".<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 385. He worked tirelessly to maintain the king's confidence, and sometimes resorted to bribery. On the accession of George II in 1727, for example, Walpole gave the new king an additional \u00a3100,000 for his personal use to maintain his offices.</ref> Second, recognising that power had shifted to the Commons, he conducted the nation's business there and made it dominant over the Lords in all matters. Third, recognising that the Cabinet had become the executive and must be united, he dominated the other members and demanded their complete support for his policies. Fourth, recognising that political parties were the source of ministerial strength, he led the Whig party and maintained discipline. In the Commons, he insisted on the support of all Whig members, especially those who held office. Finally, he set an example for future prime ministers by resigning his offices in 1742 after a [[vote of confidence]], which he won by just three votes. The slimness of this majority undermined his power, even though he still retained the confidence of the sovereign.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 77\u201381. The preceding paragraph is a paraphrase of Hearn's famous list of Walpole's contributions to the evolution of the office of prime minister in his book ''Government of England'', p. 220, quoted by Marriott.</ref><ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 385\u2013387</ref>\n\n===Ambivalence and denial===\nFor all his contributions, Walpole was not a prime minister in the modern sense. The king \u2013 not Parliament \u2013 chose him; and the king \u2013 not Walpole \u2013 chose the Cabinet. Walpole set an example, not a precedent, and few followed his example. For over 40 years after Walpole's fall in 1742, there was widespread ambivalence about the position. In some cases, the prime minister was a figurehead with power being wielded by other individuals; in others there was a reversion to the \"chief minister\" model of earlier times in which the sovereign actually governed.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 86. During most periods of British history, there have been chief ministers who have had many of the attributes of a modern prime minister such as [[Dunstan of Glastonbury]] under [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]], [[Ranulf Flambard]] under [[William II of England|William II]], [[Cardinal Wolsey]] and [[Thomas Cromwell]] under [[Henry VIII]], and many others.</ref> At other times, there appeared to be two prime ministers. During [[Great Britain's participation in the Seven Years' War]], for example, the powers of government were divided equally between the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] and [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], leading to them both alternatively being described as Prime Minister. Furthermore, many thought that the title \"Prime Minister\" usurped the sovereign's constitutional position as \"head of the government\" and that it was an affront to other ministers because they were all appointed by and equally responsible to the sovereign.\n\nFor these reasons, there was a reluctance to use the title. Although Walpole is now called the \"first\" prime minister, the title was not commonly used during his tenure. Walpole himself denied it. In 1741, during the attack that led to Walpole's downfall, [[Samuel Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys|Samuel Sandys]] declared that \"According to our Constitution we can have no sole and prime minister\". In his defence, Walpole said \"I unequivocally deny that I am sole or Prime Minister and that to my influence and direction all the affairs of government must be attributed\".<ref name=\"Marriott, p. 88\">[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 88</ref> [[George Grenville]], Prime Minister in the 1760s, said it was \"an odious title\" and never used it.<ref>[[#Low|Low]], p. 156</ref> [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]], the reluctant head of the King's Government during the [[American War of Independence]], \"would never suffer himself to be called Prime Minister, because it was an office unknown to the Constitution\".<ref>[[#Low|Low]], pp. 156\u2013157</ref><ref group=note>The 18th-century ambivalence causes problems for researchers trying to identify who was a prime minister and who was not. Every list of prime ministers may omit certain politicians. For instance, unsuccessful attempts to form ministries \u2013 such as the two-day government formed by the [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Earl of Bath]] in 1746, often dismissed as the \"[[Short-lived Ministry|Silly Little Ministry]]\" \u2013 may be included in a list or omitted, depending on the criteria selected.</ref>\n\nDenials of the premiership's legal existence continued throughout the 19th century. In 1806, for example, one member of the Commons said, \"the Constitution abhors the idea of a prime minister\". In 1829, [[Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] said, \"nothing could be more mischievous or unconstitutional than to recognise by act of parliament the existence of such an office\".<ref>[[#Walpole|Walpole]], pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century the premiership had become, by convention, the most important position in the constitutional hierarchy. Yet there were no legal documents describing its powers or acknowledging its existence. The first official recognition given to the office had only been in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878, when [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] signed as \"First Lord of the Treasury and Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\".<ref name=\"Barnett, p. 245\">[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p. 245</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=207702&sectioncode=5 |title=A dictatoror (sic) first among equals? |work=Times Higher Education |first=Vernon |last=Bogdanor |authorlink=Vernon Bogdanor |date=2 February 2007 |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref><ref>Chris Bryant, ''Parliament: The Biography (Volume II - Reform)'', Random House, 2014. p.45</ref> Not until seven years later, in 1885, did the official records entrench the institution of Prime Minister, using \"Prime Minister\" in the list of government ministers printed in [[Hansard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.blog.gov.uk/2012/01/01/the-institution-of-prime-minister/|title=The institution of Prime Minister is entrenched|website=GOV.UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1885/jul/03/the-cabinet|title=THE CABINET.|website=Hansard|date=3 July 1885}}</ref> Incumbents had no statutory authority in their own right. As late as 1904, Arthur Balfour explained the status of his office in a speech at Haddington: \"The Prime Minister has no salary as Prime Minister. He has no statutory duties as Prime Minister, his name occurs in no Acts of Parliament, and though holding the most important place in the constitutional hierarchy, he has no place which is recognised by the laws of his country.

Britain then included [[England and Wales]] and [[Scotland]], but Ireland had its own parliament and government, which were firmly [[Anglo-Irish]] and did not represent the aspirations of most Irishmen. For this and other reasons, Pitt advanced his policy, and after some difficulty in persuading the Irish political class to surrender its control of Ireland under the [[Constitution of 1782]], the new union was created by the [[Acts of Union 1800]]. With effect from 1 January 1801, Great Britain and Ireland were united into a single kingdom, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the [[Parliament of Ireland]] came to an end, and until 1922 British ministers were responsible for all three kingdoms of the British Isles.<ref>J.

[[Bonar Law]], who had been in office as Prime Minister of Great Britain and Ireland for only six weeks, and who had just won the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|general election of November 1922]], thus became the last prime minister whose responsibilities covered both Britain and the whole of Ireland.

During the first 20 years of his reign, George III (1760\u20131820) tried to be his own \"prime minister\" by controlling policy from outside the Cabinet, appointing and dismissing ministers, meeting privately with individual ministers, and giving them instructions. These practices caused confusion and dissension in Cabinet meetings; King George's experiment in personal rule was generally a failure. After the failure of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]]'s ministry (1770\u20131782) in March 1782 due to Britain's defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the ensuing [[vote of no confidence]] by Parliament, the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]] reasserted the prime minister's control over the Cabinet. Rockingham assumed the Premiership \"on the distinct understanding that measures were to be changed as well as men; and that the measures for which the new ministry required the royal consent were the measures which they, while in opposition, had advocated.\" He and his Cabinet were united in their policies and would stand or fall together; they also refused to accept anyone in the Cabinet who did not agree.<ref group=note>This event also marks the beginnings of collective Cabinet responsibility. This principle states that the decisions made by any one Cabinet member become the responsibility of the entire Cabinet.</ref> King George threatened to [[abdication|abdicate]] but in the end reluctantly agreed out of necessity: he had to have a government.\n\nFrom this time, there was a growing acceptance of the position of Prime Minister and the title was more commonly used, if only unofficially.<ref name=\"Smith, pages 379\u2013382\">[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 379\u2013382</ref><ref>[[#Low|Low]], pp. 141\u2013142</ref> Associated initially with the Whigs, the Tories started to accept it. Lord North, for example, who had said the office was \"unknown to the constitution\", reversed himself in 1783 when he said, \"In this country some one man or some body of men like a Cabinet should govern the whole and direct every measure.\"<ref>[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p. 127</ref><ref>Pares, p. 175 in a letter to the King written at the same time, North repeated the idea, \"That in critical times, it is necessary that there should be one directing Minister, who should plan the whole of the operations of government, so far as to make them co-operate zealously & actively with his designs even tho' contrary to their own.\"</ref> In 1803, [[William Pitt the Younger]], also a Tory, suggested to a friend that \"this person generally called the first minister\" was an absolute necessity for a government to function, and expressed his belief that this person should be the minister in charge of the finances.<ref name=\"Marriott, p. 88\"/>\n[[File:William Pitt the Younger at Westminster.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|left|''William Pitt the Younger addressing the House of Commons.'' Pitt's 19 years as Prime Minister followed by Lord Liverpool's 15, led the Tory Party to accept the office as a convention of the constitution.]]\nThe Tories' wholesale conversion started when Pitt was confirmed as Prime Minister in the election of 1784. For the next 17 years until 1801 (and again from 1804 to 1806), Pitt, the Tory, was Prime Minister in the same sense that Walpole, the Whig, had been earlier.\n\nTheir conversion was reinforced after 1810. In that year, George III, who had suffered periodically from mental instability (possibly due to [[porphyria]]), became permanently insane and spent the remaining 10 years of his life unable to discharge his duties. The [[Prince Regent]] was prevented from using the full powers of kingship. The regent became [[George IV]] in 1820, but during his 10-year reign was indolent and frivolous. Consequently, for 20 years the throne was virtually vacant and Tory Cabinets led by Tory prime ministers filled the void, governing virtually on their own.\n\nThe Tories were in power for almost 50 years, except for a Whig ministry from 1806 to 1807. [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] was Prime Minister for 15 years; he and Pitt held the position for 34 years. Under their long, consistent leadership, Cabinet government became a convention of the constitution. Although subtle issues remained to be settled, the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet system of government]] is essentially the same today as it was in 1830.\n{{Gladstone's Cabinet of 1868|align=right|size=330px}}\nUnder this form of government, called the [[Westminster system]], the Sovereign is [[head of state]] and titular head of [[Her Majesty's Government]]. The Sovereign selects as Prime Minister the person who is able to command a working majority in the House of Commons, and invites him or her to form a government. As the actual [[Head of Government]], the prime minister selects the Cabinet, choosing its members from among those in Parliament who agree or generally agree with his or her intended policies. The prime minister then recommends the Cabinet to the Sovereign who confirms the selection by formally appointing them to their offices. Led by the prime minister, the Cabinet is collectively responsible for whatever the government does. The Sovereign does not confer with members privately about policy, nor attend Cabinet meetings. With respect to ''actual'' governance, the monarch has only three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise, and to warn.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp 92\u201393 Bagehot enumerated the three rights of a constitutional Monarch as \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn\"</ref> In practice this means that the Sovereign reviews state papers and meets regularly with the prime minister, usually weekly, when she may advise and warn him or her regarding the proposed decisions and actions of Her Government.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp 78\u201383. Marriott enumerates five characteristics of modern Cabinet Government: 1. exclusion of the sovereign, 2. close correspondence of party affiliation between the Cabinet and the majority in Parliament, 3. homogeneity of the Cabinet, 4. collective responsibility, and 5. ascendency of the prime minister.</ref>\n\n===Loyal Opposition===\n{{Main|Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)}}\nThe modern British system includes not only a government formed by the majority party (or coalition of parties) in the House of Commons but also an organised and open opposition formed by those who are not members of the governing party.<ref name=\"Barnett, p. 245\"/> Called [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition]], they occupy the benches to the Speaker's left. Seated in the front, directly across from the ministers on the Treasury Bench, the leaders of the opposition form a \"shadow government\", complete with a salaried \"shadow prime minister\", the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], ready to assume office if the government falls or loses the next election.\n\n[[File:House of Commons Microcosm.jpg|thumb|left|''The House of Commons early 19th century.'' The Loyal Opposition occupy the benches to the Speaker's left. Seated in the front, the leaders of the opposition form a \"shadow government\", complete with a salaried \"shadow prime minister\" ready to assume office if the government falls or loses the next election.]]\n\nOpposing the King's government was considered disloyal, even treasonous, at the end of the 17th century. During the 18th century this idea waned and finally disappeared as the two party system developed. The expression \"His Majesty's Opposition\" was coined by [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton]]. In 1826, Broughton, a Whig, announced in the Commons that he opposed the report of a Bill. As a joke, he said, \"It was said to be very hard on His Majesty's ministers to raise objections to this proposition. For my part, I think it is much more hard on His Majesty's Opposition to compel them to take this course.\"<ref>[[#Foord|Foord]], p.1 Laughter followed Hobhouse's remark but George Tierney, a leading Whig, repeated the phrase and added a definition. \"My honourable friend,\" he said, \"could not have invented a better phrase to designate us than that which he has adopted, for we are certainly to all intents and purposes a branch of His Majesty's Government.\"</ref> The phrase caught on and has been used ever since. Sometimes rendered as the \"[[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Loyal Opposition]]\", it acknowledges the legitimate existence of the two party system, and describes an important constitutional concept: opposing the government is not treason; reasonable men can honestly oppose its policies and still be loyal to the Sovereign and the nation.\n\nInformally recognized for over a century as a convention of the constitution, the position of Leader of the Opposition was given statutory recognition in 1937 by the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937|Ministers of the Crown Act]].\n\n===Great Reform Act and the premiership===\n{{Main|Reform Act 1832}}\nBritish prime ministers have never been elected directly by the public. A prime minister need not be a party leader; [[David Lloyd George]] was not a party leader during his service as prime Minister during World War I, and neither was Ramsay MacDonald from 1931 to 1935.<ref name=\"blake1993\">{{cite book |title=Churchill |publisher=Clarendon Press |author=Blake, Robert |year=1993 |location=Oxford |pages=262\u2013263 |chapter=How Churchill Became Prime Minister |editor1=Blake, Robert B. |editor2=Louis, William Roger |isbn=978-0-19-820626-2}}</ref> Prime ministers have taken office because they were members of either the Commons or Lords, and either inherited a majority in the Commons or won more seats than the opposition in a general election.\n\n[[File:Charles Grey - 2nd Earl Grey - atop the Grey Momument - Newcastle upon Tyne - England - 140804.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], often called the first modern prime minister]]\n[[File:Inscription Grey Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Inscription on [[Grey's Monument]], Newcastle upon Tyne, England]]\n\nSince 1722, most prime ministers have been members of the Commons; since 1902, all have had a seat there.<ref group=note>Except [[Alec Douglas-Home|Lord Home]], who resigned his peerage to stand in a by-election soon after becoming prime minister</ref> Like other members, they are elected initially to represent only a constituency. Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], for example, represented [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] in County Durham from 1983 to 2007. He became Prime Minister because in 1994 he was elected Labour Party leader and then led the party to victory in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], winning 418 seats compared to 165 for the Conservatives and gaining a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nNeither the sovereign nor the [[House of Lords]] had any meaningful influence over who was elected to the Commons in 1997 or in deciding whether or not Blair would become Prime Minister. Their detachment from the electoral process and the selection of the prime minister has been a convention of the constitution for almost 200 years.\n\nPrior to the 19th century, however, they had significant influence, using to their advantage the fact that most citizens were disenfranchised and seats in the Commons were allocated disproportionately. Through patronage, corruption and bribery, the Crown and Lords \"owned\" about 30% of the seats (called \"pocket\" or \"rotten boroughs\") giving them a significant influence in the Commons and in the selection of the prime minister.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 37\u201338</ref><ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 219\u2013222</ref>\n\nIn 1830, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]], the 2nd [[Earl Grey]] and a life-long Whig, became Prime Minister and was determined to reform the electoral system. For two years, he and his Cabinet fought to pass what has come to be known as the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Bill of 1832]].<ref>[[#Pike|Pike]], pp. 188\u2013194</ref><ref>Minney, p. 216. Contemporaries seemed to sense from the beginning that history was being made. Lord Creevey, for example, recorded in his diary, \"I dined in Downing Street with Lady Grey... After dinner the private secretary to the Prime Minister and myself being alone, I ascertained that although Lord Grey was gone to Brighton ostensibly to prick for Sheriffs for the year, his great object was to put his plan of reform before the King, previous... to its being proposed to the House of Commons. A ticklish operation, this! to propose to a Sovereign a plan for reducing his own power and patronage. However, there is the plan all cut and dry, and the Cabinet unanimous upon it... Grey is determined to fight it out to a dissolution of Parliament, if his plan is beat in the Commons. My eye, what a crisis!\"</ref> The greatness of the Great Reform Bill lay less in substance than in symbolism. As John Bright, a liberal statesman of the next generation, said, \"It was not a good Bill, but it was a great Bill when it passed.\"<ref>Trevelyan, p.272</ref> Substantively, it increased the franchise by 65% to 717,000; with the [[middle class]] receiving most of the new votes. The representation of 56 rotten boroughs was eliminated completely, together with half the representation of 30 others; the freed up seats were distributed to boroughs created for previously disenfranchised areas. However, many rotten boroughs remained and it still excluded millions of working-class men and all women.<ref>[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp. 222\u2013223</ref><ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 437\u2013444</ref>\n\nSymbolically, however, the Reform Act exceeded expectations. It is now ranked with [[Magna Carta]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] as one of the most important documents of the British constitutional tradition.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nFirst, the Act removed the sovereign from the election process and the choice of Prime Minister. Slowly evolving for 100 years, this convention was confirmed two years after the passage of the Act. In 1834, King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] dismissed Melbourne as premier, but was forced to recall him when [[Robert Peel]], the king's choice, could not form a working majority. Since then, no sovereign has tried to impose a prime minister on Parliament.\n\nSecond, the Bill reduced the Lords' power by eliminating many of their pocket boroughs and creating new boroughs in which they had no influence. Weakened, they were unable to prevent the passage of more comprehensive electoral reforms in 1867, 1884, 1918 and 1928 when universal equal suffrage was established.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp. 454, 468, 486, and 489</ref>\n[[File:PunchDizzyReformBill.png|thumb|upright|left|''Disraeli and Gladstone Race to Pass the Reform Bill, Punch, 1867'' The rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone helped to identify the position of Prime Minister with specific personalities. (Disraeli is in the lead looking back over his shoulder at Gladstone.)]]\nUltimately, this erosion of power led to the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which marginalised the Lords' role in the legislative process and gave further weight to the convention that had developed over the previous century<ref group=note>As early as 1839, the former Prime Minister [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] had argued in the House of Lords that \"I have long entertained the view that the Prime Minister of this country, under existing circumstances, ought to have a seat in the other House of Parliament, and that he would have great advantage in carrying on the business of the Sovereign by being there.\" Quoted in [[#Barnett|Barnett]], p. 246</ref> that a prime minister cannot sit in the House of Lords. The last to do so was [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], from 1895 to 1902.<ref group=note>The last prime minister to be a member of the Lords during any part of his tenure was [[Alec Douglas-Home, 14th Earl of Home]] in 1963. Lord Home was the last prime minister who was a hereditary peer, but, within days of attaining office, he disclaimed his peerage, abiding by the convention that the prime minister should sit in the House of Commons. A junior member of his Conservative Party who had already been selected as candidate in a [[1963 Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election|by-election]] in a staunch Conservative seat stood aside, allowing Home to contest and win the by-election, and thus procure a seat in the lower House.</ref> Throughout the 19th century, governments led from the Lords had often suffered difficulties governing alongside ministers who sat in the Commons.<ref>[[#Jennings|Jennings]], p. 21</ref>\n\nGrey set an example and a precedent for his successors. He was ''primus inter pares'' (first among equals), as Bagehot said in 1867 of the prime minister's status. Using his Whig victory as a mandate for reform, Grey was unrelenting in the pursuit of this goal, using every parliamentary device to achieve it. Although respectful toward the king, he made it clear that his constitutional duty was to acquiesce to the will of the people and Parliament.\n\nThe Loyal Opposition acquiesced too. Some disgruntled Tories claimed they would repeal the bill once they regained a majority. But in 1834, Robert Peel, the new Conservative leader, put an end to this threat when he stated in his [[Tamworth Manifesto]] that the bill was \"a final and irrevocable settlement of a great constitutional question which no friend to the peace and welfare of this country would attempt to disturb\".<ref>[[#Pike|Pike]], p. 219</ref>\n\n===Populist prime ministers===\n[[File:Elliott & Fry10a.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] cultivated the public image as a ''man of the people'' by circulating pictures like this of himself cutting down oak trees with an axe. Photo by [[Elliott & Fry]]]]\n\nThe premiership was a reclusive office prior to 1832. The incumbent worked with his Cabinet and other government officials; he occasionally met with the sovereign and attended Parliament when it was in session during the spring and summer. He never went out on the stump to campaign, even during elections; he rarely spoke directly to ordinary voters about policies and issues.\n\nAfter the passage of the [[Great Reform Bill]], the nature of the position changed: prime ministers had to go out among the people. The Bill increased the electorate to 717,000. Subsequent legislation (and population growth) raised it to 2&nbsp;million in 1867, 5.5&nbsp;million in 1884 and 21.4&nbsp;million in 1918. As the franchise increased, power shifted to the people, and prime ministers assumed more responsibilities with respect to party leadership. It naturally fell on them to motivate and organise their followers, explain party policies, and deliver its \"message\". Successful leaders had to have a new set of skills: to give a good speech, present a favourable image, and interact with a crowd. They became the \"voice\", the \"face\" and the \"image\" of the party and ministry.\n\n[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] cultivated a public image as an [[imperialist]] with grand gestures such as conferring on [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] the title \"Empress of India\".]]\n\nRobert Peel, often called the \"model prime minister\",<ref>Rosebery, p. 27. Lord Rosebery, later a prime minister himself, said of Peel: \"the model of all Prime Ministers. It is more than doubtful, indeed, if it be possible in this generation, when the burdens of Empire and of office have so incalculably grown, for any Prime Minister to discharge the duties of his high office with the same thoroughness or in the same spirit as Peel. ... Peel kept a strict supervision over every department: he seems to have been master of the business of each and all of them. ... it is probable that no Prime Minister ever fulfilled so completely and thoroughly the functions of the office, parliamentary, administrative, and general as Sir Robert Peel.\"</ref> was the first to recognise this new role. After the successful Conservative campaign of 1841, J. W. Croker said in a letter to Peel, \"The elections are wonderful, and the curiosity is that all turns on the name of Sir Robert Peel. It's the first time that I remember in our history that the people have chosen the first Minister for the Sovereign. Mr. Pitt's case in '84 is the nearest analogy; but then the people only confirmed the Sovereign's choice; here every Conservative candidate professed himself in plain words to be Sir Robert Peel's man, and on that ground was elected.\"<ref>Hanham, pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\n[[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone]] developed this new role further by projecting \"images\" of themselves to the public. Known by their nicknames \"Dizzy\" and the \"Grand Old Man\", their colourful, sometimes bitter, personal and political rivalry over the issues of their time \u2013 Imperialism vs. Anti-Imperialism, expansion of the franchise, labour reform, and Irish Home Rule \u2013 spanned almost twenty years until Disraeli's death in 1881.<ref group=note>Even after death their rivalry continued. When Disraeli died in 1881, Gladstone proposed a state funeral, but Disraeli's will specified that he have a private funeral and be buried next to his wife. Gladstone replied, \"As [Disraeli] lived, so he died\u2014all display, without reality or genuineness.\" Disraeli, for his part, once said that GOM (the acronym for \"Grand Old Man\") really stood for \"God's Only Mistake\".</ref> Documented by the penny press, photographs and political cartoons, their rivalry linked specific personalities with the Premiership in the public mind and further enhanced its status.\n\n[[File:GladstoneandRosebery.gif|thumb|right|''Gladstone During the Midlothian Campaign 1879'' Speaking directly to the people for the first time, Gladstone's Midlothian campaign symbolises a major change in the role of the prime minister. (Gladstone is seated in the centre; Rosebery, a future prime minister, is sitting on the carpet in front.)]]\n\nEach created a different public image of himself and his party. Disraeli, who expanded the Empire to protect British interests abroad, cultivated the image of himself (and the Conservative Party) as \"Imperialist\", making grand gestures such as conferring the title \"[[Empress of India]]\" on Queen Victoria in 1876. Gladstone, who saw little value in the Empire, proposed an anti-Imperialist policy (later called \"Little England\"), and cultivated the image of himself (and the Liberal Party) as \"man of the people\" by circulating pictures of himself cutting down great oak trees with an axe as a hobby.\n\nGladstone went beyond image by appealing directly to the people. In his [[Midlothian campaign]] \u2013 so called because he stood as a candidate for that county \u2013 Gladstone spoke in fields, halls and railway stations to hundreds, sometimes thousands, of students, farmers, labourers and middle class workers. Although not the first leader to speak directly to voters \u2013 both he and Disraeli had spoken directly to party loyalists before on special occasions \u2013 he was the first to canvass an entire constituency, delivering his message to anyone who would listen, encouraging his supporters and trying to convert his opponents. Publicised nationwide, Gladstone's message became that of the party. Noting its significance, [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] said, \"It is a new thing and a very serious thing to see the Prime Minister on the stump.\"<ref>Bigham, p. 318. Disraeli and Victoria thought the tactic was unconstitutional. \"Such conduct\", the Queen said, \"is unheard of and the only excuse is\u2014that he is not quite sane.\"</ref>\n\nCampaigning directly to the people became commonplace. Several 20th-century prime ministers, such as [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Winston Churchill]], were famous for their oratorical skills. After the introduction of radio, motion pictures, television, and the internet, many used these technologies to project their public image and address the nation. [[Stanley Baldwin]], a master of the radio broadcast in the 1920s and 1930s, reached a national audience in his talks filled with homely advice and simple expressions of national pride.<ref>[[#Pike|Pike]], p. 389</ref> [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] also used the radio to great effect, inspiring, reassuring and informing the people with his speeches during the Second World War. Two recent prime ministers, [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Tony Blair]] (who both spent a decade or more as Prime Minister), achieved celebrity status like rock stars, but have been criticised for their more 'presidential' style of leadership. According to [[Anthony King (professor)|Anthony King]], \"The props in Blair's theatre of celebrity included ... his guitar, his casual clothes ... footballs bounced skilfully off the top of his head ... carefully choreographed speeches and performances at Labour Party conferences.\"<ref>[[#King|King]], pp. 319\u2013320</ref>\n\n==Modern premiership==\n===Parliament Act and the premiership===\n{{Main|Parliament Act 1911|Parliament Act 1949|Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949}}\nIn addition to being the leader of a great political party and the head of Her Majesty's Government, the modern prime minister directs the law-making process, enacting into law his or her party's programme. For example, [[Tony Blair]], whose Labour party was elected in 1997 partly on a promise to enact a British Bill of Rights and to create devolved governments for Scotland and Wales, subsequently stewarded through Parliament the [[Human Rights Act (1998)]], the [[Scotland Act (1998)]] and the [[Government of Wales Act (1998)]].\n\nFrom its appearance in the fourteenth century Parliament has been a bicameral legislature consisting of the Commons and the Lords. Members of the Commons are elected; those in the Lords are not. Most Lords are called \"Temporal\" with titles such as Duke, Marquess, Earl, and Viscount. The balance are Lords Spiritual (prelates of the Anglican Church).\n\nFor most of the history of the Upper House, Lords Temporal were landowners who held their estates, titles, and seats as a hereditary right passed down from one generation to the next \u2013 in some cases for centuries. In 1910, for example, there were nineteen whose title was created before 1500.<ref>[[#Tuchman1|Tuchman]], p 391</ref><ref group=note>Following a series of reforms in the twentieth century the Lords now consists almost entirely of appointed members who hold their title only for their own lifetime.

This was not always easy, because political differences often separated the chambers. Representing the landed aristocracy, Lords Temporal were generally Tory (later Conservative) who wanted to maintain the status quo and resisted progressive measures such as extending the franchise. The party affiliation of members of the Commons was less predictable. During the 18th century its makeup varied because the Lords had considerable control over elections: sometimes Whigs dominated it, sometimes Tories. After the passage of the [[Great Reform Bill]] in 1832, the Commons gradually became more progressive, a tendency that increased with the passage of each subsequent expansion of the franchise.\n\n[[File:Meeting of Asquith cabinet19090001.jpg|thumb|left|''Asquith's Cabinet Reacts to the Lords' Rejection of the \"People's Budget\"\u2014a satirical cartoon, 1909.''

(Asquith makes the announcement while David Lloyd George holds down a jubilant Winston Churchill.)]]\n\nIn 1906, the Liberal party, led by Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]], won an overwhelming victory on a platform that promised social reforms for the working class. With 379 seats compared to the Conservatives' 132, the Liberals could confidently expect to pass their legislative programme through the Commons.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 477,</ref><ref>[[#Tuchman1|Tuchman]], p 365. The Liberal majority was actually much larger in practice because on most issues they could rely on the votes of 51 Labour and Lib-Lab representatives and 83 Irish Nationalists. Their majority was so large and unprecedented \u2013 they had more seats than all other parties combined \u2013 that one Conservative called it a \"hideous abnormality\".</ref> At the same time, however, the Conservative Party had a huge majority in the Lords; it could easily veto any legislation passed by the Commons that was against their interests.<ref>Furthermore, [[Arthur Balfour]], the defeated Conservative prime minister and now Leader of the Opposition, declared that the House of Lords was the \"watchdog of the constitution\"; it had an obligation to promote stability by rejecting \"radical\" legislation proposed by \"zealots\" who may have a temporary numerical advantage in the Commons. [[David Lloyd George]], the new Liberal [[President of the Board of Trade]] and a future prime minister, said the Lords \"... is not the watchdog of the British Constitution. It is Mr Balfour's poodle!\" [[#Smith|Smith]], p. 478</ref>\n\nFor five years, the Commons and the Lords fought over one bill after another. The Liberals pushed through parts of their programme, but the Conservatives vetoed or modified others. When the Lords vetoed the \"[[People's Budget]]\" in 1909, the controversy moved almost inevitably toward a constitutional crisis.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], pp 478\u2013480. Although the Liberals did pass the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906|Trade Disputes Act]], the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906|Workmen's Compensation Act]], the [[Labour Exchanges Act 1909|Labour Exchanges Act]], the [[Trade Boards Act 1909|Trade Boards Act]], and the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1909|Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act]], the Lords vetoed an [[Education Bill]], a land reform bill, a [[Licensing Bill]], and a Plural Voting Bill; they mutilated and mauled an [[Agricultural Holdings Bill]] and an Irish Town Tenants Bill, and they almost rejected the [[Old-Age Pensions Act 1908|Old-Age Pensions Act]].</ref>\n\n[[File:Passing of the Parliament Bill, 1911 - Project Gutenberg eText 19609.jpg|thumb|right|''An important vote: the [[House of Lords]] voting for the [[Parliament Act 1911]].

Asquith]]<ref group=note>Campbell-Bannerman retired and died in 1908.</ref> introduced a bill \"for regulating the relations between the Houses of Parliament\" which would eliminate the Lords' veto power over legislation. Passed by the Commons, the Lords rejected it. In a general election fought on this issue, the Liberals were weakened but still had a comfortable majority. At Asquith's request, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] then threatened to create a sufficient number of new Liberal Peers to ensure the bill's passage. Rather than accept a permanent Liberal majority, the Conservative Lords yielded, and the bill became law.<ref>[[#Knappen|Knappen]], pp 554\u2013555</ref>\n\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]] established the supremacy of the Commons. It provided that the Lords could not delay for more than one month any bill certified by the Speaker of the Commons as a money bill. Furthermore, the Act provided that any bill rejected by the Lords would nevertheless become law if passed by the Commons in three successive sessions provided that two years had elapsed since its original passage. The Lords could still delay or suspend the enactment of legislation but could no longer veto it.<ref>[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 482,</ref><ref>[[#Knappen|Knappen]], p. 555</ref> Subsequently the Lords \"suspending\" power was reduced to one year by the [[Parliament Act 1949]].\n\nIndirectly, the Act enhanced the already dominant position of Prime Minister in the constitutional hierarchy. Although the Lords are still involved in the legislative process and the prime minister must still guide legislation through both Houses, the Lords no longer have the power to veto or even delay enactment of legislation passed by the Commons. Provided that he or she controls the Cabinet, maintains party discipline, and commands a majority in the Commons, the prime minister is assured of putting through his or her legislative agenda.\n\n===Contemporary theories of prime ministerial power===\n{{redirect|British Presidency|the political units in British India|Presidencies and provinces of British India}} Varying and competing theories of the role and power of the contemporary modern prime minister have emerged in the post-war period, particularly in response to new styles of leadership and governance. The classic view of Cabinet Government was laid out by [[Walter Bagehot]] in ''[[The English Constitution]]'' (1867) in which he described the prime minister as the [[primus inter pares]] (\"first among equals\").<ref name=\"Fairclough 2002, p. ~23\">{{cite book|title=Advanced Government and Politics|last=Fairclough|first=Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-19-913434-2|chapter=6.1 The Primemister|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxqkElM8jiYC&pg=PA23}}</ref> This view was challenged in ''The British Cabinet'' by John P.

This asserts that the prime minister has become more detached from Cabinet, party and Parliament and operates as if the occupant of the office is elected directly by the people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Politics UK|last=Jones|first=Bill|last2=Norton |first2=Philip|last3=Daddow|first3=Oliver|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=Abingdon|page=454}}</ref> The thesis is usually presented with comparisons to the [[President of the United States|American Presidency]]. Thomas Poguntke and Paul Webb define it as:\n\n{{quote|\"the development of increasing leadership power resources and autonomy within the party and the political executive respectively, and increasingly leadership-centered electoral processes.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Presidentialization of Politics: A Comparative Study of Modern Democracies|last=Poguntke|first=Thomas|last2=Webb|first2=Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|location=Oxford |page=5}}</ref>}}\n\nThe thesis has been most popularised by [[Michael Foley (academic)|Michael Foley]], who wrote two books, namely, ''The Rise of the British Presidency'', and ''The British Presidency: Tony Blair and the Politics of Public Leadership'' that are solely dedicated to the subject of presidentialisation in Britain.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Rise of the British Presidency|last=Foley |first=Michael|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1993|location=Manchester|page=283}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The British Presidency: Tony Blair and the Politics of Public Leadership|last=Foley|first=Michael|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000 |location=Manchester}}</ref> Foley writes:\n\n{{quote|The British Prime Minister has to all intents and purposes turned, not into a British version of an American president, but into an authentically British president.<ref name=\":2\" />}}\n\nThe thesis has been widely applied to the [[premiership of Tony Blair]] as many sources such as former ministers have suggested that decision-making was controlled by him and [[Gordon Brown]], and the Cabinet was no longer used for decision-making.<ref>{{cite book|title=British Government in Crisis|last=Foster|first=Christopher|publisher=Hart Publishing|year=2005|chapter=Chapter 12 Blair's Cabinet: Monarchy Returns}}</ref> Former ministers such as [[Clare Short]] and [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]] have criticised the lack of decision-making power in Cabinet.

These authors cite the stark differences between the British parliamentary model, with its principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], and the American presidential model, which has its roots in the principle of [[separation of powers]]. For example, according to John Hart, using the American example to explain the accumulation of power in the hands of the British PM is flawed and that changing dynamics of the British executive can only be studied in Britain's own historical and structural sense.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=John|date=1991|title=President and Prime Minister: Convergence or Divergence|url=|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=44|issue=2|pages=208\u2013225|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pa.a052294}}</ref> The power that a prime minister has over his or her Cabinet colleagues is directly proportional to the amount of support that they have with their political parties and this is often related to whether the party considers them to be an electoral asset or liability. Additionally, when a party is divided into factions a prime minister may be forced to include other powerful party members in the Cabinet for party political cohesion. The prime minister's personal power is also curtailed if their party is in a power-sharing arrangement, or a formal coalition with another party (as happened in the coalition government of 2010 to 2015).<ref name=\"Williams 1998, pp. 113\u2013114\">{{cite book|title=UK Government & Politics|last=Williams|first=Andy |publisher=Heinemann |year=1998|isbn=978-0-435-33158-0|pages=113\u2013114|chapter=Prime ministerial government|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6keDJpK0xL8C&pg=PA113}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Comparative Politics and Government|last=Palekar|first=S.A.|date=2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Therefore, unlike presidents, the prime minister can directly initiate legislation and due to the context British politics functions within, faces fewer \"veto players\" than a president.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Dowding|first=Keith|date=April 2017|title=The Prime Ministerialisation of the British Prime Minister|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=66|issue=3|pages=617\u2013635|doi=10.1093/pa/gss007|doi-access=free}}</ref> Thus, Dowding argues that adding to these powers, makes the prime minister less like presidents, and that what Britain is witnessing can be best explained as ''Prime Ministerialisation'' of British politics.<ref name=\":3\" /> The work of Martin J.

The Core Executive model asserts that prime ministerial power (especially of individual leaders, such as Thatcher and Blair) has been greatly overstated, and, instead, is both dependent upon and constrained by relationships, or \"dependency linkages\", with other institutions in government, such as members of the Cabinet or the Treasury. In this model, prime ministers are seen to have improved their institutional position, but rejects the notion that they dominate government and that they act, or have the ability to act, as Presidents due to the aforementioned dependencies and constraints 'that define decision-making in central government.' Smith emphasises \"complex resource relationships\" (or rather how formal and informal powers are used) and what resources a particular actor possesses. In this case, the prime minister naturally holds more resources than others. These include patronage, control of the Cabinet agenda, appointment of Cabinet Committees and the prime minister's office, as well as collective oversight and the ability to intervene in any policy area. However, all actors possess \"resources\" and government decision making relies upon resource exchange in order to achieve policy goals, not through command alone.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Martin J.|date=2010|title=Intelligence and the Core Executive|journal=Public Policy and Administration|volume=25|issue=1|pages=11\u201328|doi=10.1177/0952076709347072}}</ref> Smith originally used this model to explain the resignation of Margaret Thatcher in 1990, concluding that:\n\n{{quote|Government is not cabinet government or prime ministerial government.

The prime minister then formally [[kissing hands|kisses the hands]] of the sovereign, whose [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative powers]] are thereafter exercised solely on the advice of the prime minister and Her Majesty's Government (\"HMG\"). The prime minister has weekly audiences with the sovereign, whose rights are constitutionally limited: \"to warn, to encourage, and to be consulted\";<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4351/4351-h/4351-h.htm |last=Bagehot |first=Walter |title=The English Constitution |year=1867 |publisher=Project Gutenburg Ebook |accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> the extent of the sovereign's ability to influence the nature of the prime ministerial advice is unknown, but presumably varies depending upon the personal relationship between the sovereign and the prime minister of the day.\n\nThe prime minister will appoint all other cabinet members (who then become active Privy Counsellors) and ministers, although consulting senior ministers on their junior ministers, without any Parliamentary or other control or process over these powers. At any time, the PM may obtain the appointment, dismissal or nominal resignation of any other minister; the PM may resign, either purely personally or with the whole government. The prime minister generally co-ordinates the policies and activities of the Cabinet and Government departments, acting as the main public \"face\" of Her Majesty's Government.\n\nAlthough the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[British Armed Forces]] is legally the sovereign, under constitutional practice the prime minister can declare war, and through the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] (a position which the prime minister may appoint, dismiss or even appoint themselves to), as chair of the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]], exert power over the deployment and disposition of the UK's forces.\n\nThe prime minister makes all the most senior Crown appointments, and most others are made by ministers over whom the prime minister has the power of appointment and dismissal. [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellors]], Ambassadors and [[High Commissioner]]s, senior civil servants, senior military officers, members of important committees and commissions, and other officials are selected, and in most cases may be removed, by the prime minister. The prime minister also formally advises the sovereign on the appointment of archbishops and bishops of the [[Church of England]],<ref name=Barnett249>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p. 249</ref> but the prime minister's discretion is limited by the existence of the [[Crown Nominations Commission]]. The appointment of senior judges, while constitutionally still on the advice of the prime minister, is now made on the basis of recommendations from independent bodies.\n\nPeerages, knighthoods, and most other honours are bestowed by the sovereign only on the advice of the prime minister. The only important British honours over which the prime minister does not have control are the [[Order of the Garter]], the [[Order of the Thistle]], the [[Order of Merit]], the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]], the [[Royal Victorian Order]], and the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]], which are all within the \"personal gift\" of the sovereign.\n\nThe prime minister appoints officials known as the \"Government Whips\", who negotiate for the support of MPs and to discipline dissenters. Party discipline is strong since electors generally vote for individuals on the basis of their party affiliation. Members of Parliament may be expelled from their party for failing to support the Government on important issues, and although this will not mean they must resign as MPs, it will usually make re-election difficult. Members of Parliament who hold ministerial office or political privileges can expect removal for failing to support the prime minister. Restraints imposed by the Commons grow weaker when the Government's party enjoys a large majority in that House, or among the electorate. In most circumstances, however, the prime minister can secure the Commons' support for almost any bill by internal party negotiations, with little regard to Opposition MPs.\n\nHowever, even a government with a healthy majority can on occasion find itself unable to pass legislation. For example, on 9 November 2005, [[Tony Blair]]'s Government was defeated over plans which would have allowed police to detain terror suspects for up to 90 days without charge, and on 31 January 2006, was defeated over certain aspects of proposals to outlaw religious hatred. On other occasions, the Government alters its proposals to avoid defeat in the Commons, as [[Tony Blair]]'s Government did in February 2006 over education reforms.<ref name=\"education reforms\">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-2028503,00.html |work=The Times |location=London   |title=Blair defends school reform climbdown |date=7 February 2006 |first=Jenny |last=Booth}}</ref>\n\nFormerly, a prime minister whose government lost a Commons vote would be regarded as fatally weakened, and the whole government would resign, usually precipitating a general election. In modern practice, when the Government party has an absolute majority in the House, only [[loss of supply]] and the express vote \"that this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government\" are treated as having this effect; dissenters on a minor issue within the majority party are unlikely to force an election with the probable loss of their seats and salaries.\n\nLikewise, a prime minister is no longer just \"first amongst equals\" in HM Government; although theoretically the Cabinet might still outvote the prime minister, in practice the prime minister progressively entrenches his or her position by retaining only personal supporters in the Cabinet. In occasional reshuffles, the prime minister can sideline and simply drop from Cabinet the Members who have fallen out of favour: they remain Privy Counsellors, but the prime minister decides which of them are summoned to meetings. The prime minister is responsible for producing and enforcing the [[Ministerial Code]].\n\n==Precedence, privileges and form of address==\n{{Main|List of peerages held by Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:chequers2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Chequers Court]]'', the prime minister's official country home]]\nBy tradition, before a new prime minister can occupy [[10 Downing Street]], they are required to announce to the country and the world that they have \"kissed hands\" with the reigning monarch, and have thus become Prime Minister.

The [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] eliminated the Lord Chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister.\n\nThe prime minister is customarily a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and thus entitled to the appellation \"[[The Right Honourable]]\". Membership of the Council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed Prime Minister. Most potential candidates have already attained this status. The only case when a non-privy counsellor was the natural appointment was Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. The issue was resolved by appointing him to the Council immediately prior to his appointment as Prime Minister.\n\nAccording to the now defunct [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], the prime minister is made a privy counsellor as a result of taking office and should be addressed by the official title prefixed by \"The Right Honourable\" and not by a personal name.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2016}} Although this form of address is employed on formal occasions, it is rarely used by the media. As \"prime minister\" is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as \"the prime minister\". The title \"Prime Minister\" (e.g. \"Prime Minister Boris Johnson\") is technically incorrect but is sometimes used erroneously outside the United Kingdom and has more recently become acceptable within it.<ref>An example of \"prime minister\" being used as a title, even by Number 10 Downing Street. {{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/09/pm-attending-european-council-55107|title=PM attends European Council |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> Within the UK, the expression \"Prime Minister Johnson\" is never used, although it, too, is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources.\n\n10 Downing Street, in [[London]], has been the [[official residence|official place of residence]] of the prime minister since 1732; they are entitled to use its staff and facilities, including extensive offices. [[Chequers]], a [[English country house|country house]] in Buckinghamshire, gifted to the government in 1917, may be used as a country retreat for the prime minister.\n\n==Living former prime ministers==\n{{Further|Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom}}\nThere are five living former British prime ministers:\n{{Gallery\n|mode=packed\n|width=\n|height=\n|align=center\n|John Major 1996.jpg|[[John Major]]<br>(1990\u20131997)\n|Tony Blair 2.jpg|[[Tony Blair]]<br>(1997\u20132007)\n|Gordon Brown official.jpg|[[Gordon Brown]]<br>(2007\u20132010)\n|David Cameron official.jpg|[[David Cameron]]<br>(2010\u20132016)\n|Theresa May Official.jpg|[[Theresa May]]<br>(2016\u20132019)\n}}\n\n====Retirement Honours====\nUpon retirement, it is customary for the sovereign to grant a prime minister some honour or dignity. The honour bestowed is commonly, but not invariably, membership of the UK's most senior order of chivalry, the [[Order of the Garter]]. The practice of creating a retired prime minister a Knight of the Garter (KG) has been fairly prevalent since the mid\u2013nineteenth century. Upon the retirement of a prime minister who is Scottish, it is likely that the primarily Scottish honour of [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]] (KT) will be used instead of the Order of the Garter, which is generally regarded as an English honour.<ref group=note>This circumstance is somewhat confused, however, as since the Great Reform Act 1832, only seven Scots have served as prime minister. Of these, two \u2013 [[Bonar Law]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]] \u2013 died while still sitting in the Commons, not yet having retired; another, the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]], was appointed to ''both'' the Order of the Garter and the Order of the Thistle; yet another, [[Arthur Balfour]], was appointed to the Order of the Garter, but represented an English constituency and may not have considered himself entirely Scottish; and of the remaining three, the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]] became a KG, [[Alec Douglas-Home]] became a KT, and [[Gordon Brown]] remained in the House of Commons as a [[backbencher]] until 2015.</ref>\n\nHistorically it has also been common to grant prime ministers a [[peerage]] upon retirement from the Commons, elevating the individual to the Lords. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an [[earl]]dom.{{refn|group=note|Churchill was offered a [[Duke of London|dukedom]] but declined.<ref>{{cite book |title=Winston S.

Unusually, he became [[Earl of Stockton]] only in 1984, over twenty years after leaving office.\n\nMacmillan's successors, [[Alec Douglas-Home]], [[Harold Wilson]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], all accepted [[life peer]]ages (although Douglas-Home had previously disclaimed his hereditary title as [[Earl of Home]]). [[Edward Heath]] did not accept a peerage of any kind and nor have any of the prime ministers to retire since 1990, although Heath and Major were later appointed as Knights of the Garter.\n\nThe most recent former prime minister to die was Margaret Thatcher (1979\u20131990) on 8 April 2013. Her death meant that for the first time since 1955 (the year in which the [[Earldom of Attlee]] was created, subsequent to the death of [[Earl Baldwin of Bewdley|Earl Baldwin]] in 1947) the membership of the House of Lords included no former prime minister, a situation which remains the case as of 2020.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Timeline of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by length of tenure]]\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by age]]\n* [[List of current heads of government in the United Kingdom and dependencies]]\n* [[List of fictional Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of peerages held by Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies represented by sitting Prime Ministers]]\n* [[Air transport of the Royal Family and Government of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Children of the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Living Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Prime Ministerial Car (United Kingdom)]]\n* [[Prime Minister's Questions]]\n* [[Records of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Spouse of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Works cited ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |title=The English Constitution |last=Bagehot |first=Walter |year=1963 |ref=Bagehot |publisher=Wm.

He began his career with amateur side Bolton Temperance before signing for [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] but was released a year later having made no appearances. He instead joined [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and was eventually handed his professional debut in 1904. Shepherd won promotion in his first full season with Bolton and the following year he finished as the top goalscorer in the First Division. His form led to call ups for the [[The Football League XI|Football League representative XI]] and the [[England national football team]], scoring on his debut for both sides in 1906.\n\nHe joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 1908, winning the First Division title and becoming the first player for Newcastle to reach thirty goals in a single season during the 1909\u201310 season, including scoring both goals in the [[1910 FA Cup Final]] during a 2\u20130 victory over [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. He gained a second cap for England in 1911 before his career was halted after sustaining a serious knee injury that kept him out for over a year. After struggling to regain form after his return, he was sold to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] where he spent one season before retiring. During his career, he scored over 150 goals in the [[Football League]] in 241 appearances.\n\n==Early life==\nShepherd was born at 10 South Street in [[Great Lever]]. He was the third of three children of Thomas and Martha Shepherd and was baptised at St. Mark's Church on 31 March 1902.

He started to work at [[The Second City]], an improvisational theatre in [[Chicago]], in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987.<ref name=\"matthau\"/> During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations.<ref name=\"The Age\"/>\n\nHe auditioned for a role in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' and his first meeting underwhelmed [[Tracey Ullman]] and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a [[Visual impairment|blind]] man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.<ref name=\"matthau\"/>\n\n===''The Simpsons''===\nCastellaneta is most famous for his role as [[Homer Simpson]] on the longest running animated television show ''[[The Simpsons]]''. ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' included a series of animated shorts about a [[dysfunctional family]]. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member [[Julie Kavner]] to voice Homer and [[Marge Simpson]] rather than hire more actors.<ref name=\"The Age\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html|title=D'oh, you're the voice|accessdate=February 15, 2009|date=February 27, 2003|author=Lee, Luaine|work=[[The Age]]|location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref name=\"FN\">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,129665,00.html|title=D'oh!: The Voice of Homer Is Deceivingly Deadpan|accessdate=February 15, 2009|date=August 18, 2007|author=Elber, Lynn|publisher=[[Fox News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703090128/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C129665%2C00.html|archive-date=July 3, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Homer's voice began as a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]], but Castellaneta could not \"get enough power behind that voice\" and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour long recording sessions.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers|accessdate=February 15, 2009|date=July 26, 2007|author=Carroll, Larry|publisher=[[MTV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220140402/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|archivedate=December 20, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe tried to find something easier, so he \"dropped the voice down\", and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show.<ref name=\"matthau\">{{cite news|url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/castellaneta99.html|author=Brownfield, Paul|title=He's Homer, but This Odyssey Is His Own|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 6, 1999|accessdate=February 15, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512004132/http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/castellaneta99.html|archivedate=May 12, 2008}}</ref> Castellaneta's normal speaking voice has no similarity to Homer's.<ref name=\"Aspen\">{{cite news|author=Harden, Mark|url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/castellaneta00.html|title='Simpsons' voice Dan Castellaneta has some surprises for Aspen fest|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=February 9, 2000|accessdate=February 15, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710115213/http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/castellaneta00.html|archivedate=July 10, 2009}}</ref> To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest,<ref name=\"The Age\"/> and is said to \"let his IQ go.\"<ref name=\"Mirkin\">[[David Mirkin|Mirkin, David]].

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L. Francis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q4RONp_1mrMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+sailing+yachts|title=The Golden Age of Yachting|date=2007|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-251-6|location=|pages=19\u201325|language=en}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 1739, England found itself in a series of wars\u2014a period that saw a decline in yachting. In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of [[jib]] and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and [[trysail]] (in place of the [[mainsail]]). Performance yachts are likely to have full-battened kevlar or carbon-fiber mainsails.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Classes ===\nWorld Sailing recognizes eleven classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Class\n!LOA\n!Manufacturer\n|-\n|[[Farr 30]]\n|{{Convert|30.9|ft|m|abbr=}}\n|Various\n|-\n|[[X-35]]\n|{{Convert|10.36|m|ft|abbr=|order=flip}}\n|[[X-Yachts]]\n|-\n|[[J/111]]\n|{{Convert|36.4|ft|m|abbr=}}\n|[[J/Boats]]\n|-\n|[[Class 40]]\n|{{Convert|11.9|m|ft|abbr=|order=flip}}\n|Open\n|-\n|[[Soto 40]]\n|{{Convert|12.3|m|ft|abbr=|order=flip}}\n|M Boats\n|-\n|[[X-41]]\n|{{Convert|40.5|ft|m|abbr=}}\n|X-Yachts\n|-\n|[[Swan 45]]\n|{{Convert|13.83|m|ft|abbr=|order=flip}}\n|[[Nautor's Swan|Nautor]]\n|-\n|[[TP 52|Transpac 52]]\n|{{Convert|115.85|m|ft|abbr=|order=flip}}\n|Various\n|-\n|[[IMOCA 60]]\n|{{Convert|60|ft|m|abbr=}}\n|Various\n|-\n|[[Swan 60]]\n|{{Convert|18.85|m|ft|abbr=|order=flip}}\n|[[Nautor's Swan|Nautor]]\n|-\n|[[Maxi yacht]]\n|{{Convert|70|ft|m|abbr=}}+\n|Various\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cruising (maritime)]]\n*[[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n*[[Sailing (sport)]]\n*[[Yachting]]\n*[[Yacht racing]]\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClasses:15.85", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_yacht"}

The show includes a detailed look at the news, as well as analysis with guests and sport and weather updates.\n\nUnlike most other BBC News Channel bulletins, the ''BBC News at Five'' is presented from Studio C, which is usually the main studio for BBC World News.\n\n==Weekends and Bank Holidays==\nDuring weekends and bank holidays, BBC News at Five resembles an unbranded BBC News channel bulletin, usually lasting for 30 minutes. As the main evening news on Saturday is normally at 17:30, when the main news isn't the back half hour is filled with a sports bulletin and ''The Film Review''.  It presented from the News Channel's main studio, studio E. \n\n== History ==\n\nThe programme started on 3 April 2006 as part of the BBC's relaunch of BBC News presenters, which saw the introduction of the new flagship programme to compete against [[Jeremy Thompson]]'s ''[[Live at Five (Sky News programme)|Live at Five]]'' programme on rival channel [[Sky News]], and to improve BBC News ratings for the hour.\n\nAs part of the 2008 revamp of the entire news output, the show moved studios within [[BBC Television Centre]] along with [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] and the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' and ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' bulletins. The show originally broadcast from Studio N8 but moved to Studio N6.\n\nOn 18 March 2013, the programme moved to [[Broadcasting House]] along with BBC News and the BBC One bulletins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/tv_news_move.html |title=BBC News' television output moves to new studios at Broadcasting House |publisher=BBC |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-18}}</ref> On 4 November 2013, the ''BBC News at Five'' received new opening titles featuring the hour of broadcast.\n\n== Outside broadcasts ==\n\nAs well as presenting from the studio, the main presenters are called upon to present on location when major stories break. For example, [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] presented live from the BBC's Washington Studio for the 2008, 2012 and 2016 US Presidential Elections and has presented live from Basra from the withdrawal ceremony. [[George Alagiah]] presented from L'Aquila in April 2009 and Haiti in January 2010 when earthquakes struck the countries.

The programme is fronted by ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' presenter [[Huw Edwards]], the BBC's lead presenter for major breaking news, from Monday to Thursday and [[Jane Hill]] on Friday<!-- Do not add weekend presenters, the branded News at Five only runs on weekdays -->. The show includes a detailed look at the news, as well as analysis with guests and sport and weather updates.\n\nUnlike most other BBC News Channel bulletins, the ''BBC News at Five'' is presented from Studio C, which is usually the main studio for BBC World News.\n\n==Weekends and Bank Holidays==\nDuring weekends and bank holidays, BBC News at Five resembles an unbranded BBC News channel bulletin, usually lasting for 30 minutes. As the main evening news on Saturday is normally at 17:30, when the main news isn't the back half hour is filled with a sports bulletin and ''The Film Review''.  It presented from the News Channel's main studio, studio E. \n\n== History ==\n\nThe programme started on 3 April 2006 as part of the BBC's relaunch of BBC News presenters, which saw the introduction of the new flagship programme to compete against [[Jeremy Thompson]]'s ''[[Live at Five (Sky News programme)|Live at Five]]'' programme on rival channel [[Sky News]], and to improve BBC News ratings for the hour.\n\nAs part of the 2008 revamp of the entire news output, the show moved studios within [[BBC Television Centre]] along with [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] and the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' and ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' bulletins. The show originally broadcast from Studio N8 but moved to Studio N6.\n\nOn 18 March 2013, the programme moved to [[Broadcasting House]] along with BBC News and the BBC One bulletins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/tv_news_move.html |title=BBC News' television output moves to new studios at Broadcasting House |publisher=BBC |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-18}}</ref> On 4 November 2013, the ''BBC News at Five'' received new opening titles featuring the hour of broadcast.\n\n== Outside broadcasts ==\n\nAs well as presenting from the studio, the main presenters are called upon to present on location when major stories break. For example, [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] presented live from the BBC's Washington Studio for the 2008, 2012 and 2016 US Presidential Elections and has presented live from Basra from the withdrawal ceremony. [[George Alagiah]] presented from L'Aquila in April 2009 and Haiti in January 2010 when earthquakes struck the countries.

[[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\n\nMost Haredi and Hasidic seminaries likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education.

These are usually structured around continuing / [[adult education]], and accept both men and women.

These are usually structured around continuing / [[adult education]], and accept both men and women.
