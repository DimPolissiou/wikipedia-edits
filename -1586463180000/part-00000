A house at one farmstead sustained very high-end EF3 damage, being completely leveled with the subflooring partially collapsed into the basement. This home was bolted to its foundation, though a vehicle parked in the garage was not moved, preventing a higher rating. Another home had its roof ripped off, while a third sustained shingle and window damage. The tornado then struck the northern part of Washburn at high-end EF2 strength, ripping roofs off of many well-built homes, a few of which sustained some failure of exterior walls. One home in town had a car thrown into it. Several additional farmsteads sustained EF2 damage east of Washburn before the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and struck Rutland, where minor tree and roof damage occurred before the tornado dissipated. Many trees were snapped and uprooted along the path. Total economic losses were estimated at about $2,000,000.\n|<ref>{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Central Illinois|title=Illinois Event Report: EF3 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=678122|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2017|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Central Illinois|title=Illinois Event Report: EF2 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=678123|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2017|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref><br><ref>{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Central Illinois|title=Illinois Event Report: EF0 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=677693|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2017|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{storm colour|storm}} | EF0\n|[[Folletts, Iowa|Folletts]]\n|[[Clinton County, Iowa|Clinton]]\n|[[Iowa|IA]]\n|{{Coord|41.7535|-90.3582|name=Follets (Feb. 28, EF0)}}\n|23:53\n|{{convert|0.04|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|{{convert|25|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|An emergency manager reported a brief tornado in a farm field.

The occupants of this home survived by taking shelter in the basement.]] \nThe first EF4 tornado of 2017 began at 01:51&nbsp;UTC on March&nbsp;1 (7:51&nbsp;p.m. CST on February&nbsp;28) to the west of [[Perryville, Missouri|Perryville]] in [[Perry County, Missouri]], where it snapped the trunks of several hardwood trees and caused EF1 damage to homes. An outbuilding was destroyed at EF2 intensity near the intersection of Country Road 810 and North Highway. The tornado then continued to the northeast and intensified at an exceptional rate, causing EF4 damage as it impacted a small subdivision of large homes on the west side of [[Interstate 55]]. Multiple two-story homes along Kyle Lane were completely leveled. One person was killed in their vehicle as the tornado crossed Interstate 55, and least a dozen cars were mangled and destroyed after being thrown {{convert|200|\u2013|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} from a nearby salvage yard. The tornado then moved across a series of open pastures before crossing [[U.S. Route 61]] and impacting the northwestern outskirts of Perryville at EF4 intensity. A residential subdivision along Moore Drive in this area sustained devastating damage, with many homes completely leveled, a few of which were swept clean from their foundations. Numerous trees in this area were snapped and denuded, and several vehicles were flipped and tossed. One home in this area was anchor-bolted to its foundation with its wall studs toe-nailed at both the top and bottom, and was completely swept away with only the basement left behind. Despite the high-quality construction, the overall context surrounding this home was not indicative of an intensity greater than mid-range EF4, and maximum winds along this segment of the path were estimated to have peaked at 180&nbsp;mph (290&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"NWSDAT\">{{cite web|title=Damage Assessment Toolkit|url=https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2017-02-28 Perryville, Missouri tornado damage.jpg|thumb|left|High-end EF3 damage to a farmhouse to the southwest of Christopher, Illinois]] \nThe tornado weakened to high-end EF2 strength as it crossed Country Road 906, destroying a garage and collapsing the exterior walls of a residence. As the tornado continued through sparsely populated areas further to the northeast, it produced a mixture of EF2 and EF3 damage to homes. A few homes along this portion of the path were left with only a single interior room standing, and multiple outbuildings were destroyed. Large hay bales from one of the outbuildings were thrown up to 50 yards away. As the tornado crossed the [[Mississippi River]] into Illinois, trees along the riverbank were shredded and debarked. The tornado took on a multiple-vortex structure at this point, as evidenced by multiple distinct ground striations in nearby fields, and also attained its peak width of {{convert|0.6|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}. Once in Illinois, the tornado continued at EF2 strength as it passed south of [[Rockwood, Illinois|Rockwood]], snapping hundreds of trees and a few power poles. A house at the edge of the damage path sustained EF0 roof damage. Past Rockwood, the tornado tore through the [[Shawnee National Forest]], downing thousands of trees at EF1 to EF2 strength as it continued to the northeast. EF1 and EF2 damage continued to the south of [[Ava, Illinois|Ava]], as numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and several outbuildings were completely destroyed. East of Ava, many trees, mobile homes, and frame homes sustained considerable damage, and additional outbuildings were destroyed as damage continued to range from EF1 to EF2 in intensity. The tornado then narrowly missed the town of [[Vergennes, Illinois|Vergennes]] to the south, completely destroying a house at EF3 intensity. Outbuildings and large grain silos were destroyed, and trees and power poles were snapped just south of town as well.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\"/>\n\nContinuing northeastward past Vergennes, EF2 damage occurred as a small home was largely destroyed, power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, an antennae was bent, and a dump truck was flipped over. EF2 damage continued as the tornado clipped the northern fringes of [[Elkville, Illinois|Elkville]], with multiple homes and outbuildings severely damaged or destroyed in that area. The Powerade Park baseball field complex was also damaged, and many trees were snapped. EF1 damage to trees was observed further to the northeast as the tornado traversed unpopulated swampy areas. The tornado passed south of Campbell Lake and then moved into [[Franklin County, Illinois|Franklin County]], where it dramatically re-intensified to high-end EF3 strength as it crossed [[Illinois Route 184]]. A farmhouse at this location was completely obliterated and swept cleanly away, with the debris shredded and scattered {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} downwind. National Weather Service damage surveyors were unable to recover anything larger than a few wooden 2x4s and some pieces of siding downwind from the foundation. Nearby trees were snapped and denuded as well. Due to the intensity of the damage, the damage at this location was initially assigned an EF4 rating. However, further surveys revealed that the home was not attached to its cinder block foundation, and the rating was subsequently decreased to high-end EF3. Beyond this point, the tornado weakened to EF1 intensity and caused moderate damage to some homes and outbuildings before it lifted at 02:57&nbsp;UTC (8:57&nbsp;p.m. CST) to the southwest of [[Christopher, Illinois|Christopher]]. With a total path length of {{convert|53.47|mi|km|abbr=on}}, it was the longest-tracked tornado in the county warning area of the Paducah, Kentucky National Weather Service office in 36 years. In addition to the one fatality, twelve people were injured.<ref name=\"PerryvillePNS\">{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Paducah, Kentucky|title=NWS Damage Survey for February 28, 2017 Perry County, Missouri, southwest Illinois tornado|url=https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=PNSPAH&e=201703041744|publisher=Iowa Environmental Mesonet|date=March 4, 2017|accessdate=March 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"NWSDAT\" />\n\n===Crossville, Illinois \u2013 Oakland City, Indiana===\n[[File:2017-02-28 Crossville, Illinois tornado damage.jpg|thumb|left|EF3 damage to a house in Gibson County, Indiana.]]\nA tornado touched down just northeast of [[Carmi, Illinois|Carmi]] in [[White County, Illinois]] at 03:54&nbsp;UTC on March&nbsp;1 (9:54&nbsp;p.m. CST), snapping the trunks of hardwood trees at EF1 strength. It rapidly intensified to EF3 strength farther to the east as it crossed [[Illinois Route 1]], completely destroying a single-wide mobile home and rolling four to five vehicles. A residence was moved about {{convert|3|ft|yd|abbr=on}} off its foundation, with a majority of its second floor swept away, a four-wheeler flipped upside down, a refrigerator tossed atop the rubble, and an associated garage completely destroyed. A small brick outbuilding nearby was severely damaged, a double-wide mobile home was obliterated and several power poles were snapped in this area as well. The tornado then crossed 1675 East Street and North 1750 East Street, narrowly missing the city of [[Crossville, Illinois]] to the south. EF3 damage was again inflicted to a residence that sustained major damage to its structure, had its garage destroyed, and had a vehicle rolled about {{convert|30|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Just past 1800 East Street, one small barn storing farm equipment was decimated while a larger outbuilding had its main support beams break loose from the concrete pads, forcing the roof beams to buckle. Damage to these structures was rated EF2. Another large barn nearby was severely damaged and a small brick outbuilding was destroyed, with damage to those structures rated EF1.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\"/>\n\nFarther along the path, the tornado re-intensified to EF3 strength as it crossed at the North 1935 East Road and East 1975 North Road intersection to the north of [[Phillipstown, Illinois|Phillipstown]]. The old part of a home, which had to be rebuilt after being hit by the [[1925 Tri-State tornado]], was destroyed while the newer part of the structure was damaged. A vehicle from this residence was thrown {{convert|30|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Several other structures in this area sustained EF2 damage, including a house that had its roof torn off, two double-wide mobile homes that were destroyed with nearby vehicles displaced, and an outbuilding that was completely destroyed. A house at the edge of the circulation had some of its metal roofing removed as well. The tornado continued towards the Wabash River, downing numerous trees at EF1 intensity as it moved through unpopulated areas.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\" /> In total, 35 structures were damaged in the county.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\"/>\n\nThe tornado crossed the Wabash River into [[Posey County, Indiana]] and restrengthened to EF2 intensity, obliterating two metal barns. It veered east-southeast but quickly back east-northeast, causing severe damage to many hardwood trees along its path. Southeast of [[Griffin, Indiana|Griffin]], a free-standing light pole was collapsed. The storm narrowed after crossing [[Interstate 64]], but continued to produce EF2 damage to a barn that was flattened. Along Pumpkin Run Road, multiple power poles were snapped, while along Murphy Road, a residence sustained damage to its roof. A nearby house was completely shifted off its foundation, with nearby hardwood trees snapped and uprooted. As the tornado passed north of [[Poseyville, Indiana|Poseyville]] into [[Gibson County, Indiana|Gibson County]], wooden power poles were snapped and large amounts of debris was strewn throughout a treeline along [[Indiana State Road 165]]. A pocket of EF3 damage was noted as a metal building was totally destroyed with its foundation swept clean. Cars at the structure were tossed {{convert|15|yd|m|abbr=on}}, 6x6 poles were snapped at the concrete, and two double-wide mobile homes were destroyed with their metal frames tossed {{convert|50|\u2013|75|yd|m|abbr=on}}. An anchor-bolted frame home had one of its walls, its windows, and its stella doors blown out. Another nearby home had a large section of its roof ripped off, sustaining EF2 damage. Along South County Road 1075 West, EF2 damage continued as power poles were snapped, a mobile home was destroyed, and hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted. Continuing northeast, a steel barn was destroyed and hundreds of additional trees were snapped. The tornado then produced another area of EF3 damage as it destroyed a brick home. The house had its roof ripped off, exterior walls collapsed, and had its attached garage destroyed. An occupant of this home was left trapped in the debris after the tornado and had to be dug out.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\"/>\n\nFarther along the path, the tornado weakened back to EF2 strength as a residence to the southeast of [[Owensville, Indiana|Owensville]] had its entire roof destroyed and sustained damage to its concrete block walls, while several nearby outbuildings were damaged. EF2 damage continued as it crossed [[Indiana State Road 168]] to the west of [[Fort Branch, Indiana|Fort Branch]], tearing off large sections of roof from homes and crumpling large grain bins. The tornado weakened as it affected areas just north of Fort Branch, but still caused considerable high-end EF1 roof damage to several homes and downed many trees. To the northeast of Fort Branch, EF1 damage continued as homes sustained roof damage, including a brick home that lost about 1/4 of its roof. A metal building had part of its roof ripped off and walls pushed in along South County Road 550 East, while a final pocket of EF2 damage was noted farther along the path just west of [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]], where a barn was completely destroyed. The final observed damage was to a barn south of [[Oakland City, Indiana|Oakland City]] that had half of its roof torn off and gable blown out at 04:45&nbsp;UTC (10:45&nbsp;p.m. CST), marking an end to the tornado's 44.6&nbsp;mi (71.8&nbsp;km) path. Damage to this last structure was rated EF1. In all, 106 structures were damaged in Gibson County, of which 33 suffered minimal damage, 26 suffered minor damage, 21 suffered major damage, and 26 were destroyed. One person was killed, and two others were injured by this tornado.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tornadoes of 2017]]\n* [[Tornado outbreak of March 2\u20133, 2012]] \u2013 An early March outbreak which produced multiple long-tracked and destructive tornadoes across the Ohio Valley\n* [[Tornado outbreak of March 6\u20137, 2017]] \u2013 A less severe tornado outbreak that affected similar areas just one week later\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\nOutbreak summaries from regional National Weather Service offices:\n{{colbegin}}\n*[http://www.weather.gov/sgf/event_feb28_mar1_2017_severe Springfield, Missouri, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/lsx/02_28_2017 St. Louis, Missouri, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/dvn/SevereSummary022817 Quad Cities, IA/IL, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/ilx/28feb17 Lincoln, Illinois, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/lot/2017Feb28_tornadoes Chicago, Illinois, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/ind/feb28mar12017severe Indianapolis, Indiana, WFO]\n*[https://www.weather.gov/iwx/20170228_severe Northern Indiana, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/iln/20170301 Wilmington, Ohio, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/lmk/feb28_mar1_2017severe Louisville, Kentucky, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/pah/February28Tornadoes Paducah, Kentucky, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/lzk/svr0217a.htm Little Rock, Arkansas, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/meg/march1stormdamagesurvey Memphis, Tennessee, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/ohx/20170301 Nashville, Tennessee, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/ffc/20170301_severe_weather Atlanta, Georgia, WFO]\n{{colend}}\n\n{{2017 tornado outbreaks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2017-02-28 Tornado outbreak}}\n[[Category:2016\u201317 North American winter]]\n[[Category:2017 in Missouri]]\n[[Category:2017 in Illinois]]\n[[Category:2017 in Indiana]]\n[[Category:2017 in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:2017 in Arkansas]]\n[[Category:2017 in Ohio]]\n[[Category:February 2017 events in the United States]]\n[[Category:March 2017 events in the United States]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes of 2017]]\n[[Category:F4 tornadoes by date]]\n[[Category:F4 tornadoes by location| ,2017-02-28]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox storm\n| name = Tornado outbreak of February 28 \u2013 March 1, 2017\n| image = Supercells in the February 28\u2013March 1, 2017 tornado outbreak 2215Z.png\n| caption = [[GOES 13]] satellite images of the [[supercell]]s associated with the tornado outbreak at 23:15&nbsp;[[UTC]] on February 28, 2017\n| type = [[Tornado outbreak]]<br />[[Extratropical cyclone]]\n| formed = {{start date|2017|2|28}}\n| dissipated = {{end date|2017|3|01}}\n| lowest pressure =\n| lowest temperature =\n| tornadoes = 72 confirmed \n| fujitascale = EF4\n| enhanced = yes\n| tornado duration = 23 hours, 19 minutes\n| highest winds = Tornadic: {{convert|180|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Perryville, Missouri]]<br>Non-tornadic: {{convert|95|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} west of [[East Chicago, Indiana]]\n| hail = {{convert|4.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} diameter in Monnie Springs, Arkansas\n| damages = $1.3&nbsp;billion\n| power outages =\n| total fatalities = 4 fatalities, 38 injuries (+30 non-tornadic injuries)\n| affected = [[Central United States]], [[Ohio Valley]], [[Eastern United States]], [[Southern United States]]\n| partof = the '''[[2016\u201317 North American winter]]''' and '''[[Tornadoes of 2017|tornado outbreaks of 2017]]'''\n}}\nThe '''tornado outbreak of February 28 \u2013 March 1, 2017''' was a widespread and significant outbreak of [[tornadoes]] and severe weather that affected the Midwestern United States at the end of February 2017 and beginning of March.

A house at one farmstead sustained very high-end EF3 damage, being completely leveled with the subflooring partially collapsed into the basement. This home was bolted to its foundation, though a vehicle parked in the garage was not moved, preventing a higher rating. Another home had its roof ripped off, while a third sustained shingle and window damage. The tornado then struck the northern part of Washburn at high-end EF2 strength, ripping roofs off of many well-built homes, a few of which sustained some failure of exterior walls. One home in town had a car thrown into it. Several additional farmsteads sustained EF2 damage east of Washburn before the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and struck Rutland, where minor tree and roof damage occurred before the tornado dissipated. Many trees were snapped and uprooted along the path. Total economic losses were estimated at about $2,000,000.\n|<ref>{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Central Illinois|title=Illinois Event Report: EF3 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=678122|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2017|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Central Illinois|title=Illinois Event Report: EF2 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=678123|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2017|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref><br><ref>{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Central Illinois|title=Illinois Event Report: EF0 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=677693|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2017|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{storm colour|storm}} | EF0\n|[[Folletts, Iowa|Folletts]]\n|[[Clinton County, Iowa|Clinton]]\n|[[Iowa|IA]]\n|{{Coord|41.7535|-90.3582|name=Follets (Feb. 28, EF0)}}\n|23:53\n|{{convert|0.04|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|{{convert|25|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|An emergency manager reported a brief tornado in a farm field.

The occupants of this home survived by taking shelter in the basement.]] \nThe first EF4 tornado of 2017 began at 01:51&nbsp;UTC on March&nbsp;1 (7:51&nbsp;p.m. CST on February&nbsp;28) to the west of [[Perryville, Missouri|Perryville]] in [[Perry County, Missouri]], where it snapped the trunks of several hardwood trees and caused EF1 damage to homes. An outbuilding was destroyed at EF2 intensity near the intersection of Country Road 810 and North Highway. The tornado then continued to the northeast and intensified at an exceptional rate, causing EF4 damage as it impacted a small subdivision of large homes on the west side of [[Interstate 55]]. Multiple two-story homes along Kyle Lane were completely leveled. One person was killed in their vehicle as the tornado crossed Interstate 55, and least a dozen cars were mangled and destroyed after being thrown {{convert|200|\u2013|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} from a nearby salvage yard. The tornado then moved across a series of open pastures before crossing [[U.S. Route 61]] and impacting the northwestern outskirts of Perryville at EF4 intensity. A residential subdivision along Moore Drive in this area sustained devastating damage, with many homes completely leveled, a few of which were swept clean from their foundations. Numerous trees in this area were snapped and denuded, and several vehicles were flipped and tossed. One home in this area was anchor-bolted to its foundation with its wall studs toe-nailed at both the top and bottom, and was completely swept away with only the basement left behind. Despite the high-quality construction, the overall context surrounding this home was not indicative of an intensity greater than mid-range EF4, and maximum winds along this segment of the path were estimated to have peaked at 180&nbsp;mph (290&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"NWSDAT\">{{cite web|title=Damage Assessment Toolkit|url=https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2017-02-28 Perryville, Missouri tornado damage.jpg|thumb|left|High-end EF3 damage to a farmhouse to the southwest of Christopher, Illinois]] \nThe tornado weakened to high-end EF2 strength as it crossed Country Road 906, destroying a garage and collapsing the exterior walls of a residence. As the tornado continued through sparsely populated areas further to the northeast, it produced a mixture of EF2 and EF3 damage to homes. A few homes along this portion of the path were left with only a single interior room standing, and multiple outbuildings were destroyed. Large hay bales from one of the outbuildings were thrown up to 50 yards away. As the tornado crossed the [[Mississippi River]] into Illinois, trees along the riverbank were shredded and debarked. The tornado took on a multiple-vortex structure at this point, as evidenced by multiple distinct ground striations in nearby fields, and also attained its peak width of {{convert|0.6|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}. Once in Illinois, the tornado continued at EF2 strength as it passed south of [[Rockwood, Illinois|Rockwood]], snapping hundreds of trees and a few power poles. A house at the edge of the damage path sustained EF0 roof damage. Past Rockwood, the tornado tore through the [[Shawnee National Forest]], downing thousands of trees at EF1 to EF2 strength as it continued to the northeast. EF1 and EF2 damage continued to the south of [[Ava, Illinois|Ava]], as numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and several outbuildings were completely destroyed. East of Ava, many trees, mobile homes, and frame homes sustained considerable damage, and additional outbuildings were destroyed as damage continued to range from EF1 to EF2 in intensity. The tornado then narrowly missed the town of [[Vergennes, Illinois|Vergennes]] to the south, completely destroying a house at EF3 intensity. Outbuildings and large grain silos were destroyed, and trees and power poles were snapped just south of town as well.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\"/>\n\nContinuing northeastward past Vergennes, EF2 damage occurred as a small home was largely destroyed, power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, an antennae was bent, and a dump truck was flipped over. EF2 damage continued as the tornado clipped the northern fringes of [[Elkville, Illinois|Elkville]], with multiple homes and outbuildings severely damaged or destroyed in that area. The Powerade Park baseball field complex was also damaged, and many trees were snapped. EF1 damage to trees was observed further to the northeast as the tornado traversed unpopulated swampy areas. The tornado passed south of Campbell Lake and then moved into [[Franklin County, Illinois|Franklin County]], where it dramatically re-intensified to high-end EF3 strength as it crossed [[Illinois Route 184]]. A farmhouse at this location was completely obliterated and swept cleanly away, with the debris shredded and scattered {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} downwind. National Weather Service damage surveyors were unable to recover anything larger than a few wooden 2x4s and some pieces of siding downwind from the foundation. Nearby trees were snapped and denuded as well. Due to the intensity of the damage, the damage at this location was initially assigned an EF4 rating. However, further surveys revealed that the home was not attached to its cinder block foundation, and the rating was subsequently decreased to high-end EF3. Beyond this point, the tornado weakened to EF1 intensity and caused moderate damage to some homes and outbuildings before it lifted at 02:57&nbsp;UTC (8:57&nbsp;p.m. CST) to the southwest of [[Christopher, Illinois|Christopher]]. With a total path length of {{convert|53.47|mi|km|abbr=on}}, it was the longest-tracked tornado in the county warning area of the Paducah, Kentucky National Weather Service office in 36 years.

It rapidly intensified to EF3 strength farther to the east as it crossed [[Illinois Route 1]], completely destroying a single-wide mobile home and rolling four to five vehicles. A residence was moved about {{convert|3|ft|yd|abbr=on}} off its foundation, with a majority of its second floor swept away, a four-wheeler flipped upside down, a refrigerator tossed atop the rubble, and an associated garage completely destroyed. A small brick outbuilding nearby was severely damaged, a double-wide mobile home was obliterated and several power poles were snapped in this area as well. The tornado then crossed 1675 East Street and North 1750 East Street, narrowly missing the city of [[Crossville, Illinois]] to the south. EF3 damage was again inflicted to a residence that sustained major damage to its structure, had its garage destroyed, and had a vehicle rolled about {{convert|30|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Just past 1800 East Street, one small barn storing farm equipment was decimated while a larger outbuilding had its main support beams break loose from the concrete pads, forcing the roof beams to buckle. Damage to these structures was rated EF2. Another large barn nearby was severely damaged and a small brick outbuilding was destroyed, with damage to those structures rated EF1.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\"/>\n\nFarther along the path, the tornado re-intensified to EF3 strength as it crossed at the North 1935 East Road and East 1975 North Road intersection to the north of [[Phillipstown, Illinois|Phillipstown]]. The old part of a home, which had to be rebuilt after being hit by the [[1925 Tri-State tornado]], was destroyed while the newer part of the structure was damaged. A vehicle from this residence was thrown {{convert|30|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Several other structures in this area sustained EF2 damage, including a house that had its roof torn off, two double-wide mobile homes that were destroyed with nearby vehicles displaced, and an outbuilding that was completely destroyed. A house at the edge of the circulation had some of its metal roofing removed as well. The tornado continued towards the Wabash River, downing numerous trees at EF1 intensity as it moved through unpopulated areas.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\" /> In total, 35 structures were damaged in the county.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\"/>\n\nThe tornado crossed the Wabash River into [[Posey County, Indiana]] and restrengthened to EF2 intensity, obliterating two metal barns. It veered east-southeast but quickly back east-northeast, causing severe damage to many hardwood trees along its path. Southeast of [[Griffin, Indiana|Griffin]], a free-standing light pole was collapsed. The storm narrowed after crossing [[Interstate 64]], but continued to produce EF2 damage to a barn that was flattened. Along Pumpkin Run Road, multiple power poles were snapped, while along Murphy Road, a residence sustained damage to its roof. A nearby house was completely shifted off its foundation, with nearby hardwood trees snapped and uprooted. As the tornado passed north of [[Poseyville, Indiana|Poseyville]] into [[Gibson County, Indiana|Gibson County]], wooden power poles were snapped and large amounts of debris was strewn throughout a treeline along [[Indiana State Road 165]]. A pocket of EF3 damage was noted as a metal building was totally destroyed with its foundation swept clean. Cars at the structure were tossed {{convert|15|yd|m|abbr=on}}, 6x6 poles were snapped at the concrete, and two double-wide mobile homes were destroyed with their metal frames tossed {{convert|50|\u2013|75|yd|m|abbr=on}}. An anchor-bolted frame home had one of its walls, its windows, and its stella doors blown out. Another nearby home had a large section of its roof ripped off, sustaining EF2 damage. Along South County Road 1075 West, EF2 damage continued as power poles were snapped, a mobile home was destroyed, and hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted. Continuing northeast, a steel barn was destroyed and hundreds of additional trees were snapped. The tornado then produced another area of EF3 damage as it destroyed a brick home. The house had its roof ripped off, exterior walls collapsed, and had its attached garage destroyed. An occupant of this home was left trapped in the debris after the tornado and had to be dug out.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\"/>\n\nFarther along the path, the tornado weakened back to EF2 strength as a residence to the southeast of [[Owensville, Indiana|Owensville]] had its entire roof destroyed and sustained damage to its concrete block walls, while several nearby outbuildings were damaged. EF2 damage continued as it crossed [[Indiana State Road 168]] to the west of [[Fort Branch, Indiana|Fort Branch]], tearing off large sections of roof from homes and crumpling large grain bins. The tornado weakened as it affected areas just north of Fort Branch, but still caused considerable high-end EF1 roof damage to several homes and downed many trees. To the northeast of Fort Branch, EF1 damage continued as homes sustained roof damage, including a brick home that lost about 1/4 of its roof. A metal building had part of its roof ripped off and walls pushed in along South County Road 550 East, while a final pocket of EF2 damage was noted farther along the path just west of [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]], where a barn was completely destroyed. The final observed damage was to a barn south of [[Oakland City, Indiana|Oakland City]] that had half of its roof torn off and gable blown out at 04:45&nbsp;UTC (10:45&nbsp;p.m. CST), marking an end to the tornado's 44.6&nbsp;mi (71.8&nbsp;km) path. Damage to this last structure was rated EF1. In all, 106 structures were damaged in Gibson County, of which 33 suffered minimal damage, 26 suffered minor damage, 21 suffered major damage, and 26 were destroyed. One person was killed, and two others were injured by this tornado.<ref name=\"NWSDAT\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tornadoes of 2017]]\n* [[Tornado outbreak of March 2\u20133, 2012]] \u2013 An early March outbreak which produced multiple long-tracked and destructive tornadoes across the Ohio Valley\n* [[Tornado outbreak of March 6\u20137, 2017]] \u2013 A less severe tornado outbreak that affected similar areas just one week later\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\nOutbreak summaries from regional National Weather Service offices:\n{{colbegin}}\n*[http://www.weather.gov/sgf/event_feb28_mar1_2017_severe Springfield, Missouri, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/lsx/02_28_2017 St. Louis, Missouri, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/dvn/SevereSummary022817 Quad Cities, IA/IL, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/ilx/28feb17 Lincoln, Illinois, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/lot/2017Feb28_tornadoes Chicago, Illinois, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/ind/feb28mar12017severe Indianapolis, Indiana, WFO]\n*[https://www.weather.gov/iwx/20170228_severe Northern Indiana, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/iln/20170301 Wilmington, Ohio, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/lmk/feb28_mar1_2017severe Louisville, Kentucky, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/pah/February28Tornadoes Paducah, Kentucky, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/lzk/svr0217a.htm Little Rock, Arkansas, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/meg/march1stormdamagesurvey Memphis, Tennessee, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/ohx/20170301 Nashville, Tennessee, WFO]\n*[http://www.weather.gov/ffc/20170301_severe_weather Atlanta, Georgia, WFO]\n{{colend}}\n\n{{2017 tornado outbreaks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2017-02-28 Tornado outbreak}}\n[[Category:2016\u201317 North American winter]]\n[[Category:2017 in Missouri]]\n[[Category:2017 in Illinois]]\n[[Category:2017 in Indiana]]\n[[Category:2017 in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:2017 in Arkansas]]\n[[Category:2017 in Ohio]]\n[[Category:February 2017 events in the United States]]\n[[Category:March 2017 events in the United States]]\n[[Category:Tornadoes of 2017]]\n[[Category:F4 tornadoes by date]]\n[[Category:F4 tornadoes by location| ,2017-02-28]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak_of_February_28_%E2%80%93_March_1,_2017"}

The CAB strictly controlled all U.S. certificated airlines (\"scheduled carriers\") -- deciding which routes would be serviced by which airlines, and setting minimum limits on passenger fares (comparable to the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]) -- effectively managing competition between airlines, and ensuring certain levels of service to communities throughout the United States.<ref name=\"non_skeds_winter_2019_aahs_journal /><ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\">Brown, John Howard (assoc. prof., Dept of Finance & Economics, [[Georgia Southern University]]) (with credit to [[Alfred Kahn]], last CAB Chairman) [https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_19_01_06_brown.pdf \"Jimmy Carter, Alfred Kahn, and Airline Deregulation: Anatomy of a Policy Success,\"] Summer 2014, ''[[The Independent Review]],'' vol. 19, no. 1, ISSN 1086\u20131653, pp. 85\u201399</ref>\n\nWhile the CAB regulation suppressed free competition, it provided security for the existing airlines, avoided gluts and shortages of passengers on certain routes, and (partly by allowing airlines to carry air mail) secured airline service for communities that would have otherwise been served less, or not have been served at all (due to low passenger traffic or other reasons).<ref name=\"non_skeds_winter_2019_aahs_journal /><ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\" />\n\nTo achieve its goals, the CAB was empowered to provide and administer subsidies to airlines. Further, the CAB regulated airline industry mergers and intercompany contracting -- but shielded the airlines from [[antitrust]] regulation. Additionally, within the airline industry, the CAB was assigned to prevent deceptive trade practices and unfair competition methods (similar to the role of the [[Federal Trade Commission]]).<ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\" />\n\n==History==\nThe Civil Aeronautics Authority Act of 1938 formed the Civil Aeronautics Authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/75/publaw-706.pdf |title=Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 ~ P.L. 75-706 |date=June 23, 1938 |series=52 Stat. 973 ~ Senate Bill 3845 |publisher= Legis\u2605Works}}</ref> The agency was renamed in 1940,<ref name=USGManual>''The United States Government Manual 2009-2010''.

''Authority'' or ''respect'': submitting to tradition and legitimate authority; opposite of ''subversion''\n* ''Sanctity'' or ''purity'': abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions; opposite of ''degradation''\n\nThese five foundations are argued to group into two higher-order clusters \u2013 the person-focused ''Individualizing'' cluster of Care and Fairness, and the group-focused

Because members of two political camps are to a degree blind to one or more of the moral foundations of the others, they may perceive morally driven words or behavior as having another basis\u2014at best self-interested, at worst evil, and thus demonize one another.<ref name=\"Moyers\">{{cite AV media\n | people = Jonathan Haidt, Bill Moyers\n | title = Jonathan Haidt Explains Our Contentious Culture\n | medium = Television production\n | publisher = Public Square Media, Inc.\n | location = Lebanon\n | date = 3 February 2012\n | url = http://billmoyers.com/segment/jonathan-haidt-explains-our-contentious-culture/}}</ref>\n\nHaidt and Graham suggest a compromise can be found to allow liberals and conservatives to see eye-to-eye.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|last2=Graham|first2=Jesse|date=2007-06-01|title=When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions that Liberals may not Recognize|journal=Social Justice Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=98\u2013116|doi=10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z|issn=0885-7466}}</ref> They suggest that the five foundations can be used as \"doorway\" to allow liberals to step to the conservative side of the \"wall\" put up between these two political affiliations on major political issues (i.e. legalizing gay marriage).

The three foundations emphasized more by conservatives (Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity) bind groups together for greater strength in intertribal competition while the other two foundations balance those tendencies with concern for individuals within the group.

opposite of ''cheating''\n* ''Loyalty'' or ''ingroup'': standing with your [[Ingroups_and_outgroups|group]], family, nation; opposite of ''betrayal''\n* ''Authority'' or ''respect'': submitting to tradition and legitimate authority; opposite of ''subversion''\n* ''Sanctity'' or ''purity'': abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions; opposite of ''degradation''\n\nThese five foundations are argued to group into two higher-order clusters \u2013 the person-focused ''Individualizing'' cluster of Care and Fairness, and the group-focused ''Binding'' cluster of Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity.<ref name= \"Graham2009\" /><ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2009\">{{cite book |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |last2=Graham |first2=Jesse |editor1-last=Jost |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Kay

ideology===\n[[File:MFQResultsExample2.jpg|thumb|Results of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire]]\nResearchers have found that people's sensitivities to the five/six moral foundations correlate with their political ideologies. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, Haidt and Graham found that libertarians are most sensitive to the proposed Liberty foundation,<ref name=\"Haidt\" /> liberals are most sensitive to the Care and Fairness foundations, while conservatives are equally sensitive to all five/six foundations.<ref name=\"Graham2011\" />  [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] argued however that liberals tend to emphasise the Care, Fairness and Liberty dimensions; conservatives the Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity dimensions.<ref>R Sapolsky, ''Behave'' (London 2018) p. 450</ref>\n\nAccording to Haidt, the differences have significant implications for political discourse and relations. Because members of two political camps are to a degree blind to one or more of the moral foundations of the others, they may perceive morally driven words or behavior as having another basis\u2014at best self-interested, at worst evil, and thus demonize one another.<ref name=\"Moyers\">{{cite AV media\n | people = Jonathan Haidt, Bill Moyers\n | title = Jonathan Haidt Explains Our Contentious Culture\n | medium = Television production\n | publisher = Public Square Media, Inc.\n | location = Lebanon\n | date = 3 February 2012\n | url = http://billmoyers.com/segment/jonathan-haidt-explains-our-contentious-culture/}}</ref>\n\nHaidt and Graham suggest a compromise can be found to allow liberals and conservatives to see eye-to-eye.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|last2=Graham|first2=Jesse|date=2007-06-01|title=When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions that Liberals may not Recognize|journal=Social Justice Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=98\u2013116|doi=10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z|issn=0885-7466}}</ref> They suggest that the five foundations can be used as \"doorway\" to allow liberals to step to the conservative side of the \"wall\" put up between these two political affiliations on major political issues (i.e. legalizing gay marriage). If liberals try to consider the latter three foundations in addition to the former two (therefore adopting all five foundations like conservatives for a brief amount of time) they could understand where the conservatives' viewpoints stem from and long-lasting political issues could finally be settled.\n\nResearchers postulate that the moral foundations arose as solutions to problems common in the [[Evolutionary psychology|ancestral hunter-gatherer environment]], in particular intertribal and intra-tribal conflict. The three foundations emphasized more by conservatives (Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity) bind groups together for greater strength in intertribal competition while the other two foundations balance those tendencies with concern for individuals within the group. With reduced sensitivity to the group moral foundations, progressives tend to promote a more [[universalist]] morality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sinn | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = M.W. | year = 2017 | title = Replacing the Moral Foundations: An Evolutionary\u2010Coalitional Theory of Liberal\u2010Conservative Differences | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 6| pages = 1043\u20131064 | doi=10.1111/pops.12361}}</ref>\n\n===Cross-cultural differences===\nHaidt's initial field work in Brazil and Philadelphia in 1989,<ref name=\"Haidt1993\" /> and [[Odisha]], India in 1993, showed that moralizing indeed varies among cultures, but less than by social class (e.g. education) and age. Working-class Brazilian children were more likely to consider both taboo violations and infliction of harm to be morally wrong, and universally so. Members of traditional, [[collectivist]] societies, like political conservatives, are more sensitive to violations of the community-related moral foundations.

{"title_page": "ATM card", "text_new": "{{short description|Type of bank card providing access to Automatic Teller Machines}}\n{{Banking |accs/cards}}\nAn '''ATM card''' is a [[payment card]] or dedicated payment card issued by a [[financial institution]] which enables a customer to access [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs). ATM cards are payment card size and style plastic cards with a [[magnetic stripe]] or a plastic [[smart card]] with a [[Integrated circuit|chip]] that contains a uniqumber and some security information such as an expiration date or [[Card Verification Value Code|CVVC]] (CVV). ATM cards are known by a variety of names such as '''bank card''', '''MAC''' (money access card), '''client card''', '''key card''' or '''cash card''', among others. Most payment cards, such as [[Debit card|debit]] and [[credit card]]s can also function as ATM cards, although ATM-only cards are also available. Charge and proprietary cards cannot be used as ATM cards. The use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to a [[Point of sale|POS]] transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. [[Interbank network]]s allow the use of ATM cards at ATMs of private operators and financial institutions other than those of the institution that issued the cards.\n\nATM cards can also be used on improvised ATMs such as \"mini ATMs\", merchants' card terminals that deliver ATM features without any [[cash drawer]].<ref>. Nowadays , even children can keep atm cards as some banks like Kotak Mahindra give atm cards to children as well.[http://www.permatabank.com/service/192/index.html \"Permata Mini ATM\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414085838/http://www.permatabank.com/service/192/index.html |date=2012-04-14 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bri.co.id/JasaLayanan/JasaBank/Ebanking/MiniATMBRI/tabid/303/Default.aspx \"Mini ATM BRI\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230172255/http://www.bri.co.id/JasaLayanan/JasaBank/Ebanking/MiniATMBRI/tabid/303/Default.aspx |date=December 30, 2011 }}</ref> These terminals can also be used as cashless [[scrip]] ATMs by cashing the receipts they issue at the merchant's [[point of sale]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP4p4WZFrZU \"Cashless Scrip ATM Terminals\"]</ref>\n\nThe first ATM cards were issued in 1967 by [[Barclays]] in [[London]].<ref name=\"JW\">Jarunee Wonglimpiyara, ''Strategies of Competition in the Bank Card Business'' (2005), p. 1-3.</ref>\n\n==Dimensions==\nThe size of ATM cards is {{convert|85.60|x|53.98|mm|in|abbr=on}} and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88\u20133.48&nbsp;mm, in accordance with [[ISO/IEC 7810|ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1]], the same size as other payment cards, such as credit, debit and other cards. They also have a printed or embossed [[Payment card number|bank card number]] conforming with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard.\n\n==ATM uses==\nAll ATMs, at a minimum, will permit cash withdrawals of customers of the machine's owner (if a bank-operated machine) and for cards that are affiliated with any ATM network the machine is also affiliated. They will report the amount of the withdrawal and any fees charged by the machine on the receipt. Most banks and credit unions will permit routine account-related banking transactions at the bank's own ATM, including deposits, checking the balance of an account, and transferring money between accounts.\n\nSome ATM cards can also be used at a branch, as identification for in-person transactions.\n\nThe ability to use an ATM card for in-store EFTPOS purchases or refunds is no longer allowed;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} however, if the ATM card is also a [[debit card]], it may be used for a pin-based debit transaction, or a non-pin-based credit-card transaction if the merchant is affiliated with the credit or debit card network of the card's issuer. Banks have long argued with merchants over the fees that can be charged by the bank for such transactions. Despite the fact that ATM cards require a PIN for use, banks have decided to permit the use of a non-PIN based card (debit or credit) for all merchant transactions.\n\nPrior to the development of debit cards, ATM cards also sometimes fulfilled a dual purpose by serving as a [[cheque guarantee card]].\n\nFor other types of transactions through [[telephone banking|telephone]] or [[online banking]], this may be performed with an ATM card without in-person authentication.

ATM cards are payment card size and style plastic cards with a [[magnetic stripe]] or a plastic [[smart card]] with a [[Integrated circuit|chip]] that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiration date or [[Card Verification Value Code|CVVC]] (CVV). ATM cards are known by a variety of names such as '''bank card''', '''MAC''' (money access card), '''client card''', '''key card''' or '''cash card''', among others. Most payment cards, such as [[Debit card|debit]] and [[credit card]]s can also function as ATM cards, although ATM-only cards are also available. Charge and proprietary cards cannot be used as ATM cards. The use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to a [[Point of sale|POS]] transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. [[Interbank network]]s allow the use of ATM cards at ATMs of private operators and financial institutions other than those of the institution that issued the cards.\n\nATM cards can also be used on improvised ATMs such as \"mini ATMs\", merchants' card terminals that deliver ATM features without any [[cash drawer]].<ref>. Nowadays , even children can keep atm cards as some banks like Kotak Mahindra give atm cards to children as well.[http://www.permatabank.com/service/192/index.html \"Permata Mini ATM\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414085838/http://www.permatabank.com/service/192/index.html |date=2012-04-14 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bri.co.id/JasaLayanan/JasaBank/Ebanking/MiniATMBRI/tabid/303/Default.aspx \"Mini ATM BRI\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230172255/http://www.bri.co.id/JasaLayanan/JasaBank/Ebanking/MiniATMBRI/tabid/303/Default.aspx |date=December 30, 2011 }}</ref> These terminals can also be used as cashless [[scrip]] ATMs by cashing the receipts they issue at the merchant's [[point of sale]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP4p4WZFrZU \"Cashless Scrip ATM Terminals\"]</ref>\n\nThe first ATM cards were issued in 1967 by [[Barclays]] in [[London]].<ref name=\"JW\">Jarunee Wonglimpiyara, ''Strategies of Competition in the Bank Card Business'' (2005), p. 1-3.</ref>\n\n==Dimensions==\nThe size of ATM cards is {{convert|85.60|x|53.98|mm|in|abbr=on}} and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88\u20133.48&nbsp;mm, in accordance with [[ISO/IEC 7810|ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1]], the same size as other payment cards, such as credit, debit and other cards. They also have a printed or embossed [[Payment card number|bank card number]] conforming with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard.\n\n==ATM uses==\nAll ATMs, at a minimum, will permit cash withdrawals of customers of the machine's owner (if a bank-operated machine) and for cards that are affiliated with any ATM network the machine is also affiliated. They will report the amount of the withdrawal and any fees charged by the machine on the receipt. Most banks and credit unions will permit routine account-related banking transactions at the bank's own ATM, including deposits, checking the balance of an account, and transferring money between accounts.\n\nSome ATM cards can also be used at a branch, as identification for in-person transactions.\n\nThe ability to use an ATM card for in-store EFTPOS purchases or refunds is no longer allowed;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} however, if the ATM card is also a [[debit card]], it may be used for a pin-based debit transaction, or a non-pin-based credit-card transaction if the merchant is affiliated with the credit or debit card network of the card's issuer. Banks have long argued with merchants over the fees that can be charged by the bank for such transactions. Despite the fact that ATM cards require a PIN for use, banks have decided to permit the use of a non-PIN based card (debit or credit) for all merchant transactions.\n\nPrior to the development of debit cards, ATM cards also sometimes fulfilled a dual purpose by serving as a [[cheque guarantee card]].\n\nFor other types of transactions through [[telephone banking|telephone]] or [[online banking]], this may be performed with an ATM card without in-person authentication. This includes account balance inquiries, [[electronic bill payment]]s, or in some cases, online purchases (see [[Interac#Interac Online|Interac Online]]).\n\n==Card networks==\nIn some banking networks, the two functions of ATM cards and debit cards are combined into a single card, simply called a \"debit card\" or also commonly a \"bank card\".
