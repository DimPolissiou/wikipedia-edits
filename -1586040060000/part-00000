It was designed by [[Eugenius Birch]] and opened in 1866. It was the first pier to be [[listed building|Grade I listed]] in Britain but has become increasingly [[urban decay|derelict]] since its closure in 1975.\n\nThe pier was constructed during a boom in pleasure pier building in the 1860s, and was designed to attract tourists to Brighton. It was the town's second pier, joining the [[Royal Suspension Chain Pier]] of 1823. It was extended in 1893, and a concert hall was added in 1916. The pier reached its peak attendance during this time, with 2 million visitors between 1918 and 1919. Its popularity began to decline after World War II, and concerts were replaced by a funfair and tearoom. A local company took ownership in 1965, but could not meet the increased maintenance cost, and ultimately filed for bankruptcy. They could not find a suitable buyer, so the pier closed in 1975 and subsequently fell into disrepair.\n\nThe [[West Pier Trust]] now owns the pier and has proposed various plans to renovate it. Some schemes have been opposed by local residents and the owners of the nearby [[Brighton Palace Pier|Palace Pier]], who have claimed [[unfair competition]]. The pier gradually collapsed during the early 21st century. Major sections collapsed in late 2002, and two fires in March and May 2003 left little of the original structure. Subsequently, [[English Heritage]] declared it to be beyond repair. Structured demolition took place in 2010 to make way for the observation tower [[i360]]; further structural damage from storms has occurred since.\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[File:Opening of West Pier 1866.jpg|thumb|The opening of West Pier in 1866 from the ''Illustrated London News''.]] \nThe West Pier was constructed during a boom in pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain.{{sfn|Dobraszczyk|2014|p=143}} It was designed by architect [[Eugenius Birch]] as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air.{{sfn|Arscott|2012|p=116}} Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, complaining that the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil the view of the sea from their homes.

It was designed by [[Eugenius Birch]] and opened in 1866. It was the first pier to be [[listed building|Grade I listed]] in Britain but has become increasingly [[urban decay|derelict]] since its closure in 1975.\n\nThe pier was constructed during a boom in pleasure pier building in the 1860s, and was designed to attract tourists to Brighton. It was the town's second pier, joining the [[Royal Suspension Chain Pier]] of 1823. It was extended in 1893, and a concert hall was added in 1916. The pier reached its peak attendance during this time, with 2 million visitors between 1918 and 1919. Its popularity began to decline after World War II, and concerts were replaced by a funfair and tearoom. A local company took ownership in 1965, but could not meet the increased maintenance cost, and ultimately filed for bankruptcy. They could not find a suitable buyer, so the pier closed in 1975 and subsequently fell into disrepair.\n\nThe [[West Pier Trust]] now owns the pier and has proposed various plans to renovate it. Some schemes have been opposed by local residents and the owners of the nearby [[Brighton Palace Pier|Palace Pier]], who have claimed [[unfair competition]]. The pier gradually collapsed during the early 21st century. Major sections collapsed in late 2002, and two fires in March and May 2003 left little of the original structure. Subsequently, [[English Heritage]] declared it to be beyond repair. Structured demolition took place in 2010 to make way for the observation tower [[i360]]; further structural damage from storms has occurred since.\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[File:Opening of West Pier 1866.jpg|thumb|The opening of West Pier in 1866 from the ''Illustrated London News''.]] \nThe West Pier was constructed during a boom in pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain.{{sfn|Dobraszczyk|2014|p=143}} It was designed by architect [[Eugenius Birch]] as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air.{{sfn|Arscott|2012|p=116}} Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, complaining that the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil the view of the sea from their homes.

W. Bush series}}\nThe '''United States Invasion of Panama''', codenamed '''Operation Just Cause''', lasted over a month between mid-December 1989 and late January 1990. It occurred during the administration of President [[George H. W. Bush]] and ten years after the [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]] were ratified to transfer control of the [[Panama Canal]] from the U.S. to Panama by 1 January 2000. During the invasion, ''[[de facto]]'' Panamanian leader, general, and dictator [[Manuel Noriega]], who for a long time worked with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], was deposed citing [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] and drug trafficking. Following the operation, the [[Panama Defense Forces]] was dissolved and President-elect [[Guillermo Endara]] was sworn into office.\n\n== Background ==\nThe United States had maintained numerous military bases and a substantial garrison throughout the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] to protect the American-owned Panama Canal and to maintain American control of this strategically important area. On 7 September 1977, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and the ''de facto'' leader of Panama, General [[Omar Torrijos]], signed Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties, which set in motion the process of handing over the Panama Canal to Panamanian control by 2000. Although the canal was destined for Panamanian administration, the military bases remained and one condition of the transfer was that the canal would remain open for American shipping. The U.S. had long-standing relations with General Noriega, who served as a U.S. intelligence asset and paid informant of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] from 1967, including the period when Bush was head of the CIA (1976\u201377).<ref name=jones>{{cite book |last= Jones |first= Howard |title= Crucible of Power: A History of US Foreign Relations Since 1897 |year= 2001|location= |publisher= |page= 494}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nNoriega had sided with the U.S. rather than the USSR in Central America, notably in sabotaging the forces of the [[Sandinista]] government in Nicaragua, and the revolutionaries of the [[FMLN]] group in [[El Salvador]]. Noriega received upwards of $100,000 per year from the 1960s until the 1980s, when his salary was increased to $200,000 per year.<ref>{{cite book |first= Frederick |last= Kempe |author-link= Frederick Kempe |title= Divorcing the Dictator |url= https://archive.org/details/divorcingdictato00kemp |url-access= registration |location= New York |publisher= Putnam |year= 1990 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/divorcingdictato00kemp/page/26 26]\u201330, 162}}</ref> Although he worked with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] to restrict illegal drug shipments, he was known to simultaneously accept significant financial support from drug dealers,<ref name=jones /> because he facilitated the laundering of drug money, and through Noriega, they received protection from DEA investigations due to his special relationship with the CIA.<ref name=Cockburn>{{cite book |last1= Cockburn |first1= Alexander |last2= St. Clair |first2= Jeffrey |last-author-amp= yes |title= Whiteout: the CIA, Drugs, and the Press |url= https://archive.org/details/whiteoutciadrugs00cock |url-access= registration |location= London |publisher= Verso |year= 1998 |page= }}{{page needed|date= December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, relations between Noriega and the United States began to deteriorate.

In his statement, Bush stated that Noriega had declared that a state of war existed between the U.S. and Panama and that he threatened the lives of the approximately 35,000 U.S. citizens living there. There had been numerous clashes between U.S. and Panamanian forces; one U.S. Marine had been killed a few days earlier.\n* Defending democracy and human rights in Panama.\n* Combatting [[drug trafficking]]. Panama had become a center for drug [[money laundering]] and a transit point for drug trafficking to the U.S. and Europe.\n* Protecting the integrity of the [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]]. Members of Congress and others in the U.S. political establishment claimed that Noriega threatened the neutrality of the Panama Canal and that the U.S. had the right under the treaties to intervene militarily to protect the canal.\n\nU.S. military forces were instructed to begin maneuvers and activities within the restrictions of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, such as ignoring PDF roadblocks and conducting short-notice \"Category Three\" military exercises on security-sensitive targets, with the express goal of provoking PDF soldiers.

U.S. Navy SEALs destroyed Noriega's private jet and a Panamanian gunboat. A Panamanian ambush killed four SEALs and wounded nine. Other military command centers throughout the country were also attacked. The attack on the central headquarters of the PDF (referred to as ''La Comandancia'') touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated ''El Chorrillo'' neighborhood in downtown Panama City. During the firefight at the Comandancia, the PDF downed two special operations helicopters and forced one [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|MH-6 Little Bird]] to crash-land in the Panama Canal.<ref name=\"OJCjcs\"/> The opening round of attacks in Panama City also included a special operations raid on the Carcel Modelo prison (known as [[Operation Acid Gambit]]) to free Kurt Muse, a U.S. citizen convicted of espionage by Noriega.\n\nFort Amador was secured by elements of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, and 59th Engineer Company (sappers) in a nighttime air assault which secured the fort in the early hours of 20 December. Fort Amador was a key position because of its relationship to the large oil farms adjacent to the canal, the [[Bridge of the Americas]] over the canal, and the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal. Key command and control elements of the PDF were stationed there. C Company 1st Battalion (Airborne) 508th PIR was assigned the task of securing La Comandancia. Furthermore, Fort Amador had a large U.S. housing district that needed to be secured to prevent the PDF from taking U.S. citizens as hostages. This position also protected the left flank of the attack on La Comandancia and the securing of the ''El Chorrillos'' neighbourhood, guarded by [[Dignity Battalions]], Noriega supporters that the U.S. forces sometimes referred to as \"Dingbats\". Military police units from Ft. Bragg, North Carolina deployed via strategic airlift into Howard Air Force Base the next morning, and secured key government buildings in the downtown area of Panama City. MPs seized PDF weapons, vehicles and supplies during house-to-house searches in the following days, and conducted urban combat operations against snipers and Dignity Battalion holdouts for the following week.{{cn}}\n\nA few hours after the invasion began, Guillermo Endara was sworn in at Fort Clayton.<ref>{{Cite book |first= John T. |last= Fishel |title= Civil Military Operations in the New World |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |year= 1997}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}</ref> According to The Los Angeles Times, Endara was the \"presumed winner\" in the presidential election which had been scheduled earlier that year.<ref>{{cite news |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 21 December 1989 |title= Combat in Panama, Operation Just Cause |page=A4}}</ref>\n\nA platoon from the [[1138th Military Police Company]], [[Missouri Army National Guard]], which was on a routine two-week rotation to Panama was called upon to set up a detainee camp on Empire Range to handle the mass of civilian and military detainees.

Noriega remained at large for several days, but realizing he had few options in the face of a massive manhunt and a $1 million reward for his capture, he obtained refuge in the [[Holy See|Vatican]] diplomatic mission in Panama City.

By themselves, these ratios suggest that the [[Proportionality (law)#International law|rule of proportionality]] and the duty to minimize harm to civilians, where doing so would not compromise a legitimate military objective, were not faithfully observed by the invading U.S. forces.

In later years, he staged a hunger strike, calling attention to the poverty and homelessness left in the wake of both the Noriega years and the destruction caused by the U.S. invasion.\n\nOn 19 July 1990, a group of 60 companies based in Panama filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in Federal District Court in New York City alleging that the U.S. action against Panama was \"done in a tortuous, careless and negligent manner with disregard for the property of innocent Panamanian residents\". Most of the businesses had insurance, but the insurers either went bankrupt or refused to pay, claiming that acts of war were not covered.<ref>{{cite news |work= The New York Times |date= 21 July 1990 |title= Panama Companies Sue U.S. for Damages}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAbout 20,000 people lost their homes and became refugees as a result of [[urban warfare]].

Hundreds of Panamanians marked the day with a \"black march\" through the streets of Panama City to denounce the U.S. invasion and Endara's economic policies. Protesters echoed claims that 3,000 people were killed as a result of U.S. military action. Since Noriega's ousting, Panama has had four presidential elections, with candidates from opposing parties succeeding each other in the [[Palacio de las Garzas]]. Panama's press, however, is still subject to numerous restrictions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cpj.org/attacks01/americas01/panama.html |title= Attacks on the Press 2001: Panama |publisher= Committee to Protect Journalists}}</ref> On 10 February 1990, the Endara government abolished Panama's military and reformed the security apparatus by creating the [[Panamanian Public Forces]]. In 1994, a constitutional amendment permanently abolished the military of Panama. Concurrent with a severe recession in Latin America throughout the 1990s, Panama's GDP recovered by 1993, but very high unemployment remained a serious problem.\n\nNoriega was brought to the U.S. to stand trial.

W. Bush series}}\nThe '''United States Invasion of Panama''', codenamed '''Operation Just Cause''', lasted over a month between mid-December 1989 and late January 1990. It occurred during the administration of President [[George H. W. Bush]] and ten years after the [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]] were ratified to transfer control of the [[Panama Canal]] from the U.S. to Panama by 1 January 2000. During the invasion, ''[[de facto]]'' Panamanian leader, general, and dictator [[Manuel Noriega]], who for a long time worked with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], was deposed citing [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] and drug trafficking. Following the operation, the [[Panama Defense Forces]] was dissolved and President-elect [[Guillermo Endara]] was sworn into office.\n\n== Background ==\nThe United States had maintained numerous military bases and a substantial garrison throughout the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] to protect the American-owned Panama Canal and to maintain American control of this strategically important area. On September 7, 1977, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and the ''de facto'' leader of Panama, General [[Omar Torrijos]], signed Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties, which set in motion the process of handing over the Panama Canal to Panamanian control by 2000. Although the canal was destined for Panamanian administration, the military bases remained and one condition of the transfer was that the canal would remain open for American shipping. The U.S. had long-standing relations with General Noriega, who served as a U.S. intelligence asset and paid informant of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] from 1967, including the period when Bush was head of the CIA (1976\u201377).<ref name=jones>{{cite book |last= Jones |first= Howard |title= Crucible of Power: A History of US Foreign Relations Since 1897 |year= 2001|location= |publisher= |page= 494}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nNoriega had sided with the U.S. rather than the USSR in Central America, notably in sabotaging the forces of the [[Sandinista]] government in Nicaragua, and the revolutionaries of the [[FMLN]] group in [[El Salvador]]. Noriega received upwards of $100,000 per year from the 1960s until the 1980s, when his salary was increased to $200,000 per year.<ref>{{cite book |first= Frederick |last= Kempe |author-link= Frederick Kempe |title= Divorcing the Dictator |url= https://archive.org/details/divorcingdictato00kemp |url-access= registration |location= New York |publisher= Putnam |year= 1990 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/divorcingdictato00kemp/page/26 26]\u201330, 162}}</ref> Although he worked with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] to restrict illegal drug shipments, he was known to simultaneously accept significant financial support from drug dealers,<ref name=jones /> because he facilitated the laundering of drug money, and through Noriega, they received protection from DEA investigations due to his special relationship with the CIA.<ref name=Cockburn>{{cite book |last1= Cockburn |first1= Alexander |last2= St. Clair |first2= Jeffrey |last-author-amp= yes |title= Whiteout: the CIA, Drugs, and the Press |url= https://archive.org/details/whiteoutciadrugs00cock |url-access= registration |location= London |publisher= Verso |year= 1998 |page= }}{{page needed|date= December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, relations between Noriega and the United States began to deteriorate.

In his statement, Bush stated that Noriega had declared that a state of war existed between the U.S. and Panama and that he threatened the lives of the approximately 35,000 U.S. citizens living there. There had been numerous clashes between U.S. and Panamanian forces; one U.S. Marine had been killed a few days earlier.\n* Defending democracy and human rights in Panama.\n* Combatting [[drug trafficking]]. Panama had become a center for drug [[money laundering]] and a transit point for drug trafficking to the U.S. and Europe.\n* Protecting the integrity of the [[Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties]]. Members of Congress and others in the U.S. political establishment claimed that Noriega threatened the neutrality of the Panama Canal and that the U.S. had the right under the treaties to intervene militarily to protect the canal.\n\nU.S. military forces were instructed to begin maneuvers and activities within the restrictions of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, such as ignoring PDF roadblocks and conducting short-notice \"Category Three\" military exercises on security-sensitive targets, with the express goal of provoking PDF soldiers.

U.S. Navy SEALs destroyed Noriega's private jet and a Panamanian gunboat. A Panamanian ambush killed four SEALs and wounded nine. Other military command centers throughout the country were also attacked. The attack on the central headquarters of the PDF (referred to as ''La Comandancia'') touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated ''El Chorrillo'' neighborhood in downtown Panama City. During the firefight at the Comandancia, the PDF downed two special operations helicopters and forced one [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|MH-6 Little Bird]] to crash-land in the Panama Canal.<ref name=\"OJCjcs\"/> The opening round of attacks in Panama City also included a special operations raid on the Carcel Modelo prison (known as [[Operation Acid Gambit]]) to free Kurt Muse, a U.S. citizen convicted of espionage by Noriega.\n\nFort Amador was secured by elements of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, and 59th Engineer Company (sappers) in a nighttime air assault which secured the fort in the early hours of 20 December. Fort Amador was a key position because of its relationship to the large oil farms adjacent to the canal, the [[Bridge of the Americas]] over the canal, and the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal. Key command and control elements of the PDF were stationed there. C Company 1st Battalion (Airborne) 508th PIR was assigned the task of securing La Comandancia. Furthermore, Fort Amador had a large U.S. housing district that needed to be secured to prevent the PDF from taking U.S. citizens as hostages. This position also protected the left flank of the attack on La Comandancia and the securing of the ''El Chorrillos'' neighbourhood, guarded by [[Dignity Battalions]], Noriega supporters that the U.S. forces sometimes referred to as \"Dingbats\". Military police units from Ft. Bragg, North Carolina deployed via strategic airlift into Howard Air Force Base the next morning, and secured key government buildings in the downtown area of Panama City. MPs seized PDF weapons, vehicles and supplies during house-to-house searches in the following days, and conducted urban combat operations against snipers and Dignity Battalion holdouts for the following week.{{cn}}\n\nA few hours after the invasion began, Guillermo Endara was sworn in at Fort Clayton.<ref>{{Cite book |first= John T. |last= Fishel |title= Civil Military Operations in the New World |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |year= 1997}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}</ref> According to The Los Angeles Times, Endara was the \"presumed winner\" in the presidential election which had been scheduled earlier that year.<ref>{{cite news |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 21 December 1989 |title= Combat in Panama, Operation Just Cause |page=A4}}</ref>\n\nA platoon from the [[1138th Military Police Company]], [[Missouri Army National Guard]], which was on a routine two-week rotation to Panama was called upon to set up a detainee camp on Empire Range to handle the mass of civilian and military detainees.

Noriega remained at large for several days, but realizing he had few options in the face of a massive manhunt and a $1 million reward for his capture, he obtained refuge in the [[Holy See|Vatican]] diplomatic mission in Panama City.

By themselves, these ratios suggest that the [[Proportionality (law)#International law|rule of proportionality]] and the duty to minimize harm to civilians, where doing so would not compromise a legitimate military objective, were not faithfully observed by the invading U.S. forces.

In later years, he staged a hunger strike, calling attention to the poverty and homelessness left in the wake of both the Noriega years and the destruction caused by the U.S. invasion.\n\nOn 19 July 1990, a group of 60 companies based in Panama filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in Federal District Court in New York City alleging that the U.S. action against Panama was \"done in a tortuous, careless and negligent manner with disregard for the property of innocent Panamanian residents\". Most of the businesses had insurance, but the insurers either went bankrupt or refused to pay, claiming that acts of war were not covered.<ref>{{cite news |work= The New York Times |date= 21 July 1990 |title= Panama Companies Sue U.S. for Damages}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAbout 20,000 people lost their homes and became refugees as a result of [[urban warfare]].

Hundreds of Panamanians marked the day with a \"black march\" through the streets of Panama City to denounce the U.S. invasion and Endara's economic policies. Protesters echoed claims that 3,000 people were killed as a result of U.S. military action. Since Noriega's ousting, Panama has had four presidential elections, with candidates from opposing parties succeeding each other in the [[Palacio de las Garzas]]. Panama's press, however, is still subject to numerous restrictions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cpj.org/attacks01/americas01/panama.html |title= Attacks on the Press 2001: Panama |publisher= Committee to Protect Journalists}}</ref> On 10 February 1990, the Endara government abolished Panama's military and reformed the security apparatus by creating the [[Panamanian Public Forces]]. In 1994, a constitutional amendment permanently abolished the military of Panama. Concurrent with a severe recession in Latin America throughout the 1990s, Panama's GDP recovered by 1993, but very high unemployment remained a serious problem.\n\nNoriega was brought to the U.S. to stand trial.

He supported modernization based on foreign loans and close ties with France, but resisted giving the new parliament (the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]) major roles. He was criticised for the [[Khodynka Tragedy]], [[Pogroms in the Russian Empire|antisemitic pogroms]], [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], the violent suppression of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], the repression of political opponents, and his perceived responsibility for defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), which saw the annihilation of the [[Baltic Fleet|Russian Baltic Fleet]] at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], the loss of Russian influence over Manchuria and Korea, and the [[Karafuto Prefecture|Japanese annexation of the south of Sakhalin Island]].\n\nNicholas signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention|Anglo-Russian Entente]] of 1907, which was designed to counter [[German Empire|Germany]]'s attempts to gain influence in the Middle East; it ended [[the Great Game]] of confrontation between Russia and the [[British Empire]]. He supported Serbia and approved the mobilization of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] on 30 July 1914. In response, Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914 and its ally France on 3 August 1914,<ref>{{cite web |title=World War I Declarations |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/ww1declarations.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref> starting [[World War I|the First World War]]. The aristocracy was alarmed at the powerful influence of the despised peasant priest [[Grigori Rasputin]] over the tsar. The severe military losses led to a collapse of morale at the front and at home, leading to the fall of the [[House of Romanov]] in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917. Nicholas abdicated on behalf of himself and his son. With his family he was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks and [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed]] in July 1918.\n\nIn 1981, Nicholas, his wife, and their children were recognized as martyrs by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] in [[New York City]].<ref>A Reader's Guide to Orthodox Icons [http://iconreader.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/the-icons-that-canonized-the-holy-royal-martyrs/ ''The Icons that Canonized the Holy Royal Martyrs'']</ref> After the fall of Communism, the remains of the imperial family were exhumed, identified and re-interred with an elaborate state and church ceremony in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998.

He had five younger siblings: [[Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexander]] (1869\u20131870), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (1871\u20131899), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (1875\u20131960), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (1878\u20131918) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (1882\u20131960). Nicholas often referred to his father nostalgically in letters after Alexander's death in 1894. He was also very close to his mother, as revealed in their published letters to each other.<ref>''The letters of Tsar Nicholas and Empress Marie: being confidential correspondence between Nicholas II, last of the Tsars, and his mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna''. Edward J. Bing (ed.). London: Nicholson and Watson, 1937.</ref>\n\nHis paternal grandparents were [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]] and [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Empress Maria Alexandrovna]] (n\u00e9e Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine). His maternal grandparents were [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. Nicholas was of primarily German and [[Danes|Danish]] descent, his last ethnically [[Russians|Russian]] ancestor being [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia]] (1708\u20131728), daughter of [[Peter the Great]].\n\n[[File:Tsar Nicholas II & King George V.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia with his physically similar cousin, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] (right), wearing German military uniforms in Berlin before the war; 1913]]\nNicholas was related to several monarchs in Europe. His mother's siblings included Kings [[Frederick VIII of Denmark]] and [[George I of Greece]], as well as the United Kingdom's [[Queen Alexandra]] (consort of [[King Edward VII]]). Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]] were all first cousins of [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]]. Nicholas was also a first cousin of both [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud of Norway]], as well as [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X of Denmark]] and [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I of Greece]]. Nicholas and Wilhelm II were in turn second cousins-once-removed, as each descended from [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Frederick William III of Prussia]], as well as third cousins, as they were both great-great-grandsons of [[Tsar Paul I of Russia]]. In addition to being second cousins through descent from [[Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his wife [[Princess Wilhelmine of Baden]], Nicholas and Alexandra were also third cousins-once-removed, as they were both descendants of [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II of Prussia]].\n\nTsar Nicholas II was the first cousin-once-removed of [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich]]. To distinguish between them the Grand Duke was often known within the imperial family as \"Nikolasha\" and \"Nicholas the Tall\", while the Tsar was \"Nicholas the Short\".\n\nIn his childhood, Nicholas, his parents and siblings made annual visits to the Danish royal palaces of [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]] to visit his grandparents, the king and queen. The visits also served as family reunions, as his mother's siblings would also come from the United Kingdom, Germany and Greece with their respective families.<ref>Van Der Kiste, John (2003) ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959'', Sutton Publishing, p. 151</ref> It was there in 1883, that he had a flirtation with one of his British first cousins, [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria]].

Later that year, Nicholas's uncle, [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]], married [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Princess Elizabeth]], daughter of [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his late wife [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]] (who had died in 1878), and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. At the wedding in St. Petersburg, the sixteen-year-old [[Tsarevich]] met with and admired the bride's youngest surviving sister, twelve-year-old [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Princess Alix]]. Those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to St. Petersburg five years later in 1889. Alix had feelings for him in turn. As a devout Lutheran, she was initially reluctant to convert to Russian Orthodoxy in order to marry Nicholas, but later relented.<ref>[[#King1994|King (1994)]] p. 54</ref>\n\nIn 1890 Nicholas, [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|his younger brother George]], and their cousin [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|Prince George of Greece]], set out on a [[Eastern journey of Nicholas II|world tour]], although Grand Duke George fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip. Nicholas visited Egypt, India, Singapore, and Bangkok, receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country. In April 1891, in the city of [[\u014ctsu]], Japan, Nicholas was [[\u014ctsu incident|attacked by a deranged Japanese police officer]]. The incident cut his trip short. Some historians have speculated on how the incident may have later influenced his opinion of Japan and the Japanese.<ref name=\"kowner\"/> Returning overland to St. Petersburg, he was present at the ceremonies in [[Vladivostok]] commemorating the beginning of work on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. In 1893, Nicholas traveled to London on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin [[George V|the Duke of York]] to [[Princess Mary of Teck]]. Queen Victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins, and their appearances confused some at the wedding. During this time, Nicholas had an affair with St. Petersburg ballerina [[Mathilde Kschessinska]].<ref>Kshessinska 1960. ''Dancing in Petersburg''.

Other guests included [[Queen Victoria]], [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Empress Frederick]] (Kaiser Wilhelm's mother and Queen Victoria's eldest daughter), Nicholas's uncle, the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]], and the bride's parents, [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke]] and [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].\n\nOnce in Coburg Nicholas proposed to Alix, but she rejected his proposal, being reluctant to convert to Orthodoxy. But the Kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry Nicholas and to convert, as her sister Elizabeth had voluntarily done in 1892. Thus Nicholas and Alix became officially engaged on 20 April 1894. Nicholas's parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing, as Alix had made poor impressions during her visits to Russia. They gave their consent only when they saw Tsar Alexander's health deteriorating.\n\nThat summer, Nicholas travelled to England to visit both Alix and the Queen. The visit coincided with the birth of [[George V|the Duke]] and [[Mary of Teck|Duchess of York]]'s first child, the future [[King Edward VIII]].

Shortly after he came to the [[throne]], a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns' local assemblies (''[[zemstvos]]'') came to the [[Winter Palace]] proposing court reforms, such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy,<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 20</ref> and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry, in the [[Tver Address]].<ref>Figes, p. 165</ref><ref>Pierre, Andre (1925) ''Journal Intime de Nicholas II'', Paris: Payot, p. 127</ref>\n\nAlthough the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms, Nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an Imperial Family Council by saying to them:\n\n{{quote|... it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country.

Khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near Moscow large enough to hold all of the Moscow citizens.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 1017</ref> Khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches. Before the food and drink was handed out, rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone. As a result, the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon, suffocating in the dirt of the field.<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], pp. 26\u201327</ref> Of the approximate 100,000 in attendance, it is estimated that 1,389 individuals died<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> and roughly 1,300 were injured.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The Khodynka Tragedy was seen as an ill omen and Nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign. The French ambassador's gala was planned for that night. The Tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost, but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with France, particularly the 1894 [[Franco-Russian Alliance]]. Thus Nicholas attended the party; as a result the mourning populace saw Nicholas as frivolous and uncaring.\n\nDuring the autumn after the coronation, Nicholas and Alexandra made a tour of Europe. After making visits to the emperor and empress of Austria-Hungary, the Kaiser of Germany, and Nicholas's Danish grandparents and relatives, Nicholas and Alexandra took possession of their new yacht, the ''[[Russian yacht Standart|Standart]], ''which had been built in Denmark.<ref>[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 420</ref> From there, they made a journey to Scotland to spend some time with Queen Victoria at [[Balmoral Castle]]. While Alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother, Nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle, the Prince of Wales, in bad weather, and was suffering from a bad toothache.<ref>King, Greg (2007) ''Twilight of Splendor: the Court of Queen Victoria in Her Diamond Jubilee Year '', John Wiley & Sons, pp. 173\u2013175</ref>\n\n[[File:Imperial Monogram of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Imperial monogram]]\n\nThe first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. Nicholas allotted money for the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russia exhibition of 1896]]. In 1897 restoration of [[gold standard]] by [[Sergei Witte]], Minister of Finance, completed the series of financial reforms, initiated fifteen years earlier. By 1902 the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was nearing completion; this helped the Russians trade in the Far East but the railway still required huge amounts of work.\n\n===Ecclesiastical affairs===\nNicholas always believed God chose him to be the tsar and therefore the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed. He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances. His old-fashioned belief made for a very stubborn ruler who rejected constitutional limitations on his power. It put the tsar at variance with the emerging political consensus among the Russian elite. It was further belied by the subordinate position of the Church in the bureaucracy. The result was a new distrust between the tsar and the church hierarchy and between those hierarchs and the people. Thereby the tsar's base of support was conflicted.<ref>Sergei L. Firsov,\"Emperor Nicholas II as an Orthodox Tsar\" ''Russian Studies in History'' 50.4 (2012): 79-90.</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the [[canonisation]] of [[Seraphim of Sarov]]. The previous year, it had been suggested that if he were canonised, the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne. While Alexandra demanded in July 1902 that Seraphim be canonised in less than a week, Nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year. Despite a public outcry, the Church bowed to the intense imperial pressure, declaring Seraphim worthy of canonisation in January 1903. That summer, the imperial family travelled to Sarov for the canonisation.<ref>[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 137</ref>\n\n===Initiatives in foreign affairs===\n\nAccording to his biographer:\n: His tolerance if not preference for charlatans and adventurers extended to grave matters of external policy, and his vacillating conduct and erratic decisions aroused misgivings and occasional alarm among his more conventional advisers. The foreign ministry itself was not a bastion of diplomatic expertise. Patronage and \"connections\" were the keys to appointment and promotion.<ref>Robert D.

This conference, suggested and promoted by Nicholas II, was convened with the view of terminating the [[arms race]], and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

Russia had expanded in the Far East, and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions, as its southward path to the [[Balkans]] was frustrated, conflicted with Japan's own territorial ambitions on the Chinese and Asian mainland.

The United Kingdom would not allow the Russian navy to use the [[Suez Canal]], due to [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|its alliance]] with the Empire of Japan, and due to the [[Dogger Bank incident]] where the Baltic Fleet mistakenly fired on British fishing boats in the North Sea. The Russian [[Baltic Fleet]] traversed the world to lift the blockade on Port Arthur, but after many misadventures on the way, was nearly annihilated by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Tsushima|Battle of the Tsushima Strait]].<ref name=\"Kowner\" /> On land the [[Imperial Russian Army]] experienced logistical problems.

Nicholas's mother, as well as his cousin [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]], urged Nicholas to negotiate for peace.

He saw the war as an easy god-given victory that would raise Russian morale and patriotism. He ignored the financial repercussions of a long-distance war.<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 67</ref> Rotem Kowner, argues that during his visit to Japan in 1891, where Nicholas was [[\u014ctsu incident|attacked]] by a Japanese policeman, he regarded the Japanese as small of stature, feminine, weak, and inferior.

Despite the onset of the war and the many defeats Russia suffered, Nicholas still believed in, and expected, a final victory, maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the Japanese.<ref>Kowner (1998)</ref> Throughout the war, the tsar demonstrated total confidence in Russia's ultimate triumph. His advisors never gave him a clear picture of Russia's weaknesses. Despite the continuous military disasters Nicholas believed victory was near at hand. Losing his navy at Tsushima finally persuaded him to agree to peace negotiations. Even then he insisted on the option of reopening hostilities if peace conditions were unfavorable. He forbade his chief negotiator Count Witte to agree to either indemnity payments or loss of territory. Nicholas remained adamantly opposed to any concessions. Peace was made, but Witte did so by disobeying the tsar and ceding southern Sakhalin to Japan.<ref>Raymond A.

On Saturday, 8 (21) January, the ministers convened to consider the situation.

In the [[October Manifesto]], the Tsar pledged to introduce basic [[civil liberties]], provide for broad participation in the State Duma, and endow the Duma with legislative and oversight powers. He was determined, however, to preserve his [[autocracy]] even in the context of reform. This was signalled in the text of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|1906 constitution]]. He was described as the supreme autocrat, and retained sweeping executive powers, also in church affairs. His cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere with nor assist one another; they were responsible only to him.\n\nNicholas's relations with the Duma were poor. The [[First Duma]], with a majority of [[Constitutional Democratic party|Kadets]], almost immediately came into conflict with him. Scarcely had the 524 members sat down at the [[Tauride Palace]] when they formulated an 'Address to the Throne'. It demanded [[universal suffrage]], radical land reform, the release of all [[political prisoner]]s and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the Tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the Duma.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 243</ref> Grand Duchess Olga, Nicholas's sister, later wrote:\n\n{{quote|There was such gloom at Tsarskoye Selo. I did not understand anything about politics. I just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us. The October Constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone. I went with my mother to the first Duma. I remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people. The peasants looked sullen. But the workmen were worse: they looked as though they hated us. I remember the distress in [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alicky]]'s eyes.<ref name=\"vorres121\" />}}\n\nMinister of the Court Count [[Vladimir Frederiks]] commented, \"The Deputies, they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats.

The Duma was populated with [[Political radicalism|radicals]], many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership, among other things. Witte, unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming Russia and the monarchy, wrote to Nicholas on 14 April 1906 resigning his office (however, other accounts have said that Witte was forced to resign by the Emperor). Nicholas was not ungracious to Witte and an Imperial Rescript was published on 22 April creating Witte a Knight of the [[Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky]] with diamonds (the last two words were written in the Emperor's own hand, followed by \"I remain unalterably well-disposed to you and sincerely grateful, for ever more Nicholas.\").\n\nA second Duma met for the first time in February 1907. The [[leftist]] parties\u2014including the [[Social Democrats]] and the Social Revolutionaries, who had boycotted the First Duma\u2014had won 200 seats in the Second, more than a third of the membership. Again Nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the Duma. In two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow:\n\n{{quote|A grotesque deputation is coming from England to see liberal members of the Duma. [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Uncle Bertie]] informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming. Their famous \"liberty\", of course.

Every word spoken, however, comes out in the next day's papers which are avidly read by everyone. In many places the populace is getting restive again.

Stolypin, a skilful politician, had ambitious plans for reform. These included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land, with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown. Nevertheless, when the Duma remained hostile, Stolypin had no qualms about invoking Article 87 of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|Fundamental Laws]], which empowered the Tsar to issue 'urgent and extraordinary' emergency decrees 'during the recess of the State Duma'. Stolypin's most famous legislative act, the change in peasant land tenure, was promulgated under Article 87.<ref name=\"massie245\" />\n\nThe third Duma remained an independent body. This time the members proceeded cautiously. Instead of hurling themselves at the government, opposing parties within the Duma worked to develop the body as a whole. In the classic manner of the British Parliament, the Duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings. The Duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures. These sessions, endorsed by Stolypin, were educational for both sides, and, in time, mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect. Even the sensitive area of military expenditure, where the October Manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne, a Duma commission began to operate. Composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than Nicholas to restore the fallen honour of Russian arms, the Duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed.\n\nWith the passage of time, Nicholas also began to have confidence in the Duma. \"This Duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it,\" he said to Stolypin in 1909.<ref name=\"massie246\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 246</ref> Nevertheless, Stolypin's plans were undercut by conservatives at court. Although the tsar at first supported him, he finally sided with the arch critics.<ref>Mikhail F. Florinskii, \"Nicholas II and Stolypin's Cabinet\" ''Russian Social Science Review'' 53.4 (2012): 4-14.</ref> Reactionaries such as Prince [[Vladimir Nikolayevich Orlov]] never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the Duma was a blot on the autocracy. Stolypin, they whispered, was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the Duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the Tsar by God. Witte also engaged in constant intrigue against Stolypin. Although Stolypin had had nothing to do with Witte's fall, Witte blamed him. Stolypin had unwittingly angered the Tsaritsa. He had ordered an investigation into Rasputin and presented it to the Tsar, who read it but did nothing. Stolypin, on his own authority, ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg. Alexandra protested vehemently but Nicholas refused to overrule his Prime Minister,<ref name=\"massie247\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 247.</ref> who had more influence with the Emperor.\n\nBy the time of Stolypin's assassination in September 1911, Stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office. For a man who preferred clear decisive action, working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating. As an example, Nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note:\n\n{{quote|Despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter, an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that I do not accept responsibility for it. So far my conscience has not deceived me. Therefore I intend in this case to follow its dictates. I know that you, too, believe that \"a Tsar's heart is in God's hands.\" Let it be so. For all laws established by me I bear a great responsibility before God, and I am ready to answer for my decision at any time.<ref name=\"massie247\" />}}\n\n[[File:Rasputin PA.jpg|thumb|[[Grigori Rasputin]]]]\n\nAlexandra, believing that Stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life, hated the Prime Minister.<ref name=\"massie247\" /> In March 1911, in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence, Stolypin asked to be relieved of his office. Two years earlier when Stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to Nicholas he was informed: \"This is not a question of confidence or lack of it. It is my will. Remember that we live in Russia, not abroad...and therefore I shall not consider the possibility of any resignation.\"<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 248</ref> He was assassinated in September 1911.\n\nIn 1912, a fourth Duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third. \"The Duma started too fast. Now it is slower, but better, and more lasting,\" stated Nicholas to Sir [[Bernard Pares]].<ref name=\"massie246\" />\n\nThe [[World War I|First World War]] developed badly for Russia. By late 1916, Romanov family desperation reached the point that [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]], younger brother of Alexander III and the Tsar's only surviving uncle, was deputed to beg Nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the Duma. Nicholas sternly and adamantly refused, reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors. In the Duma on 2 December 1916, Vladimir Purishkevich, a fervent patriot, monarchist and war worker, denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous two-hour speech which was tumultuously applauded. \"Revolution threatens,\" he warned, \"and an obscure peasant shall govern Russia no longer!\"<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 49.</ref>\n\n===Tsarevich Alexei's illness and Rasputin===\n[[File:Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.jpg|left|thumb|Alexei in 1913]]\n\nFurther complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession. Alexandra bore Nicholas four daughters, [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Olga]] in 1895, [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Tatiana]] in 1897, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria]] in 1899, and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] in 1901, before their son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei]] was born on 12 August 1904. The young heir was afflicted with [[Haemophilia B]], a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly, which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death. As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Alexandra carried the same [[gene mutation]] that afflicted several of the major European royal houses, such as [[Prussia]] and Spain. Hemophilia, therefore, became known as \"[[Haemophilia in European royalty|the royal disease]]\". Through Alexandra, the disease had passed on to her son. As all of Nicholas and Alexandra's daughters were murdered with their parents and brother in Yekaterinburg in 1918, it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as [[genetic carrier|carriers]].\n\nBefore Rasputin's arrival, the tsarina and the tsar had consulted numerous mystics, charlatans, \"holy fools,\" and miracle workers. The royal behavior was not some odd aberration, but a deliberate retreat from the secular social and economic forces of his time - an act of faith and vote of confidence in a spiritual past. They had set themselves up for the greatest spiritual advisor and manipulator in Russian history.<ref>Robert D. Warth,\"Before Rasputin: Piety and the Occult at the Court of Nicholas II.\" ''Historian'' 47.3 (1985): 323-337.</ref>\n\nBecause of the fragility of the autocracy at this time, Nicholas and Alexandra chose to keep secret Alexei's condition. Even within the household, many were unaware of the exact nature of the Tsarevich's illness. At first Alexandra turned to Russian doctors and medics to treat Alexei; however, their treatments generally failed, and Alexandra increasingly turned to [[mysticism|mystic]]s and holy men (or ''[[starets]]'' as they were called in Russian). One of these starets, an illiterate Siberian named [[Grigori Rasputin]], gained amazing success. Rasputin's influence over Empress Alexandra, and consequently the Tsar himself, grew even stronger after 1912 when the Tsarevich nearly died from an injury. His bleeding grew steadily worse as doctors despaired, and priests administered the [[last rites|Last Sacrament]]. In desperation, Alexandra called upon Rasputin, to which he replied, \"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.\"<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 185</ref> The haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover. Alexandra took this as a sign that Rasputin was a ''starets'' and that God was with him; for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him.\n\n===European affairs===\n[[File:Nicholas II and Alexei in Reval 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II and his son Alexei aboard the Imperial yacht ''[[Russian yacht Standart|Standart]]'', during King [[Edward VII]]'s state visit to Russia in [[Tallinn|Reval]], 1908]]\n\nIn 1907, to end longstanding controversies over central Asia, Russia and the United Kingdom signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907|Anglo-Russian Convention]] that resolved most of the problems generated for decades by [[The Great Game]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Klein, Ira |title=The Anglo-Russian Convention and the Problem of Central Asia, 1907\u20131914|journal=Journal of British Studies|year=1971|volume=11|issue=1|pages=126\u2013147 |jstor=175041|doi=10.1086/385621}}</ref> The UK had already entered into the [[Entente cordiale]] with France in 1904, and the Anglo-Russian convention led to the formation of the [[Triple Entente]]. The following year, in May 1908, Nicholas and Alexandra's shared \"Uncle Bertie\" and \"Aunt Alix,\" Britain's King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, made a state visit to Russia, being the first reigning British monarchs to do so. However, they did not set foot on Russian soil. Instead, they stayed aboard their yachts, meeting off the coast of modern-day [[Tallinn]]. Later that year, Nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister, [[Alexander Izvolsky]], had entered into a secret agreement with the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, [[Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Count Alois von Aehrenthal]], agreeing that, in exchange for Russian naval access to the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus Strait]], Russia would not oppose the Austrian annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a revision of the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. When Austria-Hungary did annex this territory that October, it precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis|diplomatic crisis]]. When Russia protested about the annexation, the Austrians threatened to leak secret communications between Izvolsky and Aehernthal, prompting Nicholas to complain in a letter to the Austrian emperor, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], about a breach of confidence. In 1909, in the wake of the Anglo-Russian convention, the Russian imperial family made a visit to England, staying on the [[Isle of Wight]] for [[Cowes Week]]. In 1913, during the [[Balkan War (1912\u201313)|Balkan Wars]], Nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between Serbia and Bulgaria. However, the Bulgarians rejected his offer. Also in 1913, Nicholas, albeit without Alexandra, made a visit to Berlin for the wedding of Kaiser Wilhelm II's daughter, [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Princess Victoria Louise]], to a maternal cousin of Nicholas, [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Ernest Augustus, the Duke of Brunswick]].<ref>Clay, Catarine (2006) ''King, Kaiser, Tsar: Three Royal Cousins Who Led the World to War'', Walker & Company, {{ISBN|0802716237}}, pp. 300\u2013301</ref> Nicholas was also joined by his cousin, [[King George V]] and his wife, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].\n\n===Tercentenary===\n{{Main|Romanov Tercentenary}}\nIn February 1913, Nicholas presided over the [[Romanov Tercentenary|tercentenary celebrations for the Romanov Dynasty]].

The outbreak of war was not inevitable, but leaders, diplomats and nineteenth-century alliances created a climate for large-scale conflict. The concept of [[Pan-Slavism]] and shared religion created strong public sympathy between Russia and Serbia. Territorial conflict created rivalries between [[German Empire|Germany]] and France and between Austria-Hungary and [[Serbia]], and as a consequence alliance networks developed across Europe. The [[Triple Entente]] and [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] networks were set before the war. Nicholas wanted neither to abandon Serbia to the ultimatum of Austria, nor to provoke a general war. In a series of letters exchanged with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]] of Germany (the \"[[Willy\u2013Nicky correspondence]]\") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against Austria-Hungary, in the hopes of preventing war with Germany.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R43302, Kaiser Wilhelm II. und Zar Nikolaus II..jpg|thumb|Nicholas II (right) with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany in 1905.

On 29 July 1914, Nicholas sent a telegram to Wilhelm with the suggestion to submit the Austro-Serbian problem to the [[Hague Conference]] (in [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|Hague tribunal]]).

Less than a week later, on 6 August, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] signed the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Russia.\n\nThe outbreak of war on 1 August 1914 found Russia grossly unprepared. Russia and her allies placed their faith in her army, the famous 'Russian steamroller'.<ref name=\"tames42\">[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 42</ref> Its pre-war regular strength was 1,400,000; mobilization added 3,100,000 reserves and millions more stood ready behind them. In every other respect, however, Russia was unprepared for war. Germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile, and whereas Russian soldiers travelled an average of {{convert|1290|km|mi|-1}} to reach the front, German soldiers traveled less than a quarter of that distance. Russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the Tsar could raise, and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small; while the German army in 1914 was better equipped than any other, man-for-man, the Russians were severely short on artillery pieces, shells, motorized transports, and even boots. With the Baltic Sea barred by German U-boats and the Dardanelles by the guns of Germany's ally, the [[Ottoman Empire]], Russia initially could receive help only via [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], which was frozen solid in winter, or via [[Vladivostok]], which was over {{convert|6400|km|mi}} from the front line. By 1915, a rail line was built north from [[Petrozavodsk]] to the Kola Gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the ice-free port of what eventually was called [[Murmansk]]. The Russian High Command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov]], the Minister of War, and the incompetent Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field.<ref>Paul Robinson, Paul. \"A Study of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich as Supreme Commander of the Russian Army, 1914\u20131915.\" ''Historian'' 75.3 (2013): 475-498. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24456116 online]</ref> In spite of all of this, an immediate attack was ordered against the German province of [[East Prussia]]. The Germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two Russian armies which had invaded. The [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], where an entire Russian army was annihilated, cast an ominous shadow over Russia's future. Russia had great success against both the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman armies from the very beginning of the war, but they never succeeded against the might of the German Army. In September 1914, in order to relieve pressure on France, the Russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against Austria-Hungary in Galicia in order to attack German-held Silesia.<ref>Massie, Robert K.

General Denikin, retreating from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] wrote, \"The German heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches, and their defenders with them. We hardly replied. There was nothing with which we could reply. Our regiments, although completely exhausted, were beating off one attack after another by bayonet ...

At first, the targets were German, and for three days in June shops, bakeries, factories, private houses and country estates belonging to people with German names were looted and burned.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. The inflamed mobs then turned on the government, declaring the Empress should be shut up in a convent, the Tsar deposed and Rasputin hanged. Nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents. An emergency session of the Duma was summoned and a Special Defense Council established, its members drawn from the Duma and the Tsar's ministers.\n\nIn July 1915, King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] of [[Denmark]], first cousin of the Tsar, sent [[Hans Niels Andersen]] to Tsarskoye Selo with an offer to act as a mediator. He made several trips between London, Berlin and Petrograd and in July saw the Dowager Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]]. Andersen told her they should conclude peace. Nicholas chose to turn down King Christian's offer of mediation, as he felt it would be a betrayal for Russia to form a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers when its allies Britain and France were still fighting.<ref>Hall, C (2006) ''Little Mother of Russia'', Holmes and Meier, {{ISBN|0841914222}}, p. 264</ref>\n\nThe energetic and efficient General [[Alexei Polivanov]] replaced Sukhomlinov as [[Minister of War]], which failed to improve the strategic situation.<ref name=\"tames42\" /> In the aftermath of the [[Great Retreat (Russia)|Great Retreat]] and the loss of the Kingdom of [[Poland]], Nicholas assumed the role of commander-in-chief after dismissing his cousin, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich, in September 1915. This was a mistake, as the Tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front. He was also away at the remote HQ at [[Mogilev]], far from the direct governance of the empire, and when revolution broke out in [[Petrograd]] he was unable to halt it. In reality the move was largely symbolic, since all important military decisions were made by his chief-of-staff General [[Michael Alexeiev]], and Nicholas did little more than review troops, inspect [[field hospital]]s, and preside over military luncheons.<ref>King, Greg and Wilson, Penny (2003) ''The Fate of the Romanovs'', John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|0471207683}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nicholas II with his family in Yevpatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II with his family in [[Yevpatoria]], [[Crimea]], May 1916]]\n\nThe Duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war. Cut off from public opinion, Nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering. With Nicholas at the front, domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife Alexandra. However, Alexandra's relationship with [[Grigori Rasputin]], and her German background, further discredited the dynasty's authority. Nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of Rasputin but had failed to remove him. Rumors and accusations about Alexandra and Rasputin appeared one after another; Alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards Germany. Anger at Nicholas's failure to act and the extreme damage that Rasputin's influence was doing to Russia's war effort and to the monarchy led to Rasputin's eventual murder by a group of nobles, led by Prince [[Felix Yusupov]] and [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], a cousin of the Tsar, in the early morning of Saturday 17 December 1916 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) / 30 December 1916 ([[New Style|N.S.]]).\n\n===Collapse===\n[[File:\u0417\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e. \u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0432. 1 \u0430\u043f\u0440.1916.jpg|thumb|right|Nicholas with members of the Stavka at Mogilev in April 1916.]]\nAs the government failed to produce supplies, mounting hardship resulted in massive riots and rebellions. With Nicholas away at the front from 1915 through 1916, authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering soldiers. Despite efforts by the British Ambassador [[George Buchanan (diplomat)|Sir George Buchanan]] to warn the Tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution, Nicholas continued to bury himself away at the Staff HQ ([[Stavka]]) {{convert|600|km|mi|-2}} away at [[Mogilev|Moghilev]], leaving his capital and court open to intrigues and insurrection.<ref name=\"tames52\">[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 52</ref>\n\nIdeologically the tsar's greatest support came from the right-wing monarchists, who had recently gained strength. However they were increasingly alienated by the tsar's support of Stolypin's Westernizing reforms, by tsar's liberal reforms taken early in the Revolution of 1905, and especially by the political power the tsar had bestowed on Rasputin.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11693/49114/Monarchists_Against_Their_Monarch_the_Rightists'_Criticism_of_Tsar_Nicholas_II.pdf?sequence=1|jstor=24657737|title=Monarchists Against Their Monarch: The Rightists' Criticism of Tsar Nicholas Ii|journal=Russian History|volume=31|issue=1/2|pages=105\u2013120|last1=Podbolotov|first1=Sergei|year=2004|doi=10.1163/187633104X00043|hdl=11693/49114}}</ref>\n\nBy early 1917, Russia was on the verge of total collapse of morale.

The army had taken 15 million men from the farms and food prices had soared. An egg cost four times what it had in 1914, butter five times as much. The severe winter dealt the railways, overburdened by emergency shipments of coal and supplies, a crippling blow.<ref name=\"tames52\" />\n\nRussia entered the war with 20,000 locomotives; by 1917, 9,000 were in service, while the number of serviceable railway wagons had dwindled from half a million to 170,000. In February 1917, 1,200 locomotives burst their boilers and nearly 60,000 wagons were immobilized. In Petrograd, supplies of flour and fuel had all but disappeared.<ref name=\"tames52\" /> War-time [[prohibition of alcohol]] was enacted by Nicholas to boost patriotism and productivity, but instead damaged the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 199</ref>\n\nOn 23 February 1917 in Petrograd, a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities. In the streets, red banners appeared and the crowds chanted \"Down with the German woman! Down with [[Alexander Protopopov|Protopopov]]! Down with the war! Down with the Tsar!\"<ref name=\"tames52\" />\n\nPolice started to shoot at the populace from rooftops, which incited riots. The troops in the capital were poorly motivated and their officers had no reason to be loyal to the regime. They were angry and full of revolutionary fervor and sided with the populace.<ref name=\"tames53\">[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 53</ref>\n\nThe Tsar's Cabinet begged Nicholas to return to the capital and offered to resign completely. The Tsar, 800 kilometres (500&nbsp;mi) away, was misinformed by the Minister of the Interior, [[Alexander Protopopov]], that the situation was under control, and he ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators. For this task, the Petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable. The cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in [[Poland]] and Galicia. In Petrograd, 170,000 recruits, country boys or older men from the working-class suburbs of the capital itself, remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies. The units in the capital, although many bore the names of famous Imperial Guard regiments, were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments, the regular units being away at the front. Many units, lacking both officers and rifles, had never undergone formal training.<ref name=\"tames53\" />\n\nGeneral Khabalov attempted to put the Tsar's instructions into effect on the morning of Sunday, 11 March 1917. Despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets, vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some 200 had been shot dead, though a company of the [[Volinsky Regiment]] fired into the air rather than into the mob, and a company of the [[Pavlovsky Regiment|Pavlovsky Life Guards]] shot the officer who gave the command to open fire. Nicholas, informed of the situation by Rodzianko, ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the Duma.<ref name=\"tames53\" /> However, it was too late.\n\nOn 12 March, the [[Volinsky Regiment]] mutinied and was quickly followed by the [[Semenovsky Regiment|Semenovsky]], the [[Izmaylovsky Regiment|Ismailovsky]], the [[:fr:R\u00e9giment de la Garde Litovski|Litovsky Life Guards]] and even the legendary [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] of the Imperial Guard, the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. The arsenal was pillaged, the Ministry of the Interior, Military Government building, police headquarters, the Law Courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch. By noon, the fortress of Peter and Paul, with its heavy artillery, was in the hands of the insurgents. By nightfall, 60,000 soldiers had joined the revolution.<ref name=\"tames53\" />\n\nOrder broke down and members of the Duma and the [[Soviet (council)#Russian Revolution|Soviet]] formed a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] to try to restore order. They issued a demand that Nicholas must abdicate.

He first abdicated in favor of Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that Alexei would not live long enough while separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile. Nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], as the next Emperor of all the Russians. He issued a statement but it was suppressed by the Provisional Government. Michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a Constituent Assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic. The abdication of Nicholas II and Michael's deferment of accepting the throne brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty's rule to an end. The fall of [[Tsarist autocracy]] brought joy to liberals and socialists in Britain and France. The United States was the [[Russian Provisional Government#World recognition|first foreign government]] to recognize the Provisional government. In Russia, the announcement of the Tsar's abdication was greeted with many emotions, including delight, relief, fear, anger and confusion.<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 55</ref>\n\n===Possibility of exile===\nBoth the Provisional Government and Nicholas wanted the royal family to go into exile following his abdication, with the United Kingdom being the preferred option.<ref>Service 2018, p. 49</ref> The British government reluctantly offered the family [[Right of asylum|asylum]] on 19 March 1917, although it was suggested that it would be better for the Romanovs to go to a neutral country.

The Provisional Government only remained in power through an uneasy alliance with the [[Petrograd Soviet]], an arrangement known as \"The [[Dual power|Dual Power]]\". An initial plan to send the royal family to the northern port of [[Murmansk]] had to be abandoned when it was realised that the railway workers and the soldiers guarding them were loyal to the Petrograd Soviet, which opposed the escape of the tsar; a later proposal to send the Romanovs to a neutral port in the [[Baltic Sea]] via the [[Duchy of Finland]] faced similar difficulties.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 51-52 and pp. 68-69</ref>\n\n===Imprisonment===\n[[File:Nikolaus II.

In October 1917, however, the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power from Kerensky's Provisional Government; Nicholas followed the events in October with interest but not yet with alarm. [[Boris Soloviev]], the husband of [[Maria Rasputin]], attempted to organize a rescue with monarchical factions, but it came to nothing. Rumors persist that Soloviev was working for the Bolsheviks or the Germans, or both.<ref>Massie, K.

In the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with reading books, exercising and playing games; Nicholas particularly enjoyed chopping firewood.<ref>Service 2018, p. 150</ref> However, in January 1918, the guard detachment's committee grew more assertive, restricting the hours that the family could spend in the grounds and banning them from walking to church on a Sunday as they had done since October.<ref>Service 2018, p. 125</ref> In a later incident, the soldiers tore the [[epaulette]]s from Kobylinsky's uniform, and he asked Nicholas not to wear his uniform outside for fear of provoking a similar event.<ref>Service 2018, p. 157</ref>\n\nIn February 1918, the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (abbreviated to \"Sovnarkom\") in Moscow, the new capital, announced that the state subsidy for the family would be drastically reduced, starting on 1 March. This meant parting with twelve devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries, even though Nicholas added to the funds from his own resources.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 128-129</ref> Nicholas and Alexandra were appalled by news of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], whereby Russia agreed to give up Poland, Finland, the Baltic States, most of Belarus, the Ukraine, the Crimea, most of the Caucasus, and small parts of Russia proper including areas around [[Pskov]] and [[Rostov-on-Don]].<ref>Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 493-494</ref> What kept the family's spirits up was the belief that help was at hand.<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 62.</ref> The Romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety. The Western Allies lost interest in the fate of the Romanovs after Russia left the war.

The result was that Sovnarkom appointed their own [[commissar]] to take charge of Tobolsk and remove the Romanovs to Yekaterinburg, with the intention of eventually bringing Nicholas to a [[show trial]] in Moscow.<ref>Service 2018, p. 152-153</ref> The man selected was [[Vasily Yakovlev]], a veteran Bolshevik,<ref>Service 2018, p. 158</ref> Recruiting a body of loyal men ''en route'', Yakovlev arrived in Tobolsk on 22 April; he imposed his authority on the competing Red Guards factions, paid-off and [[Demobilization|demobilized]] the guard detachment, and placed further restrictions on the Romanovs.<ref>Service 2018, p. 160-161</ref> The next day, Yakovlev informed Kobylinsky that Nicholas was to be transferred to Yekaterinburg.

According to the account of Bolshevik officer [[Yakov Yurovsky]] (the chief executioner), in the early hours of 17 July 1918, the royal family was awakened around 2:00 am, got dressed, and were led down into a half-basement room at the back of the Ipatiev house. The pretext for this move was the family's safety, i.e. that anti-Bolshevik forces were approaching Yekaterinburg, and the house might be fired upon.<ref name=\"Nicholas 1998\">''Nicholas & Alexandra \u2013 The Last Imperial Family of Tsarist Russia'', Booth-Clibborn Editions, 1998, {{ISBN|1861540388}}</ref>\n\nPresent with Nicholas, Alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants, who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family: the Tsar's personal physician [[Eugene Botkin]], his wife's maid [[Anna Demidova]], and the family's chef, [[Ivan Kharitonov]], and footman, [[Alexei Trupp]].

When the family arrived in the basement, the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit on. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in, and when the empress and the heir were seated, the executioners filed into the room. Yurovsky announced to them that the Ural Soviet of Workers' Deputies had decided to execute them. A stunned Nicholas asked, \"What? What did you say?\" and turned toward his family. Yurovsky quickly repeated the order and Nicholas said, according to [[Peter Ermakov]], \"You know not what you do.\"\n\nThe executioners drew handguns and began shooting; Nicholas was the first to die. Yurovsky took credit afterwards for firing the first shot that killed the Tsar, but his protege \u2013 [[Grigory Petrovich Nikulin|Grigory Nikulin]] \u2013 said years later that Mikhail Medvedev had fired the shot that killed Nicholas. \"He fired the first shot.

On 14 August 2000, they were recognised by the [[synod]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. This time they were not named as martyrs, since their deaths did not result immediately from their Christian faith; instead, they were canonized as [[passion bearer]]s. According to a statement by the Moscow synod, they were glorified as saints for the following reasons:\n\n{{quote|In the last Orthodox Russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the Gospel. In the suffering borne by the Royal Family in prison with humility, patience, and meekness, and in their martyrs' deaths in Yekaterinburg in the night of 17 July 1918 was revealed the light of the faith of Christ that conquers evil.}}\n\nHowever, Nicholas' canonization was controversial. The Russian Orthodox Church Abroad was split on the issue back in 1981, some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the Bolsheviks. It was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the Russian Orthodox Church has nothing to do with the martyr's personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed.<ref name=\"Massie\">[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church inside Russia rejected the family's classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith. Religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the Tsar's family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife, children and servants. For these opponents, the fact that the Tsar was, in private life, a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of Russia.<ref name=\"Massie\" />\n\nDespite the original opposition, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] inside Russia ultimately recognised the family as \"passion bearers,\" or people who met their deaths with Christian humility. Since the [[Late 20th Century|late 20th century]], believers have attributed healing from illnesses or conversion to the Orthodox Church to their prayers to the children of Nicholas Maria and Alexei, as well as to the rest of the family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.serfes.org/royal/miracleofmaria.htm|title=''Miracle of the Child Martyr Grand Duchess Maria''|last=Serfes, Demetrios|first=|date=|year=2000|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.serfes.org/royal/miracleprayers.htm|title=A Miracle Through the Prayers of Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarevich Alexis|last=Serfes, Demetrios|first=|date=|year=2000|website=The Royal Martyrs of Russia|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=6 February 2007|access-date=25 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHistorian Raymond Esthus states:\n: The contemporary assessments of Nicholas are remarkably uniform. He was described as shy, charming, gentle in disposition, fearful of controversy, indecisive, indulgent to his relatives, and deeply devoted to his family. Aleksandr Mosolov, who headed his Court Chancellery for sixteen years, wrote that Nicholas, though intelligent and well-educated, never adopted a definite, energetic attitude and loathed making a decision in the presence of others. Sergei Witte, who served Nicholas and his father for eleven years as Minister of Finance, commented that the Tsar was a well-intentioned child, but his actions were entirely dependent upon the character of his counselors, most of whom were bad.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Esthus, Raymond A. |title=Nicholas II and the Russo-Japanese War|journal=Russian Review|volume=40|issue=4|year=1981|pages=396\u2013411|jstor=129919|doi=10.2307/129919}}</ref>\n\nNicholas generally was considered for the most of the 20st century to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous Russian Empire,<ref>Ferro, Marc (1995) ''Nicholas II: Last of the Tsars''.

Historians admit that Nicholas was a \"good man\"\u2014the historical evidence of personal charm, gentleness, love of family, deep religious faith and strong Russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied\u2014but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant; what matters is that Nicholas was a bad tsar&nbsp;.... Essentially, the tragedy of Nicholas II was that he appeared in the wrong place in history.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] pp. viii\u2013x.</ref>}}\n\nIn Russia, just after the rise of [[Soviet Union|the new regime]], the legacy of Nicholas II faced widespread criticism. Pavel Bykov, who in Russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the Tsar for the [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|newly-formed Soviet propaganda's regime]], denounced Nicholas as a \"tyrant, who paid with his life for the age-old repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the Russian people, over the impoverished and blood-soaked country\". Soviet-era historians noted that Nicholas II was not fit to be a statesman. It has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces. His regime was condemned for extensive use of the army, police, and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement. He was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism. With the punitive expeditions and courts-martial during the 1905 Revolution, the monarch became known as \"Nicholas the Bloody\". Nicholas's reign was seen as a time of suffering for Russians.<ref name=\"Kallistov\">{{cite book|author=Kallistov, D.

These included the Imperial German, Spanish, Italian, Danish and British armies.\n\nHe was [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Royal Scots Greys]] from 1894 until his death. On becoming Colonel-in-Chief he presented the Regiment with a white [[bearskin]], now worn by the bass drummer of the Pipes and Drums of the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]]. The Imperial Russian anthem is still played at dinner nights in the Officers' Mess, where there remains a portrait of the Tsar in Scots Greys uniform. Since his death, the Regiment has worn a black backing behind its cap badge as a symbol of [[mourning]].\n\n===Arms===\n[[File:Lesser CoA of the empire of Russia.svg|upright=1.05|center|thumb|Lesser Coat of Arms of the Empire of Russia and Letter Coat of Arms of the Emperor]]\n\n==Children==\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Image!!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n|colspan=5|'''By [[Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine]]''' (6 June 1872&nbsp;\u2013 17 July 1918, married on 26 November 1894)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Olgachair.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|15 November|1895|3 November}}||rowspan=\"5\"|[[Execution of the Romanov family|17 July 1918]]||rowspan=\"5\"|Shot, along with their parents, at [[Yekaterinburg]] by the [[Bolshevik]]s\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Tatiana Nikolaevna.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|10 June|1897|29 May}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:GrandDuchessMaria1914formal2.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899\u20131918)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|26 June|1899|14 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna Crisco edit letters removed.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|18 June|1901|5 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.jpg|90px]] || [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich]]||{{OldStyleDate|12 August|1904|30 July}}\n|}\n\n== Wealth ==\nEstimates of Nicholas II's personal wealth have been vastly exaggerated. As ''Emperor of All The Russias'', and an [[Autocracy|autocrat]], the resources under his command were virtually incalculable. However, the vast majority of this was owned by the state as [[Crown property]]; the Romanov family's ''personal wealth'' was only a small fraction of this. As monarch, the income of Nicholas was 24 million gold [[Ruble|roubles]] per annum: this derived from a yearly allowance from the Treasury, and from the profits of Crown farmland.<ref name=\"Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64\">Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', New York, Atheneum, 1967, p64</ref> From this income, he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings. \"Before the end of the year, the Tsar was usually penniless; sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn.\"<ref name=\"Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64\"/> According to the Grand Marshal of the Court, Count Paul Benckendorff, the family's total financial resources amounted to between 12.5 and 17.5 million roubles.<ref>Clarke, William ''The Lost Fortune of the Tsars'', St. Martin's Griffin; Reprint edition, 1996, p101.</ref> As a comparison, Prince Felix Yusupov estimated his family's worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to 50 million gold roubles.<ref>Ferrand, Jacques ''Les Princes Youssoupoff & les comtes Soumarkoff Elston'', Paris 1991</ref>\n\n== Documentaries and films ==\n{{See also|List of films about the Romanovs}}\nSeveral films about Nicholas II and his family have been made, including ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' (1971), ''[[Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna]]'' (1986), ''[[Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny]]'' (1996 [[HBO]]), ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997), and two Russian adaptations ''[[Assassin of the Tsar]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Romanovs: An Imperial Family]]'' (2000).\nIn 2017 the film ''[[Matilda (2017 film)]]'' was released.

His reign saw the fall of the [[Russian Empire]] from one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. His memory was reviled by [[Historiography in the Soviet Union|Soviet historians]] as a weak and incompetent leader whose decisions led to military defeats and the deaths of millions of his subjects. By contrast Anglo-Russian historian [[Nikolai Tolstoy]], leader of the International Monarchist League, says, \"There were many bad things about the Tsar's regime, but he inherited an autocracy and his acts are now being seen in perspective and in comparison to the terrible crimes committed by the Soviets.\"<ref name=\"Tsar Nicholas - exhibits from an execution\">{{citation|title = Tsar Nicholas \u2013 exhibits from an execution|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18592372|publisher = BBC News|author = Martin Vennard|date = 27 June 2012|accessdate = 3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Emperor, Nicholas gave limited support to the economic and political reforms promoted by top aides [[Sergei Witte]] and [[Pyotr Stolypin]], but they faced too much aristocratic opposition to be fully effective. He supported modernization based on foreign loans and close ties with France, but resisted giving the new parliament (the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]) major roles. He was criticised for the [[Khodynka Tragedy]], [[Pogroms in the Russian Empire|antisemitic pogroms]], [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], the violent suppression of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], the repression of political opponents, and his perceived responsibility for defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), which saw the annihilation of the [[Baltic Fleet|Russian Baltic Fleet]] at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], the loss of Russian influence over Manchuria and Korea, and the [[Karafuto Prefecture|Japanese annexation of the south of Sakhalin Island]].\n\nNicholas signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention|Anglo-Russian Entente]] of 1907, which was designed to counter [[German Empire|Germany]]'s attempts to gain influence in the Middle East; it ended [[the Great Game]] of confrontation between Russia and the [[British Empire]]. He supported Serbia and approved the mobilization of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] on 30 July 1914. In response, Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914 and its ally France on 3 August 1914,<ref>{{cite web |title=World War I Declarations |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/ww1declarations.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref> starting [[World War I|the First World War]]. The aristocracy was alarmed at the powerful influence of the despised peasant priest [[Grigori Rasputin]] over the tsar. The severe military losses led to a collapse of morale at the front and at home, leading to the fall of the [[House of Romanov]] in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917. Nicholas abdicated on behalf of himself and his son. With his family he was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks and [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed]] in July 1918.\n\nIn 1981, Nicholas, his wife, and their children were recognized as martyrs by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] in [[New York City]].<ref>A Reader's Guide to Orthodox Icons [http://iconreader.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/the-icons-that-canonized-the-holy-royal-martyrs/ ''The Icons that Canonized the Holy Royal Martyrs'']</ref> After the fall of Communism, the remains of the imperial family were exhumed, identified and re-interred with an elaborate state and church ceremony in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998.

He had five younger siblings: [[Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexander]] (1869\u20131870), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (1871\u20131899), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (1875\u20131960), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (1878\u20131918) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (1882\u20131960). Nicholas often referred to his father nostalgically in letters after Alexander's death in 1894. He was also very close to his mother, as revealed in their published letters to each other.<ref>''The letters of Tsar Nicholas and Empress Marie: being confidential correspondence between Nicholas II, last of the Tsars, and his mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna''. Edward J. Bing (ed.). London: Nicholson and Watson, 1937.</ref>\n\nHis paternal grandparents were [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]] and [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Empress Maria Alexandrovna]] (n\u00e9e Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine). His maternal grandparents were [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. Nicholas was of primarily German and [[Danes|Danish]] descent, his last ethnically [[Russians|Russian]] ancestor being [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia]] (1708\u20131728), daughter of [[Peter the Great]].\n\n[[File:Tsar Nicholas II & King George V.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia with his physically similar cousin, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] (right), wearing German military uniforms in Berlin before the war; 1913]]\nNicholas was related to several monarchs in Europe. His mother's siblings included Kings [[Frederick VIII of Denmark]] and [[George I of Greece]], as well as the United Kingdom's [[Queen Alexandra]] (consort of [[King Edward VII]]). Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]] were all first cousins of [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]]. Nicholas was also a first cousin of both [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud of Norway]], as well as [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X of Denmark]] and [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I of Greece]]. Nicholas and Wilhelm II were in turn second cousins-once-removed, as each descended from [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Frederick William III of Prussia]], as well as third cousins, as they were both great-great-grandsons of [[Tsar Paul I of Russia]]. In addition to being second cousins through descent from [[Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his wife [[Princess Wilhelmine of Baden]], Nicholas and Alexandra were also third cousins-once-removed, as they were both descendants of [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II of Prussia]].\n\nTsar Nicholas II was the first cousin-once-removed of [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich]]. To distinguish between them the Grand Duke was often known within the imperial family as \"Nikolasha\" and \"Nicholas the Tall\", while the Tsar was \"Nicholas the Short\".\n\nIn his childhood, Nicholas, his parents and siblings made annual visits to the Danish royal palaces of [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]] to visit his grandparents, the king and queen. The visits also served as family reunions, as his mother's siblings would also come from the United Kingdom, Germany and Greece with their respective families.<ref>Van Der Kiste, John (2003) ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959'', Sutton Publishing, p. 151</ref> It was there in 1883, that he had a flirtation with one of his British first cousins, [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria]].

On such occasions, Alexander III and his family occupied the nearby [[Anichkov Palace]].\n\n[[File:Prince Nicolas at Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|Tsarevich Nicholas in Japan (1891)]]\n\nIn 1884, Nicholas's coming-of-age ceremony was held at the Winter Palace, where he pledged his loyalty to his father. Later that year, Nicholas's uncle, [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]], married [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Princess Elizabeth]], daughter of [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his late wife [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]] (who had died in 1878), and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. At the wedding in St. Petersburg, the sixteen-year-old [[Tsarevich]] met with and admired the bride's youngest surviving sister, twelve-year-old [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Princess Alix]]. Those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to St. Petersburg five years later in 1889. Alix had feelings for him in turn. As a devout Lutheran, she was initially reluctant to convert to Russian Orthodoxy in order to marry Nicholas, but later relented.<ref>[[#King1994|King (1994)]] p. 54</ref>\n\nIn 1890 Nicholas, [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|his younger brother George]], and their cousin [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|Prince George of Greece]], set out on a [[Eastern journey of Nicholas II|world tour]], although Grand Duke George fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip. Nicholas visited Egypt, India, Singapore, and Bangkok, receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country. In April 1891, in the city of [[\u014ctsu]], Japan, Nicholas was [[\u014ctsu incident|attacked by a deranged Japanese police officer]]. The incident cut his trip short. Some historians have speculated on how the incident may have later influenced his opinion of Japan and the Japanese.<ref name=\"kowner\"/> Returning overland to St. Petersburg, he was present at the ceremonies in [[Vladivostok]] commemorating the beginning of work on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. In 1893, Nicholas traveled to London on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin [[George V|the Duke of York]] to [[Princess Mary of Teck]]. Queen Victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins, and their appearances confused some at the wedding. During this time, Nicholas had an affair with St. Petersburg ballerina [[Mathilde Kschessinska]].<ref>Kshessinska 1960. ''Dancing in Petersburg''. London, transl Haskell.{{page needed|date=January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThough Nicholas was heir-apparent to the throne, his father failed to prepare him for his future role as Tsar.

Other guests included [[Queen Victoria]], [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Empress Frederick]] (Kaiser Wilhelm's mother and Queen Victoria's eldest daughter), Nicholas's uncle, the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]], and the bride's parents, [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke]] and [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].\n\nOnce in Coburg Nicholas proposed to Alix, but she rejected his proposal, being reluctant to convert to Orthodoxy. But the Kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry Nicholas and to convert, as her sister Elizabeth had voluntarily done in 1892. Thus Nicholas and Alix became officially engaged on 20 April 1894. Nicholas's parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing, as Alix had made poor impressions during her visits to Russia. They gave their consent only when they saw Tsar Alexander's health deteriorating.\n\nThat summer, Nicholas travelled to England to visit both Alix and the Queen. The visit coincided with the birth of [[George V|the Duke]] and [[Mary of Teck|Duchess of York]]'s first child, the future [[King Edward VIII]]. Along with being present at the christening, Nicholas and Alix were listed among the child's godparents.<ref>[[#King1994|King (1994)]] p. 70</ref> After several weeks in England, Nicholas returned home for the wedding of his sister, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]], to a cousin, [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich]] (\"Sandro\").<ref>{{cite news |title=The Czarewitch |work=[[St James's Gazette]] |date=30 July 1894 |accessdate=11 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001485/18940730/041/0008| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1904-1905peterhof.jpg|thumb|left|Nicholas II and family]]\n\nBy that autumn, Alexander III lay dying.

Shortly after he came to the [[throne]], a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns' local assemblies (''[[zemstvos]]'') came to the [[Winter Palace]] proposing court reforms, such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy,<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 20</ref> and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry, in the [[Tver Address]].<ref>Figes, p. 165</ref><ref>Pierre, Andre (1925) ''Journal Intime de Nicholas II'', Paris: Payot, p. 127</ref>\n\nAlthough the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms, Nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an Imperial Family Council by saying to them:\n\n{{quote|... it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country.

Khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near Moscow large enough to hold all of the Moscow citizens.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 1017</ref> Khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches. Before the food and drink was handed out, rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone. As a result, the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon, suffocating in the dirt of the field.<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], pp. 26\u201327</ref> Of the approximate 100,000 in attendance, it is estimated that 1,389 individuals died<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> and roughly 1,300 were injured.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The Khodynka Tragedy was seen as an ill omen and Nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign. The French ambassador's gala was planned for that night. The Tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost, but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with France, particularly the 1894 [[Franco-Russian Alliance]]. Thus Nicholas attended the party; as a result the mourning populace saw Nicholas as frivolous and uncaring.\n\nDuring the autumn after the coronation, Nicholas and Alexandra made a tour of Europe. After making visits to the emperor and empress of Austria-Hungary, the Kaiser of Germany, and Nicholas's Danish grandparents and relatives, Nicholas and Alexandra took possession of their new yacht, the ''[[Russian yacht Standart|Standart]], ''which had been built in Denmark.<ref>[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 420</ref> From there, they made a journey to Scotland to spend some time with Queen Victoria at [[Balmoral Castle]]. While Alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother, Nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle, the Prince of Wales, in bad weather, and was suffering from a bad toothache.<ref>King, Greg (2007) ''Twilight of Splendor: the Court of Queen Victoria in Her Diamond Jubilee Year '', John Wiley & Sons, pp. 173\u2013175</ref>\n\n[[File:Imperial Monogram of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Imperial monogram]]\n\nThe first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. Nicholas allotted money for the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russia exhibition of 1896]]. In 1897 restoration of [[gold standard]] by [[Sergei Witte]], Minister of Finance, completed the series of financial reforms, initiated fifteen years earlier. By 1902 the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was nearing completion; this helped the Russians trade in the Far East but the railway still required huge amounts of work.\n\n===Ecclesiastical affairs===\nNicholas always believed God chose him to be the tsar and therefore the decisions of the tsar reflected the will of God and could not be disputed. He was convinced that the simple people of Russia understood this and loved him, as demonstrated by the display of affection he perceived when he made public appearances. His old-fashioned belief made for a very stubborn ruler who rejected constitutional limitations on his power. It put the tsar at variance with the emerging political consensus among the Russian elite. It was further belied by the subordinate position of the Church in the bureaucracy. The result was a new distrust between the tsar and the church hierarchy and between those hierarchs and the people. Thereby the tsar's base of support was conflicted.<ref>Sergei L. Firsov,\"Emperor Nicholas II as an Orthodox Tsar\" ''Russian Studies in History'' 50.4 (2012): 79-90.</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the [[canonisation]] of [[Seraphim of Sarov]]. The previous year, it had been suggested that if he were canonised, the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne. While Alexandra demanded in July 1902 that Seraphim be canonised in less than a week, Nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year. Despite a public outcry, the Church bowed to the intense imperial pressure, declaring Seraphim worthy of canonisation in January 1903. That summer, the imperial family travelled to Sarov for the canonisation.<ref>[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 137</ref>\n\n===Initiatives in foreign affairs===\n\nAccording to his biographer:\n: His tolerance if not preference for charlatans and adventurers extended to grave matters of external policy, and his vacillating conduct and erratic decisions aroused misgivings and occasional alarm among his more conventional advisers. The foreign ministry itself was not a bastion of diplomatic expertise. Patronage and \"connections\" were the keys to appointment and promotion.<ref>Robert D. Warth, ''Nicholas II: The Life and Reign of Russia's Last Monarch'' (1997) p 47.</ref>\n\nEmperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] of Austria-Hungary paid a state visit in April 1897 that was a success. It produced a \"gentlemen's agreement\" to keep the status quo in the Balkans, and a somewhat similar commitment became applicable to Constantinople and the Straits. The result was years of peace that allowed for rapid economic growth.<ref>Warth, ''Nicholas II'' p 49.</ref>\n\n[[File:Faure Loubet Carnot Alexandre Nicolas Grandes manoeuvres de l'est 1901 carte postale.JPG|thumb|Souvenir postcard of the [[French maneuvers of 1901]] attended by Nicholas II and Alexandra]]\nNicholas followed the policies of his father, strengthening the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] and pursuing a policy of general European pacification, which culminated in the famous [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague peace conference]]. This conference, suggested and promoted by Nicholas II, was convened with the view of terminating the [[arms race]], and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The results of the conference were less than expected due to the mutual distrust existing between great powers.

Russia had expanded in the Far East, and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions, as its southward path to the [[Balkans]] was frustrated, conflicted with Japan's own territorial ambitions on the Chinese and Asian mainland. Nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to [[Manchuria]] and [[Korea]], and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Bezobrazov|Bezobazov group]].<ref name=\"Kowner\">Kowner, '' Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War'', p. 260-264.</ref><ref>Raymond A.

The United Kingdom would not allow the Russian navy to use the [[Suez Canal]], due to [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|its alliance]] with the Empire of Japan, and due to the [[Dogger Bank incident]] where the Baltic Fleet mistakenly fired on British fishing boats in the North Sea. The Russian [[Baltic Fleet]] traversed the world to lift the blockade on Port Arthur, but after many misadventures on the way, was nearly annihilated by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Tsushima|Battle of the Tsushima Strait]].<ref name=\"Kowner\" /> On land the [[Imperial Russian Army]] experienced logistical problems. While commands and supplies came from [[St. Petersburg]], combat took place in east Asian ports with only the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] for transport of supplies as well as troops both ways.<ref name=\"Kowner\" /> The {{convert|9200|km|mi|adj=on}} rail line between St. Petersburg and Port Arthur was single-track, with no track around [[Lake Baikal]], allowing only gradual build-up of the forces on the front. [[Siege of Port Arthur|Besieged Port Arthur]] fell to the Japanese, after nine months of resistance.<ref name=\"Kowner\" />\n\nAs Russia faced imminent defeat by the Japanese, the call for peace grew. Nicholas's mother, as well as his cousin [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]], urged Nicholas to negotiate for peace. Despite the efforts, Nicholas remained evasive, sending a telegram to the Kaiser on 10 October that it was his intent to keep on fighting until the Japanese were driven from Manchuria.<ref name=\"Kowner\" /> It was not until 27\u201328 May 1905 and the annihilation of the Russian fleet by the Japanese, that Nicholas finally decided to sue for peace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2018/12/2/the-last-tsar-tsar-nicholas-ii-of-russia-protect-us-lord-for-we-reign-too-young|title=The Last Tsar \u2013 Tsar Nicholas II of Russia: Protect us Lord, for We Reign Too Young|website=History is Now Magazine, Podcasts, Blog and Books {{!}} Modern International and American history|language=en-US|access-date=29 May 2019}}</ref> Nicholas II accepted American mediation, appointing [[Sergei Witte]] chief plenipotentiary for the peace talks. The war was ended by the signing of the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]].<ref name=\"Kowner\" />\n\n====Tsar's confidence in victory====\nNicholas's stance on the war was so at variance with the obvious facts that many observers were baffled. He saw the war as an easy god-given victory that would raise Russian morale and patriotism. He ignored the financial repercussions of a long-distance war.<ref>[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 67</ref> Rotem Kowner, argues that during his visit to Japan in 1891, where Nicholas was [[\u014ctsu incident|attacked]] by a Japanese policeman, he regarded the Japanese as small of stature, feminine, weak, and inferior. He ignored reports of the prowess of Japanese soldiers in the Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395) and reports on the capabilities of the Japanese fleet, as well as negative reports on the lack of readiness of Russian forces.<ref name=\"kowner\">Rotem Kowner, \"Nicholas II and the Japanese body: Images and decision-making on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War.\" ''Psychohistory Review'' (1998) 26#3 pp 211-252.

Despite the onset of the war and the many defeats Russia suffered, Nicholas still believed in, and expected, a final victory, maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the Japanese.<ref>Kowner (1998)</ref> Throughout the war, the tsar demonstrated total confidence in Russia's ultimate triumph. His advisors never gave him a clear picture of Russia's weaknesses. Despite the continuous military disasters Nicholas believed victory was near at hand. Losing his navy at Tsushima finally persuaded him to agree to peace negotiations. Even then he insisted on the option of reopening hostilities if peace conditions were unfavorable. He forbade his chief negotiator Count Witte to agree to either indemnity payments or loss of territory. Nicholas remained adamantly opposed to any concessions. Peace was made, but Witte did so by disobeying the tsar and ceding southern Sakhalin to Japan.<ref>Raymond A.

On Saturday, 8 (21) January, the ministers convened to consider the situation. There was never any thought that the Tsar, who had left the capital for Tsarskoye Selo on the advice of the ministers, would actually meet Gapon; the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected.<ref name=\"Massie, R p. 124\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 124</ref>\n\nFinally informed by the Prefect of Police that he lacked the men to pluck Gapon from among his followers and place him under arrest, the newly appointed Minister of the Interior, Prince [[Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky|Sviatopolk-Mirsky]], and his colleagues decided to bring additional troops to reinforce the city. That evening Nicholas wrote in his diary, \"Troops have been brought from the outskirts to reinforce the garrison. Up to now the workers have been calm. Their number is estimated at 120,000. At the head of their union is a kind of socialist priest named Gapon. Mirsky came this evening to present his report on the measures taken.\"<ref name=\"Massie, R p. 124\" />\n\nOn Sunday, 9 (22) January 1905, Gapon began his march. Locking arms, the workers [[Nonviolent resistance|marched peacefully]] through the streets. Some carried religious icons and banners, as well as national flags and portraits of the Tsar. As they walked, they sang hymns and ''[[God Save the Tsar!|God Save The Tsar]]''. At 2{{nbsp}}pm all of the converging processions were scheduled to arrive at the Winter Palace. There was no single confrontation with the troops. Throughout the city, at bridges on strategic boulevards, the marchers found their way blocked by lines of infantry, backed by [[Cossack]]s and Hussars; and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd.<ref name=\"Massie, R pp. 124\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nThe official number of victims was 92 dead and several hundred wounded.

As bullets riddled their icons, their banners and their portraits of Nicholas, the people shrieked, \"The Tsar will not help us!\"<ref name=\"Massie, R pp. 124\" /> Outside Russia, the future British Labour Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] attacked the Tsar, calling him a \"blood-stained creature and a common murderer\".<ref name=\"massie125\" />\n\nThat evening Nicholas wrote in his diary:\n\n{{quote|Difficult day!

They would have presented their petition and gone back to their homes. But that wretched Epiphany incident had left all the senior officials in a state of panic. They kept on telling Nicky that he had no right to run such a risk, that he owed it to the country to leave the capital, that even with the utmost precautions taken there might always be some loophole left.

In the [[October Manifesto]], the Tsar pledged to introduce basic [[civil liberties]], provide for broad participation in the State Duma, and endow the Duma with legislative and oversight powers. He was determined, however, to preserve his [[autocracy]] even in the context of reform. This was signalled in the text of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|1906 constitution]]. He was described as the supreme autocrat, and retained sweeping executive powers, also in church affairs. His cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere with nor assist one another; they were responsible only to him.\n\nNicholas's relations with the Duma were poor. The [[First Duma]], with a majority of [[Constitutional Democratic party|Kadets]], almost immediately came into conflict with him. Scarcely had the 524 members sat down at the [[Tauride Palace]] when they formulated an 'Address to the Throne'. It demanded [[universal suffrage]], radical land reform, the release of all [[political prisoner]]s and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the Tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the Duma.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 243</ref> Grand Duchess Olga, Nicholas's sister, later wrote:\n\n{{quote|There was such gloom at Tsarskoye Selo. I did not understand anything about politics. I just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us. The October Constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone. I went with my mother to the first Duma. I remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people. The peasants looked sullen.

The Duma was populated with [[Political radicalism|radicals]], many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership, among other things. Witte, unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming Russia and the monarchy, wrote to Nicholas on 14 April 1906 resigning his office (however, other accounts have said that Witte was forced to resign by the Emperor). Nicholas was not ungracious to Witte and an Imperial Rescript was published on 22 April creating Witte a Knight of the [[Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky]] with diamonds (the last two words were written in the Emperor's own hand, followed by \"I remain unalterably well-disposed to you and sincerely grateful, for ever more Nicholas.\").\n\nA second Duma met for the first time in February 1907. The [[leftist]] parties\u2014including the [[Social Democrats]] and the Social Revolutionaries, who had boycotted the First Duma\u2014had won 200 seats in the Second, more than a third of the membership. Again Nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the Duma. In two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow:\n\n{{quote|A grotesque deputation is coming from England to see liberal members of the Duma. [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Uncle Bertie]] informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming. Their famous \"liberty\", of course.

Stolypin, a skilful politician, had ambitious plans for reform. These included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land, with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown. Nevertheless, when the Duma remained hostile, Stolypin had no qualms about invoking Article 87 of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|Fundamental Laws]], which empowered the Tsar to issue 'urgent and extraordinary' emergency decrees 'during the recess of the State Duma'. Stolypin's most famous legislative act, the change in peasant land tenure, was promulgated under Article 87.<ref name=\"massie245\" />\n\nThe third Duma remained an independent body. This time the members proceeded cautiously. Instead of hurling themselves at the government, opposing parties within the Duma worked to develop the body as a whole. In the classic manner of the British Parliament, the Duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings. The Duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures. These sessions, endorsed by Stolypin, were educational for both sides, and, in time, mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect. Even the sensitive area of military expenditure, where the October Manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne, a Duma commission began to operate. Composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than Nicholas to restore the fallen honour of Russian arms, the Duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed.\n\nWith the passage of time, Nicholas also began to have confidence in the Duma. \"This Duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it,\" he said to Stolypin in 1909.<ref name=\"massie246\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 246</ref> Nevertheless, Stolypin's plans were undercut by conservatives at court. Although the tsar at first supported him, he finally sided with the arch critics.<ref>Mikhail F. Florinskii, \"Nicholas II and Stolypin's Cabinet\" ''Russian Social Science Review'' 53.4 (2012): 4-14.</ref> Reactionaries such as Prince [[Vladimir Nikolayevich Orlov]] never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the Duma was a blot on the autocracy. Stolypin, they whispered, was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the Duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the Tsar by God. Witte also engaged in constant intrigue against Stolypin. Although Stolypin had had nothing to do with Witte's fall, Witte blamed him. Stolypin had unwittingly angered the Tsaritsa. He had ordered an investigation into Rasputin and presented it to the Tsar, who read it but did nothing. Stolypin, on his own authority, ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg. Alexandra protested vehemently but Nicholas refused to overrule his Prime Minister,<ref name=\"massie247\">[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 247.</ref> who had more influence with the Emperor.\n\nBy the time of Stolypin's assassination in September 1911, Stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office. For a man who preferred clear decisive action, working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating. As an example, Nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note:\n\n{{quote|Despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter, an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that I do not accept responsibility for it. So far my conscience has not deceived me. Therefore I intend in this case to follow its dictates. I know that you, too, believe that \"a Tsar's heart is in God's hands.\" Let it be so.

Two years earlier when Stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to Nicholas he was informed: \"This is not a question of confidence or lack of it. It is my will. Remember that we live in Russia, not abroad...and therefore I shall not consider the possibility of any resignation.\"<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 248</ref> He was assassinated in September 1911.\n\nIn 1912, a fourth Duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third. \"The Duma started too fast. Now it is slower, but better, and more lasting,\" stated Nicholas to Sir [[Bernard Pares]].<ref name=\"massie246\" />\n\nThe [[World War I|First World War]] developed badly for Russia. By late 1916, Romanov family desperation reached the point that [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]], younger brother of Alexander III and the Tsar's only surviving uncle, was deputed to beg Nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the Duma. Nicholas sternly and adamantly refused, reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors. In the Duma on 2 December 1916, Vladimir Purishkevich, a fervent patriot, monarchist and war worker, denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous two-hour speech which was tumultuously applauded. \"Revolution threatens,\" he warned, \"and an obscure peasant shall govern Russia no longer!\"<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 49.</ref>\n\n===Tsarevich Alexei's illness and Rasputin===\n[[File:Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.jpg|left|thumb|Alexei in 1913]]\n\nFurther complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession. Alexandra bore Nicholas four daughters, [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Olga]] in 1895, [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Tatiana]] in 1897, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria]] in 1899, and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] in 1901, before their son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei]] was born on 12 August 1904. The young heir was afflicted with [[Haemophilia B]], a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly, which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death. As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Alexandra carried the same [[gene mutation]] that afflicted several of the major European royal houses, such as [[Prussia]] and Spain. Hemophilia, therefore, became known as \"[[Haemophilia in European royalty|the royal disease]]\". Through Alexandra, the disease had passed on to her son. As all of Nicholas and Alexandra's daughters were murdered with their parents and brother in Yekaterinburg in 1918, it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as [[genetic carrier|carriers]].\n\nBefore Rasputin's arrival, the tsarina and the tsar had consulted numerous mystics, charlatans, \"holy fools,\" and miracle workers. The royal behavior was not some odd aberration, but a deliberate retreat from the secular social and economic forces of his time - an act of faith and vote of confidence in a spiritual past. They had set themselves up for the greatest spiritual advisor and manipulator in Russian history.<ref>Robert D. Warth,\"Before Rasputin: Piety and the Occult at the Court of Nicholas II.\" ''Historian'' 47.3 (1985): 323-337.</ref>\n\nBecause of the fragility of the autocracy at this time, Nicholas and Alexandra chose to keep secret Alexei's condition. Even within the household, many were unaware of the exact nature of the Tsarevich's illness. At first Alexandra turned to Russian doctors and medics to treat Alexei; however, their treatments generally failed, and Alexandra increasingly turned to [[mysticism|mystic]]s and holy men (or ''[[starets]]'' as they were called in Russian). One of these starets, an illiterate Siberian named [[Grigori Rasputin]], gained amazing success. Rasputin's influence over Empress Alexandra, and consequently the Tsar himself, grew even stronger after 1912 when the Tsarevich nearly died from an injury. His bleeding grew steadily worse as doctors despaired, and priests administered the [[last rites|Last Sacrament]]. In desperation, Alexandra called upon Rasputin, to which he replied, \"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.\"<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 185</ref> The haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover. Alexandra took this as a sign that Rasputin was a ''starets'' and that God was with him; for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him.\n\n===European affairs===\n[[File:Nicholas II and Alexei in Reval 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II and his son Alexei aboard the Imperial yacht ''[[Russian yacht Standart|Standart]]'', during King [[Edward VII]]'s state visit to Russia in [[Tallinn|Reval]], 1908]]\n\nIn 1907, to end longstanding controversies over central Asia, Russia and the United Kingdom signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907|Anglo-Russian Convention]] that resolved most of the problems generated for decades by [[The Great Game]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Klein, Ira |title=The Anglo-Russian Convention and the Problem of Central Asia, 1907\u20131914|journal=Journal of British Studies|year=1971|volume=11|issue=1|pages=126\u2013147 |jstor=175041|doi=10.1086/385621}}</ref> The UK had already entered into the [[Entente cordiale]] with France in 1904, and the Anglo-Russian convention led to the formation of the [[Triple Entente]]. The following year, in May 1908, Nicholas and Alexandra's shared \"Uncle Bertie\" and \"Aunt Alix,\" Britain's King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, made a state visit to Russia, being the first reigning British monarchs to do so. However, they did not set foot on Russian soil. Instead, they stayed aboard their yachts, meeting off the coast of modern-day [[Tallinn]]. Later that year, Nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister, [[Alexander Izvolsky]], had entered into a secret agreement with the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, [[Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Count Alois von Aehrenthal]], agreeing that, in exchange for Russian naval access to the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus Strait]], Russia would not oppose the Austrian annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a revision of the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. When Austria-Hungary did annex this territory that October, it precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis|diplomatic crisis]]. When Russia protested about the annexation, the Austrians threatened to leak secret communications between Izvolsky and Aehernthal, prompting Nicholas to complain in a letter to the Austrian emperor, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], about a breach of confidence. In 1909, in the wake of the Anglo-Russian convention, the Russian imperial family made a visit to England, staying on the [[Isle of Wight]] for [[Cowes Week]]. In 1913, during the [[Balkan War (1912\u201313)|Balkan Wars]], Nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between Serbia and Bulgaria. However, the Bulgarians rejected his offer. Also in 1913, Nicholas, albeit without Alexandra, made a visit to Berlin for the wedding of Kaiser Wilhelm II's daughter, [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Princess Victoria Louise]], to a maternal cousin of Nicholas, [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Ernest Augustus, the Duke of Brunswick]].<ref>Clay, Catarine (2006) ''King, Kaiser, Tsar: Three Royal Cousins Who Led the World to War'', Walker & Company, {{ISBN|0802716237}}, pp. 300\u2013301</ref> Nicholas was also joined by his cousin, [[King George V]] and his wife, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].\n\n===Tercentenary===\n{{Main|Romanov Tercentenary}}\nIn February 1913, Nicholas presided over the [[Romanov Tercentenary|tercentenary celebrations for the Romanov Dynasty]].

The outbreak of war was not inevitable, but leaders, diplomats and nineteenth-century alliances created a climate for large-scale conflict. The concept of [[Pan-Slavism]] and shared religion created strong public sympathy between Russia and Serbia. Territorial conflict created rivalries between [[German Empire|Germany]] and France and between Austria-Hungary and [[Serbia]], and as a consequence alliance networks developed across Europe. The [[Triple Entente]] and [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] networks were set before the war. Nicholas wanted neither to abandon Serbia to the ultimatum of Austria, nor to provoke a general war. In a series of letters exchanged with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]] of Germany (the \"[[Willy\u2013Nicky correspondence]]\") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against Austria-Hungary, in the hopes of preventing war with Germany.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R43302, Kaiser Wilhelm II. und Zar Nikolaus II..jpg|thumb|Nicholas II (right) with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany in 1905.

He put the Russian army on \"alert\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Merriman, John (2009) ''A History of Modern Europe Volume Two'', W. W. Norton & Company, {{ISBN|0393933857}}, p. 967</ref> on 25 July. Although this was not general mobilization, it threatened the German and Austro-Hungarian borders and looked like military preparation for war.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> However, his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization, and on 30 July 1914 Nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization, despite being strongly counselled against it.\n\nOn 28 July, Austria-Hungary formally declared war against Serbia. On 29 July 1914, Nicholas sent a telegram to Wilhelm with the suggestion to submit the Austro-Serbian problem to the [[Hague Conference]] (in [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|Hague tribunal]]). Wilhelm did not address the question of the Hague Conference in his subsequent reply.<ref>[[Hew Strachan]], ''The First World War, Vol I: To Arms'' (2001), p. 85</ref><ref>Hamilton, Richard F. and Herwig, Holger H.

Germany, reacting to the discovery of partial mobilization ordered on 25 July, announced its own pre-mobilization posture, the Imminent Danger of War. Germany requested that Russia demobilize within the next twelve hours.<ref>{{cite web|author=Josef und Ulli |url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/6916/ww1.htm |title=Germany during World War One |date= |accessdate=7 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018191920/http://geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/6916/ww1.htm|archivedate=18 October 2009 }}</ref> In [[Saint Petersburg]], at 7pm, with the ultimatum to Russia having expired, the German ambassador to Russia met with the Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Sazonov]], asked three times if Russia would reconsider, and then with shaking hands, delivered the note accepting Russia's war challenge and declaring war on 1 August. Less than a week later, on 6 August, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] signed the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Russia.\n\nThe outbreak of war on 1 August 1914 found Russia grossly unprepared. Russia and her allies placed their faith in her army, the famous 'Russian steamroller'.<ref name=\"tames42\">[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 42</ref> Its pre-war regular strength was 1,400,000; mobilization added 3,100,000 reserves and millions more stood ready behind them. In every other respect, however, Russia was unprepared for war. Germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile, and whereas Russian soldiers travelled an average of {{convert|1290|km|mi|-1}} to reach the front, German soldiers traveled less than a quarter of that distance. Russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the Tsar could raise, and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small; while the German army in 1914 was better equipped than any other, man-for-man, the Russians were severely short on artillery pieces, shells, motorized transports, and even boots. With the Baltic Sea barred by German U-boats and the Dardanelles by the guns of Germany's ally, the [[Ottoman Empire]], Russia initially could receive help only via [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], which was frozen solid in winter, or via [[Vladivostok]], which was over {{convert|6400|km|mi}} from the front line. By 1915, a rail line was built north from [[Petrozavodsk]] to the Kola Gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the ice-free port of what eventually was called [[Murmansk]]. The Russian High Command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov]], the Minister of War, and the incompetent Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field.<ref>Paul Robinson, Paul. \"A Study of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich as Supreme Commander of the Russian Army, 1914\u20131915.\" ''Historian'' 75.3 (2013): 475-498. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24456116 online]</ref> In spite of all of this, an immediate attack was ordered against the German province of [[East Prussia]]. The Germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two Russian armies which had invaded. The [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], where an entire Russian army was annihilated, cast an ominous shadow over Russia's future. Russia had great success against both the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman armies from the very beginning of the war, but they never succeeded against the might of the German Army. In September 1914, in order to relieve pressure on France, the Russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against Austria-Hungary in Galicia in order to attack German-held Silesia.<ref>Massie, Robert K.

General Denikin, retreating from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] wrote, \"The German heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches, and their defenders with them. We hardly replied. There was nothing with which we could reply. Our regiments, although completely exhausted, were beating off one attack after another by bayonet ...

At first, the targets were German, and for three days in June shops, bakeries, factories, private houses and country estates belonging to people with German names were looted and burned.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. The inflamed mobs then turned on the government, declaring the Empress should be shut up in a convent, the Tsar deposed and Rasputin hanged. Nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents. An emergency session of the Duma was summoned and a Special Defense Council established, its members drawn from the Duma and the Tsar's ministers.\n\nIn July 1915, King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] of [[Denmark]], first cousin of the Tsar, sent [[Hans Niels Andersen]] to Tsarskoye Selo with an offer to act as a mediator. He made several trips between London, Berlin and Petrograd and in July saw the Dowager Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]]. Andersen told her they should conclude peace. Nicholas chose to turn down King Christian's offer of mediation, as he felt it would be a betrayal for Russia to form a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers when its allies Britain and France were still fighting.<ref>Hall, C (2006) ''Little Mother of Russia'', Holmes and Meier, {{ISBN|0841914222}}, p. 264</ref>\n\nThe energetic and efficient General [[Alexei Polivanov]] replaced Sukhomlinov as [[Minister of War]], which failed to improve the strategic situation.<ref name=\"tames42\" /> In the aftermath of the [[Great Retreat (Russia)|Great Retreat]] and the loss of the Kingdom of [[Poland]], Nicholas assumed the role of commander-in-chief after dismissing his cousin, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich, in September 1915. This was a mistake, as the Tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front. He was also away at the remote HQ at [[Mogilev]], far from the direct governance of the empire, and when revolution broke out in [[Petrograd]] he was unable to halt it. In reality the move was largely symbolic, since all important military decisions were made by his chief-of-staff General [[Michael Alexeiev]], and Nicholas did little more than review troops, inspect [[field hospital]]s, and preside over military luncheons.<ref>King, Greg and Wilson, Penny (2003) ''The Fate of the Romanovs'', John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|0471207683}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nicholas II with his family in Yevpatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II with his family in [[Yevpatoria]], [[Crimea]], May 1916]]\n\nThe Duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war. Cut off from public opinion, Nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering. With Nicholas at the front, domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife Alexandra. However, Alexandra's relationship with [[Grigori Rasputin]], and her German background, further discredited the dynasty's authority. Nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of Rasputin but had failed to remove him. Rumors and accusations about Alexandra and Rasputin appeared one after another; Alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards Germany. Anger at Nicholas's failure to act and the extreme damage that Rasputin's influence was doing to Russia's war effort and to the monarchy led to Rasputin's eventual murder by a group of nobles, led by Prince [[Felix Yusupov]] and [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], a cousin of the Tsar, in the early morning of Saturday 17 December 1916 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) / 30 December 1916 ([[New Style|N.S.]]).\n\n===Collapse===\n[[File:\u0417\u0430\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e. \u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0432. 1 \u0430\u043f\u0440.1916.jpg|thumb|right|Nicholas with members of the Stavka at Mogilev in April 1916.]]\nAs the government failed to produce supplies, mounting hardship resulted in massive riots and rebellions. With Nicholas away at the front from 1915 through 1916, authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering soldiers.

The Tsar, 800 kilometres (500&nbsp;mi) away, was misinformed by the Minister of the Interior, [[Alexander Protopopov]], that the situation was under control, and he ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators. For this task, the Petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable. The cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in [[Poland]] and Galicia. In Petrograd, 170,000 recruits, country boys or older men from the working-class suburbs of the capital itself, remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies. The units in the capital, although many bore the names of famous Imperial Guard regiments, were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments, the regular units being away at the front. Many units, lacking both officers and rifles, had never undergone formal training.<ref name=\"tames53\" />\n\nGeneral Khabalov attempted to put the Tsar's instructions into effect on the morning of Sunday, 11 March 1917. Despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets, vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some 200 had been shot dead, though a company of the [[Volinsky Regiment]] fired into the air rather than into the mob, and a company of the [[Pavlovsky Regiment|Pavlovsky Life Guards]] shot the officer who gave the command to open fire.

He first abdicated in favor of Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that Alexei would not live long enough while separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile. Nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], as the next Emperor of all the Russians. He issued a statement but it was suppressed by the Provisional Government. Michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a Constituent Assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic. The abdication of Nicholas II and Michael's deferment of accepting the throne brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty's rule to an end.

''Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Tsar and His Family'' (1967) p. 461</ref> The Liberal Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] preferred that the family went to a neutral country, and wanted the offer to be announced as at the request of the Russian government.{{sfn|Rappaport|2018|pp=62,63}} The offer of asylum was withdrawn in April following objections by King [[George V]], who, acting on the advice of his secretary [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham]], was worried that Nicholas's presence might provoke an uprising like the previous year's [[Easter Rising]] in Ireland. However, later the king defied his secretary and went to the Romanov memorial service at the Russian Church in London.{{sfn|Welch|2018|p=246}} In the early summer of 1917, the Russian government approached the British government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of British internal politics.<ref>Massie, Robert K.

The Provisional Government only remained in power through an uneasy alliance with the [[Petrograd Soviet]], an arrangement known as \"The [[Dual power|Dual Power]]\". An initial plan to send the royal family to the northern port of [[Murmansk]] had to be abandoned when it was realised that the railway workers and the soldiers guarding them were loyal to the Petrograd Soviet, which opposed the escape of the tsar; a later proposal to send the Romanovs to a neutral port in the [[Baltic Sea]] via the [[Duchy of Finland]] faced similar difficulties.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 51-52 and pp. 68-69</ref>\n\n===Imprisonment===\n[[File:Nikolaus II.

The government feared that further disturbances in the city could easily reach Tsarskoye Selo and it was decided to move the royal family to a safer location.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 70-71</ref> [[Alexander Kerensky]], who had taken over as prime minister, selected the town of [[Tobolsk]] in [[Western Siberia]], since it was remote from any large city and {{convert|150|mi}} from the nearest rail station.<ref>Service 2018, p. 80</ref> Some sources state that there was an intention to send the family abroad in the spring of 1918 via Japan,<ref>Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 487</ref> but more recent work suggests that this was just a Bolshevik rumour.<ref>Service 2018, p. 145</ref> The family left the Alexandra Palace late on 13 August, reached [[Tyumen]] by rail four days later and then by two river ferries finally reached Tobolsk on 19 August.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 76-78</ref> There they lived in the former [[Governor's Mansion (Tobolsk, Russia)|Governor's Mansion]] in considerable comfort. In October 1917, however, the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power from Kerensky's Provisional Government; Nicholas followed the events in October with interest but not yet with alarm. [[Boris Soloviev]], the husband of [[Maria Rasputin]], attempted to organize a rescue with monarchical factions, but it came to nothing. Rumors persist that Soloviev was working for the Bolsheviks or the Germans, or both.<ref>Massie, K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 488-492</ref> Separate preparations for a rescue by [[Nikolai Yevgenyevich Markov]] were frustrated by Soloviev's ineffectual activities.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 132-133</ref> Nicholas continued to underestimate [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s importance. In the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with reading books, exercising and playing games; Nicholas particularly enjoyed chopping firewood.<ref>Service 2018, p. 150</ref> However, in January 1918, the guard detachment's committee grew more assertive, restricting the hours that the family could spend in the grounds and banning them from walking to church on a Sunday as they had done since October.<ref>Service 2018, p. 125</ref> In a later incident, the soldiers tore the [[epaulette]]s from Kobylinsky's uniform, and he asked Nicholas not to wear his uniform outside for fear of provoking a similar event.<ref>Service 2018, p. 157</ref>\n\nIn February 1918, the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (abbreviated to \"Sovnarkom\") in Moscow, the new capital, announced that the state subsidy for the family would be drastically reduced, starting on 1 March. This meant parting with twelve devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries, even though Nicholas added to the funds from his own resources.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 128-129</ref> Nicholas and Alexandra were appalled by news of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], whereby Russia agreed to give up Poland, Finland, the Baltic States, most of Belarus, the Ukraine, the Crimea, most of the Caucasus, and small parts of Russia proper including areas around [[Pskov]] and [[Rostov-on-Don]].<ref>Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 493-494</ref> What kept the family's spirits up was the belief that help was at hand.<ref>[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 62.</ref> The Romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety. The Western Allies lost interest in the fate of the Romanovs after Russia left the war. The German government wanted the monarchy restored in Russia to crush the Bolsheviks and maintain good relations with the Central Powers.<ref>Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 502-505</ref> \n\nThe situation in Tobolsk changed for the worse on 26 March, when 250 ill-disciplined [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] arrived from the regional capital, [[Omsk]]. Not to be outdone, the soviet in [[Yekaterinburg]], the capital of the neighbouring [[Ural (region)|Ural region]], sent 400 Red Guards to exert their influence on the town.<ref>Service 2018, p. 145-148</ref> Disturbances between these rival groups and the lack of funds to pay the guard detachment caused them to send a delegation to Moscow to plead their case. The result was that Sovnarkom appointed their own [[commissar]] to take charge of Tobolsk and remove the Romanovs to Yekaterinburg, with the intention of eventually bringing Nicholas to a [[show trial]] in Moscow.<ref>Service 2018, p. 152-153</ref> The man selected was [[Vasily Yakovlev]], a veteran Bolshevik,<ref>Service 2018, p. 158</ref> Recruiting a body of loyal men ''en route'', Yakovlev arrived in Tobolsk on 22 April; he imposed his authority on the competing Red Guards factions, paid-off and [[Demobilization|demobilized]] the guard detachment, and placed further restrictions on the Romanovs.<ref>Service 2018, p. 160-161</ref> The next day, Yakovlev informed Kobylinsky that Nicholas was to be transferred to Yekaterinburg. Alexei was too ill to travel, so Alexandra elected to go with Nicholas along with Maria, while the other daughters would remain at Tobolsk until they were able to make the journey.<ref>Service 2018, p. 163-165</ref>\n\n====Yekaterinburg====\nAt 3 am on 25 April, the three Romanovs, their retinue, and the escort of Yakovlev's detachment, left Tobolsk in a convoy of nineteen [[tarantass]]es (four-wheeled carriages), as the river was still partly frozen which prevented the use of the ferry.<ref>Service 2018, p. 167</ref> After an arduous journey which included two overnight stops, fording rivers, frequent changes of horses and a foiled plot by the Yekaterinburg Red Guards to abduct and kill the prisoners, the party arrived at Tyumen and boarded a requisitioned train. Yakovlev was able to communicate securely with Moscow by means of a [[David Edward Hughes|Hughes]]' [[teleprinter]] and obtained agreement to change their destination to Omsk, where it was thought that the leadership were less likely to harm the Romanovs.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 170-174</ref> Leaving Tyumen early on 28 April, the train left towards Yekaterinburg, but quickly changed direction towards Omsk. This led the Yekaterinburg leaders to believe that Yakovlev was a traitor who was trying to take Nicholas to exile by way of [[Vladivostok]]; telegraph messages were sent, two thousand armed men were mobilised and a train was dispatched to arrest Yakovlev and the Romanovs. The Romanovs' train was halted at Omsk station and after a frantic exchange of cables with Moscow, it was agreed that they should go to Yekaterinburg in return for a guarantee of safety for the royal family; they finally arrived there on the morning of 30 April.<ref>Service 2018, pp. 179-182</ref>\n\nThey were imprisoned in the two-storey [[Ipatiev House]], the home of the military engineer Nikolay Nikolayevich Ipatiev, which ominously became referred to as the \"house of special purpose\". Here the Romanovs were kept under even stricter conditions; their retinue was further reduced and their possessions were searched.<ref>Service 2018, p. 203-204</ref> The remaining Romanovs left Tobolsk by river steamer on 20 May and arrived in Yekaterinburg three days later.<ref>Service 2018, p. 201</ref> By the first weeks of June, the Bolsheviks were becoming alarmed by the [[Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion]], whose forces were approaching the city from the east. This prompted a wave of executions of those in the region who were believed to be [[counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]], including [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], who was shot in [[Perm]] on 13 June.<ref>Rappaport 2009, p. 38</ref>\n\n=== Execution ===\n{{See also|Execution of the Romanov family}}\n[[File:Russian Imperial Family 1913.jpg|alt=|thumb|Nicholas with his family (left to right): Olga, Maria, Nicholas II, Alexandra Fyodorovna, Anastasia, Alexei, and Tatiana.

According to the account of Bolshevik officer [[Yakov Yurovsky]] (the chief executioner), in the early hours of 17 July 1918, the royal family was awakened around 2:00 am, got dressed, and were led down into a half-basement room at the back of the Ipatiev house. The pretext for this move was the family's safety, i.e. that anti-Bolshevik forces were approaching Yekaterinburg, and the house might be fired upon.<ref name=\"Nicholas 1998\">''Nicholas & Alexandra \u2013 The Last Imperial Family of Tsarist Russia'', Booth-Clibborn Editions, 1998, {{ISBN|1861540388}}</ref>\n\nPresent with Nicholas, Alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants, who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family: the Tsar's personal physician [[Eugene Botkin]], his wife's maid [[Anna Demidova]], and the family's chef, [[Ivan Kharitonov]], and footman, [[Alexei Trupp]]. A firing squad had been assembled and was waiting in an adjoining room, composed of seven Communist soldiers from Central Europe, and three local Bolsheviks, all under the command of Yurovsky.<ref name=\"Nicholas 1998\" />\n\nNicholas was carrying his son. When the family arrived in the basement, the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit on. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in, and when the empress and the heir were seated, the executioners filed into the room. Yurovsky announced to them that the Ural Soviet of Workers' Deputies had decided to execute them. A stunned Nicholas asked, \"What? What did you say?\" and turned toward his family. Yurovsky quickly repeated the order and Nicholas said, according to [[Peter Ermakov]], \"You know not what you do.\"\n\nThe executioners drew handguns and began shooting; Nicholas was the first to die. Yurovsky took credit afterwards for firing the first shot that killed the Tsar, but his protege \u2013 [[Grigory Petrovich Nikulin|Grigory Nikulin]] \u2013 said years later that Mikhail Medvedev had fired the shot that killed Nicholas. \"He fired the first shot. He killed the Tsar,\" he said in 1964 in a tape-recorded statement for the radio.<ref>Radzinsky p. 431</ref> Nicholas was shot several times in the chest (sometimes incorrectly said to have been shot in his head, but his skull bore no bullet wounds when it was discovered later). Anastasia, Tatiana, Olga, and Maria survived the first hail of bullets; the sisters were wearing over 1.3 kilograms of diamonds and precious gems sewn into their clothing, which provided some initial protection from the bullets and bayonets.<ref>[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] p. 8.</ref> They were then stabbed with bayonets and finally shot at close range in their heads.<ref>[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] p. 6.</ref>\n\nAn announcement from the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet of the Workers' and Peasants' Government emphasized that conspiracies had been exposed to free the ex-tsar, that counter-revolutionary forces were pressing in on Soviet Russian territory, and that the ex-tsar was guilty of unforgivable crimes against the nation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander, Robert |title=The Kitchen Boy: A Novel of the Last Tsar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0z8GNUhOqoC|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-1-101-20036-0}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In view of the enemy's proximity to Yekaterinburg and the exposure by the Cheka of a serious White Guard plot with the goal of abducting the former Tsar and his family\u2026 In light of the approach of counterrevolutionary bands toward the Red capital of the Urals and the possibility of the crowned executioner escaping trial by the people (a plot among the White Guards to try to abduct him and his family was exposed and the compromising documents will be published), the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet, fulfilling the will of the Revolution, resolved to shoot the former Tsar, Nikolai Romanov, who is guilty of countless, bloody, violent acts against the Russian people.<ref>Telegraph quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=l0z8GNUhOqoC ''The Kitchen Boy''] by Robert Alexander (unpaginated).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe bodies were driven to nearby woodland, searched and burned.

On 14 August 2000, they were recognised by the [[synod]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. This time they were not named as martyrs, since their deaths did not result immediately from their Christian faith; instead, they were canonized as [[passion bearer]]s. According to a statement by the Moscow synod, they were glorified as saints for the following reasons:\n\n{{quote|In the last Orthodox Russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the Gospel. In the suffering borne by the Royal Family in prison with humility, patience, and meekness, and in their martyrs' deaths in Yekaterinburg in the night of 17 July 1918 was revealed the light of the faith of Christ that conquers evil.}}\n\nHowever, Nicholas' canonization was controversial. The Russian Orthodox Church Abroad was split on the issue back in 1981, some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the Bolsheviks. It was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the Russian Orthodox Church has nothing to do with the martyr's personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed.<ref name=\"Massie\">[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church inside Russia rejected the family's classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith. Religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the Tsar's family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife, children and servants. For these opponents, the fact that the Tsar was, in private life, a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of Russia.<ref name=\"Massie\" />\n\nDespite the original opposition, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] inside Russia ultimately recognised the family as \"passion bearers,\" or people who met their deaths with Christian humility. Since the [[Late 20th Century|late 20th century]], believers have attributed healing from illnesses or conversion to the Orthodox Church to their prayers to the children of Nicholas Maria and Alexei, as well as to the rest of the family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.serfes.org/royal/miracleofmaria.htm|title=''Miracle of the Child Martyr Grand Duchess Maria''|last=Serfes, Demetrios|first=|date=|year=2000|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.serfes.org/royal/miracleprayers.htm|title=A Miracle Through the Prayers of Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarevich Alexis|last=Serfes, Demetrios|first=|date=|year=2000|website=The Royal Martyrs of Russia|url-status=dead|archive-url=|archive-date=6 February 2007|access-date=25 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHistorian Raymond Esthus states:\n: The contemporary assessments of Nicholas are remarkably uniform. He was described as shy, charming, gentle in disposition, fearful of controversy, indecisive, indulgent to his relatives, and deeply devoted to his family. Aleksandr Mosolov, who headed his Court Chancellery for sixteen years, wrote that Nicholas, though intelligent and well-educated, never adopted a definite, energetic attitude and loathed making a decision in the presence of others. Sergei Witte, who served Nicholas and his father for eleven years as Minister of Finance, commented that the Tsar was a well-intentioned child, but his actions were entirely dependent upon the character of his counselors, most of whom were bad.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Esthus, Raymond A. |title=Nicholas II and the Russo-Japanese War|journal=Russian Review|volume=40|issue=4|year=1981|pages=396\u2013411|jstor=129919|doi=10.2307/129919}}</ref>\n\nNicholas generally was considered for the most of the 20st century to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous Russian Empire,<ref>Ferro, Marc (1995) ''Nicholas II: Last of the Tsars''. New York: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-508192-7}}, p. 2</ref> although the influence of Soviet propaganda, on the general opinion on the monarch, which described him as a bloodthirsty tyrant, must be considered.

Massie]] provides a typical indictment of his incompetence:\n\n{{quote| ... there still are those who for political or other reasons continue to insist that Nicholas was \"Bloody Nicholas\". Most commonly, he is described as shallow, weak, stupid\u2014a one-dimensional figure presiding feebly over the last days of a corrupt and crumbling system. This, certainly, is the prevailing public image of the last Tsar. Historians admit that Nicholas was a \"good man\"\u2014the historical evidence of personal charm, gentleness, love of family, deep religious faith and strong Russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied\u2014but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant; what matters is that Nicholas was a bad tsar&nbsp;.... Essentially, the tragedy of Nicholas II was that he appeared in the wrong place in history.<ref>[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] pp. viii\u2013x.</ref>}}\n\nIn Russia, just after the rise of [[Soviet Union|the new regime]], the legacy of Nicholas II faced widespread criticism. Pavel Bykov, who in Russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the Tsar for the [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|newly-formed Soviet propaganda's regime]], denounced Nicholas as a \"tyrant, who paid with his life for the age-old repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the Russian people, over the impoverished and blood-soaked country\". Soviet-era historians noted that Nicholas II was not fit to be a statesman. It has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces. His regime was condemned for extensive use of the army, police, and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement. He was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism. With the punitive expeditions and courts-martial during the 1905 Revolution, the monarch became known as \"Nicholas the Bloody\". Nicholas's reign was seen as a time of suffering for Russians.<ref name=\"Kallistov\">{{cite book|author=Kallistov, D.

His father, Alexander III, who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty, unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy, and died when Nicholas was twenty-six. The new Tsar had learned nothing in the interval, and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy\u2014the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface. When a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the Russian fleet at Tsushima, he read it, stuffed it in his pocket, and went on playing tennis.<ref>Tuchman, Barbara W.

These included the Imperial German, Spanish, Italian, Danish and British armies.\n\nHe was [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Royal Scots Greys]] from 1894 until his death. On becoming Colonel-in-Chief he presented the Regiment with a white [[bearskin]], now worn by the bass drummer of the Pipes and Drums of the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]]. The Imperial Russian anthem is still played at dinner nights in the Officers' Mess, where there remains a portrait of the Tsar in Scots Greys uniform. Since his death, the Regiment has worn a black backing behind its cap badge as a symbol of [[mourning]].\n\n===Arms===\n[[File:Lesser CoA of the empire of Russia.svg|upright=1.05|center|thumb|Lesser Coat of Arms of the Empire of Russia and Letter Coat of Arms of the Emperor]]\n\n==Children==\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Image!!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n|colspan=5|'''By [[Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine]]''' (6 June 1872&nbsp;\u2013 17 July 1918, married on 26 November 1894)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Olgachair.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|15 November|1895|3 November}}||rowspan=\"5\"|[[Execution of the Romanov family|17 July 1918]]||rowspan=\"5\"|Shot, along with their parents, at [[Yekaterinburg]] by the [[Bolshevik]]s\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Tatiana Nikolaevna.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|10 June|1897|29 May}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:GrandDuchessMaria1914formal2.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899\u20131918)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|26 June|1899|14 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna Crisco edit letters removed.jpg|90px]] || [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna]]||{{OldStyleDate|18 June|1901|5 June}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[File:Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia.jpg|90px]] || [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich]]||{{OldStyleDate|12 August|1904|30 July}}\n|}\n\n== Wealth ==\nEstimates of Nicholas II's personal wealth have been vastly exaggerated. As ''Emperor of All The Russias'', and an [[Autocracy|autocrat]], the resources under his command were virtually incalculable. However, the vast majority of this was owned by the state as [[Crown property]]; the Romanov family's ''personal wealth'' was only a small fraction of this. As monarch, the income of Nicholas was 24 million gold [[Ruble|roubles]] per annum: this derived from a yearly allowance from the Treasury, and from the profits of Crown farmland.<ref name=\"Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64\">Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', New York, Atheneum, 1967, p64</ref> From this income, he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings. \"Before the end of the year, the Tsar was usually penniless; sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn.\"<ref name=\"Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64\"/> According to the Grand Marshal of the Court, Count Paul Benckendorff, the family's total financial resources amounted to between 12.5 and 17.5 million roubles.<ref>Clarke, William ''The Lost Fortune of the Tsars'', St. Martin's Griffin; Reprint edition, 1996, p101.</ref> As a comparison, Prince Felix Yusupov estimated his family's worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to 50 million gold roubles.<ref>Ferrand, Jacques ''Les Princes Youssoupoff & les comtes Soumarkoff Elston'', Paris 1991</ref>\n\n== Documentaries and films ==\n{{See also|List of films about the Romanovs}}\nSeveral films about Nicholas II and his family have been made, including ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' (1971), ''[[Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna]]'' (1986), ''[[Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny]]'' (1996 [[HBO]]), ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997), and two Russian adaptations ''[[Assassin of the Tsar]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Romanovs: An Imperial Family]]'' (2000).\nIn 2017 the film ''[[Matilda (2017 film)]]'' was released.

Sarban's songs are unrivalled for their choice of poetry, originality of composition, and sophisticated orchestration. Known as the [[Frank Sinatra]] of Afghanistan, he was the first Afghan artist to break away from the prevalent musical forms in Afghanistan at the time, namely the Indian inspired pure classical tradition (epitomized by [[Ustad Sarahang]], [[Rahim Bakhsh]] and others), and the 'mohali' (regional & folk) musical traditions exemplified by the Pashto music, logari, qataghani, qarsak etc.  In partnership with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast, Sarban's music fused elements, rhythms and orchestration of the western musical traditions of jazz and \"Belle Chanson\" with the prevalent Afghan musical tradition to create a unique and lasting style which became an inspiration for all ensuing artists including the great [[Ahmad Zahir]].\n\nBorn 1930 in Kabul, Afghanistan. Sarban sang predominantly in Dari as well as Pashto, possessing a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Persian poetic tradition (ranging from the poetry of Hafiz, Rumi, Khayyam to Khusro and Bedil).  Apart from his first few songs, Sarban chose the poems (lyrics) to all his songs, based on his own personal knowledge of the Persian literary canon. During the early stages of his career, Sarban worked with many musicians and composers such as Nainawaz and Taranasaz. However, during the middle and late stages of his career, he worked almost exclusively with the composer Salim Sarmast.  Sarban's songs Ahesta Bero, Khorsheede Man<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kZlYFy4zms</ref> Ay Sarban, Dar Damane Sahra, Biya ke Borem ba Mazar, Moshke Taza Mebarad, Ay Shakhe Gul, Biya Ta Gul Beyafshanem, Ya Maula Dilam Tang Amada, Take Nabashi Hamdame Jani, Suraya Chara Am Kun, Tu Aftabi Wo Man, and many others are rank among the highest in the Afghan musical repertoire and are admired for their depth, refinement, and beauty.\n\nSarban's legacy permanently altered the Persian (Dari) musical tradition in Afghanistan. Almost every great artist that came after him including Ahmad Zahir & Farhad Darya considered him their primary source of inspiration and they ranked his musical repertoire as their main model of emulation.  A national icon and celebrity in Afghanistan, Sarban is also widely admired in other Persian-speaking countries like [[Iran]] and [[Tajikistan]], where he gave live performances at the height of his career.\n\nSarban's artistic greatness, due to his eccentric and mysticist temperament, did not translate into financial prosperity for himself.  He was famed for refusing to do home (majlisi) shows for pay, and for giving the proceeds from his highly successful concerts to the beggars and the needy, without regard for his own or his family's financial well-being.  Sarban stopped producing songs in the 1960s. During the 1970s he was mainly involved in concerts & in re-recording his earlier music for audiocassettes (his original recordings at Radio Kabul at the time could not be converted to audio cassette form due to lack of high quality sound equipment in Afghanistan). In 1984, Sarban suffered from a stroke which left him paralyzed and unable to speak.  This effectively ended his musical career.  During the civil war and unrest of 1990s in Kabul, Sarban left Afghanistan and migrated to Peshawar, Pakistan.   He lived in Pakistan until 1994 when he died in abject poverty.  12 years after his death, his remains were taken back to Afghanistan for reburial.<ref name=farhaddarya>[http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html Farhad Darya website: Bringing Sarban's remains from Pakistan to Afghanistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102084131/http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html |date=November 2, 2013 }}</ref> to Kabul Afghanistan where he was reburied with pomp and honour as a national hero of Afghanistan for his contributions to furthering the art and culture of the country.\n\n== Career ==\nSarban gained popularity due to his music style, which was highly unconventional for its time, but it went on to become the gold standard of Afghan musical style. The legendary Afghan singer [[Ahmad Zahir]] was a huge fan of Sarban and incorporated his original songs and musical style into Zahir's own collection.  Sarban's popularity is mainly with the elite and educated classes in Afghanistan where appreciation of his music is considered the height of sophistication, learning, and elegance.\n\nSarban's path to art and his immortality was purely accidental.  Being born in a highly educated and accomplished family, Sarban was the only male family members who had not gone to university.  Sarban's career in art began when the director and \"father\" of the Afghan National Theatre, Ustad Abdul Rashid Latifi overheard him hum a song in a hamaam (communal baths customary in Kabul at the time)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRkIK9OsG6I].  Ustad Latifi, however, did not conceive of Sarban as a singer since singing, at that time in Afghanistan, was a profession chosen very early in life and required years of work and training. Instead, Latifi asked Sarban to join his theatre troupe as a lead heroic actor, mainly due to his elegant & erudite elucidation and accent in Dari, which Sarban had naturally learned in his family upbringing.  Sarban accepted the offer to work as an actor because, according to him, thing were tough and he had no prospects of employment and of feeding his young family.  While acting in the theatre, Sarban was rediscovered by the composers Nainawaz and Taranasaz for his extraordinary and evocative baritone voice.  Thus, without any artistic, musical, or vocal training in voice or singing, Sarban was offered the opportunity to become a singer.  His first recorded song was \"Man Akher Az Ghamat Ay Mahro,\" and \"Tu Aftabi Wo Man.\"  The songs, played in Kabul Radio, generated a great degree of interest and enthusiasm among the public in Sarban's voice.\n\nUnlike any other great Afghan artist, Sarban stands alone in that he had no previous musical training in either playing instruments or using his voice.  He, however, had an acute ear for musical sound, and more importantly, a broad and profound understanding of Persian poetry.  It is, perhaps, because of his lack of training and background in the predominant musical traditions in Afghanistan that Sarban became the artist who would free Afghan music from subservience to the Indian, Iranian, and folkloric musical traditions which dominated at the time.  In cooperation with composers, mainly Salim Sarmast, Sarban managed to create a musical language that was unique to Afghanistan.  Although his first few songs \"Tu Aftabi wo man,\" and \"Man akher az ghamat,\" were made strictly in the Indian classical model, his immediately ensuing songs \"Rahm kon ram kon,\" \"Saqi dile ma,\" \"ya maula dilam tang amada,\" \"shod abro para para,\" and the super hit songs, \"az bas ke nazanini,\" \"asare shikanje maujam,\" \"Man nainawaz am,\" and \"Harja ke safer karma,\" [the latter two songs covered by Ahmad Zahir] became models of a new sound that broke away from the traditional musical vocabulary in Afghanistan at the time.  This new sound was made immortal by the creation of a slew of songs in later years (such as Ahesta Bero, Ay Sarban, Dar Damane Sahra, Khorsheede Man, Ay Shakhe Gul, Moshke Taza Mebarad, Dosh Az Masjid, Deshab ba khoda, Nameporsi Naame man, Sobhe Keshaare Maiwar, Take nabashad ham dame jani, Ta ba kai ay mah liqa, Een ghame be haya mara, haal ke deewana shodam merawi, Aye shake gul) which defined Afghan music (especially the Persian musical genre) for decades to come.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarban's personal life, especially his numerous family troubles, constantly hindered his complete devotion to his musical career.  Sarban was never able to fully commit himself to his art because of many family tragedies and difficulties that befell him persistently throughout his life.  He routinely fell into deep clinical depression due to the numerous concerns in his personal and family life such as the loss of his close relatives and family members including his beloved brothers (for their political activities).  Consequently, he took to heavy drinking to deal with his many personal problems.  This took a heavy toll on his career, as he failed to produce any original music after the mid 1970s.  Nevertheless, his musical legacy and influence remain unparalleled in Afghanistan.\n\n== Contributions ==\nSarban's greatest contribution to Afghan music was the creation of a unique Afghan sound\u2014distinct from the Indian, Iranian, regional (folkloric), western traditions.  His songs set an example for all pursuing Afghan artists to compose & perform in a style that was distinctly identifiable as Afghan, as opposed to mere imitation of other musical traditions.  His work with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast led to the creation of a rhythm, melody line, harmony, and texture which became the essence of the Dari (Persian) sound.  This sound was a major influence on many later musicians including Nainawaz, Ahmad Zahir, Ustad Zaland, Ahmad Wali, & later Farhad Darya.\n\nBesides a unique and new musical sound, Sarban was the first artist to choose poems & lyrics for his songs which were not primarily about romantic love.  The vast majority of songs in Afghanistan up to that point chose poems/lyrics about romance, love, longing, and the trials and tribulations related to love.  Sarban considered this trend to be frivolous and glib.  He, therefore, made a sharp departure from this tradition, and chose social, political, economic, spiritual, and even religious matters as subject matter for his songs.  An astute student of Dari/Persian literature, he personally picked poems  which were considered by many to be not only unconventional but unsuitable for being turned into songs.  For instance, Een Ghame Be Haya, Ay Sarban, and Dar Damane Sahra, Ay Shakhe Gul, Harja Ke Safar Kardam, Beya Ta Gal Beyafshanem, were considered too erudite, abstract, and gloomy to be composed into songs.  Almost all composers declined to consider them for composition.  Salim Sarmast was the only composer who offered to do the task.  Today, these are among the best songs of Afghan musical tradition.  Sometimes, if he did not get his way & was pressured by his employer (Kabul Radio) to sing more conventional love songs, he would pick a completely unrelated verse or two from another poem & insert it in the romantic song composed for him.  For instance, in his song \"Soraya chara Am kon,\" which contains a traditional romantic subject matter, he violently inserted a completely unrelated verse:\n\nAgar Dastam Rasad Ba Charkhe Gardoon\n(If my hands could reach/grab the one who runs the universe)\nAzo Porsam Ke Een Chook Auto Aan Choon\n(I shall demand of him, how is this so?)\nYaki Ra Dadayi Sad Nazo Nehmat\n(One person you lavish with a hundred gifts & prides)\nYaki Ra Qorse Jawr alooda Bar Khoon\n(But another you torture with the yoke of blood & misery)\n\nSarban was the first person to put lyrics to the iconic \"[[Ahesta Boro]]\" (Step softly) anthem played for all brides on their wedding day. These lyrics, along with the composition, have become an expected and celebrated feature of Afghan weddings, with the composition also having been sung by many popular Afghan artists. Muslim singer [[Sami Yusuf]] used the tune of a Sarban composition, \"Beyake Berem Ba Mazaar\" (Come, Lets Go to Mazaar), in his song \"Hasbi Rasbi\". Many others have covered the song and composition as well, both within Afghanistan and in other Persian cultures.\n\nSarban's \"Moshke Taza Mebarad\" (based on an obscure poem glorifying the city of his birth, Kabul) became one of the models for patriotic and national songs, and is still one of the most evocative and emotionally stirring Patriotic songs of Afghanistan due to its original and moving composition and evocative singing by Sarban.  It is said that many composers laughed at Sarban when he suggested the poem for composition into a national song due to the poem's complex vocabulary and imagery, but once again, his main artistic collaborator Salim Sarmast came to the rescue and set the lyrics to a sublime composition which moves Afghans to this day with the words\nMoshke Taza Mebarad Abre Bhmand kabul\n(Fresh Musk Scatter the silky Clouds of Kabul)\nMauje Sabza mekarad Koyo barzane Kabul\n(Waves & waves of greenery grow the mountains and rocks of Kabul)\n\nIn addition to the various compositions and lyrics he contributed, Sarban was also arguably symbolic and typical of Afghanistan's culture in his day, reflected in his singing of the beautiful poetry of many famous poets from ages past, such as Hafiz Shirazi, to whom he paid tribute with the song \"Dozh as Masjid (Soye Maykhanaa Aamad Peer e Ma)\" (Last night, upon departing the Mosque, our Master headed towards the Tavern). Sarban's cover is a cut down version of the original poem, retaining 3 of the 10 verses composed by Shirazi.\n\nSarban's compositions, like \"Dozh as Masjid\", feature various styles of Sufi or mystical poetry, which use the metaphorical language of romantic love, to describe the author's relationship with God.  Often such poems use words such as \"beloved\" figuratively in reference to God, and it could be argued that Sarban was part of a musical movement in Afghanistan which sought to enlighten the audience as much as it entertained them.  Certainly, in his own personal life, Sarban was highly influenced by the Sufi tradition of mysticism.  This is evident not only in his choice of poetry, but also in his mannerisms, such as his constant raising of his forefinger when speaking or singing (the raised forefinger is the mystic's gesture denoting not only the oneness of God, but also the oneness of all creation and being.\n\nArguably, the most highly acclaimed song in Persian Language in Afghanistan is Sarban's Khorsheede Man Kojayee, which has been covered by numerous Afghan Artists.  The song, considered by critics as the greatest Afghan Persian song, was based on a poem by the Kurdish Persian poet Abolqasem Lahouti and composed by Salim Sarmast.  The song exemplifies the highest tradition of Afghan music in which sublime poetry is fused with hypnotizing melody & music, and extraordinarily emotive elocution.  Furthermore, Sarban's songs \"Ay Sarban\" (based on a poem by Saadi), Dar Damane Sahra are considered among the most accomplished examples of the Afghan musical repertoire.\n\nAlmost all of Sarban's songs were recorded in the first decade of his career\u20141960s.  Sadly, the vast majority of his original repertoire, which was recorded with a full orchestra, is not available to us. Except for a few songs from the original recordings (Khorsheede Man, Asare Shikanje Maujam, Az Bas Ke Nazanini), the overwhelming majority of Sarban's songs are re-recordings which were done in late 1970s and released in audio cassettes.  These later versions lack the full orchestra and chorus and rely only a few instruments.  Furthermore, Sarban's vocal gifts were past their prime at that point.  Most of originals recordings which were held at Kabul Radio, were destroyed by the Taliban in late 1990s when the Taliban captured Kabul & destroyed a large number of original recordings of the Afghan musical repertoire in Kabul Radio, and Afghan Television.  As a result, it is possible the some of his most memorable recordings are permanently lost.  Recently, however, a few vintage and rare recordings of Sarban's records (for instance the original of his song Khorsheede Man, and Asare Shikanje Moujam) were uploaded by some good samaritans on YouTube.\n\nSarban's songs have been covered both live and in recording by a vast number of Persian singes in countries ranging from Afghanistan, Iran, Tajikistan, to Uzbekistan.  In Afghanistan, his song \"Ahesta Bero\" is played in every Persian wedding as the bride walks to the aisle, in the same manner as Wagner's Bridal Chorus \"Here Comes the Bride\" is played each time a bride in the west walks the aisle.  His song such as Ay Sarban is covered by hugely popular singers such as Googoosh (from Iran) and Ahmad Zahir from Afghanistan.  Every successful musician from Ahmad Zahir to Farhad Darya cite him as one of their main influences.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSarban was born in Saragy, an old area of Kabul to the prominent and highly respected Mahmoody family.  His father was a well educated, highly respected, and prosperous rice merchant.  The Mahmoodys were a family of illustrious doctors and surgeons highly respected among the educated elite of Kabul.  However, The Mahmoody family had been at the forefront of social agitation and political activism for decades.  As a result, his family was continuously persecuted by the monarchy at first, and then by successive governments which came after the monarchy.  This persecution resulted in a huge diminishment of the family's wealth to the point that by the time Sarban was in his teens, they were virtually penniless.  Furthermore, the majority of the most prominent and successful family members (including Sarban's only two brothers, and almost all of his first cousins) had been either executed or exiled by the time Sarban had begun his musical career.\n\nThese were the conditions under which Sarban lived.  Added to this was immense financial hardships, exacerbated by his familial background because most doors to work had been closed to him.  These conditions profoundly influenced his choice of poetry and his music.  For instance, he chose the poem \"Een Ghame Be Haya,\" for composition when his first cousin Engineer Latif Mahmoody had been arrested and executed.\n\nSarban was shy and reclusive throughout his life. He seemed indifferent to fame, celebrity, and wealth for his entire life, even when through the prime of his career, which began peaking in the 1960s <ref>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/399319/afghans-sing-again-of-love-and-war/ AFP / ''The Express Tribune'': Afghans sing again -- of love and war]</ref> At the peak of his celebrity, he polarized the Afghan intellectual class between those who loved and referred him for his art and those who criticized him for his personal life (i.e. his eccentric behaviour, his fondness for alcohol etc., rather than his artistic accomplishments).  Speculations said he had a constant problem with alcohol with claims he couldn't sing live on [[Kabul Radio]] without having a drink first. There are apocryphal stories that he had deep depression because he fell in love with one of his cousins, but reportedly she or her father did not accept his proposal, and that as a result Sarban was heartbroken and never married. However, these are mere rumours.  Sarban did fight with severe bouts of depression throughout his life, but this was not because of unrequited love.  Many of his close relatives (including his younger brother) were arrested for their political activities and executed by the communist regime at the time, and many others were imprisoned or forced to flee in exile.  This and the financial difficulties of raising a family without any reliable source of income were the main reasons for his depressive bouts.  As regards to his failed love with his cousin, these are mere rumours.  His close friends and family all dismiss this as urban legend.  Sarban was indeed married to one of his cousins, and he has four children (three daughters and a son).  HIs son Abdulrab Sarban also recorded an album covering some of Sarban's famous songs.  Sarban suffered a stroke in 1984 which incapacitated him & rendered him speechless.  Due to the political turmoil in Afghanistan, he and his family emigrated to Pakistan where he died in poverty. But after 12 years of his death, the Afghan Government made arrangements with his family to relocate his remains to Kabul.\n\nDiscography & Songs:\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sarban, Abdul Rahim}}\n[[Category:Afghan singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan musicians]]\n[[Category:Afghan Tajik people]]\n[[Category:Tajik singers]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:1993 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan emigrants to Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Afghan male singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=October 2013}}\n{{copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n|name           = Sarban<br>{{nq|\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646}}\n|background     = solo_singer\n|image          = \n|caption        =\n|birth_name     = Abdul Rahim \n|birth_date     = 1930\n|birth_place    = [[Kabul, Afghanistan]]\n|death_date     = April 2nd, 1993 (aged 63)\n|death_place    = [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]]\n|genre          = [[Soft rock]]<br>[[Classical music]]\n|occupation     = Singer\n|instrument     = [[Pump organ|Harmonium]]\n|years_active   = 1950's-1986 \n}}\n'''Abdul-Rahim Mahmoodi S\u0101rb\u0101n''' ({{lang-fa|\u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u06cc\u0645 \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646}}), known simply as '''Sarban''', was an [[Afghan singer]] (1930 \u2013 April 2, 1993) \nBorn in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] he is known for his unique voice and [[music style]] that no other singer from Afghanistan has been able to surpass. Sarban's songs are unrivalled for their choice of poetry, originality of composition, and sophisticated orchestration. Known as the [[Frank Sinatra]] of Afghanistan, he was the first Afghan artist to break away from the prevalent musical forms in Afghanistan at the time, namely the Indian inspired pure classical tradition (epitomized by [[Ustad Sarahang]], [[Rahim Bakhsh]] and others), and the 'mohali' (regional & folk) musical traditions exemplified by the Pashto music, logari, qataghani, qarsak etc.  In partnership with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast, Sarban's music fused elements, rhythms and orchestration of the western musical traditions of jazz and \"Belle Chanson\" with the prevalent Afghan musical tradition to create a unique and lasting style which became an inspiration for all ensuing artists including the great [[Ahmad Zahir]].\n\nBorn 1930 in Kabul, Afghanistan. Sarban sang predominantly in Dari as well as Pashto, possessing a deep and comprehensive understanding of the Persian poetic tradition (ranging from the poetry of Hafiz, Rumi, Khayyam to Khusro and Bedil).  Apart from his first few songs, Sarban chose the poems (lyrics) to all his songs, based on his own personal knowledge of the Persian literary canon. During the early stages of his career, Sarban worked with many musicians and composers such as Nainawaz and Taranasaz. However, during the middle and late stages of his career, he worked almost exclusively with the composer Salim Sarmast.  Sarban's songs Ahesta Bero, Khorsheede Man<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kZlYFy4zms</ref> Ay Sarban, Dar Damane Sahra, Biya ke Borem ba Mazar, Moshke Taza Mebarad, Ay Shakhe Gul, Biya Ta Gul Beyafshanem, Ya Maula Dilam Tang Amada, Take Nabashi Hamdame Jani, Suraya Chara Am Kun, Tu Aftabi Wo Man, and many others are rank among the highest in the Afghan musical repertoire and are admired for their depth, refinement, and beauty.\n\nSarban's legacy permanently altered the Persian (Dari) musical tradition in Afghanistan. Almost every great artist that came after him including Ahmad Zahir & Farhad Darya considered him their primary source of inspiration and they ranked his musical repertoire as their main model of emulation.  A national icon and celebrity in Afghanistan, Sarban is also widely admired in other Persian-speaking countries like [[Iran]] and [[Tajikistan]], where he gave live performances at the height of his career.\n\nSarban's artistic greatness, due to his eccentric and mysticist temperament, did not translate into financial prosperity for himself.  He was famed for refusing to do home (majlisi) shows for pay, and for giving the proceeds from his highly successful concerts to the beggars and the needy, without regard for his own or his family's financial well-being.  Sarban stopped producing songs in the 1960s. During the 1970s he was mainly involved in concerts & in re-recording his earlier music for audiocassettes (his original recordings at Radio Kabul at the time could not be converted to audio cassette form due to lack of high quality sound equipment in Afghanistan). In 1984, Sarban suffered from a stroke which left him paralyzed and unable to speak.  This effectively ended his musical career.  During the civil war and unrest of 1990s in Kabul, Sarban left Afghanistan and migrated to Peshawar, Pakistan.   He lived in Pakistan until 1994 when he died in abject poverty.  12 years after his death, his remains were taken back to Afghanistan for reburial.<ref name=farhaddarya>[http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html Farhad Darya website: Bringing Sarban's remains from Pakistan to Afghanistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102084131/http://www.farhaddarya.info/latest_news_sarban_remains.html |date=November 2, 2013 }}</ref> to Kabul Afghanistan where he was reburied with pomp and honour as a national hero of Afghanistan for his contributions to furthering the art and culture of the country.\n\n== Career ==\nSarban gained popularity due to his music style, which was highly unconventional for its time, but it went on to become the gold standard of Afghan musical style. The legendary Afghan singer [[Ahmad Zahir]] was a huge fan of Sarban and incorporated his original songs and musical style into Zahir's own collection.  Sarban's popularity is mainly with the elite and educated classes in Afghanistan where appreciation of his music is considered the height of sophistication, learning, and elegance.\n\nSarban's path to art and his immortality was purely accidental.  Being born in a highly educated and accomplished family, Sarban was the only male family members who had not gone to university.  Sarban's career in art began when the director and \"father\" of the Afghan National Theatre, Ustad Abdul Rashid Latifi overheard him hum a song in a hamaam (communal baths customary in Kabul at the time)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRkIK9OsG6I].  Ustad Latifi, however, did not conceive of Sarban as a singer since singing, at that time in Afghanistan, was a profession chosen very early in life and required years of work and training. Instead, Latifi asked Sarban to join his theatre troupe as a lead heroic actor, mainly due to his elegant & erudite elucidation and accent in Dari, which Sarban had naturally learned in his family upbringing.  Sarban accepted the offer to work as an actor because, according to him, thing were tough and he had no prospects of employment and of feeding his young family.  While acting in the theatre, Sarban was rediscovered by the composers Nainawaz and Taranasaz for his extraordinary and evocative baritone voice.  Thus, without any artistic, musical, or vocal training in voice or singing, Sarban was offered the opportunity to become a singer.  His first recorded song was \"Man Akher Az Ghamat Ay Mahro,\" and \"Tu Aftabi Wo Man.\"  The songs, played in Kabul Radio, generated a great degree of interest and enthusiasm among the public in Sarban's voice.\n\nUnlike any other great Afghan artist, Sarban stands alone in that he had no previous musical training in either playing instruments or using his voice.  He, however, had an acute ear for musical sound, and more importantly, a broad and profound understanding of Persian poetry.  It is, perhaps, because of his lack of training and background in the predominant musical traditions in Afghanistan that Sarban became the artist who would free Afghan music from subservience to the Indian, Iranian, and folkloric musical traditions which dominated at the time.  In cooperation with composers, mainly Salim Sarmast, Sarban managed to create a musical language that was unique to Afghanistan.  Although his first few songs \"Tu Aftabi wo man,\" and \"Man akher az ghamat,\" were made strictly in the Indian classical model, his immediately ensuing songs \"Rahm kon ram kon,\" \"Saqi dile ma,\" \"ya maula dilam tang amada,\" \"shod abro para para,\" and the super hit songs, \"az bas ke nazanini,\" \"asare shikanje maujam,\" \"Man nainawaz am,\" and \"Harja ke safer karma,\" [the latter two songs covered by Ahmad Zahir] became models of a new sound that broke away from the traditional musical vocabulary in Afghanistan at the time.  This new sound was made immortal by the creation of a slew of songs in later years (such as Ahesta Bero, Ay Sarban, Dar Damane Sahra, Khorsheede Man, Ay Shakhe Gul, Moshke Taza Mebarad, Dosh Az Masjid, Deshab ba khoda, Nameporsi Naame man, Sobhe Keshaare Maiwar, Take nabashad ham dame jani, Ta ba kai ay mah liqa, Een ghame be haya mara, haal ke deewana shodam merawi, Aye shake gul) which defined Afghan music (especially the Persian musical genre) for decades to come.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarban's personal life, especially his numerous family troubles, constantly hindered his complete devotion to his musical career.  Sarban was never able to fully commit himself to his art because of many family tragedies and difficulties that befell him persistently throughout his life.  He routinely fell into deep clinical depression due to the numerous concerns in his personal and family life such as the loss of his close relatives and family members including his beloved brothers (for their political activities).  Consequently, he took to heavy drinking to deal with his many personal problems.  This took a heavy toll on his career, as he failed to produce any original music after the mid 1970s.  Nevertheless, his musical legacy and influence remain unparalleled in Afghanistan.\n\n== Contributions ==\nSarban's greatest contribution to Afghan music was the creation of a unique Afghan sound\u2014distinct from the Indian, Iranian, regional (folkloric), western traditions.  His songs set an example for all pursuing Afghan artists to compose & perform in a style that was distinctly identifiable as Afghan, as opposed to mere imitation of other musical traditions.  His work with the legendary composer Salim Sarmast led to the creation of a rhythm, melody line, harmony, and texture which became the essence of the Dari (Persian) sound.  This sound was a major influence on many later musicians including Nainawaz, Ahmad Zahir, Ustad Zaland, Ahmad Wali, & later Farhad Darya.\n\nBesides a unique and new musical sound, Sarban was the first artist to choose poems & lyrics for his songs which were not primarily about romantic love.  The vast majority of songs in Afghanistan up to that point chose poems/lyrics about romance, love, longing, and the trials and tribulations related to love.  Sarban considered this trend to be frivolous and glib.  He, therefore, made a sharp departure from this tradition, and chose social, political, economic, spiritual, and even religious matters as subject matter for his songs.  An astute student of Dari/Persian literature, he personally picked poems  which were considered by many to be not only unconventional but unsuitable for being turned into songs.  For instance, Een Ghame Be Haya, Ay Sarban, and Dar Damane Sahra, Ay Shakhe Gul, Harja Ke Safar Kardam, Beya Ta Gal Beyafshanem, were considered too erudite, abstract, and gloomy to be composed into songs.  Almost all composers declined to consider them for composition.  Salim Sarmast was the only composer who offered to do the task.  Today, these are among the best songs of Afghan musical tradition.  Sometimes, if he did not get his way & was pressured by his employer (Kabul Radio) to sing more conventional love songs, he would pick a completely unrelated verse or two from another poem & insert it in the romantic song composed for him.  For instance, in his song \"Soraya chara Am kon,\" which contains a traditional romantic subject matter, he violently inserted a completely unrelated verse:\n\nAgar Dastam Rasad Ba Charkhe Gardoon\n(If my hands could reach/grab the one who runs the universe)\nAzo Porsam Ke Een Chook Auto Aan Choon\n(I shall demand of him, how is this so?)\nYaki Ra Dadayi Sad Nazo Nehmat\n(One person you lavish with a hundred gifts & prides)\nYaki Ra Qorse Jawr alooda Bar Khoon\n(But another you torture with the yoke of blood & misery)\n\nSarban was the first person to put lyrics to the iconic \"[[Ahesta Boro]]\" (Step softly) anthem played for all brides on their wedding day. These lyrics, along with the composition, have become an expected and celebrated feature of Afghan weddings, with the composition also having been sung by many popular Afghan artists. Muslim singer [[Sami Yusuf]] used the tune of a Sarban composition, \"Beyake Berem Ba Mazaar\" (Come, Lets Go to Mazaar), in his song \"Hasbi Rasbi\". Many others have covered the song and composition as well, both within Afghanistan and in other Persian cultures.\n\nSarban's \"Moshke Taza Mebarad\" (based on an obscure poem glorifying the city of his birth, Kabul) became one of the models for patriotic and national songs, and is still one of the most evocative and emotionally stirring Patriotic songs of Afghanistan due to its original and moving composition and evocative singing by Sarban.  It is said that many composers laughed at Sarban when he suggested the poem for composition into a national song due to the poem's complex vocabulary and imagery, but once again, his main artistic collaborator Salim Sarmast came to the rescue and set the lyrics to a sublime composition which moves Afghans to this day with the words\nMoshke Taza Mebarad Abre Bhmand kabul\n(Fresh Musk Scatter the silky Clouds of Kabul)\nMauje Sabza mekarad Koyo barzane Kabul\n(Waves & waves of greenery grow the mountains and rocks of Kabul)\n\nIn addition to the various compositions and lyrics he contributed, Sarban was also arguably symbolic and typical of Afghanistan's culture in his day, reflected in his singing of the beautiful poetry of many famous poets from ages past, such as Hafiz Shirazi, to whom he paid tribute with the song \"Dozh as Masjid (Soye Maykhanaa Aamad Peer e Ma)\" (Last night, upon departing the Mosque, our Master headed towards the Tavern). Sarban's cover is a cut down version of the original poem, retaining 3 of the 10 verses composed by Shirazi.\n\nSarban's compositions, like \"Dozh as Masjid\", feature various styles of Sufi or mystical poetry, which use the metaphorical language of romantic love, to describe the author's relationship with God.  Often such poems use words such as \"beloved\" figuratively in reference to God, and it could be argued that Sarban was part of a musical movement in Afghanistan which sought to enlighten the audience as much as it entertained them.  Certainly, in his own personal life, Sarban was highly influenced by the Sufi tradition of mysticism.  This is evident not only in his choice of poetry, but also in his mannerisms, such as his constant raising of his forefinger when speaking or singing (the raised forefinger is the mystic's gesture denoting not only the oneness of God, but also the oneness of all creation and being.\n\nArguably, the most highly acclaimed song in Persian Language in Afghanistan is Sarban's Khorsheede Man Kojayee, which has been covered by numerous Afghan Artists.  The song, considered by critics as the greatest Afghan Persian song was based on a poem by the Kurdish Persian poet Abolqasem Lahouti and composed by Salim Sarmast.  The song exemplifies the highest tradition of Afghan music in which sublime poetry is fused with hypnotizing melody & music, and extraordinarily emotive elocution.  Furthermore, Sarban's songs \"Ay Sarban\" (based on a poem by Saadi), Dar Damane Sahra are considered among the most accomplished examples of the Afghan musical repertoire.\n\nAlmost all of Sarban's songs were recorded in the first decade of his career\u20141960s.  Sadly, the vast majority of his original repertoire, which was recorded with a full orchestra, is not available to us. Except for a few songs from the original recordings (Khorsheede Man, Asare Shikanje Maujam, Az Bas Ke Nazanini), the overwhelming majority of Sarban's songs are re-recordings which were done in late 1970s and released in audio cassettes.  These later versions lack the full orchestra and chorus and rely only a few instruments.  Furthermore, Sarban's vocal gifts were past their prime at that point.  Most of originals recordings which were held at Kabul Radio, were destroyed by the Taliban in late 1990s when the Taliban captured Kabul & destroyed a large number of original recordings of the Afghan musical repertoire in Kabul Radio, and Afghan Television.  As a result, it is possible the some of his most memorable recordings are permanently lost.  Recently, however, a few vintage and rare recordings of Sarban's records (for instance the original of his song Khorsheede Man, and Asare Shikanje Moujam) were uploaded by some good samaritans on YouTube.\n\nSarban's songs have been covered both live and in recording by a vast number of Persian singes in countries ranging from Afghanistan, Iran, Tajikistan, to Uzbekistan.  In Afghanistan, his song \"Ahesta Bero\" is played in every Persian wedding as the bride walks to the aisle, in the same manner as Wagner's Bridal Chorus \"Here Comes the Bride\" is played each time a bride in the west walks the aisle.  His song such as Ay Sarban is covered by hugely popular singers such as Googoosh (from Iran) and Ahmad Zahir from Afghanistan.  Every successful musician from Ahmad Zahir to Farhad Darya cite him as one of their main influences.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSarban was born in Saragy, an old area of Kabul to the prominent and highly respected Mahmoody family.  His father was a well educated, highly respected, and prosperous rice merchant.  The Mahmoodys were a family of illustrious doctors and surgeons highly respected among the educated elite of Kabul.  However, The Mahmoody family had been at the forefront of social agitation and political activism for decades.  As a result, his family was continuously persecuted by the monarchy at first, and then by successive governments which came after the monarchy.  This persecution resulted in a huge diminishment of the family's wealth to the point that by the time Sarban was in his teens, they were virtually penniless.  Furthermore, the majority of the most prominent and successful family members (including Sarban's only two brothers, and almost all of his first cousins) had been either executed or exiled by the time Sarban had begun his musical career.\n\nThese were the conditions under which Sarban lived.  Added to this was immense financial hardships, exacerbated by his familial background because most doors to work had been closed to him.  These conditions profoundly influenced his choice of poetry and his music.  For instance, he chose the poem \"Een Ghame Be Haya,\" for composition when his first cousin Engineer Latif Mahmoody had been arrested and executed.\n\nSarban was shy and reclusive throughout his life. He seemed indifferent to fame, celebrity, and wealth for his entire life, even when through the prime of his career, which began peaking in the 1960s <ref>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/399319/afghans-sing-again-of-love-and-war/ AFP / ''The Express Tribune'': Afghans sing again -- of love and war]</ref> At the peak of his celebrity, he polarized the Afghan intellectual class between those who loved and referred him for his art and those who criticized him for his personal life (i.e. his eccentric behaviour, his fondness for alcohol etc., rather than his artistic accomplishments).  Speculations said he had a constant problem with alcohol with claims he couldn't sing live on [[Kabul Radio]] without having a drink first. There are apocryphal stories that he had deep depression because he fell in love with one of his cousins, but reportedly she or her father did not accept his proposal, and that as a result Sarban was heartbroken and never married. However, these are mere rumours.  Sarban did fight with severe bouts of depression throughout his life, but this was not because of unrequited love.  Many of his close relatives (including his younger brother) were arrested for their political activities and executed by the communist regime at the time, and many others were imprisoned or forced to flee in exile.  This and the financial difficulties of raising a family without any reliable source of income were the main reasons for his depressive bouts.  As regards to his failed love with his cousin, these are mere rumours.  His close friends and family all dismiss this as urban legend.  Sarban was indeed married to one of his cousins, and he has four children (three daughters and a son).  HIs son Abdulrab Sarban also recorded an album covering some of Sarban's famous songs.  Sarban suffered a stroke in 1984 which incapacitated him & rendered him speechless.  Due to the political turmoil in Afghanistan, he and his family emigrated to Pakistan where he died in poverty. But after 12 years of his death, the Afghan Government made arrangements with his family to relocate his remains to Kabul.\n\nDiscography & Songs:\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sarban, Abdul Rahim}}\n[[Category:Afghan singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan musicians]]\n[[Category:Afghan Tajik people]]\n[[Category:Tajik singers]]\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:1993 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century singers]]\n[[Category:Afghan emigrants to Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Afghan male singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n", "name_user": "Llunnaz", "label": "safe", "comment": "punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahim_Sarban"}

In the [[Philippines]], the custom has expanded into the nine-day ''[[Simbang Gabi]]'', when Filipinos attend dawn Masses (traditionally beginning around 04:00 to 05:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]]) from 16 December, continuing daily until Christmas Eve. In 2009 [[Holy See|Vatican]] officials scheduled the Midnight Mass to start at 10&nbsp;pm so that the 82-year-old [[Pope Benedict XVI]] would not have too late a night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8430118.stm |title=Woman knocks Pope down at Christmas Mass|date=25 December 2009|publisher=British Broadcasting Company}}</ref>\n\nA nativity scene may be erected indoors or outdoors, and is composed of figurines depicting the infant Jesus resting in a manger, Mary, and Joseph.<ref>Vermes, Geza.

The Church of Scotland no longer holds [[Hogmanay]] services on New Year's Eve, however. The Christmas Eve Services are still very popular.\nOn Christmas Eve, the Christ Candle in the center of the [[Advent wreath]] is traditionally lit in many [[church service]]s. In candlelight services, while singing ''[[Silent Night]]'', each member of the congregation receives a candle and passes along their flame which is first received from the Christ Candle.\n\n[[File:Advent2007candlelight.JPG|thumb|Advent wreath, lighting the candle]]\n\n[[Lutheran]]s traditionally practice Christmas Eve [[Eucharist]]ic traditions typical of Germany and Scandinavia. \"Krippenspiele\" ([[Nativity play]]s), special festive music for organ, vocal and brass [[choir]]s and candlelight services make Christmas Eve one of the highlights in the Lutheran Church calendar.\n\nChristmas [[Vespers]] are popular in the early evening, and midnight services are also widespread in regions which are predominantly Lutheran. The old Lutheran tradition of a Christmas Vigil in the early morning hours of [[Christmas Day]] (Christmette) can still be found in some regions. In eastern and [[middle Germany]], congregations still continue the tradition of \"[[Quempas]] singing\": separate groups dispersed in various parts of the church sing verses of the song \"He whom shepherds once came Praising\" (''Quem pastores laudavere'') responsively.[[File:Krippe Gutenzell.jpg|thumb|left|A nativity scene]]\n[[Methodism|Methodists]] celebrate the evening in different ways. Some, in the early evening, come to their church to celebrate [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] with their families. The mood is very solemn, and the only visible light is the [[Advent Wreath]], and the candles upon the [[Lord's Table]]. Others celebrate the evening with services of light, which include singing the song ''Silent Night'' as a variety of candles (including personal candles) are lit. Other churches have late evening services perhaps at 11&nbsp;pm, so that the church can celebrate Christmas Day together with the ringing of bells at midnight. Others offer Christmas Day services as well.\n\nThe annual \"[[Nine Lessons and Carols]]\", broadcast from [[King's College, Cambridge]] on Christmas Eve, has established itself a Christmas custom in the United Kingdom.<ref name=nine>{{citation|author=Alex Webb|title=Choir that sings to the world|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1703517.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=24 December 2001}}</ref> It is broadcast outside the UK via the [[BBC World Service]], and is also bought by broadcasters around the world.<ref name=nine/>\n\n=== Eastern churches ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:2013-12-24--Artoklasia during Christmas Eve service.JPG|thumbnail|Annunciation of the Virgin Mary Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Toronto, Ontario, Canada]]\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Rite]], Christmas Eve is referred to as '''Paramony''' (\"preparation\").  It is the concluding day of the [[Nativity Fast]] and is observed as a day of strict [[fasting]] by those devout Byzantine Christians who are physically capable of doing so. In some traditions, nothing is eaten until the first star appears in the evening sky, in commemoration of the [[Star of Bethlehem]]. The [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] celebration begins earlier in the day with the celebration of the [[Royal Hours]], followed by the [[Divine Liturgy]] combined with the celebration of [[Vespers]], during which a large number of passages from the [[Old Testament]] are chanted, recounting the history of salvation. After the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] at the end of the service, a new candle is brought out into the center of the church and lit, and all gather round and sing the [[Troparion]] and [[Kontakion]] of the Feast.\n\nIn the evening, the [[All-Night Vigil]] for the Feast of the Nativity is composed of [[Great Compline]], [[Matins]] and the [[First Hour]]. The Byzantine services of Christmas Eve are intentionally parallel to those of [[Good Friday]], illustrating the [[Orthodox theology|theological]] point that the purpose of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] was to make possible the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. This is illustrated in Eastern [[icon]]s of the Nativity, on which the [[Christ Child]] is wrapped in [[swaddling clothes]] reminiscent of his [[burial shroud|burial wrappings]]. The child is also shown lying on a stone, representing the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]], rather than a [[manger]]. The [[Church of the Nativity|Cave of the Nativity]] is also a reminder of the cave in which Jesus was buried.\n\nThe services of Christmas Eve are also similar to those of the Eve of [[Epiphany (holiday)#Eastern Christian Churches|Theophany]] (Epiphany), and the two [[Great Feasts]] are considered one celebration.\n\nIn some [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] cultures, after the Vesperal Liturgy the family returns home to a festive meal, but one at which [[Fasting#Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek-Catholicism|Orthodox fasting rules]] are still observed: no meat or dairy products (milk, cheese, eggs, etc.) are consumed (see below for variations according to nationality). Then they return to the church for the All-Night Vigil.\n\nThe next morning, Christmas Day, the Divine Liturgy is celebrated again, but with special features that occur only on Great Feasts of the Lord. After the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of this Liturgy, the faithful customarily greet each other with the [[kiss of peace]] and the words: \"Christ is Born!\", to which the one being greeted responds: \"Glorify Him!\" (the opening words of the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] of the Nativity that was chanted the night before during the Vigil). This greeting, together with many of the [[hymn]]s of the feast, continue to be used until the [[leave-taking]] of the feast on 29 December.\n\nThe first three days of the feast are particularly solemn. The second day is known as the [[Synaxis]] of the [[Theotokos]], and commemorates the role of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[Nativity of Jesus]]. The third day is referred to simply as \"the Third Day of the Nativity\". The Saturday and Sunday following 25 December have special [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]] readings assigned to them. 29 December celebrates the [[Holy Innocents]].\n\nByzantine Christians observe a festal period of [[Twelve Days of Christmas|twelve days]], during which no one in the Church fasts, even on Wednesdays and Fridays, which are normal fasting days throughout the rest of the year. During this time one feast leads into another: 25\u201331 December is the [[afterfeast]] of the Nativity; 2\u20135 January is the [[forefeast]] of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].\n\n=== Meals ===\n{{Further|List of Christmas dishes}}\n\n==== Bulgaria ====\n\nIn Bulgaria, the meal consists of an [[odd number]] of lenten dishes in compliance with the rules of fasting.

The table is spread with a white cloth symbolic of the [[swaddling clothes]] the [[Child Jesus]] was wrapped in, and a large white candle stands in the center of the table symbolizing [[Light of the World (Jesus)|Christ the Light of the World]]. Next to it is a round loaf of bread symbolizing Christ [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#Bread of Life|Bread of Life]]. [[Hay]] is often displayed either on the table or as a decoration in the room, reminiscent of the [[manger]] in Bethlehem. The twelve dishes (which differ by nationality or region) symbolize the [[Twelve Apostles]].\n\nThe Holy Meal was a common Eastern Orthodox tradition in the [[Russian Empire]], but during the era of the Soviet Union it was greatly discouraged as a result of the official [[atheism]] of the former regime. It is coming back in Russia and continues to be popular in Ukraine.\n\nThe main attributes of Holy Meal in Ukraine are [[kutia]], a poppy seed, honey and wheat dish, and uzvar, a drink made from reconstituted dried fruits. Other typical dishes are [[borscht]], [[Varenyky]], and dishes made of [[fish]], [[phaseolus]] and [[cabbage]].\n\n==== Serbia ====\n\n[[File:Candle lighting a plate of oranges and smarties 1.JPG|thumb|Candles on Christmas Eve 2010]]\nIn accordance with the [[Serbian Christmas traditions|Christmas traditions of the Serbs]], their festive meal has a copious and diverse selection of foods, although it is prepared according to the rules of fasting.\n\nAs well as a round, [[Leavening agent|unleavened]] loaf of bread and salt, which are necessary, this meal may comprise roast fish, cooked beans, [[sauerkraut]], noodles with ground walnuts, honey, and wine.\n\nFamilies in some Slavic countries leave an empty place at the table for guests (alluding to Mary and Joseph looking for shelter in Bethlehem).\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Gift giving ==\n\n[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|left|Christmas presents under the Christmas tree]]\n\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'', and the date of giving gifts changed from 6 December to Christmas Eve.<ref>Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}, pp. 68\u201379.</ref> It is the night when [[Santa Claus]] makes his rounds delivering gifts to good children.

The truce began on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1914, when [[German Army (German Empire)|German troops]] began decorating the area around their [[trench warfare|trenches]] in the region of [[Ypres]], Belgium, for Christmas. They began by placing candles on trees, then continued the celebration by singing [[Christmas carol]]s, most notably ''[[Silent Night (song)|Stille Nacht]]'' (\"Silent Night\"). The [[British Army|British troops]] in the trenches across from them responded by singing English carols. The two sides shouted Christmas greetings to each other. Soon there were calls for visits across the \"[[No man's land]]\" when small gifts were exchanged. The truce also allowed a breathing space during which recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Funerals took place as soldiers from both sides mourned the dead together and paid their respects. At one funeral in No Man's Land, soldiers from both sides gathered and read a passage from [[Psalm 23]]. The truce occurred in spite of opposition at higher levels of the military command. Earlier in the autumn, a call by [[Pope Benedict XV]] for an official truce between the warring governments had been ignored.\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', as seen from [[Apollo 8]], 24 December 1968, photographed by astronaut [[William Anders]] ([[NASA]])]]\n\n=== Apollo 8 reading from Genesis ===\n{{Main|Apollo 8 Genesis reading}}\n\nOn 24 December 1968, in what was the most watched television broadcast to that date, the [[astronaut]]s [[William Anders|Bill Anders]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Frank Borman]] of [[Apollo 8]] surprised the world with a reading of the Creation from the [[Book of Genesis]] as they orbited the Moon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo8_xmas.html|title=The Apollo 8 Christmas Eve Broadcast|publisher=NASA National Space Science Data Center|date=25 September 2007|accessdate=12 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080419065805/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo8_xmas.html| archivedate= 19 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]], an [[atheist]] activist, filed a lawsuit under the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].<ref name = \"aldrin\">{{cite book|author=Chaikin, Andrew|title=A Man On The Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts|publisher=Viking|isbn=0-670-81446-6|year=1994|pages=[https://archive.org/details/manonmoonvoyages00chai/page/204 204], 623|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/manonmoonvoyages00chai}}</ref> The trial court dismissed the lawsuit, which was upheld on appeal.<ref>''O'Hair v.

Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including [[Santa Claus]], [[Father Christmas]], [[Christkind]], and [[Saint Nicholas]] are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve, although until the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe,<ref>Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}, pp.&nbsp;68\u201379.</ref> such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the eve of [[Saint Nicholas Day|Saint Nicholas' feast day]] (6 December).\n\n== Religious traditions ==\n\n=== Western churches ===\n\n[[File:Midnight Mass 2010 - 66 (5292245955).jpg|thumb|left|[[Midnight Mass]] is held in many churches toward the end of Christmas Eve, often with dim lighting and traditional decorative accents such as greenery]]\n\n[[Roman Catholic]]s and high church [[Anglican]]s traditionally celebrate [[Midnight Mass]], which begins either at or sometime before [[midnight]] on Christmas Eve.  This ceremony, which is held in churches throughout the world, celebrates the birth of Christ, which is believed to have occurred at night. Midnight Mass is popular in Poland ([[pasterka]]) and Lithuania (piemen\u0117li\u0173 mi\u0161ios).\n\nIn recent years some churches have scheduled their \"Midnight\" Mass as early as 7&nbsp;pm.  This better suits the young children, whose choral singing has become a popular feature in some traditions. In Spanish-speaking areas, the Midnight Mass is sometimes referred to as ''[[Misa de Gallo]]'', or ''Missa do Galo'' in Portuguese (\"Rooster's Mass\"). In the [[Philippines]], the custom has expanded into the nine-day ''[[Simbang Gabi]]'', when Filipinos attend dawn Masses (traditionally beginning around 04:00 to 05:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]]) from 16 December, continuing daily until Christmas Eve. In 2009 [[Holy See|Vatican]] officials scheduled the Midnight Mass to start at 10&nbsp;pm so that the 82-year-old [[Pope Benedict XVI]] would not have too late a night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8430118.stm |title=Woman knocks Pope down at Christmas Mass|date=25 December 2009|publisher=British Broadcasting Company}}</ref>\n\nA nativity scene may be erected indoors or outdoors, and is composed of figurines depicting the infant Jesus resting in a manger, Mary, and Joseph.<ref>Vermes, Geza.

The figures may be made of any material,<ref name=\"Dues\">Dues, Greg.''Catholic Customs and Traditions: A Popular Guide'' Twenty-Third Publications, 2000.</ref> and arranged in a stable or grotto. The [[Magi]] may also appear, and are sometimes not placed in the scene until the week following Christmas to account for their travel time to Bethlehem.  While most home nativity scenes are packed away at Christmas or shortly thereafter, nativity scenes in churches usually remain on display until the feast of the [[Baptism of the Lord]].<ref name=\"Dues\" />\n\nWhilst it does not include any kind of Mass, the [[Church of Scotland]] has a service beginning just before midnight, in which [[Christmas carol|carols]] are sung. The Church of Scotland no longer holds [[Hogmanay]] services on New Year's Eve, however. The Christmas Eve Services are still very popular.\nOn Christmas Eve, the Christ Candle in the center of the [[Advent wreath]] is traditionally lit in many [[church service]]s. In candlelight services, while singing ''[[Silent Night]]'', each member of the congregation receives a candle and passes along their flame which is first received from the Christ Candle.\n\n[[File:Advent2007candlelight.JPG|thumb|Advent wreath, lighting the candle]]\n\n[[Lutheran]]s traditionally practice Christmas Eve [[Eucharist]]ic traditions typical of Germany and Scandinavia. \"Krippenspiele\" ([[Nativity play]]s), special festive music for organ, vocal and brass [[choir]]s and candlelight services make Christmas Eve one of the highlights in the Lutheran Church calendar.\n\nChristmas [[Vespers]] are popular in the early evening, and midnight services are also widespread in regions which are predominantly Lutheran. The old Lutheran tradition of a Christmas Vigil in the early morning hours of [[Christmas Day]] (Christmette) can still be found in some regions. In eastern and [[middle Germany]], congregations still continue the tradition of \"[[Quempas]] singing\": separate groups dispersed in various parts of the church sing verses of the song \"He whom shepherds once came Praising\" (''Quem pastores laudavere'') responsively.[[File:Krippe Gutenzell.jpg|thumb|left|A nativity scene]]\n[[Methodism|Methodists]] celebrate the evening in different ways. Some, in the early evening, come to their church to celebrate [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] with their families. The mood is very solemn, and the only visible light is the [[Advent Wreath]], and the candles upon the [[Lord's Table]]. Others celebrate the evening with services of light, which include singing the song ''Silent Night'' as a variety of candles (including personal candles) are lit. Other churches have late evening services perhaps at 11&nbsp;pm, so that the church can celebrate Christmas Day together with the ringing of bells at midnight. Others offer Christmas Day services as well.\n\nThe annual \"[[Nine Lessons and Carols]]\", broadcast from [[King's College, Cambridge]] on Christmas Eve, has established itself a Christmas custom in the United Kingdom.<ref name=nine>{{citation|author=Alex Webb|title=Choir that sings to the world|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1703517.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=24 December 2001}}</ref> It is broadcast outside the UK via the [[BBC World Service]], and is also bought by broadcasters around the world.<ref name=nine/>\n\n=== Eastern churches ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:2013-12-24--Artoklasia during Christmas Eve service.JPG|thumbnail|Annunciation of the Virgin Mary Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Toronto, Ontario, Canada]]\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Rite]], Christmas Eve is referred to as '''Paramony''' (\"preparation\").  It is the concluding day of the [[Nativity Fast]] and is observed as a day of strict [[fasting]] by those devout Byzantine Christians who are physically capable of doing so. In some traditions, nothing is eaten until the first star appears in the evening sky, in commemoration of the [[Star of Bethlehem]]. The [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] celebration begins earlier in the day with the celebration of the [[Royal Hours]], followed by the [[Divine Liturgy]] combined with the celebration of [[Vespers]], during which a large number of passages from the [[Old Testament]] are chanted, recounting the history of salvation. After the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] at the end of the service, a new candle is brought out into the center of the church and lit, and all gather round and sing the [[Troparion]] and [[Kontakion]] of the Feast.\n\nIn the evening, the [[All-Night Vigil]] for the Feast of the Nativity is composed of [[Great Compline]], [[Matins]] and the [[First Hour]]. The Byzantine services of Christmas Eve are intentionally parallel to those of [[Good Friday]], illustrating the [[Orthodox theology|theological]] point that the purpose of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] was to make possible the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. This is illustrated in Eastern [[icon]]s of the Nativity, on which the [[Christ Child]] is wrapped in [[swaddling clothes]] reminiscent of his [[burial shroud|burial wrappings]]. The child is also shown lying on a stone, representing the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]], rather than a [[manger]]. The [[Church of the Nativity|Cave of the Nativity]] is also a reminder of the cave in which Jesus was buried.\n\nThe services of Christmas Eve are also similar to those of the Eve of [[Epiphany (holiday)#Eastern Christian Churches|Theophany]] (Epiphany), and the two [[Great Feasts]] are considered one celebration.\n\nIn some [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] cultures, after the Vesperal Liturgy the family returns home to a festive meal, but one at which [[Fasting#Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek-Catholicism|Orthodox fasting rules]] are still observed: no meat or dairy products (milk, cheese, eggs, etc.) are consumed (see below for variations according to nationality). Then they return to the church for the All-Night Vigil.\n\nThe next morning, Christmas Day, the Divine Liturgy is celebrated again, but with special features that occur only on Great Feasts of the Lord. After the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of this Liturgy, the faithful customarily greet each other with the [[kiss of peace]] and the words: \"Christ is Born!\", to which the one being greeted responds: \"Glorify Him!\" (the opening words of the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] of the Nativity that was chanted the night before during the Vigil). This greeting, together with many of the [[hymn]]s of the feast, continue to be used until the [[leave-taking]] of the feast on 29 December.\n\nThe first three days of the feast are particularly solemn. The second day is known as the [[Synaxis]] of the [[Theotokos]], and commemorates the role of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[Nativity of Jesus]]. The third day is referred to simply as \"the Third Day of the Nativity\". The Saturday and Sunday following 25 December have special [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]] readings assigned to them. 29 December celebrates the [[Holy Innocents]].\n\nByzantine Christians observe a festal period of [[Twelve Days of Christmas|twelve days]], during which no one in the Church fasts, even on Wednesdays and Fridays, which are normal fasting days throughout the rest of the year. During this time one feast leads into another: 25\u201331 December is the [[afterfeast]] of the Nativity; 2\u20135 January is the [[forefeast]] of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].\n\n=== Meals ===\n{{Further|List of Christmas dishes}}\n\n==== Bulgaria ====\n\nIn Bulgaria, the meal consists of an [[odd number]] of lenten dishes in compliance with the rules of fasting. They are usually the traditional [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[bob chorba]] (bean soup), fortune [[korovai|kravai]] (pastry with a fortune in it; also called ''bogovitsa'', ''vechernik'', ''kolednik''), [[stuffed peppers]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], dried fruit, boiled wheat.<ref>[http://www.discover-bulgaria.com/Travel_Results.aspx?CategoryID=450 Bulgarian Main Courses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104151340/http://www.discover-bulgaria.com/Travel_Results.aspx?CategoryID=450 |date=4 January 2009 }}</ref> The meal is often accompanied with wine or Bulgaria's traditional [[alcoholic beverage]] [[rakia]], in the past ''olovina'' (a type of homemade rye beer).

The table is spread with a white cloth symbolic of the [[swaddling clothes]] the [[Child Jesus]] was wrapped in, and a large white candle stands in the center of the table symbolizing [[Light of the World (Jesus)|Christ the Light of the World]]. Next to it is a round loaf of bread symbolizing Christ [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#Bread of Life|Bread of Life]]. [[Hay]] is often displayed either on the table or as a decoration in the room, reminiscent of the [[manger]] in Bethlehem. The twelve dishes (which differ by nationality or region) symbolize the [[Twelve Apostles]].\n\nThe Holy Meal was a common Eastern Orthodox tradition in the [[Russian Empire]], but during the era of the Soviet Union it was greatly discouraged as a result of the official [[atheism]] of the former regime. It is coming back in Russia and continues to be popular in Ukraine.\n\nThe main attributes of Holy Meal in Ukraine are [[kutia]], a poppy seed, honey and wheat dish, and uzvar, a drink made from reconstituted dried fruits. Other typical dishes are [[borscht]], [[Varenyky]], and dishes made of [[fish]], [[phaseolus]] and [[cabbage]].\n\n==== Serbia ====\n\n[[File:Candle lighting a plate of oranges and smarties 1.JPG|thumb|Candles on Christmas Eve 2010]]\nIn accordance with the [[Serbian Christmas traditions|Christmas traditions of the Serbs]], their festive meal has a copious and diverse selection of foods, although it is prepared according to the rules of fasting.\n\nAs well as a round, [[Leavening agent|unleavened]] loaf of bread and salt, which are necessary, this meal may comprise roast fish, cooked beans, [[sauerkraut]], noodles with ground walnuts, honey, and wine.\n\nFamilies in some Slavic countries leave an empty place at the table for guests (alluding to Mary and Joseph looking for shelter in Bethlehem).\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Gift giving ==\n\n[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|left|Christmas presents under the Christmas tree]]\n\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'', and the date of giving gifts changed from 6 December to Christmas Eve.<ref>Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}, pp. 68\u201379.</ref> It is the night when [[Santa Claus]] makes his rounds delivering gifts to good children.

The truce began on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1914, when [[German Army (German Empire)|German troops]] began decorating the area around their [[trench warfare|trenches]] in the region of [[Ypres]], Belgium, for Christmas. They began by placing candles on trees, then continued the celebration by singing [[Christmas carol]]s, most notably ''[[Silent Night (song)|Stille Nacht]]'' (\"Silent Night\"). The [[British Army|British troops]] in the trenches across from them responded by singing English carols. The two sides shouted Christmas greetings to each other. Soon there were calls for visits across the \"[[No man's land]]\" when small gifts were exchanged. The truce also allowed a breathing space during which recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Funerals took place as soldiers from both sides mourned the dead together and paid their respects. At one funeral in No Man's Land, soldiers from both sides gathered and read a passage from [[Psalm 23]]. The truce occurred in spite of opposition at higher levels of the military command. Earlier in the autumn, a call by [[Pope Benedict XV]] for an official truce between the warring governments had been ignored.\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', as seen from [[Apollo 8]], 24 December 1968, photographed by astronaut [[William Anders]] ([[NASA]])]]\n\n=== Apollo 8 reading from Genesis ===\n{{Main|Apollo 8 Genesis reading}}\n\nOn 24 December 1968, in what was the most watched television broadcast to that date, the [[astronaut]]s [[William Anders|Bill Anders]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Frank Borman]] of [[Apollo 8]] surprised the world with a reading of the Creation from the [[Book of Genesis]] as they orbited the Moon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo8_xmas.html|title=The Apollo 8 Christmas Eve Broadcast|publisher=NASA National Space Science Data Center|date=25 September 2007|accessdate=12 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080419065805/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo8_xmas.html| archivedate= 19 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]], an [[atheist]] activist, filed a lawsuit under the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].<ref name = \"aldrin\">{{cite book|author=Chaikin, Andrew|title=A Man On The Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts|publisher=Viking|isbn=0-670-81446-6|year=1994|pages=[https://archive.org/details/manonmoonvoyages00chai/page/204 204], 623|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/manonmoonvoyages00chai}}</ref> The trial court dismissed the lawsuit, which was upheld on appeal.<ref>''O'Hair v.

A hub of tourism, many private banks service the city and maintain underground bunkers and storage facilities for gold at the foothills of the [[Swiss Alps]].]]'''Banking in Switzerland''' began in the early 18th century through [[Switzerland]]'s merchant trade and has, over the centuries, grown into a complex, regulated, and international industry. Along with the [[Swiss Alps]], [[Swiss chocolate]], watchmaking and mountaineering, banking is seen as [[Culture of Switzerland|emblematic of Switzerland]]. Switzerland has a [[Banking in Switzerland#Banking secrecy|long, kindred history of banking secrecy]] and client confidentiality reaching back to the early 1700s. Started as a way to protect wealthy European banking interests, Swiss banking secrecy was codified in 1934 with the passage of the landmark federal law, the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks]].   <!--This article's banking secrecy section is mean't to be the *most comprehensive treatment of Swiss banking secrecy* on Wikipedia, everything else should be directed or redirected appropriately. --><!--There is a purposeful lack of citations in the lead of this article as per WP:WHENNOTCITE.

If content is added that has clearly been synthesized it will be removed per WP:SYNTHNOT. -->{{Culture of Switzerland}}Controversial protection of foreign accounts and assets during [[World War II]] sparked a series of proposed financial regulations seeking to temper bank secrecy to little success. Switzerland, considered the \"grandfather of bank secrecy\", has been one of the largest [[Offshore financial centre|offshore financial centers]] and [[tax haven]]s in the world since the mid-20th century. Despite [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks#Revisions|an international push]] to meaningfully roll back banking secrecy laws in the country, Swiss social and political forces have minimized and reverted much of proposed roll backs. Although disclosing criminal activities by banks, who do not enjoy a good reputation even in Switzerland, is generally well seen by the Swiss public, disclosing client information has been considered a criminal offence since the early 1900s. Employees working in Switzerland and abroad at Swiss banks \"have long adhered to an unwritten code similar to that [[Non-disclosure agreement|observed by doctors or priests]]\".<ref name=\":17\" /> Since 1934, banking secrecy laws have been violated by four people: [[Christoph Meili]] (1997), [[Bradley Birkenfeld]] (2007), [[Rudolf Elmer]] (2011), and [[Herv\u00e9 Falciani]] (2014).\n\nThe [[Swiss Bankers Association]] (SBA) estimated in 2018 that Swiss banks held [[United States dollar|US$]]6.5 trillion in assets or 25% of all global cross-border assets. Switzerland's main lingual hubs, [[Geneva]] (for French), [[Lugano]] (for Italian), and [[Z\u00fcrich]] (for German) service the different geographical markets. It consistently ranks in the top three states on the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] and was named first many times, most recently in 2018. The three largest banks\u2013[[UBS]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Julius Baer Group|Julius B\u00e4r]]\u2013are all regulated by the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority]] (FINMA), and the [[Swiss National Bank]] (NSB) which derives its authority from a series of federal statutes. Banking in Switzerland has historically played, and still continues to play, a dominant role in the [[Economy of Switzerland|Swiss economy]] and society. According to the [[OECD|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), total banking assets amount to 467% of total gross domestic product.<ref name=\":5\">[[Banking in Switzerland#Bibliography|Financial Secrecy Index: Narrative Report on Switzerland (2018)]], p. 2</ref> Banking in Switzerland [[Banking in Switzerland#In popular culture|has been portrayed]], to varying degrees of accuracy, in overall popular culture, books, movies, and television shows.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Banking in Switzerland#Banking secrecy}}\nDuring the 18th century, [[Swiss mercenaries]] brought home funds from their contracts that helped Swiss banks begin.<ref name=\"mcphee19831031\">{{cite news|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=16248&startpage=page0000103#folio=050|title=La Place de la Concorde Suisse-I|author=McPhee, John|first=|date=October 31, 1983|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=22 July 2013|pages=50}}</ref> Banking began in the eighteenth century by way of the riches of merchants.

Along with the [[Swiss Alps]], [[Swiss chocolate]], watchmaking and mountaineering, banking is seen as [[Culture of Switzerland|emblematic of Switzerland]]. Switzerland has a [[Banking in Switzerland#Banking secrecy|long, kindred history of banking secrecy]] and client confidentiality reaching back to the early 1700s.

Switzerland, considered the \"grandfather of bank secrecy\", has been one of the largest [[Offshore financial centre|offshore financial centers]] and [[tax haven]]s in the world since the mid-20th century. Despite [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks#Revisions|an international push]] to meaningfully roll back banking secrecy laws in the country, Swiss social and political forces have minimized and reverted much of proposed roll backs. Although disclosing criminal activities by banks, who do not enjoy a good reputation even in Switzerland, is generally well seen by the Swiss public, disclosing client information has been considered a criminal offence since the early 1900s. Employees working in Switzerland and abroad at Swiss banks \"have long adhered to an unwritten code similar to that [[Non-disclosure agreement|observed by doctors or priests]]\".<ref name=\":17\" /> Since 1934, banking secrecy laws have been violated by four people: [[Christoph Meili]] (1997), [[Bradley Birkenfeld]] (2007), [[Rudolf Elmer]] (2011), and [[Herv\u00e9 Falciani]] (2014).\n\nThe [[Swiss Bankers Association]] (SBA) estimated in 2018 that Swiss banks held [[United States dollar|US$]]6.5 trillion in assets or 25% of all global cross-border assets. Switzerland's main lingual hubs, [[Geneva]] (for French), [[Lugano]] (for Italian), and [[Z\u00fcrich]] (for German) service the different geographical markets. It consistently ranks in the top three states on the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] and was named first many times, most recently in 2018. The three largest banks\u2013[[UBS]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Julius Baer Group|Julius B\u00e4r]]\u2013are all regulated by the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority]] (FINMA), and the [[Swiss National Bank]] (NSB) which derives its authority from a series of federal statutes. Banking in Switzerland has historically played, and still continues to play, a dominant role in the [[Economy of Switzerland|Swiss economy]] and society.
