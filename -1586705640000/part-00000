After Marcos was elected president in 1965, Enrile became part of his inner circle. From 1966 to 1968, he was the Undersecretary and sometime Acting Secretary of the Department of Finance. He concurrently became acting Insurance Commissioner and Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs. From 1968 to 1970, he was the Secretary of Justice.\n\n==Career in the Marcos Cabinet==\n[[File:Marcos in Washington 1983.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Minister of National Defense Juan Ponce Enrile with President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].]]\n\nEnrile, like Marcos, comes from the northern Philippines, a region that had become Marcos' recruiting ground for key political and military leaders during his time.

Marcos appointed Enrile as his Secretary of National Defense on February 9, 1970, a position Enrile held until August 27, 1971, when he resigned to run unsuccessfully for the senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/history-the-department-of-national-defense/|title=History: The Department of National Defense|publisher=}}</ref> He was re-appointed Defense Secretary by Marcos on January 4, 1972. As Defense Secretary, he was the highest ranked commissioned officer of a nation's armed forces.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nFrom the beginning of Marcos' period in government, Enrile was one of the few that the former president trusted, and was seen by many as Marcos' prot\u00e9g\u00e9. For almost the entire period of [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]], Enrile served officially as the martial law administrator as he was in charge of all the armed forces' services during that time. Furthermore, as early as Marcos' planning and preparation for the declaration of martial law, Enrile was involved.<ref>[http://www.manilatimes.net/why-not-ask-ramos-and-enrile-about-martial-law-abuses/247486/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031757/https://www.manilatimes.net/why-not-ask-ramos-and-enrile-about-martial-law-abuses/247486/ |date=August 11, 2018 }} Why Not Ask Ramos and Enrile About Martial Law Abuses</ref> In his memoir, Enrile recalls Marcos' careful preparations. He narrates that as early as December 1969, Marcos instructed him to study the 1935 Constitution, specifically the powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief. Marcos had already foreseen a rise in violence and chaos in the country and wanted to know the exact extent of his powers.<ref name=\"DML\" />\n                  \t\nAt the end of January of the following year, Enrile, with help from Efren Plana and Minerva Gonzaga Reyes, submitted the only copy of the report regarding the detailed nature and extent of Martial Law to Marcos. Soon after, Marcos allegedly ordered Enrile to prepare all documents necessary for the implementation of [[Martial Law in the Philippines]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16055240-juan-ponce-enrile | title=Juan Ponce Enrile, A Memoir | publisher=[[ABS-CBN Publishing]] | author=Juan Ponce Enrile | year=2012 | isbn=\n978-9-7181-6117-3 | editor=Navarro, Nelson A. }}</ref> In August 1972, Marcos once again met with Enrile and a few of his other most trusted commanders to discuss tentative dates for the declaration. By September 22, 1972, Marcos announced that he had placed the entire country under Martial Law as of 9 p.m. via proclamation 1081 which, he claimed, he had signed on September 21, 1972.<ref name=\"DML\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gov.ph/featured/declaration-of-martial-law/ | title=Declaration of Martial Law | work=[[Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]] | accessdate= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014532/https://www.gov.ph/featured/declaration-of-martial-law/ | archivedate= September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos Declares Martial Law.jpg|thumb|left|\"FM Declares Martial Law\"\u2014the headline of the September 24, 1972 issue of the ''Sunday Express'', which was the Sunday edition of the ''[[Philippines Daily Express]]''.

He cited the alleged ambush attack on Enrile's car on September 22, 1972 as pretext for martial law. At the time, many people doubted that the attack actually took place. Marcos, in his diary entry for September 1972, wrote that Enrile had been ambushed near Wack-Wack that night. He says \"it was a good thing he was riding in his security car as a protective measure\u2026 This makes the martial law proclamation a necessity.\"<ref name=\"DML\" /> On the contrary, Oscar Lopez, a resident of Wack-Wack who lived along the street of the alleged ambush, stated that he had heard a lot of shooting on the night of the incident. When he went out to see what was happening, he saw only an empty car riddled with bullets. Lopez' driver, who had happened to witness the incident, stated that \"there was a car that came and stopped beside a Meralco post. Some people exited the car, and another car came by to shoot at the car, to make it look like it was ambushed.\"<ref name=\"DML\" />\n\n[[File:Juan Ponce Enrile's Bullet-riddled car.jpg|thumb|left|Juan Ponce Enrile's bullet-riddled car]]\n \nThe doubts surrounding the alleged ambush were further confirmed in a press conference on February 23, 1986 when then Lieutenant General Fidel Ramos and Enrile admitted that the attack was staged in order to justify the declaration of martial law. Both radio and television media covered this and millions of Filipinos witnessed the said confession. Furthermore, in several interviews, Enrile was reported as indeed confirming that the attempted assassination was faked in order to justify the declaration of Martial Law.<ref name=\"ERF\" /><ref name=\"Inquirer\" >{{cite web | url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/284836/true-or-false-was-1972-enrile-ambush-faked#ixzz4QFSz3iDu | title=True or false: Was 1972 Enrile ambush faked? | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date=October 8, 2012 | accessdate=December 23, 2019 | author=Inquirer Research}}</ref> Conflicting accounts arise in his book, ''Juan Ponce Enrile: A Memoir''.

In 1973, under the new modified [[parliamentary system]] then in place under the country's new constitution under Martial Law, Enrile's title became Defense Minister. Enrile focused his efforts on a broad review of defense policies and on dealing with pressing social unrest. The abolition of civilian institutions such as [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]], the weakening of the judiciary, and the outlawing of [[Political party|political parties]], left the military as the only other instrumentality of the national government outside of the Presidency.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAccording to the [[National Historical Institute of the Philippines]], Enrile was also appointed as the general for logging in the Philippines. He was tasked by Marcos to give certificates to logging companies, which eventually led to one of Asia's most devastating environmental disasters. During that time, the forest cover of the Philippines shrank until only 8% remained. Enrile also owned numerous logging companies such as Ameco in Bukidnon, Dolores Timber in Samar, San Jose Timber in Northern Samar, Kasilagan Softwood Development Corp in Butuan, Eurasia Match in Cebu, Pan Oriental which operates in Cebu and Butuan, Palawan-Apitong Corp in Palawan, and Royal Match. He also invested heavily in a rubber plantation in Basilan. A share of the Marcos ill-gotten wealth was siphoned in those companies. Enrile was also appointed by Marcos as the President of the [[Philippine Coconut Authority]], where he established control of the copra industry together with Danding Cojuangco. The two ruled over the controversial Coco Levy Fund which proved their intense corruption in government service. The fund, which was supposed to be used to improve the country's copra industry, was used by the two for programs led by Imelda Marcos and other [[Marcos cronies]]. A huge portion of the fund was also used for the presidential campaigns of Ferdinand Marcos in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5reVY2X8PS0|title=EP09 KAYO ANG HIHIRAP KAMI ANG YAYAMAN|publisher=[[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]|date=September 20, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOn November 28, 1978, Marcos issued the Letter of Instruction no. 776, which stated that \"No changes of assignment of senior officers including provincial commanders, brigade commanders, division commanders, and special unit commanders shall be made without clearance from the president.\"<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/1978/11/28/letter-of-instruction-no-776-s-1978/] Letter of Instruction No. 776</ref> By the 1980s, Marcos began to bypass Enrile's authority.

He began aligning himself with dissident elements in the army, particularly the [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]] - which was then headed by his [[Aide-de-camp]], Lieutenant Colonel Gregorio Honasan. On February 15, 1986, Aquino's wife, [[Cory Aquino]], gained mass support through her oath taking in protest of Marcos being announced president. This then led to many leaders joining the revolution and fight against Marcos.<ref name=\"Tavaana\"/>\n\nOfficers from the group, with Enrile's support, launched a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' against Marcos in February 1986. Marcos was alerted to the plot by Ver, and the conspirators took refuge in two military camps. From there, Enrile and then Lieutenant General [[Fidel Ramos]], the head of the defunct [[Philippine Constabulary]] (it had been integrated with the INP to form the [[Philippine National Police]]) and concurrently vice-chief of staff of the armed forces, rallied opponents against Marcos in a citizens' revolt that became known as the [[People Power Revolution]]. They called on the people to gather in Epifanio de los Santos Avenue ([[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]) to support on February 22. The next three days, they continued their rally in EDSA now containing two million people in support. The growing number encouraged many more leaders to support the movement against Marcos. Enrile stated, \"It was funny.\u2026 We in the defense and military organizations who should be protecting the people were being protected by them.\"<ref name=\"Tavaana\">{{cite web | url=https://tavaana.org/en/en/content/people-power-revolution-philippines-i-saw-no-one-yield-fear | title=People Power Revolution Philippines: I Saw No One Yield | publisher=Tavaana | accessdate=December 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career in the Aquino Cabinet==\nEnrile then served as the Secretary of National Defense under Corazon Aquino, who had replaced Marcos as president, but he increasingly differed with Aquino, specifically on the administration's handling of insurgent leftist opposition. Aquino sought to make peace with the communist party of the Philippines through the use and promotions of ceasefires during which peace talks were to be held between the government and the leftist opposition. Because of such tactics, Enrile was not the only person dissatisfied with Aquino administration. Many of the younger officers in the military who had been identified as members of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement and Marcos loyalists sought to oust Aquino from the presidency with the many coups that were plotted from 1986 to 1990. The earliest and most prominent one was the [[1986-1990 Philippine coup attempts|\"God Save the Queen\" plot]] that was to supposedly be executed on the November 11, 1986.<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/1990/10/03/the-final-report-of-the-fact-finding-commission-ii-political-change-and-military-transmition-in-the-philippines-1966-1989-from-the-barracks-to-the-corridors-of-power/] Final Report of the Fact Finding Commission</ref> The investigation of the coup done by the Fact Finding Commission found that Enrile and some members of the RAM as the primary instigators of the coup. After revealing the fruits of the investigation findings, Aquino forced Enrile to resign as Defense Secretary in November 1986 as she had lost confidence in him. Enrile was then replaced with [[Rafael Ileto]].\n\n==Congressional career==\n\n===First Senate term===\nIn May 1987 Enrile won a seat in the [[1987 Philippine Senate election|1987 election]] as one of two opposition members in the country's 24-member [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] (the other being [[Joseph Estrada]]), finishing 24th. He was unable to be proclaimed until August, when the electoral protest filed by Augusto Sanchez was dismissed. He formally assumed office on August 15, 1987. In the same month, an [[1986\u20131987 Philippine coup attempts|attempted coup against Aquino]] escalated and led to the destruction of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]] General Headquarters (AFPGHQ) in [[Camp Aguinaldo]] in [[Quezon City]]. He was detained in Camp Aguinaldo over suspicion of planning the coup with Lt. Col. [[Gregorio Honasan]], but was released days later for lack of evidence. Enrile later stated numerous recalls about the martial law era, of which all were flip-flops from his previous statements during his term a secretary of defense and during the ouster of Marcos. He was dubbed by then-President [[Corazon Aquino]] as \"''Pambansang Balimbing''\" (national political turncoat) for his contradicting statements and \"''Dakilang Miron''\" (great bystander) for his inconvenient bystander and opportunistic attitude.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d8JJzuks0Q&t=13s|title=President Corazon Aquino blasts Enrile and coup rebels at EDSA (1990)|first=|last=Maypagasa|date=August 23, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\n===Member of the House of Representatives===\nIn 1992, before his term in the Senate had ended, Enrile predicted that he might lose the senatorial election or win, but only serve three years in office. Under the transitory provisions of the [[Philippine Constitution|1987 Constitution]], the 12 candidates who receive the greatest number of votes serve a six-year term, the next 12 only three years. He ran instead for the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]. He [[1992 Philippine House of Representatives elections|was elected]] and represented the First District of [[Cagayan]].\n\n===Second to fourth senate terms===\nIn 1995 Enrile ran in the senatorial race as an independent candidate for [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] and was also a guest candidate under the [[Lakas NUCD|Lakas]]&ndash;[[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino|Laban]] coalition. He [[1995 Philippine Senate election|won as senator]] and held the position until 2001. During his term as senator, he ran as an independent candidate in the [[1998 Philippine presidential election|1998 election]] for the position of [[President of the Philippines|President]]. He lost to then [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] Joseph Estrada.\n\nOn January 13, 2001 he was one of those who voted against the opening of the second bank envelope.{{clarify|date=September 2011}} That vote led to the [[EDSA II|second EDSA People Power Revolution]] that eventually ousted President Estrada. From April 30 to May 1, 2001, together with [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]], [[Gregorio Honasan]], [[Panfilo Lacson]] and [[Vicente Sotto III]], he led the [[EDSA III]] protests in support of [[Joseph Estrada]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/90521/miriam-gma-resign-or-we-will-storm-palace|title= Miriam to GMA: Resign or we will storm palace\n|newspaper=[[Philippine Star]]|date=April 30, 2001|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"EDSA INC\" />  May 1, 2001, the protesters stormed [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]].<ref name=\"EDSA INC\" >{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/104045-edsa-3-iglesia-ni-cristo|title= Remembering the Iglesia-led EDSA 3\n|work=[[Rappler]]|date=August 25, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref> In May 2001 he was indicted by the military for the investigation of the unsuccessful siege of the [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]] by pro-Estrada forces. He was released a day later. He ran for [[2001 Philippine Senate election|reelection]] as part of the [[Puwersa ng Masa]] coalition. Due to the issues that haunted him over the failed siege, he lost the election.\n\nIn the [[2004 Philippine Senate election|2004 election]], he made a comeback bid for the Senate under the [[Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino]] (KNP) banner. He actively opposed the imposition of the Purchased Power Adjustment (PPA) on consumers' electric bills. Due to his expos\u00e9 of the PPA and the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decision in favour of a refund on electric bills, the public responded positively and elected him. He thus became a senator in three non-consecutive terms. He was reelected as senator in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 election]]s. {{asof|2013}}, he is the oldest senator of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines]]. Enrile is affiliated with the [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino]] (PMP). Technically he belongs to an opposition party, but in the Senate, he stands as an independent and is part of the administration bloc. The minority bloc includes all of his party's members.\n\n==Senate Presidency==\n\n===Election===\nOn November 17, 2008, Senate President [[Manuel Villar]] resigned due to lack of support, and Enrile succeeded him the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/senators-name-juan-ponce-enrile-as-new-philippine-senate-562997|title=easybourse.com, Senators Name Juan Ponce Enrile As New Philippine Senate President|access-date=November 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221140806/http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/senators-name-juan-ponce-enrile-as-new-philippine-senate-562997|archive-date=December 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=ABS>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/17/08/enrile-ousts-villar-senate-coup|title=(Update) Enrile ousts Villar in Senate coup|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/17/content_10371979.htm news.xinhuanet.com, Philippine senate president resigns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221153448/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/17/content_10371979.htm |date=December 21, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/133995/Zubiri-is-new-Senate-Majority-Leader|title=Zubiri is new Senate Majority Leader|publisher=}}</ref> Enrile was nominated by [[Panfilo Lacson]]; 14 senators supported the nomination and five abstained.<ref name=ABS/> Enrile accepted the position, saying that \"To lead the Senate with its great minds, strong advocacies, varying and independent political beliefs and leanings, is not an easy task.

Institutional reforms were also implemented within the Senate to improve the daily conduct of business as well the welfare of its officers and employees.\n\n===Maguindanao martial law===\nThe Senate also collaborated with the House of Representatives on two crucial issues which are now considered historical milestones. In December 2009, it used Proclamation No. 1959 of the previous administration, declaring a state of martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in the province of Maguindanao, while in May 2010, Congress convened to constitute itself as the national board to canvass the votes for president and vice president, and proclaim the winners.\n\n===Re-election as Senate President===\n[[File:Hajime Ishii and Juan Ponce Enrile 20110504.jpg|thumb|200px|with [[Hajime Ishii]] (left) on May 4, 2011]]\n\nEnrile was re-elected to a fourth term in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 Senate election]]. On July 26, 2010, he was re-elected President of the Senate.

No partisan consideration will blur or color the treatment of any member of the Senate. We are all Senators elected by the people to serve them with dedication to their interest and well-being and devotion to our responsibilities.\" Furthermore, in his acceptance speech, he enjoined his colleagues to \"uphold the independence and integrity of this Senate, without abandoning our duty to cooperate with the other departments of the government to achieve what is good for our people.\"<ref>[https://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/senpres/enrile.asp] Biography of Senate Presidents - Juan Ponce Enrile.

In September 2012 he started a feud with [[Antonio Trillanes IV]] when he asked Trillanes why he secretly visited [[Beijing]] to talk about the [[Philippines and the Spratly Islands]] dispute on [[Spratlys]] and the [[Scarborough Shoal]]. Trillanes said his visit in China was authorized by the [[Malaca\u00f1an|Palace]]. He also alleged that Enrile was being pushed by former Pres. [[Gloria Arroyo]] to pass a bill splitting the province of [[Camarines Sur]] into two but Enrile denied the allegation.\n\nIn late 2012, Enrile also started a feud with [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] when Santiago authored the [[Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012]] with [[Pia Cayetano]], which he opposed. In January 2013, Santiago exposed that Enrile allegedly gave PhP 1.6 million each to his fellow Senators, except for her, [[Pia Cayetano]], [[Alan Peter Cayetano]], and Trillanes, who were reportedly to have been only given PhP 250 thousand each. He admitted giving the said amount to the senators, saying it was part of the balance of the maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE) funds allowed per senator.

He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and served as [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice Secretary]] and [[Secretary of National Defense (Philippines)|Defense Minister]] under the [[History of the Philippines (1965-1986)|Marcos regime]]. He later became one of the leaders (along with General [[Fidel Ramos]]) of the [[People Power Revolution|1986 People Power Revolution]] that drove Marcos from power and into exile. Enrile has continued to be a prominent politician since then; he was [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] from November 2008 until his resignation on June 5, 2013.\n\n==Early life and career==\nEnrile was born in [[Gonzaga, Cagayan]] to Petra Furagganan, the stepdaughter of a poor fisherman. He was born out of wedlock\u2014his Spanish ''mestizo'' father was the powerful regional politician and renowned lawyer Alfonso Ponce Enrile, who was already married. His second great-uncle was [[Mariano Ponce]]. As a young man, he was reunited with his father in the [[City of Manila]], and took his secondary education at [[St. James Academy (Malabon)|Saint James Academy]] in [[Malabon]].\n\nHe graduated [[Latin honors|''cum laude'']] in 1949 with an [[Associate of Arts]] degree from [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. Afterward, he attended the [[University of the Philippines]] [[University of the Philippines College of Law|College of Law]] and graduated ''cum laude'' with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree.  While in law school, he joined the Sigma Rho fraternity. Upon graduation, he was elected to the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] and [[Phi Kappa Phi]] international honor societies. He scored 11th in the 1953 [[Philippine Bar Examination|bar examinations]] with a 91.72% rating and a perfect score in mercantile law. As a scholar at the [[Harvard Law School]], he earned a [[Master of Laws]] degree with specialized training in international tax law.\n\nHe taught law at the [[Far Eastern University]] and practiced law in his father's law firm before taking responsibility for then Senator [[Ferdinand Marcos]]'s personal legal affairs in 1964, especially during the latter's term as Senate President.  After Marcos was elected president in 1965, Enrile became part of his inner circle. From 1966 to 1968, he was the Undersecretary and sometime Acting Secretary of the Department of Finance. He concurrently became acting Insurance Commissioner and Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs. From 1968 to 1970, he was the Secretary of Justice.\n\n==Career in the Marcos Cabinet==\n[[File:Marcos in Washington 1983.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Minister of National Defense Juan Ponce Enrile with President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].]]\n\nEnrile, like Marcos, comes from the northern Philippines, a region that had become Marcos' recruiting ground for key political and military leaders during his time.

For almost the entire period of [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]], Enrile served officially as the martial law administrator as he was in charge of all the armed forces' services during that time. Furthermore, as early as Marcos' planning and preparation for the declaration of martial law, Enrile was involved.<ref>[http://www.manilatimes.net/why-not-ask-ramos-and-enrile-about-martial-law-abuses/247486/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031757/https://www.manilatimes.net/why-not-ask-ramos-and-enrile-about-martial-law-abuses/247486/ |date=August 11, 2018 }} Why Not Ask Ramos and Enrile About Martial Law Abuses</ref> In his memoir, Enrile recalls Marcos' careful preparations. He narrates that as early as December 1969, Marcos instructed him to study the 1935 Constitution, specifically the powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief. Marcos had already foreseen a rise in violence and chaos in the country and wanted to know the exact extent of his powers.<ref name=\"DML\" />\n                  \t\nAt the end of January of the following year, Enrile, with help from Efren Plana and Minerva Gonzaga Reyes, submitted the only copy of the report regarding the detailed nature and extent of Martial Law to Marcos. Soon after, Marcos allegedly ordered Enrile to prepare all documents necessary for the implementation of [[Martial Law in the Philippines]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16055240-juan-ponce-enrile | title=Juan Ponce Enrile, A Memoir | publisher=[[ABS-CBN Publishing]] | author=Juan Ponce Enrile | year=2012 | isbn=\n978-9-7181-6117-3 | editor=Navarro, Nelson A. }}</ref> In August 1972, Marcos once again met with Enrile and a few of his other most trusted commanders to discuss tentative dates for the declaration.

He cited the alleged ambush attack on Enrile's car on September 22, 1972 as pretext for martial law. At the time, many people doubted that the attack actually took place. Marcos, in his diary entry for September 1972, wrote that Enrile had been ambushed near Wack-Wack that night. He says \"it was a good thing he was riding in his security car as a protective measure\u2026 This makes the martial law proclamation a necessity.\"<ref name=\"DML\" /> On the contrary, Oscar Lopez, a resident of Wack-Wack who lived along the street of the alleged ambush, stated that he had heard a lot of shooting on the night of the incident. When he went out to see what was happening, he saw only an empty car riddled with bullets. Lopez' driver, who had happened to witness the incident, stated that \"there was a car that came and stopped beside a Meralco post. Some people exited the car, and another car came by to shoot at the car, to make it look like it was ambushed.\"<ref name=\"DML\" />\n\n[[File:Juan Ponce Enrile's Bullet-riddled car.jpg|thumb|left|Juan Ponce Enrile's bullet-riddled car]]\n \nThe doubts surrounding the alleged ambush were further confirmed in a press conference on February 23, 1986 when then Lieutenant General Fidel Ramos and Enrile admitted that the attack was staged in order to justify the declaration of martial law.

In 1973, under the new modified [[parliamentary system]] then in place under the country's new constitution under Martial Law, Enrile's title became Defense Minister. Enrile focused his efforts on a broad review of defense policies and on dealing with pressing social unrest. The abolition of civilian institutions such as [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]], the weakening of the judiciary, and the outlawing of [[Political party|political parties]], left the military as the only other instrumentality of the national government outside of the Presidency.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAccording to the [[National Historical Institute of the Philippines]], Enrile was also appointed as the general for logging in the Philippines. He was tasked by Marcos to give certificates to logging companies, which eventually led to one of Asia's most devastating environmental disasters. During that time, the forest cover of the Philippines shrank until only 8% remained. Enrile also owned numerous logging companies such as Ameco in Bukidnon, Dolores Timber in Samar, San Jose Timber in Northern Samar, Kasilagan Softwood Development Corp in Butuan, Eurasia Match in Cebu, Pan Oriental which operates in Cebu and Butuan, Palawan-Apitong Corp in Palawan, and Royal Match. He also invested heavily in a rubber plantation in Basilan. A share of the Marcos ill-gotten wealth was siphoned in those companies. Enrile was also appointed by Marcos as the President of the [[Philippine Coconut Authority]], where he established control of the copra industry together with Danding Cojuangco. The two ruled over the controversial Coco Levy Fund which proved their intense corruption in government service. The fund, which was supposed to be used to improve the country's copra industry, was used by the two for programs led by Imelda Marcos and other [[Marcos cronies]]. A huge portion of the fund was also used for the presidential campaigns of Ferdinand Marcos in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5reVY2X8PS0|title=EP09 KAYO ANG HIHIRAP KAMI ANG YAYAMAN|publisher=[[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]|date=September 20, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOn November 28, 1978, Marcos issued the Letter of Instruction no. 776, which stated that \"No changes of assignment of senior officers including provincial commanders, brigade commanders, division commanders, and special unit commanders shall be made without clearance from the president.\"<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/1978/11/28/letter-of-instruction-no-776-s-1978/] Letter of Instruction No. 776</ref> By the 1980s, Marcos began to bypass Enrile's authority.

He began aligning himself with dissident elements in the army, particularly the [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]] - which was then headed by his [[Aide-de-camp]], Lieutenant Colonel Gregorio Honasan. On February 15, 1986, Aquino's wife, [[Cory Aquino]], gained mass support through her oath taking in protest of Marcos being announced president. This then led to many leaders joining the revolution and fight against Marcos.<ref name=\"Tavaana\"/>\n\nOfficers from the group, with Enrile's support, launched a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' against Marcos in February 1986. Marcos was alerted to the plot by Ver, and the conspirators took refuge in two military camps. From there, Enrile and then Lieutenant General [[Fidel Ramos]], the head of the defunct [[Philippine Constabulary]] (it had been integrated with the INP to form the [[Philippine National Police]]) and concurrently vice-chief of staff of the armed forces, rallied opponents against Marcos in a citizens' revolt that became known as the [[People Power Revolution]]. They called on the people to gather in Epifanio de los Santos Avenue ([[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]) to support on February 22. The next three days, they continued their rally in EDSA now containing two million people in support. The growing number encouraged many more leaders to support the movement against Marcos. Enrile stated, \"It was funny.\u2026 We in the defense and military organizations who should be protecting the people were being protected by them.\"<ref name=\"Tavaana\">{{cite web | url=https://tavaana.org/en/en/content/people-power-revolution-philippines-i-saw-no-one-yield-fear | title=People Power Revolution Philippines: I Saw No One Yield | publisher=Tavaana | accessdate=December 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career in the Aquino Cabinet==\nEnrile then served as the Secretary of National Defense under Corazon Aquino, who had replaced Marcos as president, but he increasingly differed with Aquino, specifically on the administration's handling of insurgent leftist opposition. Aquino sought to make peace with the communist party of the Philippines through the use and promotions of ceasefires during which peace talks were to be held between the government and the leftist opposition. Because of such tactics, Enrile was not the only person dissatisfied with Aquino administration. Many of the younger officers in the military who had been identified as members of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement and Marcos loyalists sought to oust Aquino from the presidency with the many coups that were plotted from 1986 to 1990. The earliest and most prominent one was the [[1986-1990 Philippine coup attempts|\"God Save the Queen\" plot]] that was to supposedly be executed on the November 11, 1986.<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/1990/10/03/the-final-report-of-the-fact-finding-commission-ii-political-change-and-military-transmition-in-the-philippines-1966-1989-from-the-barracks-to-the-corridors-of-power/] Final Report of the Fact Finding Commission</ref> The investigation of the coup done by the Fact Finding Commission found that Enrile and some members of the RAM as the primary instigators of the coup. After revealing the fruits of the investigation findings, Aquino forced Enrile to resign as Defense Secretary in November 1986 as she had lost confidence in him. Enrile was then replaced with [[Rafael Ileto]].\n\n==Congressional career==\n\n===First Senate term===\nIn May 1987 Enrile won a seat in the [[1987 Philippine Senate election|1987 election]] as one of two opposition members in the country's 24-member [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] (the other being [[Joseph Estrada]]), finishing 24th. He was unable to be proclaimed until August, when the electoral protest filed by Augusto Sanchez was dismissed. He formally assumed office on August 15, 1987. In the same month, an [[1986\u20131987 Philippine coup attempts|attempted coup against Aquino]] escalated and led to the destruction of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]] General Headquarters (AFPGHQ) in [[Camp Aguinaldo]] in [[Quezon City]]. He was detained in Camp Aguinaldo over suspicion of planning the coup with Lt. Col. [[Gregorio Honasan]], but was released days later for lack of evidence. Enrile later stated numerous recalls about the martial law era, of which all were flip-flops from his previous statements during his term a secretary of defense and during the ouster of Marcos. He was dubbed by then-President [[Corazon Aquino]] as \"''Pambansang Balimbing''\" (national political turncoat) for his contradicting statements and \"''Dakilang Miron''\" (great bystander) for his inconvenient bystander and opportunistic attitude.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d8JJzuks0Q&t=13s|title=President Corazon Aquino blasts Enrile and coup rebels at EDSA (1990)|first=|last=Maypagasa|date=August 23, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\n===Member of the House of Representatives===\nIn 1992, before his term in the Senate had ended, Enrile predicted that he might lose the senatorial election or win, but only serve three years in office. Under the transitory provisions of the [[Philippine Constitution|1987 Constitution]], the 12 candidates who receive the greatest number of votes serve a six-year term, the next 12 only three years. He ran instead for the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]. He [[1992 Philippine House of Representatives elections|was elected]] and represented the First District of [[Cagayan]].\n\n===Second to fourth senate terms===\nIn 1995 Enrile ran in the senatorial race as an independent candidate for [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] and was also a guest candidate under the [[Lakas NUCD|Lakas]]&ndash;[[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino|Laban]] coalition. He [[1995 Philippine Senate election|won as senator]] and held the position until 2001. During his term as senator, he ran as an independent candidate in the [[1998 Philippine presidential election|1998 election]] for the position of [[President of the Philippines|President]]. He lost to then [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] Joseph Estrada.\n\nOn January 13, 2001 he was one of those who voted against the opening of the second bank envelope.{{clarify|date=September 2011}} That vote led to the [[EDSA II|second EDSA People Power Revolution]] that eventually ousted President Estrada. From April 30 to May 1, 2001, together with [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]], [[Gregorio Honasan]], [[Panfilo Lacson]] and [[Vicente Sotto III]], he led the [[EDSA III]] protests in support of [[Joseph Estrada]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/90521/miriam-gma-resign-or-we-will-storm-palace|title= Miriam to GMA: Resign or we will storm palace\n|newspaper=[[Philippine Star]]|date=April 30, 2001|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"EDSA INC\" />  May 1, 2001, the protesters stormed [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]].<ref name=\"EDSA INC\" >{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/104045-edsa-3-iglesia-ni-cristo|title= Remembering the Iglesia-led EDSA 3\n|work=[[Rappler]]|date=August 25, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref> In May 2001 he was indicted by the military for the investigation of the unsuccessful siege of the [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]] by pro-Estrada forces. He was released a day later. He ran for [[2001 Philippine Senate election|reelection]] as part of the [[Puwersa ng Masa]] coalition. Due to the issues that haunted him over the failed siege, he lost the election.\n\nIn the [[2004 Philippine Senate election|2004 election]], he made a comeback bid for the Senate under the [[Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino]] (KNP) banner. He actively opposed the imposition of the Purchased Power Adjustment (PPA) on consumers' electric bills. Due to his expos\u00e9 of the PPA and the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decision in favour of a refund on electric bills, the public responded positively and elected him. He thus became a senator in three non-consecutive terms. He was reelected as senator in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 election]]s. {{asof|2013}}, he is the oldest senator of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines]]. Enrile is affiliated with the [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino]] (PMP). Technically he belongs to an opposition party, but in the Senate, he stands as an independent and is part of the administration bloc. The minority bloc includes all of his party's members.\n\n==Senate Presidency==\n\n===Election===\nOn November 17, 2008, Senate President [[Manuel Villar]] resigned due to lack of support, and Enrile succeeded him the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/senators-name-juan-ponce-enrile-as-new-philippine-senate-562997|title=easybourse.com, Senators Name Juan Ponce Enrile As New Philippine Senate President|access-date=November 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221140806/http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/senators-name-juan-ponce-enrile-as-new-philippine-senate-562997|archive-date=December 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=ABS>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/17/08/enrile-ousts-villar-senate-coup|title=(Update) Enrile ousts Villar in Senate coup|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/17/content_10371979.htm news.xinhuanet.com, Philippine senate president resigns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221153448/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/17/content_10371979.htm |date=December 21, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/133995/Zubiri-is-new-Senate-Majority-Leader|title=Zubiri is new Senate Majority Leader|publisher=}}</ref> Enrile was nominated by [[Panfilo Lacson]]; 14 senators supported the nomination and five abstained.<ref name=ABS/> Enrile accepted the position, saying that \"To lead the Senate with its great minds, strong advocacies, varying and independent political beliefs and leanings, is not an easy task.

Institutional reforms were also implemented within the Senate to improve the daily conduct of business as well the welfare of its officers and employees.\n\n===Maguindanao martial law===\nThe Senate also collaborated with the House of Representatives on two crucial issues which are now considered historical milestones. In December 2009, it used Proclamation No. 1959 of the previous administration, declaring a state of martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in the province of Maguindanao, while in May 2010, Congress convened to constitute itself as the national board to canvass the votes for president and vice president, and proclaim the winners.\n\n===Re-election as Senate President===\n[[File:Hajime Ishii and Juan Ponce Enrile 20110504.jpg|thumb|200px|with [[Hajime Ishii]] (left) on May 4, 2011]]\n\nEnrile was re-elected to a fourth term in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 Senate election]]. On July 26, 2010, he was re-elected President of the Senate. Enrile committed himself to \"discharge my duties and responsibilities with honor, with total devotion to our institution, and with fairness to all members. No partisan consideration will blur or color the treatment of any member of the Senate. We are all Senators elected by the people to serve them with dedication to their interest and well-being and devotion to our responsibilities.\" Furthermore, in his acceptance speech, he enjoined his colleagues to \"uphold the independence and integrity of this Senate, without abandoning our duty to cooperate with the other departments of the government to achieve what is good for our people.\"<ref>[https://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/senpres/enrile.asp] Biography of Senate Presidents - Juan Ponce Enrile.

He was one of the 20 Senators voting guilty for the impeachment. In September 2012 he started a feud with [[Antonio Trillanes IV]] when he asked Trillanes why he secretly visited [[Beijing]] to talk about the [[Philippines and the Spratly Islands]] dispute on [[Spratlys]] and the [[Scarborough Shoal]]. Trillanes said his visit in China was authorized by the [[Malaca\u00f1an|Palace]]. He also alleged that Enrile was being pushed by former Pres. [[Gloria Arroyo]] to pass a bill splitting the province of [[Camarines Sur]] into two but Enrile denied the allegation.\n\nIn late 2012, Enrile also started a feud with [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] when Santiago authored the [[Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012]] with [[Pia Cayetano]], which he opposed. In January 2013, Santiago exposed that Enrile allegedly gave PhP 1.6 million each to his fellow Senators, except for her, [[Pia Cayetano]], [[Alan Peter Cayetano]], and Trillanes, who were reportedly to have been only given PhP 250 thousand each. He admitted giving the said amount to the senators, saying it was part of the balance of the maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE) funds allowed per senator. On January 21, 2013, because of the controversies involving him, he attempted to vacate his position as Senate President but his motion was rejected.\n\n===Resignation===\nAmid accusations against him, including the alleged distribution of MOOE funds to senators, Enrile stepped down as Senate President after his privilege speech on June 5, 2013.<ref>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/311510/news/nation/enrile-resigns-as-senate-president Enrile resigns as Senate president] retrieved June 5, 2013</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n\n===Enrile cash gift===\nIn January 2013, while sitting as the Senate President, Enrile was accused of using Senate funds called MOOE as Christmas gifts to members of the senate who do not oppose him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/19395-enrile-s-cash-gifts-exclude-4-critics|title=Enrile's 'cash gifts' exclude 4 critics|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/337461/enrile-gave-18-senators-p1-6m-each-for-christmas|title=Enrile gave 18 senators P1.6M each for Christmas|first=Juliet|last=Labog-Javellana|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/289408/news/nation/enrile-gave-p1-6m-to-all-fellow-senators-except-his-foes|title=Enrile gave P1.6M to all fellow senators except his foes|publisher=}}</ref> This led to his resignation as Senate President without sufficiently answering the controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/421361/enrile-quits-slams-critics|title=Enrile quits, slams critics|first=Cathy|last=Yamsuan|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Pork barrel scam===\n{{main|Priority Development Assistance Fund scam}}\n[[File:Bong Revilla after delivering \"Salamat, Kaibigan\".jpg|thumb|200px|Enrile with Senators [[Jinggoy Estrada]] (left) and [[Bong Revilla]] (center) after Revilla's Privilege Speech at the Senate floor on June 9, 2014]]\n\nIn September 2013, Enrile was again involved in misappropriated funds, this time with regard to the PDAF or what is commonly called the [[pork barrel]] fund.

The series was introduced in 2004 with the [[Cadillac CTS]] and the [[Holden Commodore (VZ)]].\n\nIt is a 60\u00b0 24-valve design with aluminum block and heads and [[Sequential multi-port fuel injection]]. Most versions feature [[Continuous variable valve timing|continuously variable cam phasing]] on both intake and exhaust valves and [[electronic throttle control]]. Other features include piston oil-jet capability, forged and [[Deep Rolling|fillet rolled]] [[crankshaft]], sinter forged [[connecting rod]]s, a [[VLIM|variable-length intake manifold]], twin knock control sensors and [[Direct Ignition#Direct ignition|coil-on-plug ignition]]. It was developed by the same international team responsible for the [[GM Ecotec engine#Ecotec|Ecotec]], including the [[Opel]] engineers responsible for the [[GM 54-Degree V6 engine|54\u00b0 V6]], with involvement with design and development engineering from [[Ricardo plc]].\n\n[[Holden]] sells the HFV6 under the name '''Alloytec'''. The '''High Feature''' moniker on the Holden produced engine is reserved for the twin cam phasing high output version. The block was designed to be expandable from 2.8&nbsp;L to 4.0&nbsp;L. High Feature V6 engines were previously produced in Fishermans Bend, [[Port Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and remain in production at the following four manufacturing locations: [[St. Catharines]], [[Canada]]; [[Flint Engine South]] in [[Flint, Michigan]], [[United States]]; Romulus Engine Plant in Romulus, MI and [[Ramos Arizpe Assembly|Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico]]. The assembly lines for the St. Catharines and Flint facilities were manufactured by Hirata Corporation at their powertrain facility in [[Kumamoto, Japan]]. Most of the designs of this motor happened in Flint. They were first produced for the Cadillac range.\n\n== History ==\nThe HFV6 was first designed, tested and produced in a joint program by [[Cadillac]] and Holden. A majority of designs into the new alloy construction, transmission pairing and first use in production were all undertaken in Detroit (and manufactured in [[St. Catharines, Ontario]]). Holden had the job of developing smaller engines (Holden 3.2, LP1 and Saab 2.8, LP9 Turbo) as well as their own Holden 3.6 HFV6 (called the Alloytec V6) for local models.\n\nCadillac and Holden both tested variations of these engines in US and Australia.\n\n== 2.8 ==\n\n=== LP1 ===\nA {{convert|2792|cc|L|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} ''LP1'' variant was introduced in the 2005 [[Cadillac CTS]]. It was also used on the Chinese 2008 CTS. It has a {{convert|89x74.8|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke, [[Sequential multi-port fuel injection]] and a 10.0:1 compression ratio. The ''LP1'' was built in St. Catharines, Ontario.\n\nApplications:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year(s)\n! Model\n! Power\n!

Introduced in the MY2012 [[Holden Commodore]], Based on the 3.6-litre LY7 engine, the LWR had a vapour injection system. The vapour injection system injected gas directly into the [[air intake]] runner, thereby preventing excess gas from circulating through the air intake system. Although liquid LPG injection generally produces more power, [[Holden]] justified vapour injection on the grounds of lower fuel consumption, lower {{CO2}} emissions, reduced pumping and parasitic losses, and start-up reliability in hot weather.\n\nThe dedicated LPG LWR engine produced peak power and torque of {{convert|180|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2000 rpm. The LWR engine was engine was mated to GM's six-speed [[GM 6L50 transmission|6L45]] [[automatic transmission]] and, over the combined ADR 81/02 test cycle, the Commodore Omega achieved fuel consumption of {{convert|11.8|L/100 km|abbr=on}} \u2013 an improvement of {{convert|1.6|L/100 km|abbr=on}} compared to its dual fuel LW2 predecessor. Furthermore, the LWR engine exceeded [[European emissions standards|Euro 6 emissions standards]].\n* Specially hardened valves and valve seats.\n* A redesigned cylinder head and manifold for improved air flow.\n* Variable exhaust valve timing (the LW2 engine only had variable intake valve timing)\n* Specially-developed fuel injectors.\n* New pistons with pentroof-style centre-domes and valve eyelets for a higher compression ratio of 12.2:1 (compared to 10.2:1 for the dual fuel engine).\n* A new fuel rail and a new LPG fuel filter.\nApplications:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!

The series was introduced in 2004 with the [[Cadillac CTS]] and the [[Holden Commodore (VZ)]].\n\nIt is a 60\u00b0 24-valve design with aluminum block and heads and [[Sequential multi-port fuel injection]]. Most versions feature [[Continuous variable valve timing|continuously variable cam phasing]] on both intake and exhaust valves and [[electronic throttle control]]. Other features include piston oil-jet capability, forged and [[Deep Rolling|fillet rolled]] [[crankshaft]], sinter forged [[connecting rod]]s, a [[VLIM|variable-length intake manifold]], twin knock control sensors and [[Direct Ignition#Direct ignition|coil-on-plug ignition]]. It was developed by the same international team responsible for the [[GM Ecotec engine#Ecotec|Ecotec]], including the [[Opel]] engineers responsible for the [[GM 54-Degree V6 engine|54\u00b0 V6]], with involvement with design and development engineering from [[Ricardo plc]].\n\n[[Holden]] sells the HFV6 under the name '''Alloytec'''. The '''High Feature''' moniker on the Holden produced engine is reserved for the twin cam phasing high output version. The block was designed to be expandable from 2.8&nbsp;L to 4.0&nbsp;L. High Feature V6 engines were previously produced in Fishermans Bend, [[Port Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and remain in production at the following four manufacturing locations: [[St. Catharines]], [[Canada]]; [[Flint Engine South]] in [[Flint, Michigan]], [[United States]]; Romulus Engine Plant in Romulus, MI and [[Ramos Arizpe Assembly|Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico]]. The assembly lines for the St. Catharines and Flint facilities were manufactured by Hirata Corporation at their powertrain facility in [[Kumamoto, Japan]]. Most of the designs of this motor happened in Flint. They were first produced for the Cadillac range.\n\n== History ==\nThe HFV6 was first designed, tested and produced in a joint program by [[Cadillac]] and Holden. A majority of designs into the new alloy construction, transmission pairing and first use in production were all undertaken in Detroit (and manufactured in [[St. Catharines, Ontario]]). Holden had the job of developing smaller engines (Holden 3.2, LP1 and Saab 2.8, LP9 Turbo) as well as their own Holden 3.6 HFV6 (called the Alloytec V6) for local models.\n\nCadillac and Holden both tested variations of these engines in US and Australia.\n\n== 2.8 ==\n\n=== LP1 ===\nA {{convert|2792|cc|L|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} ''LP1'' variant was introduced in the 2005 [[Cadillac CTS]]. It was also used on the Chinese 2008 CTS. It has a {{convert|89x74.8|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore and stroke, [[Sequential multi-port fuel injection]] and a 10.0:1 compression ratio. The ''LP1'' was built in St. Catharines, Ontario.\n\nApplications:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year(s)\n! Model\n! Power\n!

Introduced in the MY2012 [[Holden Commodore]], Based on the 3.6-litre LY7 engine, the LWR had a vapour injection system. The vapour injection system injected gas directly into the [[air intake]] runner, thereby preventing excess gas from circulating through the air intake system. Although liquid LPG injection generally produces more power, [[Holden]] justified vapour injection on the grounds of lower fuel consumption, lower {{CO2}} emissions, reduced pumping and parasitic losses, and start-up reliability in hot weather.\n\nThe dedicated LPG LWR engine produced peak power and torque of {{convert|180|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2000 rpm.
