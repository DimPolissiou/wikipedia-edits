The school is one of five career academies offered by the [[Monmouth County Vocational School District]]. This high school is based upon the expansion of medical knowledge for teenagers who want to pursue medical careers. Proximity to Jersey Shore University Medical Center provides students with hands-on training in a hospital setting. The school has been accredited by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Secondary Schools since 1999.<ref>[https://www.msa-cess.org/RelId/606553/AccountID/12248/ISvars/default/School_Search.htm Monmouth County Academy of Allied Health and Science], [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Secondary Schools.

Students who attend this school tend to score in high percentiles on most standardized tests and the [[SAT]], and nearly always attend four-year colleges (usually 98-100%).\n\nAs of the 2017\u201318 school year, the school had an enrollment of 269 students and 19.0 classroom teachers (on an [[full-time equivalent|FTE]] basis), for a [[student\u2013teacher ratio]] of 14.2:1. There were 18 students (6.7% of enrollment) eligible for [[National School Lunch Act|free lunch]] and 6 (2.2% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.<ref name=NCES>[https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&DistrictID=3410080&ID=341008003428 School data for Middlesex County Voc Acad Allied Health & Biomedical Science], [[National Center for Education Statistics]].

Accessed January 20, 2020.</ref>\n<!--Image deleted: [[Image:AAHS.gif|thumb|right|350px|Academy of Allied Health and Science in Neptune, New Jersey]]-->\n\n== Admission criteria ==\nThe academy is a selective school and will only take those who score well on 7th and 1st marking period 8th grade report cards, and on an acceptance exam, normally held in January or February, after applications to school are submitted. To take Geometry in the freshman year, students successfully pass an Algebra I test. To take Spanish II in the freshman year, students must successfully pass Spanish I test, which includes an \"interview\". The different parts of the entrance exam (not including the Algebra I and Spanish II test) sum up a cumulative score. If this is below 75/100, then the student is automatically disqualified from attending, but a 75 might not be enough to pass. Each town has its first highest-ranked student admitted by default assuming he or she earns a 75 or higher. Not all towns have one student apply, usually one or more seek admission to the Monmouth County Full-Time Vocational Schools. All other students are chosen based on rank and test admission score. There is also a waiting list. It is used not only when students decline their admission, but also when students drop out to return to their home high schools.\n\n==Schedule==\nThe school uses a block schedule. There are four classes in a day, and periods are an hour and twenty-five minutes long. School begins at 7:35 am and ends at 2:25 pm. The first four to five classes are taken in the first half of the school year, and the next four to five are taken in the second. Some classes, including electives, alternate with Fitness.\n\nThe first two periods take place from 7:35 am \u2013 10:27 am (with a two-minute break in between periods).  From 10:27 am \u2013 11:27 am there is a one-hour activity period, where students eat lunch, participate in clubs, or overall relax.  From 11:27 am \u2013 2:25 pm the final two periods take place.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Freshman year ===\n\nThe following classes are required during freshman year: Dynamics of Healthcare, Computer Applications, Math (Algebra I or Geometry), Foreign Language (Latin I or Spanish I or II), Biology, Intro to Anatomy and Physiology (Allied Health Clinical Skills), World History, Fitness I and English I.<ref name=\"course\">[http://aahs.ctemc.org/departments Academics], Academy of Allied Health & Science. Accessed September 4, 2014.</ref> There are nine required classes total: Algebra I or Geometry, English I, World History, Allied Health Clinical Skills, Dynamics of Healthcare, Latin I or Spanish I/II, Computer Applications, Biology I, and Fitness I.  There are no electives in freshman year. The \"Dynamics of Healthcare\" course incorporates learning about health insurance, legal terms, healthcare facilities, professional behavior, and medical history. It is administered by the [[Rutgers School of Health Related Professions]]. The \"Financial Literacy\" course has been replaced with \"Allied Health Clinical Skills,\" which addresses (as indicated by its name) the clinical side of the healthcare profession.  This switch took place in 2013 and Financial Literacy has been moved to Junior Year.\n\nNote: Since the 2012\u20132013 school year, students are allowed to take Algebra II in 9th grade and PreCalculus in 10th grade. Rahul Yerrabelli did this and took an online AP Statistics course through FLVS for his 11th grade math credits. There is now a Statistics class taught by a new teacher for the 2018\u20132019 school year. \n\nInstead of taking an art class, students must complete a \"Visual & Performing Arts\" assignment before November of their sophomore year.<ref name=\"course\" />\n\n=== Sophomore year ===\n\nThe following classes are required during sophomore year: Anatomy and Physiology I, Math: Algebra II or Geometry, Foreign Language: Latin II or Spanish II or III, Chemistry, English II, Fitness II, Principles of Computer Technology, Healthy Relations (a guidance/sex ed course) and US History I.<ref name=\"course\" /> There are no electives in sophomore year. In Anatomy and Physiology I course, students volunteer two hours on Fridays for six weeks at [[Jersey Shore University Medical Center]] at a different department each week. Departments that can be assigned include [[NICU]], occupational therapy, laboratory, patient transport, and various nursing floors. At the end of the Anatomy course, students take a Rutgers-issued exam for college credits in Anatomy I and Dynamics of Healthcare.\n\nNote: Since the 2012\u20132013 school year, students are allowed to take Algebra II in 9th grade and PreCalculus in 10th grade.  It has not been decided if this will be standard for later years for students in the program.\n\n=== Junior year ===\n\nStudents have no electives in this year.<ref name=\"course\" /> During junior year, students continue their learning in Anatomy and Physiology II.<ref name=\"course\" /> Students will again take a similar college-level test for college credits for the Anatomy II course and for Medical Terminology.<ref name=\"course\" /> Students also participate in the Grant Writing/Service Learning class, which teaches students the various aspects of helping their communities. Much volunteer work is involved as the class sponsors activities such as coat or book drives.\n\nNote: Since the 2012\u20132013 school year, students are allowed to take Algebra II in 9th grade and PreCalculus in 10th grade. There is only 1 junior who is in this case. He is taking an online AP Statistics course through FLVS for his 11th grade math credits. In 2018, a new Statistics teacher was hired to teach the class of about 20 juniors. The class uses an AP textbook but is not an AP class, however, students can take the AP tests by themselves with not much preparation after the course.  \n\nOther required courses are: Financial Literacy, Nutrition (Dual-Enrollment), Algebra II or Pre-calculus, English III, U.S. History II, Physics, Fitness III, and Latin II or Spanish III/IV.\n\n=== Senior year ===\n\nStudents take a \"mentorship\" course. Students choose a \"mentor,\" and must relate their mentorship to the medical field. There are exceptions to the rule of medical involvement, as long as students can prove they are gaining valuable experience in a professional field.  Seniors go to their mentorship site three days a week (Mon, Wed, Fri) for three hours a day during the second half of the school day.  Students have worked with local medical centers, specialized private clinics (ranging from sports medicine to urology), and miscellaneous sites such as a college radio station. Notably, students can fail mentorship if they are kicked out of the hospital, so it is a very formal and strict relationship. \n\nThe following medical courses are available: EMT, Physical Therapy, Sign Language, and Alternative Medicine.<ref name=\"course\" /> Other required courses include: Biology, English IV, Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and Chemistry.<ref name=\"course\" /> Foreign Language is not required, and can be replaced by an elective.  The Fitness program is also no longer an in-school class for seniors, and instead involves filling out an online set of forms.\n\n== Clubs and activities==\nThe academy has many different clubs in many different areas. Clubs usually meet during lunch, but sometimes meet after school. Anyone can join most clubs, but some have requirements. Most notably, HOSA requires members to be juniors or seniors and officers to be seniors, NHS requires members to be juniors or seniors with a 92 (A) GPA and to do volunteer work, and Character Committee has a selection process including interviews. Every club runs year long, except Mock Trial (first semester only) and Model UN (second semester only).\n\n===Team Allied===\nOne main goal of Team Allied (formerly known as Character Committee) is to help new students at the academy feel welcome. Team Allied is unique in that it is the only club that is a four-year commitment, requiring members to sign up in the early spring of their freshmen year. Still, many apply to the club. To keep the club small, there is a highly selective process to determine which applicants are admitted which includes an interview.\n\n===Math Club===\nMath Club emphasizes a love of math. The club meets every second and fourth Tuesday. Math League tests are given 6 times a year and are open to all students. The tests occur during lunch and the time limit is 30 minutes for 6 questions of increasing difficulty (many finish earlier). The highest monthly and cumulative scores are recorded and compared with other schools within the MCVSD district. There is also the AMC test which only occurs once a year. This test has only started to be implemented in 2019\u20132020 school year.\n\n===Global Forum (Discontinued)===\nGlobal Forum is a club that focuses on free discussion. Global Forum meets every Friday at the second half of lunch. Most of meetings are debates among its members on a specific topic. These debates do not have an informal atmosphere with calling out as the main form of communication. Topics depend on current events, but frequently include gun control, military action, criticism/defense of the president's actions, etc. There also occasional fundraisers for charitable organizations like UNICEF and Red Cross. Finally, Global Forum provides a \"This Day in History...\" fact every Wednesday and Friday on the morning video announcements. Global Forum was discontinued before 2016.\n\n===Mock Trial===\nMock Trial meets in the first semester only. Mock Trial participates, often successfully, in a tournament with other schools. The members pretend to be lawyers, witnesses, etc. and perform a trial hearing. Many members in Mock Trial are also in Model UN.\n\n===Model UN===\nModel UN only occurs on the second half the year. It starts just when Mock Trial ends and is run by the same teacher. Its meetings times are usually Wednesday on the second half of lunch. As the name implies, the club is about imitating a UN meeting. Each member has a country and the members debate an issue. Usually, Model UN competes in one tournament with other schools every year.\n\n===Science League===\nScience League was started in the 2013\u20132014 school year. Most of its meetings are after school. The club has a large number of competitions, including NJSL, US Biology Olympiad, US Chemistry Olympiad, Merck Test, etc. All of the tests are one day events, except for NJSL. There are four NJSL tests (January, February, March, April) every year. There are many subjects with each subject having 1-3 levels of difficulty. There are plaque for individuals who score in the highest 10% in the state in their respective subject and level. Team plaques are also given to the top 10 teams in the state for each subject and level. In the 2013\u20132014 school year, Science League chose to participate in four teams: Biology I, Biology II, Chemistry I, and Chemistry II. In the 2014 Biology Olympiad, 4 students, a remarkably high number, of students qualified as semifinalists. Approximately 600 high school students qualify nationwide for this. All four semifinalists were juniors. In 2018, four seniors got 7th place in the New Jersey Science League Biology I Competition. In 2019, the same four seniors and one additional one got 6th place in the New Jersey Science League Chemistry I Competition.\n\n===Academic Team===\nAcademic Team was started in the 2018\u20132019 school year, and it takes place year-round. The team consists of an \"A\" team and a \"B\" team. These teams were determined by performance on multiple tryout examinations. The \"A\" team have received several accolades, including 3rd Place at the High Technology High School Quiz Bowl Competition, and 2nd place at the Biotechnology Quiz Bowl. \n\n===Red Cross===\nA branch of the Health Occupations Students of America, this club serves to primarily organize fundraisers and food drives for people in need. In the past, they have hosted successful Can Drives, Letters for Veterans, and blood drives. The club was founded by Ashlesha Thorat (Class of 2021), and the current President is Amol Shirodkar (Class of 2020).\n\n===Other clubs===\nOther clubs include HOSA, art club, tech club, yearbook, 4-H, pulse (started in 2013\u20132014 school year), and NHS.\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n\nThe Academy of Allied Health & Science has been recognized for many awards, including:\n\n* In its listing of \"America's Best High Schools 2016\", the school was ranked 12th out of 500 best high schools in the country; it was ranked fifth among all high schools in New Jersey.<ref>Staff.

Accessed September 4, 2015.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe school opened in 1996. The school's early development, including construction and curriculum creation, was overseen by Timothy M. McCorkell, who was the school's first principal until the end of the 2001\u201302 school year, when he was promoted to Assistant Superintendent at [[Monmouth County Vocational School District]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = http://www.mcvsd.org/admin/\n | title = MCVSD Administration\n | accessdate = May 26, 2012\n | author = Monmouth County Vocational School District\n | date = April 21, 2010}}\n</ref> He was later Superintendent in 2009. Following McCorkell was Scott Taylor. Taylor resigned after the 2004\u201305 school year to take a position at the [[Little Silver School District]]. Robert V. Cancro took the position after Scott Taylor left.\n\nIn 1997, the first \"Color Wars\" took place. Originally, two teams were made by splitting the student body into two groups by homerooms. Students were pitted against students in their own grade. It is a [[battle of the classes]] event, with the freshman and senior classes (taking the school color blue) pitted against the sophomore and junior classes (taking the school color gray) in a week-long series of competitive events, which include [[ultimate frisbee]], pudding eating, [[tug of war]], a medical challenge, student and faculty volleyball, an original skit, and one or more \"mystery events\". It takes place in late May. Beforehand, the teams must choose a team name incorporating the color. As of the  2011\u201312 school year, the blue team has won four times, and the gray team has won four times. In the 2011\u20132012 school year, the gray team won. Then the blue team won in the 2012\u20132013 school year against the gray team (called the Gray Avengers). Finally, in the 2013\u20132014 school year, the gray team (called the Holy Grayl) won against the blue team (Bluminati). Furthermore, no class has won all four years, but the classes of 2010 and 2011 came very close (each with 3-1). As of early 2017, the class of 2018 has 3 wins, and they hope to have their fourth win in spring 2018. However, the class of 2012 lost all four years. Teacher Chris Benson and the Student Council are in charge of planning and managing the events.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = http://www.aahs.mcvsd.org/activities.html\n | title = Co-Curricular Activities\n | accessdate = May 26, 2012\n | author =Academy of Allied Health and Science}}\n</ref>\n<!--To add: lipsync, Mr. AAHS-->\n\nStarting in the 2004\u201305 school year, the school began phasing out its French Language program, due to core curriculum conflicts.

The school is one of five career academies offered by the [[Monmouth County Vocational School District]]. This high school is based upon the expansion of medical knowledge for teenagers who want to pursue medical careers. Proximity to Jersey Shore University Medical Center provides students with hands-on training in a hospital setting. The school has been accredited by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Secondary Schools since 1999.<ref>[https://www.msa-cess.org/RelId/606553/AccountID/12248/ISvars/default/School_Search.htm Monmouth County Academy of Allied Health and Science], [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Secondary Schools.

Accessed January 20, 2020.</ref>\n<!--Image deleted: [[Image:AAHS.gif|thumb|right|350px|Academy of Allied Health and Science in Neptune, New Jersey]]-->\n\n== Admission criteria ==\nThe academy is a selective school and will only take those who score well on 7th and 1st marking period 8th grade report cards, and on an acceptance exam, normally held in January or February, after applications to school are submitted. To take Geometry in the freshman year, students successfully pass an Algebra I test. To take Spanish II in the freshman year, students must successfully pass Spanish I test, which includes an \"interview\". The different parts of the entrance exam (not including the Algebra I and Spanish II test) sum up a cumulative score. If this is below 75/100, then the student is automatically disqualified from attending, but a 75 might not be enough to pass. Each town has its first highest-ranked student admitted by default assuming he or she earns a 75 or higher. Not all towns have one student apply, usually one or more seek admission to the Monmouth County Full-Time Vocational Schools. All other students are chosen based on rank and test admission score. There is also a waiting list. It is used not only when students decline their admission, but also when students drop out to return to their home high schools.\n\n==Schedule==\nThe school uses a block schedule. There are four classes in a day, and periods are an hour and twenty-five minutes long. School begins at 7:35 am and ends at 2:25 pm. The first four to five classes are taken in the first half of the school year, and the next four to five are taken in the second. Some classes, including electives, alternate with Fitness.\n\nThe first two periods take place from 7:35 am \u2013 10:27 am (with a two-minute break in between periods).  From 10:27 am \u2013 11:27 am there is a one-hour activity period, where students eat lunch, participate in clubs, or overall relax.  From 11:27 am \u2013 2:25 pm the final two periods take place.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Freshman year ===\n\nThe following classes are required during freshman year: Dynamics of Healthcare, Computer Applications, Math (Algebra I or Geometry), Foreign Language (Latin I or Spanish I or II), Biology, Intro to Anatomy and Physiology (Allied Health Clinical Skills), World History, Fitness I and English I.<ref name=\"course\">[http://aahs.ctemc.org/departments Academics], Academy of Allied Health & Science. Accessed September 4, 2014.</ref> There are nine required classes total: Algebra I or Geometry, English I, World History, Allied Health Clinical Skills, Dynamics of Healthcare, Latin I or Spanish I/II, Computer Applications, Biology I, and Fitness I.  There are no electives in freshman year. The \"Dynamics of Healthcare\" course incorporates learning about health insurance, legal terms, healthcare facilities, professional behavior, and medical history. It is administered by the [[Rutgers School of Health Related Professions]]. The \"Financial Literacy\" course has been replaced with \"Allied Health Clinical Skills,\" which addresses (as indicated by its name) the clinical side of the healthcare profession.  This switch took place in 2013 and Financial Literacy has been moved to Junior Year.\n\nNote: Since the 2012-2013 school year, students are allowed to take Algebra II in 9th grade and PreCalculus in 10th grade. Rahul Yerrabelli did this and took an online AP Statistics course through FLVS for his 11th grade math credits. There is now a Statistics class taught by a new teacher for the 2018-2019 school year. \n\nInstead of taking an art class, students must complete a \"Visual & Performing Arts\" assignment before November of their sophomore year.<ref name=\"course\" />\n\n=== Sophomore year ===\n\nThe following classes are required during sophomore year: Anatomy and Physiology I, Math: Algebra II or Geometry, Foreign Language: Latin II or Spanish II or III, Chemistry, English II, Fitness II, Principles of Computer Technology, Healthy Relations (a guidance/sex ed course) and US History I.<ref name=\"course\" /> There are no electives in sophomore year. In Anatomy and Physiology I course, students volunteer two hours on Fridays for six weeks at [[Jersey Shore University Medical Center]] at a different department each week. Departments that can be assigned include [[NICU]], occupational therapy, laboratory, patient transport, and various nursing floors. At the end of the Anatomy course, students take a Rutgers-issued exam for college credits in Anatomy I and Dynamics of Healthcare.\n\nNote: Since the 2012-2013 school year, students are allowed to take Algebra II in 9th grade and PreCalculus in 10th grade.  It has not been decided if this will be standard for later years for students in the program.\n\n=== Junior year ===\n\nStudents have no electives in this year.<ref name=\"course\" /> During junior year, students continue their learning in Anatomy and Physiology II.<ref name=\"course\" /> Students will again take a similar college-level test for college credits for the Anatomy II course and for Medical Terminology.<ref name=\"course\" /> Students also participate in the Grant Writing/Service Learning class, which teaches students the various aspects of helping their communities. Much volunteer work is involved as the class sponsors activities such as coat or book drives.\n\nNote: Since the 2012-2013 school year, students are allowed to take Algebra II in 9th grade and PreCalculus in 10th grade. There is only 1 junior who is in this case. He is taking an online AP Statistics course through FLVS for his 11th grade math credits. In 2018, a new Statistics teacher was hired to teach the class of about 20 juniors. The class uses an AP textbook but is not an AP class, however, students can take the AP tests by themselves with not much preparation after the course.  \n\nOther required courses are: Financial Literacy, Nutrition (Dual-Enrollment), Algebra II or Pre-calculus, English III, U.S. History II, Physics, Fitness III, and Latin II or Spanish III/IV.\n\n=== Senior year ===\n\nStudents take a \"mentorship\" course. Students choose a \"mentor,\" and must relate their mentorship to the medical field. There are exceptions to the rule of medical involvement, as long as students can prove they are gaining valuable experience in a professional field.  Seniors go to their mentorship site three days a week (Mon, Wed, Fri) for three hours a day during the second half of the school day.  Students have worked with local medical centers, specialized private clinics (ranging from sports medicine to urology), and miscellaneous sites such as a college radio station. Notably, students can fail mentorship if they are kicked out of the hospital, so it is a very formal and strict relationship. \n\nThe following medical courses are available: EMT, Physical Therapy, Sign Language, and Alternative Medicine.<ref name=\"course\" /> Other required courses include: Biology, English IV, Pre-Calculus or Calculus, and Chemistry.<ref name=\"course\" /> Foreign Language is not required, and can be replaced by an elective.  The Fitness program is also no longer an in-school class for seniors, and instead involves filling out an online set of forms.\n\n== Clubs and activities==\nThe academy has many different clubs in many different areas. Clubs usually meet during lunch, but sometimes meet after school. Anyone can join most clubs, but some have requirements. Most notably, HOSA requires members to be juniors or seniors and officers to be seniors, NHS requires members to be juniors or seniors with a 92 (A) GPA and to do volunteer work, and Character Committee has a selection process including interviews. Every club runs year long, except Mock Trial (first semester only) and Model UN (second semester only).\n\n===Team Allied===\nOne main goal of Team Allied (formerly known as Character Committee) is to help new students at the academy feel welcome. Team Allied is unique in that it is the only club that is a four-year commitment, requiring members to sign up in the early spring of their freshmen year. Still, many apply to the club. To keep the club small, there is a highly selective process to determine which applicants are admitted which includes an interview.\n\n===Math Club===\nMath Club emphasizes a love of math. The club meets every second and fourth Tuesday. Math League tests are given 6 times a year and are open to all students. The tests occur during lunch and the time limit is 30 minutes for 6 questions of increasing difficulty (many finish earlier). The highest monthly and cumulative scores are recorded and compared with other schools within the MCVSD district. There is also the AMC test which only occurs once a year. This test has only started to be implemented in 2019-2020 school year.\n\n===Global Forum (Discontinued)===\nGlobal Forum is a club that focuses on free discussion. Global Forum meets every Friday at the second half of lunch. Most of meetings are debates among its members on a specific topic. These debates do not have an informal atmosphere with calling out as the main form of communication. Topics depend on current events, but frequently include gun control, military action, criticism/defense of the president's actions, etc. There also occasional fundraisers for charitable organizations like UNICEF and Red Cross. Finally, Global Forum provides a \"This Day in History...\" fact every Wednesday and Friday on the morning video announcements. Global Forum was discontinued before 2016.\n\n===Mock Trial===\nMock Trial meets in the first semester only. Mock Trial participates, often successfully, in a tournament with other schools. The members pretend to be lawyers, witnesses, etc. and perform a trial hearing. Many members in Mock Trial are also in Model UN.\n\n===Model UN===\nModel UN only occurs on the second half the year. It starts just when Mock Trial ends and is run by the same teacher. Its meetings times are usually Wednesday on the second half of lunch. As the name implies, the club is about imitating a UN meeting. Each member has a country and the members debate an issue. Usually, Model UN competes in one tournament with other schools every year.\n\n===Science League===\nScience League was started in the 2013-2014 school year. Most of its meetings are after school. The club has a large number of competitions, including NJSL, US Biology Olympiad, US Chemistry Olympiad, Merck Test, etc. All of the tests are one day events, except for NJSL. There are four NJSL tests (January, February, March, April) every year. There are many subjects with each subject having 1-3 levels of difficulty. There are plaque for individuals who score in the highest 10% in the state in their respective subject and level. Team plaques are also given to the top 10 teams in the state for each subject and level. In the 2013-2014 school year, Science League chose to participate in four teams: Biology I, Biology II, Chemistry I, and Chemistry II. In the 2014 Biology Olympiad, 4 students, a remarkably high number, of students qualified as semifinalists. Approximately 600 high school students qualify nationwide for this. All four semifinalists were juniors. In 2018, four seniors got 7th place in the New Jersey Science League Biology I Competition. In 2019, the same four seniors and one additional one got 6th place in the New Jersey Science League Chemistry I Competition.\n\n===Academic Team===\nAcademic Team was started in the 2018-2019 school year, and it takes place year-round. The team consists of an \"A\" team and a \"B\" team. These teams were determined by performance on multiple tryout examinations. The \"A\" team have received several accolades, including 3rd Place at the High Technology High School Quiz Bowl Competition, and 2nd place at the Biotechnology Quiz Bowl. \n\n===Red Cross===\nA branch of the Health Occupations Students of America, this club serves to primarily organize fundraisers and food drives for people in need. In the past, they have hosted successful Can Drives, Letters for Veterans, and blood drives. The club was founded by Ashlesha Thorat (Class of 2021), and the current President is Amol Shirodkar (Class of 2020).\n\n===Other clubs===\nOther clubs include HOSA, art club, tech club, yearbook, 4-H, pulse (started in 2013-2014 school year), and NHS.\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n\nThe Academy of Allied Health & Science has been recognized for many awards, including:\n\n* In its listing of \"America's Best High Schools 2016\", the school was ranked 12th out of 500 best high schools in the country; it was ranked fifth among all high schools in New Jersey.<ref>Staff.

McCorkell, who was the school's first principal until the end of the 2001-02 school year, when he was promoted to Assistant Superintendent at [[Monmouth County Vocational School District]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = http://www.mcvsd.org/admin/\n | title = MCVSD Administration\n | accessdate = May 26, 2012\n | author = Monmouth County Vocational School District\n | date = April 21, 2010}}\n</ref> He was later Superintendent in 2009. Following McCorkell was Scott Taylor. Taylor resigned after the 2004-05 school year to take a position at the [[Little Silver School District]]. Robert V. Cancro took the position after Scott Taylor left.\n\nIn 1997, the first \"Color Wars\" took place. Originally, two teams were made by splitting the student body into two groups by homerooms. Students were pitted against students in their own grade. It is a [[battle of the classes]] event, with the freshman and senior classes (taking the school color blue) pitted against the sophomore and junior classes (taking the school color gray) in a week-long series of competitive events, which include [[ultimate frisbee]], pudding eating, [[tug of war]], a medical challenge, student and faculty volleyball, an original skit, and one or more \"mystery events\". It takes place in late May. Beforehand, the teams must choose a team name incorporating the color. As of the  2011-12 school year, the blue team has won four times, and the gray team has won four times. In the 2011-2012 school year, the gray team won. Then the blue team won in the 2012-2013 school year against the gray team (called the Gray Avengers). Finally, in the 2013-2014 school year, the gray team (called the Holy Grayl) won against the blue team (Bluminati). Furthermore, no class has won all four years, but the classes of 2010 and 2011 came very close (each with 3-1). As of early 2017, the class of 2018 has 3 wins, and they hope to have their fourth win in spring 2018. However, the class of 2012 lost all four years. Teacher Chris Benson and the Student Council are in charge of planning and managing the events.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = http://www.aahs.mcvsd.org/activities.html\n | title = Co-Curricular Activities\n | accessdate = May 26, 2012\n | author =Academy of Allied Health and Science}}\n</ref>\n<!--To add: lipsync, Mr. AAHS-->\n\nStarting in the 2004-05 school year, the school began phasing out its French Language program, due to core curriculum conflicts.

Episodes air at 3 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] on Monday through Friday. The show focuses on the day's events with interviews, current event updates, and comprehensive reporting. The show is a part of the Fox News program lineup since October 7, 2013, and had been the number one cable news broadcast in its time slot.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe program continues coverage of stories followed during prior hours of Fox News programs. The show often takes a swifter pace compared to the network's other programming, making a larger focus of the program on [[breaking news|breaking-news]] events with live correspondents. The coverage includes correspondents on location, in studio, in addition to analysis from [[pundit]]s or experts. [[Trace Gallagher]] fills in on days when Smith is absent.\n\nPrior to the program's relaunch on April 23, 2007, and to a larger extent summer 2007, ''Studio B'' was commonly seen as more laid-back, including a short segment of small talk after the bottom-of-the-hour headlines between Smith and [[Jane Skinner]] commonly about [[soft news]] or irrelevant stories of the day. The segment was known as \"Skinnerville\".\n\n== History ==\nThe program's relaunch included the conclusion of the weekend edition of ''Studio B'', hosted by [[Trace Gallagher]], which was started in February 2006. ''Studio B'' replaced the 3-4 p.m. ET hour of ''[[Fox News Live]]'' (also hosted by Smith) in 2002, and the weekend hour of ''Fox News Live'' in 2005. The weekend editions were discontinued in May 2007, when the 3-4 p.m. timeslot was replaced by reruns of ''[[War Stories with Oliver North]]'', or other taped programming. Trace Gallagher hosted ''Studio B'' as a fill-in anchor whenever Smith was absent.\n\nAlso in 2007, Smith revealed that the program would soon get a more expansive overhaul, which may include name and format changes. This is partly because FNC's physical Studio B is no longer available for the network's use. On December 14, 2008, ''Studio B'' moved to Studio 12H, the set used by the ''[[Fox Report]]'' due to its move to the high definition Election Night set used by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].\n\nOn January 9, 2009, ''Studio B'' moved to a new set in Studio 12H. Despite the actual studio name, Shepard Smith stated that this studio will be the new Studio B, \"because that is the name of the program\". While ''Studio B'' moved to the aforementioned HD set, it continued to broadcast in [[4:3]] with the Fox News HD wing at the side, until March 23, 2009, when the show began broadcasting in full [[16:9]].\n\nDuring the week of September 26 \u2013 October 2, 2011, the ''Fox Report'' moved into its former studios, Studio E, which was used from September 2007 to December 2008  at the same time, ''Studio B'' moved into the newsroom and Shepard Smith announced on the September 28 broadcast that the ''Fox Report'' and ''Studio B'' moved into a new set on October 10, 2011. On that date, ''Studio B'' and the ''[[Fox Report]]'' introduced a new look and graphics featuring the new lower-thirds graphics for the show as seen on other Fox News Channel shows, ''[[The Five (talk show)|The Five]]'' and ''[[Happening Now]]''. Shepard Smith presented the show from a modified Studio 12H featuring more monitors and retaining \"The Cube\" but the overhead platform and accompanying staircase, which had been part of the set since 2008 had been removed.\n\nOn October 7, 2013, ''Studio B'' was relaunched as ''Shepard Smith Reporting'' with new graphics and a new state of the art studio called \"The Fox News Deck\" in Studio D.<ref name=\"tvnewser20130912\">{{cite news |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/new-fox-news-deal-for-shepard-smith-as-network-begins-program-changes_b196393 |title=New Fox News Deal for Shepard Smith as Network Begins Program Changes |work=TV Newser |first=Chris |last=Ariens |date=September 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915041338/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/new-fox-news-deal-for-shepard-smith-as-network-begins-program-changes_b196393 |archivedate=September 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe program was rebranded ''Fox News Reporting'' on October 14, 2019, upon Shepard Smith's departure from Fox News.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shepard-smith-leaving-fox-news-1247097 |title=Shepard Smith Leaving Fox News After 23 Years |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Jeremy |last=Barr |date=October 11, 2019 |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nOn September 28, 2012, ''Studio B'' inadvertently broadcast the suicide (due to a gunshot to the head) of 33-year-old Jodon F.

Later, as a military solution became less feasible, the ROC referred to the PRC as \"Communist China\"\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e2d\u5171}}). With the democratization of Taiwan in the 1990s, the phrase \"mainland China\" soon grew to mean not only the area under the control of the Communist Party of China, but also a more neutral means to refer to the People's Republic of China government; this usage remains prevalent by the KMT today.\n\nDue to their status as colonies of foreign states during the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the phrase \"mainland China\" excludes [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=So|editor1-first=Alvin Y. |editor2-last=Lin|editor2-first=Nan |editor3-last=Poston|editor3-first=Dudley L.|title=The Chinese Triangle of mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong : comparative institutional analyses|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=9780313308697}}</ref> Since the return of Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereignty in [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|1997]] and [[Transfer of sovereignty of Macau|1999]], respectively, the two territories have retained their legal, political, and economic systems.

Therefore, \"mainland China\" generally continues to exclude these territories, because of the \"[[One country, two systems]]\" policy adopted by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|PRC central government]] towards the [[special administrative region|regions]].<ref name=\"LegCo1\">LegCo. \"[http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr06-07/english/bc/bc56/papers/bc561008cb2-2767-1-e.pdf Legislative council HK].\" ''Mainland Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Bill.''

However, democratization on Taiwan has led to the rise of voices which denounced traditional attitudes towards the mainland and the [[Ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral home system]], pressing for [[Taiwanization]], [[Desinicization]], and \"Taiwan cultural independence\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u6587\u5316\u53f0\u7368}}). Concurrently, the mainland [[Chinese economic reform]] changed the connotation of \"mainland China\" to one of \"primitiveness, nativeness, and raw cultural material for economic gain\", as well as condescension because of Taiwan's comparatively advanced economy.<ref name=\"Shih\" /> Warlike phrases like \"Counterattack the mainland!\" saw a revival, but in reference to the economic expansion of Taiwanese businesses. Despite the re-branding of the Kuomintang in the 1990s as a party \"native\" to Taiwan, Kuomintang continues to produce a variety of mainland-related media such as the television program \"Searching for the Strange on the Mainland\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5927\u9678\u5c0b\u5947}}).<ref name=\"Shih\" />\n\n==== Terms used in Taiwan ====\nIn Taiwan, there are differing opinions as to the neutrality of the term \"mainland China\". However, the term is considered somewhat more neutral than historical terms used to describe the territories under the control of the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] (which is in turn led by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party of China (CPC)]]).\n\nTraditionally, the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]] (led by the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang/Nationalists (KMT/GMD)]]) has referred to the territories under the control of the Chinese Communist Party with several different names, e.g. \"(territory controlled by the) [[Communist bandit|Communist bandits]]\", \"occupied/unfree area (of China)\" (as opposed to the \"[[free area of the Republic of China]]\"), \"Communist China\" (as opposed to either \"Nationalist China\" or \"Democratic China\"), \"Red China\" (as opposed to \"Blue China\"), and \"mainland China (area)\". In modern times, the term \"Communist bandits\" is generally considered both inflammatory and offensive by supporters of the Kuomintang and other [[Pan-Blue Coalition|Pan-Blue]] political parties [the KMT and other aligned parties believe that \"China\" encompasses both sides of the Taiwan Strait<ref name=\"Wachman\">{{Cite book|title=Taiwan: National Identity and Democratization|last=Wachman|first=Alan|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=1994|page=81|authorlink1=Alan M. Wachman}}</ref>], so it is no longer used by them. Similarly, terms implying illegal occupation (of the mainland) or an intent to reclaim the mainland tend not to be used by both Pan-Blue and Pan-Green individuals. Therefore, only the terms \"Communist China\" or \"mainland China\" are still commonly used by Taiwanese (Chinese) people aligned with Pan-Blue ideologies. Somewhat synonymous to the term \"Communist China\" is the term \"People's Republic of China (PRC)\" (which is either considered to encompass [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] or isn't, due to the confusion and ambiguity of [[One country, two systems|One Country Two Systems]]). Meanwhile, the term \"mainland China\" is often simply abbreviated to \"the mainland\" among speakers of Chinese in Taiwan or from Taiwan. \n\nHowever, the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] in Taiwan, led by the [[Democratic Progressive Party|Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)]] [the DPP and other aligned parties usually support [[Taiwanese independence movement|Taiwanese independence]] to a certain degree], tend to be opposed to suggestions that Taiwan is part of China,<ref name=\"Wachman\" /><ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/07/23/2003538429 DPP is firm on China name issue]. Taipei Times (2013-07-14). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref> regardless of the subtlety of said suggestions. Referring to the territories under the control of the Chinese Communist Party as \"mainland China\" suggests that Taiwan is part of China. That is, the term \"mainland China\" suggests that Taiwan is a \"satellite island\" of China, and that Taiwan is tethered to China (much in the same way that one might say that \"[[Kinmen]] is tethered to Taiwan\"). Therefore, Pan-Green individuals tend to prefer the term \"China\", rather than \"mainland China\", since the term \"China\" suggests that Taiwan and China are two separate countries. Pan-Green Taiwanese might also prefer to refer to China as \"Communist China\" or \"the People's Republic of China (PRC)\" or \"Red China\". However, these terms suggest that there exist \"[[two Chinas]]\". Certain Pan-Green Taiwanese believe that there exist \"two Chinas\" and that the Republic of China (ROC) and Taiwan [[Four-Stage Theory of the Republic of China|are one and the same]], so they would be more inclined to use these terms (compared to those who believe that [[Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan|the ROC is illegally occupying Taiwan]]). Individuals in Taiwan who are aligned with Pan-Green ideologies might be more inclined to refer to the People's Republic of China as \"the Communist bandits\" or \"occupied/unfree area\" (compared to those aligned with Pan-Blue ideologies), due to their negative (or indifferent) views towards mainland China and the Chinese Communist Party, though they generally don't have any intention of \"reclaiming the mainland\".\n\n==== Legal definitions ====\nGovernment organizations and official and legal documents in Taiwan, including the [[Republic of China Constitution|Republic of China (ROC) Constitution]], use the term \"the mainland\" to refer to territory controlled by the PRC (excluding the claimed area of the Free Area). Since the ROC government has never recognized the establishment of the PRC and because the Constitution of the ROC does not allow the existence of another [[sovereign state|state]] within its territory, constitutional amendments made in the 1990s had to refer to the area occupied by the PRC as \"mainland\", since that territory was still officially considered to be part of the ROC's sovereign territory which was just under illegal enemy occupation. \n\nDue to the issue of [[national identity]] (i.e. \"Chinese versus Taiwanese\"), the Democratic Progressive Party and other aligned parties would prefer to amend the ROC constitution to limit its scope and territorial description to the [[Free area of the Republic of China]] only and [[Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign|formally change the name of the Republic of China]] to \"Republic of Taiwan\" instead, thereby eliminating the need to refer to the \"mainland area\" and \"Free Area\" altogether.<ref>[http://dpptaiwan.blogspot.com/2011/03/establishment-of-sovereign-and.html] Democratic Progressive Party Platform: Taiwan Sovereignty page</ref>\n\nIn 1992, a high-level political meeting between the ROC and PRC was held in [[Hong Kong]] where what became called the \"[[1992 Consensus]]\" developed. This \"consensus\" essentially reaffirmed that both the ROC (then under KMT administration) and the PRC agree there is only \"[[one China Principle|one China]]\" in a definition that covers both sides of Taiwan Strait, but they differ on their own interpretation of what that \"China\" means. Each interprets and believes it is the legitimate government of China and has a claim on the territories held by the other. In this context, the term \"mainland China\" is agreeable to both sides since they both conceive \"China\" as including mainland and Taiwan, and therefore need this term to distinguish the two areas. However, since it was the KMT who came to this consensus with mainland China, the [[Pan Green Coalition]] does not embrace this term as the [[Pan Blue Coalition]] does.\n\n==== Other usages of \"Mainland/Mainlander\" ====\nIn Taiwan, the term \"Waishengren\" ({{zh|c=\u5916\u7701\u4eba|p=w\u00e0ish\u011bngr\u00e9n|l=external province person(s)|labels=no}}) is used to describe an ethnic or sub-ethnic group which officially comprises around 14% of the population of Taiwan. Waishengren were originally people who migrated from mainland China to Taiwan immediately after the supposed \"[[Retrocession Day|Retrocession]]\" of Taiwan to the Republic of China, following the Japanese surrender of 1945. Waishengren are most commonly associated with those Chinese who migrated to Taiwan with the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]] around the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. However, the term has become somewhat outdated in modern times, as it now refers to the descendants of the original Waishengren, spanning across 74 years of modern history. Most modern Waishengren were born and raised in Taiwan. However, the term still sees usage in Taiwan (e.g. \"[[Taiwanese people#New Taiwanese|New Taiwanese]]\", a related term coined by former ROC-president [[Lee Teng-hui]]) due to the reality that many children of Waishengren were raised with \"[[Mainland Chinese]]\" family values and national ideologies (and therefore don't often share the same values and identity as \"Benshengren\" ({{zh|c=\u672c\u7701\u4eba|p=b\u011bnsh\u011bngr\u00e9n|l=original province person(s)|labels=no}}), or \"Native Taiwanese\"). The status of Waishengren in Taiwan is a divisive political issue. For many years, certain groups of Waishengren were given special treatment by the KMT government, which had imposed [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law on Taiwan]]. More recently, pro-Taiwan independence politicians have been calling into question the loyalty and devotion of Waishengren to Taiwan, whereas pro-[[Chinese reunification]] politicians have been accusing the pro-independence politicians of playing [[identity politics]].<ref>Apdrc.org. \"[http://www.apdrc.org.tw/apdrc/web/identity.htm Apdrc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929075444/http://www.apdrc.org.tw/apdrc/web/identity.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}.\" ''Taiwan's Identity Politics.'' Retrieved on 2008-03-10.</ref> \n\nIn modern times, the term \"Mainlander\" mostly refers to \"Daluren\" ({{zh|t=\u5927\u9678\u4eba|s=\u5927\u9646\u4eba|p=d\u00e0l\u00f9r\u00e9n|l=mainland person(s)|labels=no}}), meaning people who live in China (PRC), i.e. mainland China. The term does not generally refer to people living in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], even though those regions are nominally under the sovereignty of the PRC. The term also usually isn't used to refer to residents of [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], islands which are under the control of the ROC and are administered as \"[[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Streamlined Fujian Province]]\" (i.e. they are not part of Taiwan). However, the islands of Kinmen and Matsu are geographically much closer to \"mainland China\" than Taiwan and have historically been separate from Taiwan. Kinmenese and Matsunese are commonly referred to by foreign media as \"Taiwanese\", but they generally prefer to refer to themselves as \"Kinmenese\" and \"Matsunese\", respectively (i.e. they neither prefer to be labeled as \"Taiwanese\" nor \"Mainlander\", but as something else entirely).\n\n===Hong Kong and Macau===\n[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are both sovereign territories of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. However, due to the [[One country, two systems|One Country Two Systems]] policy, the two regions maintain a high degree of autonomy, hence why they are considered not to be part of mainland China.\n\nGeologically speaking, Hong Kong and Macau are both connected to mainland China in certain areas (e.g. the north of the [[New Territories]]). Additionally, the islands contained within Hong Kong (e.g. [[Hong Kong Island]]) and Macau are much closer to mainland China than Taiwan and [[Hainan]], and are much smaller. \n\nIn [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], the terms \"mainland China\" and \"mainlander\" are frequently used for people from PRC-governed areas (i.e. not Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau). The Chinese term ''Neidi'' ({{zh|t=\u5167\u5730|labels=no}}), meaning the ''inland'' but still translated ''mainland'' in English, is commonly applied by [[Special Administrative Region|SAR]] governments to represent non-SAR areas of PRC, including [[Hainan]] province and coastal regions of mainland China, such as \"Constitutional and Mainland Affairs\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u653f\u5236\u53ca\u5167\u5730\u4e8b\u52d9\u5c40}})<ref>Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. \"[http://www.cmab.gov.hk/ Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China].\" ''Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau.''
