The film stars [[Jeremy Blackman]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Melinda Dillon]], [[Philip Baker Hall]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Ricky Jay]], [[William H. Macy]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Jason Robards]], and [[Melora Walters]], and is a mosaic of interrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness and meaning in the [[San Fernando Valley]].\n\n''Magnolia'' received positive reviews, with critics praising its acting, direction, storytelling, ambition, and [[Magnolia (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]], largely consisting of [[Aimee Mann]] songs; however, some deemed it overlong and melodramatic. Of the [[ensemble cast]], Tom Cruise was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[72nd Academy Awards]], and won the award in that category at the [[Golden Globes]] of 2000. The film also won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. It was Robards' final feature film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe narrator recounts three instances of incredible coincidences and suggests that forces greater than [[Chance (philosophy)|chance]] play important roles in life.\n\nPolice officer Jim Kurring investigates a disturbance at a woman's apartment, finding a body in a closet. Dixon, a neighborhood boy, tries to tell him who committed the murder, but Jim is dismissive. Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson. Claudia's neighbors called the police after she argued with her estranged father, children's game show host Jimmy Gator, and then blasted music while snorting [[cocaine]]. Unaware of her addiction, Jim is attracted to her and prolongs the visit. He asks her on a date that night, to which she says yes.\n\nJimmy hosts a long-running [[quiz show]] called \"''What Do Kids Know?\"'' and is dying of [[cancer]]; he has only a few months to live. That night the newest [[child prodigy]] on the show, Stanley Spector, takes the lead as the show begins. He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the surrounding adults, who refuse to let him use the bathroom during a commercial break. When the show resumes, he wets himself and freezes, humiliated when everyone realizes what happened. As the show continues, an inebriated Jimmy sickens, and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage. But after Stanley's father berates him for freezing on-air, Stanley runs away from the studio.\n\nDonnie Smith, a former ''\"What Do Kids Know?\"'' champion, watches the show from a bar. Donnie's parents spent the money he won as a child, and he has just been fired from his job at Solomon & Solomon, an electronics store, due to chronic lateness and poor sales. He is obsessed with getting [[oral surgery]], thinking he will land the man of his dreams after he gets braces. He hatches a plan to get back at his boss by stealing the money he needs for his braces.\n\nThe show's former producer, Earl Partridge, is also dying of cancer. Earl's [[trophy wife]], Linda, collects his prescriptions for [[morphine]] while he is cared for by a nurse, Phil Parma. Earl asks Phil to find his estranged son, Frank Mackey, a [[motivational speaker]] peddling a [[pickup artist]] course to men. Frank is in the midst of an interview with a journalist who reveals that she knows Frank had to take care of his dying mother after Earl abandoned the family. An angry Frank storms out of the interview when Phil gets through to him.\n\nLinda goes to see Earl's lawyer, begging him to change Earl's [[Last will|will]]. She admits she married Earl for his money, but now loves him and does not want it. The lawyer suggests she renounce the will and refuse the money, which would go to Frank. Linda rejects his advice and leaves in a rage. Linda berates Phil for seeking out Frank but later apologizes. She then drives to a vacant parking lot and washes down handfuls of prescription medicine with alcohol. Dixon finds Linda in her car, near death, and calls an ambulance after taking money from her purse.\n\nBefore his date with Claudia, Jim takes fire during a pursuit and loses his gun. When he meets Claudia, they promise to be honest with each other, so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he was divorced three years earlier. Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems, but Jim assures her that her past does not matter. They kiss, but she runs off.\n\nJimmy goes home to his wife, Rose, and confesses that he cheated on her. She asks why Claudia does not talk to him, and Jimmy admits that Claudia believes he molested her. Rose demands to know if it is true, but Jimmy says he cannot remember if he committed the abuse. Upset, Rose tells Jimmy he deserves to die alone and walks out on him.\n\nDonnie takes money from the Solomon & Solomon safe. As he drives away, he decides to return the money but discovers he cannot get back in as his key broke off in the lock. While climbing a utility pole to get on the roof, he is seen by a passing Jim. Suddenly, [[Rain of animals|frogs begin falling from the sky]], with multiple consequences: as Jimmy is about to shoot himself, frogs fall through his skylight, causing him to shoot the TV, which sets his house on fire; Rose crashes her car in front of Claudia's apartment, but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter; Earl is awakened by the sound and sees Frank beside him before dying; Linda's ambulance crashes in front of the emergency room; and Donnie is knocked from the pole, smashes his teeth, and is dragged to safety by Jim.\n\nJim counsels Donnie and helps him return the money; his gun also mysteriously falls from the sky. Frank goes to the hospital to be with Linda, who will recover from her [[attempted suicide]]. Stanley returns home and tells his father that he needs to be kinder to him, but his father just tells him to go to bed. Jim goes to see Claudia, telling her he wants to make things work between them, and she smiles in reply.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jeremy Blackman]] as Stanley Spector\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Frank T.J.

The first image he had for the film was the smiling face of actress [[Melora Walters]].<ref name=\"patterson\"/> The next image that came to him was of [[Philip Baker Hall]] as her father.

For the section of the prologue that is set in 1911, Anderson used a hand-cranked [[Path\u00e9]] camera that would have been used at the time.<ref name=\"prodnotes\"/> Some of the actors were nervous about singing the lyrics to Mann's \"Wise Up\" in the film's climactic scene and so Anderson had Moore do it first and she set the pace and everyone else followed.<ref name=\"patterson\"/>\n\nAnderson and New Line reportedly had intense arguments about how to market ''Magnolia''.<ref name=\"hirschberg\"/> He felt that the studio did not do a decent enough job on ''Boogie Nights'' and did not like the studio's poster or trailer for ''Magnolia''.

Reilly]] grew a mustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of [[Cops (TV series)|''COPS'']] with the director chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Actress [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring's dialogue came from these sessions.<ref name=\"patterson\"/> This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was \"always cast as these heavies or these semi-retarded child men. Can't you give me something I can relate to, like falling in love with a girl?\"<ref name=\"braun\">{{cite news | last = Braun | first = Liz | title = He Finally Gets the Girl| newspaper = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = January 11, 2000 }}</ref> Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it was something different that the actor had not done before.<ref name=\"patterson\"/>\n\nFor [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], Anderson wanted him to play a \"really simple, uncomplicated, caring character\".<ref name=\"patterson\"/> The actor described his character as someone who \"really takes pride in the fact that every day he's dealing with life and death circumstances\".<ref name=\"prodnotes\"/> With [[Julianne Moore]] in mind, the director wrote a role for her to play a crazed character using many pharmaceuticals. According to the actress, \"Linda doesn't know who she is or what she's feeling and can only try to explain it in the most vulgar terms possible\".<ref name=\"strauss\">{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Bob | title = Everything's Coming Up ''Magnolia''s for Actress | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = December 23, 1999 }}</ref> For William H.

After Anderson finished the script, he sent Cruise a copy and the next day, the actor called him. Cruise was interested but nervous about the role. They met with Cruise along with De Luca who helped convince the actor to do the film.<ref name=\"hirschberg\"/> Frank T.J. Mackey, the character that Cruise would play in the film, was based in part on an audio-recording done in an engineering class taught by a friend that was given to Anderson.<ref name=\"konow\"/> It consisted of two men, \"talking all this trash\" about women and quoting a man named [[Ross Jeffries]], who was teaching a new version of the [[Eric Weber (director)|Eric Weber]] course, \"How to Pick Up Women,\" but utilizing [[hypnotism]] and [[subliminal message|subliminal]] language techniques.<ref name=\"konow\"/> Anderson transcribed the tape and did a reading with Reilly and [[Chris Penn]].<ref name=\"hirschberg\"/> The director then incorporated this dialogue and his research on Jeffries and other self-help gurus into Mackey and his sex seminar.<ref name=\"konow\"/> Anderson felt that Cruise was drawn to the role because he had just finished making ''Eyes Wide Shut'', playing a repressed character, and was able to then play a character that was \"outlandish and bigger-than-life\".<ref name=\"strauss2\"/>\n\nAnderson wrote the role of Earl Partridge for [[Jason Robards]], but Robards was initially unable to do it because of a serious [[staph infection]].

Mann had songs on soundtracks before but never \"utilized in such an integral way\" she said in an interview.<ref name=\"weinraub\"/> She gave Anderson rough mixes of songs and found that they both wrote about the same kinds of characters.<ref name=\"weinraub\"/> He encouraged her to write songs for the film by sending her a copy of the script.<ref name=\"prodnotes\"/>\n\nTwo songs were written expressly for the film: \"You Do\", which was based on a character later cut from the film, and \"Save Me\", which closes the film;<ref name=\"bessman\"/> the latter was nominated in the 2000 [[Academy Award]]s and [[Golden Globes]] and in the 2001 [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]. Most of the remaining seven Mann songs were demos and works in progress; \"Wise Up\", which is at the center of a sequence in which all of the characters sing the song,<ref name=\"patterson\"/> was originally written for the 1996 film ''[[Jerry Maguire]]''. At the time Mann's record label had refused to release her songs on an album.<ref name=\"bessman\"/> The song that plays at the opening of the film is Mann's cover of [[One (Harry Nilsson song)|\"One\"]] by [[Harry Nilsson]]. Mann's track \"Momentum\" is used as the loud playing music in Claudia's apartment scene when Officer Jim arrives and was also featured in the trailer for the film.\n\nThe [[Magnolia (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]], released in December 1999 on [[Reprise Records]], features the Mann songs, as well as a section of [[Jon Brion]]'s score and tracks by [[Supertramp]] and [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]] that were used in the film.

Macy]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Jason Robards]], and [[Melora Walters]], and is a mosaic of interrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness and meaning in the [[San Fernando Valley]].\n\n''Magnolia'' received positive reviews, with critics praising its acting, direction, storytelling, ambition, and [[Magnolia (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]], largely consisting of [[Aimee Mann]] songs; however, some deemed it overlong and melodramatic. Of the [[ensemble cast]], Tom Cruise was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[72nd Academy Awards]], and won the award in that category at the [[Golden Globes]] of 2000. The film also won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. It was Robards' final feature film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe narrator recounts three instances of incredible coincidences and suggests that forces greater than [[Chance (philosophy)|chance]] play important roles in life.\n\nPolice officer Jim Kurring investigates a disturbance at a woman's apartment, finding a body in a closet. Dixon, a neighborhood boy, tries to tell him who committed the murder, but Jim is dismissive. Jim goes to the apartment of Claudia Wilson. Claudia's neighbors called the police after she argued with her estranged father, children's game show host Jimmy Gator, and then blasted music while snorting [[cocaine]]. Unaware of her addiction, Jim is attracted to her and prolongs the visit. He asks her on a date that night, to which she says yes.\n\nJimmy hosts a long-running [[quiz show]] called \"''What Do Kids Know?\"'' and is dying of [[cancer]]; he has only a few months to live. That night the newest [[child prodigy]] on the show, Stanley Spector, takes the lead as the show begins. He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the surrounding adults, who refuse to let him use the bathroom during a commercial break. When the show resumes, he wets himself and freezes, humiliated when everyone realizes what happened. As the show continues, an inebriated Jimmy sickens, and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage. But after Stanley's father berates him for freezing on-air, Stanley runs away from the studio.\n\nDonnie Smith, a former ''\"What Do Kids Know?\"'' champion, watches the show from a bar. Donnie's parents spent the money he won as a child, and he has just been fired from his job at Solomon & Solomon, an electronics store, due to chronic lateness and poor sales. He is obsessed with getting [[oral surgery]], thinking he will land the man of his dreams after he gets braces. He hatches a plan to get back at his boss by stealing the money he needs for his braces.\n\nThe show's former producer, Earl Partridge, is also dying of cancer. Earl's [[trophy wife]], Linda, collects his prescriptions for [[morphine]] while he is cared for by a nurse, Phil Parma. Earl asks Phil to find his estranged son, Frank Mackey, a [[motivational speaker]] peddling a [[pickup artist]] course to men. Frank is in the midst of an interview with a journalist who reveals that she knows Frank had to take care of his dying mother after Earl abandoned the family. An angry Frank storms out of the interview when Phil gets through to him.\n\nLinda goes to see Earl's lawyer, begging him to change Earl's [[Last will|will]]. She admits she married Earl for his money, but now loves him and does not want it. The lawyer suggests she renounce the will and refuse the money, which would go to Frank. Linda rejects his advice and leaves in a rage. Linda berates Phil for seeking out Frank but later apologizes. She then drives to a vacant parking lot and washes down handfuls of prescription medicine with alcohol. Dixon finds Linda in her car, near death, and calls an ambulance after taking money from her purse.\n\nBefore his date with Claudia, Jim takes fire during a pursuit and loses his gun. When he meets Claudia, they promise to be honest with each other, so he confesses his ineptitude as a cop and admits he has not been on a date since he was divorced three years earlier. Claudia says he will hate her because of her problems, but Jim assures her that her past does not matter. They kiss, but she runs off.\n\nJimmy goes home to his wife, Rose, and confesses that he cheated on her. She asks why Claudia does not talk to him, and Jimmy admits that Claudia believes he molested her. Rose demands to know if it is true, but Jimmy says he cannot remember if he committed the abuse. Upset, Rose tells Jimmy he deserves to die alone and walks out on him.\n\nDonnie takes money from the Solomon & Solomon safe. As he drives away, he decides to return the money but discovers he cannot get back in as his key broke off in the lock. While climbing a utility pole to get on the roof, he is seen by a passing Jim. Suddenly, [[Rain of animals|frogs begin falling from the sky]], with multiple consequences: as Jimmy is about to shoot himself, frogs fall through his skylight, causing him to shoot the TV, which sets his house on fire; Rose crashes her car in front of Claudia's apartment, but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter; Earl is awakened by the sound and sees Frank beside him before dying; Linda's ambulance crashes in front of the emergency room; and Donnie is knocked from the pole, smashes his teeth, and is dragged to safety by Jim.\n\nJim counsels Donnie and helps him return the money; his gun also mysteriously falls from the sky. Frank goes to the hospital to be with Linda, who will recover from her [[attempted suicide]]. Stanley returns home and tells his father that he needs to be kinder to him, but his father just tells him to go to bed. Jim goes to see Claudia, telling her he wants to make things work between them, and she smiles in reply.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jeremy Blackman]] as Stanley Spector\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Frank T.J.

The mission is a constellation with two twin satellites, [[Sentinel-2A]] and [[Sentinel-2B]].\n\nThe mission supports a broad range of services and applications such as agricultural monitoring, emergencies management, land cover classification or water quality.\n\nSentinel-2 has been developed and is being operated by [[European Space Agency|ESA]], and the satellites were manufactured by a consortium led by [[Airbus Defence and Space|Airbus DS]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe Sentinel-2 mission has the following key characteristics:\n* [[Multispectral image|Multi-spectral]] data with 13 bands in the [[Visible spectrum|visible]], [[Infrared#Regions within the infrared|near infrared]], and [[Infrared#Regions within the infrared|short wave infrared]] part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]]\n* Systematic global coverage of land surfaces from 56\u00b0&nbsp;S to 84\u00b0&nbsp;N, coastal waters, and all of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]\n* Revisiting every 5 days under the same viewing angles. At high latitudes, Sentinel-2 swath overlap and some regions will be observed twice or more every 5 days, but with different viewing angles.\n* Spatial resolution of 10&nbsp;m, 20&nbsp;m and 60&nbsp;m\n* 290&nbsp;km field of view\n* Free and open data policy\n\nTo achieve frequent revisits and high mission availability, two identical Sentinel-2 satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) operate together. The satellites are phased 180 degrees from each other on the same orbit. This allows for what would be a 10-day revisit cycle to be completed in 5 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/satellite-description/orbit|title=Orbit - Sentinel 2 - Mission - Sentinel Online|website=sentinel.esa.int|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> The 290km swath is created by the VNIR and SWIR, which are each made of 12 detectors that are lined in two offset rows. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/instrument-payload|title=Sentinel-2 - Missions - Instrument Payload - Sentinel Handbook|website=sentinel.esa.int|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe orbit is [[Sun-synchronous orbit|Sun synchronous]] at {{convert|786|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude, 14.3 revolutions per day, with a 10:30&nbsp;a.m. descending node. This local time was selected as a compromise between minimizing cloud cover and ensuring suitable Sun illumination. It is close to the [[Landsat]] local time and matches [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT]]{{'s}}, allowing the combination of Sentinel-2 data with historical images to build long-term time series. \n\n==Launches==\nThe launch of the first satellite, Sentinel-2A, occurred 23 June 2015 at 01:52&nbsp;UTC on a [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] launch vehicle.<ref name=\"sfinside20150623\">{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/earth-science/arianespace-successfully-launches-europes-sentinel-2a-earth-observation-satellite/ |title=Arianespace successfully launches Europe's Sentinel-2A Earth observation satellite |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Tomasz |last=Nowakowski |date=23 June 2015 |accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nSentinel-2B was launched on 7 March 2017 at 01:49&nbsp;UTC,<ref name=\"nasasf20170306\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/03/sentinel-2b-vega-ride-join-copernicus-fleet/ |title=Sentinel-2B rides Vega to join Copernicus fleet |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |first=Chris |last=Bergin |date=6 March 2017 |accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref> also aboard a Vega rocket.<ref name=\"sfinsider20161117\">{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/esa/esas-sentinel-2b-spacecraft-steps-spotlight/ |title=ESA's Sentinel 2B spacecraft steps into the spotlight |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Jacques |last=van Oene |date=17 November 2016 |accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Instruments==\nThe Sentinel-2 satellites will each carry a single multi-spectral instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral channels in the visible/near infrared (VNIR) and short wave infrared spectral range (SWIR).

The mission is a constellation with two twin satellites, [[Sentinel-2A]] and [[Sentinel-2B]].\n\nThe mission supports a broad range of services and applications such as agricultural monitoring, emergencies management, land cover classification or water quality.\n\nSentinel-2 has been developed and is being operated by [[European Space Agency|ESA]], and the satellites were manufactured by a consortium led by [[Airbus Defence and Space|Airbus DS]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe Sentinel-2 mission has the following key characteristics:\n* [[Multispectral image|Multi-spectral]] data with 13 bands in the [[Visible spectrum|visible]], [[Infrared#Regions within the infrared|near infrared]], and [[Infrared#Regions within the infrared|short wave infrared]] part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]]\n* Systematic global coverage of land surfaces from 56\u00b0&nbsp;S to 84\u00b0&nbsp;N, coastal waters, and all of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]\n* Revisiting every 5 days under the same viewing angles. At high latitudes, Sentinel-2 swath overlap and some regions will be observed twice or more every 5 days, but with different viewing angles.\n* Spatial resolution of 10&nbsp;m, 20&nbsp;m and 60&nbsp;m\n* 290&nbsp;km field of view\n* Free and open data policy\n\nTo achieve frequent revisits and high mission availability, two identical Sentinel-2 satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) operate together. The satellites are phased 180 degrees from each other on the same orbit. This allows for what would be a 10-day revisit cycle to be completed in 5 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/satellite-description/orbit|title=Orbit - Sentinel 2 - Mission - Sentinel Online|website=sentinel.esa.int|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> The 290km swath is created by the VNIR and SWIR, which are each made of 12 detectors that are lined in two offset rows. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2/instrument-payload|title=Sentinel-2 - Missions - Instrument Payload - Sentinel Handbook|website=sentinel.esa.int|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe orbit is [[Sun-synchronous orbit|Sun synchronous]] at {{convert|786|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude, 14.3 revolutions per day, with a 10:30&nbsp;a.m. descending node. This local time was selected as a compromise between minimizing cloud cover and ensuring suitable Sun illumination. It is close to the [[Landsat]] local time and matches [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT]]{{'s}}, allowing the combination of Sentinel-2 data with historical images to build long-term time series. \n\n==Launches==\nThe launch of the first satellite, Sentinel-2A, occurred 23 June 2015 at 01:52&nbsp;UTC on a [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] launch vehicle.<ref name=\"sfinside20150623\">{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/earth-science/arianespace-successfully-launches-europes-sentinel-2a-earth-observation-satellite/ |title=Arianespace successfully launches Europe's Sentinel-2A Earth observation satellite |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Tomasz |last=Nowakowski |date=23 June 2015 |accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nSentinel-2B was launched on 7 March 2017 at 01:49&nbsp;UTC,<ref name=\"nasasf20170306\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/03/sentinel-2b-vega-ride-join-copernicus-fleet/ |title=Sentinel-2B rides Vega to join Copernicus fleet |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |first=Chris |last=Bergin |date=6 March 2017 |accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref> also aboard a Vega rocket.<ref name=\"sfinsider20161117\">{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/esa/esas-sentinel-2b-spacecraft-steps-spotlight/ |title=ESA's Sentinel 2B spacecraft steps into the spotlight |work=Spaceflight Insider |first=Jacques |last=van Oene |date=17 November 2016 |accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Instruments==\nThe Sentinel-2 satellites will each carry a single multi-spectral instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral channels in the visible/near infrared (VNIR) and short wave infrared spectral range (SWIR).

Satellite images will be used to determine various plant indices such as leaf area chlorophyll and water content indexes. This is particularly important for effective yield prediction and applications related to Earth's vegetation.\n\nAs well as monitoring plant growth, Sentinel-2 can be used to map changes in land cover and to monitor the world's forests. It will also provide information on pollution in lakes and coastal waters. Images of floods, volcanic eruptions and landslides contribute to disaster mapping and help humanitarian relief efforts.\n\nExamples for applications include:\n* Monitoring land cover change for environmental monitoring\n* Agricultural applications, such as crop monitoring and management to help food security\n* Detailed vegetation and forest monitoring and parameter generation (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll concentration, carbon mass estimations)\n* Observation of coastal zones (marine environmental monitoring, coastal zone mapping)\n* Inland water monitoring\n* Glacier monitoring, ice extent mapping, snow cover monitoring\n* Flood mapping & management (risk analysis, loss assessment, disaster management during floods)\n\nThe Sentinel Monitoring web application offers an easy way to observe and analyse land changes based on archived Sentinel-2 data.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sentinel-hub.com/apps/sentinel-monitoring |title=Sentinel Monitoring |publisher=Sentinel Hub/Sinergise |accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Products==\nThe following two main products are generated by the mission:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/product-types |title=Sentinel-2 MSI: Product Types |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n* Level-1C: Top-of-atmosphere reflectances in cartographic geometry (combined UTM projection and WGS84 ellipsoid).

The following fossil evidence of ''Doleserpeton'' was retrieved:\n#  Several predominantly completed skulls\n#  Brain case\n#  Partial dentary\n#  Partial vertebral column (15 vertebrae) with corresponding ribs\n#  Incomplete sets of forelimbs and hindlimbs\n#  Incomplete sets of digits \n#  Pectoral girdles\n#  Pelvic girdles\n\n==Description==\n===Skull===\nThe skull is broad, rounded, and flat, and was estimated to be approximately 15mm but could reach a length of 19mm. Skull features of Doleserpeton included a deepened otic notch and expanded interpterygoid vacuities and vomers.<ref>SIGURDSEN, TROND. \"The Otic Region of Doleserpeton (temnospondyli) and Its Implications for the Evolutionary Origin of Frogs.\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. 154.4 (2008): 738-751.

AHLBERG, and G KOENTGES. \"The Braincase and Middle Ear Region of Dendrerpeton Acadianum (tetrapoda: Temnospondyli).\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. 143.4 (2005): 577-597. Print.</ref>\n\n====Dentition====\nThe distinguishing synapomorphy that defines ''Doleserpeton'' are its bicuspid, pedicellate teeth. Each bicuspid, pedicellate tooth in ''Doleserpeton'' had two cusps with a separation from the root by a region of uncalcified fibrous tissue. The uncalcified regions of the bicuspid teeth in ''Doleserpeton'' were often lost and replaced during its lifetime to support a carnivorous diet. The maxilla contained 60 bicuspid, pedicellate teeth, in which 40 teeth were located in the upper jaw and 20 teeth were located in the lower jaw. ''Doleserpeton'' contained marginal teeth located on the premaxilla and palatal bones of the skull. It was hypothesized that ''Doleserpeton'' contained a range of 22-25 marginal teeth.\n\n===Vertebrae===\n''Doleserpeton'' possessed a rhachitomous vertebrae, in which the pleurocentrum dominates in size in each vertebra compared to the intercentrum.<ref name=\"Earth Before the Dinosaur\" /> This \"rhachitomous\" vertebrae is unique to amphibians and its relatives, which is one of the defining traits of ''Doleserpeton'' and its relatives. ''Doleserpeton'' contained 10 vertebrae in its cervical column, 24 presacral vertebrae, 2 sacral vertebrae, and an estimate of 15 caudal vertebrae that was concluded from fossil evidence. Rib attachment started at the second presacral vertebrae and continue throughout the length of its body until the sacral vertebrae. Rib size increased from ribs 2 through 4, and the decreased in size after the fifth presacral vertebrae. Ribs were double headed to allow a sturdy attachment for muscles to support its body mass on land.\n\n===Posture===\n''Doleserpeton'' displayed a sprawling posture, in which locomotion was achieved on all four limbs while dragging part of its midsection on the ground. Sprawling posture is considered the most primitive trait of terrestrial locomotion, which is consistent with the evolutionary trend from aquatic to terrestrial adaptations. Sprawling posture allowed ''Doleserpeton'' to possess the stability and functionality to move on land while also being efficient and functional in aquatic environments.\n\n===Pectoral girdle===\nThe development in pectoral girdle elements as well as pelvic girdle elements in ''Doleserpeton'' displayed the shift in traits that supported amphibious adaptions to aquatic and terrestrial environments. Limb structures of ''Doleserpeton'' were homologous to [[temnospondyli]] and to other derived terrestrial species.<ref>Laurin, Michel, and B K. Hall. \"Fins into Limbs: Evolution, Development and Transformation.\" Copeia. 2007.4 (2007): 344-1061. Print.</ref> The prominence of the scapulocoracoid in the pectoral girdle of''Doleserpeton'' allowed them to move efficiently on land while supporting the upper half of its body. The humerus is and attached perpendicularly to the scauplcorcoid. The carpals, metacarpals, and digits of ''Doleserpeton'' were allowed for full mobility of its forelimbs and joints to travel on land while providing adequate support for its body mass and size.<ref>Sigurdsen, Trond, and John R. Bolt. \"The Lissamphibian Humerus and Elbow Joint, and the Origins of Modern Amphibians.\" Journal of Morphology. 270.12 (2009): 1443-1453. Print.</ref>\n\n===Pelvic girdle===\nThe pelvic girdle also displays the same characteristics as the pectoral girdle. The femur is elongated and enlarged and place perpendicularly to the pelvic girdle. The proximal end of the femur was enlarged to allow strong muscle attachment and also displayed well developed tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges that served the same purposes for mobility and flexibility of joints in their hindlimbs.\n\n===Digits===\nThe digit formula for ''Doleserpeton'' is 4 digits on the forelimbs and 5 digits on the hindlimb. This digit formula is primitive to all living amphibians with a few exceptions in [[Caecilian]] and some outlying amphibious species.\n\n==Classification==\nParsimony-based cladistic analysis and Bayesian inference analysis were utilized to analyze 20 taxa and 51 characters to classify ''Doleserpeton''.<ref name=\"Bolt\" /> Finite classification of ''Doleserpeton'' still remain dubious because of the uncertainty of the phylogenetic classification of the family [[Amphibamidae]] and the subclass [[Lissamphibia]]. The classification of the family [[Amphibamidae]] is based on the notion that the origin of [[Lissamphibia]] is derived from three hypotheses, which conflicts with the evolutionary position of ''Doleserpeton'' in relation to its primitive ancestors and descendants.<ref>Ruta, Marcello, and Michael I. Coates. \"Dates, Nodes and Character Conflict: Addressing the Lissamphibian Origin Problem.\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. 5.1 (2007): 69-122.

Print.</ref>\n# Diphyletic(branching) origin of [[Lissamphibia]] from both [[Temnospondyli]] and [[Lepospondyli]]\n\nThe most parsimonious tree showed that ''Doleserpeton'' is loosely classified as the sister group to the genus ''Amphimabus'' within the family ''Amphibamidae''. Character traits that support this phylogenetic classification include the following synapomorphies: bicuspid teeth, morphological similarities in larval stages, and separation between the crown and base of the tooth in its pedicellate dentition.<ref name=\"Bolt\" />\n\n==Paleobiology==\nPhysical characteristics from fossil evidence of ''Doleserpeton'' indicate that they resembled modern newts and salamanders.<ref name=\"Bolt\" /> The overall size of ''Doleserpeton'' was relatively small, with an estimated body length of 55&nbsp;mm (2.165 inches) from snout to tail. Morphological features of ''Doleserpeton'' indicated that they were quadrupedal with elongate bodies and a lizard-like appearance. Their overall body morphology included short limbs protruding from a 90-degree angle, long tails, and flattened skulls with blunt snouts. ''Doleserpeton'' may have had smooth, granular skin to adapt to the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments.<ref name=\"Bolt\"/> Fossil evidence and classification of ''Doleserpeton'' predicted that they transitioned through metamorphic stages throughout their life, but lived primarily on terrestrial land during juvenile and adult stages. Like their modern amphibious relatives [[Lissamphibia]], ''Doleserpeton'' may have had to rely on the availability of a nearby water source during reproduction and larval stages.\n\n===Ontogeny===\nThe skeletal elements from fossil evidence were well ossified, which supported the notion that ''Doleserpeton'' lived a primarily terrestrial life after metamorphosis. A well ossified skeletal structure in ''Doleserpeton'' indicated the lack of maturity in several ''Doleserpeton'' specimens. The ossification process in ''Doleserpeton'' deviates from typical terrestrial skeletal ossification, in which well ossified skeletal elements were indicators of maturity in terrestrial organisms. Variation in ossification in fossil specimens of ''Dolserpeton'' infer the possibility of skeletal changes in adult stages in life, concluding that the fossil evidence can only support characteristics that would define skeletal elements and characteristics only up to juvenile stages.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Paleontology}}\n* [[Prehistoric amphibian]]\n* [[List of prehistoric amphibians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Euskelia|D.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5288963}}\n\n[[Category:Amphibamids]]\n[[Category:Dissorophids]]\n[[Category:Permian amphibians of North America]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1969]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric amphibian genera]]\n", "text_old": "{{Speciesbox\n| fossil_range =[[Upper Permian]] {{fossil range|285}}\n| taxon = Doleserpeton annectens\n| authority = Bolt, 1969\n}}\n\n'''''Doleserpeton''''' is an extinct, monospecific [[genus]] of [[dissorophoidea]]n [[temnospondyl]] within the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Amphibamidae]] that lived during the [[Upper Permian]], 285 million years ago.<ref name=\"Earth Before the Dinosaur\">{{cite book|last1=Steyer|first1=Sebastian|title=Earth Before the Dinosaurs|date=2012|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0-253-22380-7|pages=75\u201377}}<!--|accessdate=5 March 2015--></ref> ''Doleserpeton'' is represented by a single species, ''Doleserpeton annectens'', which was first described by John R.

The stratigraphic location of ''Doleserpeton'' was based in Fissure Fills and the Admirial Formation, which was dated back to the Upper Permian.<ref>Anderson, Jason S, and John R. Bolt. \"New Information on Amphibamids (tetrapoda, Temnospondyli) from Richards Spur (fort Sill), Oklahoma\". ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology''. 33.5 (2013): 553\u2013567. Print.</ref> All fossil specimens were preserved in limestone blocks, which was treated with an acid wash to clear away excess debris and minimize damage during the excavation process. The following fossil evidence of ''Doleserpeton'' was retrieved:\n#  Several predominantly completed skulls\n#  Brain case\n#  Partial dentary\n#  Partial vertebral column (15 vertebrae) with corresponding ribs\n#  Incomplete sets of forelimbs and hindlimbs\n#  Incomplete sets of digits \n#  Pectoral girdles\n#  Pelvic girdles\n\n==Description==\n===Skull===\nThe skull is broad, rounded, and flat, and was estimated to be approximately 15mm but could reach a length of 19mm. Skull features of Doleserpeton included a deepened otic notch and expanded interpterygoid vacuities and vomers.<ref>SIGURDSEN, TROND. \"The Otic Region of Doleserpeton (temnospondyli) and Its Implications for the Evolutionary Origin of Frogs.\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. 154.4 (2008): 738-751. Print.</ref> The eye orbits in ''Doleserpeton'' are relatively large in proportion to the overall size of its skull. Inner ear characteristics of ''Doleserpeton'' share morphological similarities to salamanders in the otic region, in which the [[Tympanum (anatomy)|tympanum]] is not connected to the [[stapes]].<ref>ROBINSON, J, P E. AHLBERG, and G KOENTGES. \"The Braincase and Middle Ear Region of Dendrerpeton Acadianum (tetrapoda: Temnospondyli).\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. 143.4 (2005): 577-597. Print.</ref>\n\n====Dentition====\nThe distinguishing synapomorphy that defines ''Doleserpeton'' are its bicuspid, pedicellate teeth. Each bicuspid, pedicellate tooth in ''Doleserpeton'' had two cusps with a separation from the root by a region of uncalcified fibrous tissue. The uncalcified regions of the bicuspid teeth in ''Doleserpeton'' were often lost and replaced during its lifetime to support a carnivorous diet. The maxilla contained 60 bicuspid, pedicellate teeth, in which 40 teeth were located in the upper jaw and 20 teeth were located in the lower jaw. ''Doleserpeton'' contained marginal teeth located on the premaxilla and palatal bones of the skull. It was hypothesized that ''Doleserpeton'' contained a range of 22-25 marginal teeth.\n\n===Vertebrae===\n''Doleserpeton'' possessed a rhachitomous vertebrae, in which the pleurocentrum dominates in size in each vertebra compared to the intercentrum.<ref name=\"Earth Before the Dinosaur\" /> This \"rhachitomous\" vertebrae is unique to amphibians and its relatives, which is one of the defining traits of ''Doleserpeton'' and its relatives. ''Doleserpeton'' contained 10 vertebrae in its cervical column, 24 presacral vertebrae, 2 sacral vertebrae, and an estimate of 15 caudal vertebrae that was concluded from fossil evidence. Rib attachment started at the second presacral vertebrae and continue throughout the length of its body until the sacral vertebrae. Rib size increased from ribs 2 through 4, and the decreased in size after the fifth presacral vertebrae. Ribs were double headed to allow a sturdy attachment for muscles to support its body mass on land.\n\n===Posture===\n''Doleserpeton'' displayed a sprawling posture, in which locomotion was achieved on all four limbs while dragging part of its midsection on the ground. Sprawling posture is considered the most primitive trait of terrestrial locomotion, which is consistent with the evolutionary trend from aquatic to terrestrial adaptations. Sprawling posture allowed ''Doleserpeton'' to possess the stability and functionality to move on land while also being efficient and functional in aquatic environments.\n\n===Pectoral girdle===\nThe development in pectoral girdle elements as well as pelvic girdle elements in ''Doleserpeton'' displayed the shift in traits that supported amphibious adaptions to aquatic and terrestrial environments. Limb structures of ''Doleserpeton'' were homologous to [[temnospondyli]] and to other derived terrestrial species.<ref>Laurin, Michel, and B K. Hall. \"Fins into Limbs: Evolution, Development and Transformation.\" Copeia. 2007.4 (2007): 344-1061. Print.</ref> The prominence of the scapulocoracoid in the pectoral girdle of''Doleserpeton'' allowed them to move efficiently on land while supporting the upper half of its body. The humerus is and attached perpendicularly to the scauplcorcoid. The carpals, metacarpals, and digits of ''Doleserpeton'' were allowed for full mobility of its forelimbs and joints to travel on land while providing adequate support for its body mass and size.<ref>Sigurdsen, Trond, and John R. Bolt. \"The Lissamphibian Humerus and Elbow Joint, and the Origins of Modern Amphibians.\" Journal of Morphology. 270.12 (2009): 1443-1453. Print.</ref>\n\n===Pelvic girdle===\nThe pelvic girdle also displays the same characteristics as the pectoral girdle. The femur is elongated and enlarged and place perpendicularly to the pelvic girdle. The proximal end of the femur was enlarged to allow strong muscle attachment and also displayed well developed tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges that served the same purposes for mobility and flexibility of joints in their hindlimbs.\n\n===Digits===\nThe digit formula for ''Doleserpeton'' is 4 digits on the forelimbs and 5 digits on the hindlimb. This digit formula is primitive to all living amphibians with a few exceptions in [[Caecilian]] and some outlying amphibious species.\n\n==Classification==\nParsimony-based cladistic analysis and Bayesian inference analysis were utilized to analyze 20 taxa and 51 characters to classify ''Doleserpeton''.<ref name=\"Bolt\" /> Finite classification of ''Doleserpeton'' still remain dubious because of the uncertainty of the phylogenetic classification of the family [[Amphibamidae]] and the subclass [[Lissamphibia]]. The classification of the family [[Amphibamidae]] is based on the notion that the origin of [[Lissamphibia]] is derived from three hypotheses, which conflicts with the evolutionary position of ''Doleserpeton'' in relation to its primitive ancestors and descendants.<ref>Ruta, Marcello, and Michael I. Coates. \"Dates, Nodes and Character Conflict: Addressing the Lissamphibian Origin Problem.\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. 5.1 (2007): 69-122.

Print.</ref>\n# Diphyletic(branching) origin of [[Lissamphibia]] from both [[Temnospondyli]] and [[Lepospondyli]]\n\nThe most parsimonious tree showed that ''Doleserpeton'' is loosely classified as the sister group to the genus ''Amphimabus'' within the family ''Amphibamidae''. Character traits that support this phylogenetic classification include the following synapomorphies: bicuspid teeth, morphological similarities in larval stages, and separation between the crown and base of the tooth in its pedicellate dentition.<ref name=\"Bolt\" />\n\n==Paleobiology==\nPhysical characteristics from fossil evidence of ''Doleserpeton'' indicate that they resembled modern newts and salamanders.<ref name=\"Bolt\" /> The overall size of ''Doleserpeton'' was relatively small, with an estimated body length of 55&nbsp;mm (2.165 inches) from snout to tail. Morphological features of ''Doleserpeton'' indicated that they were quadrupedal with elongate bodies and a lizard-like appearance. Their overall body morphology included short limbs protruding from a 90-degree angle, long tails, and flattened skulls with blunt snouts. ''Doleserpeton'' may have had smooth, granular skin to adapt to the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments.<ref name=\"Bolt\"/> Fossil evidence and classification of ''Doleserpeton'' predicted that they transitioned through metamorphic stages throughout their life, but lived primarily on terrestrial land during juvenile and adult stages. Like their modern amphibious relatives [[Lissamphibia]], ''Doleserpeton'' may have had to rely on the availability of a nearby water source during reproduction and larval stages.\n\n===Ontogeny===\nThe skeletal elements from fossil evidence were well ossified, which supported the notion that ''Doleserpeton'' lived a primarily terrestrial life after metamorphosis. A well ossified skeletal structure in ''Doleserpeton'' indicated the lack of maturity in several ''Doleserpeton'' specimens. The ossification process in ''Doleserpeton'' deviates from typical terrestrial skeletal ossification, in which well ossified skeletal elements were indicators of maturity in terrestrial organisms. Variation in ossification in fossil specimens of ''Dolserpeton'' infer the possibility of skeletal changes in adult stages in life, concluding that the fossil evidence can only support characteristics that would define skeletal elements and characteristics only up to juvenile stages.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Paleontology}}\n* [[Prehistoric amphibian]]\n* [[List of prehistoric amphibians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Euskelia|D.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5288963}}\n\n[[Category:Amphibamids]]\n[[Category:Dissorophids]]\n[[Category:Permian amphibians of North America]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1969]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric amphibian genera]]\n", "name_user": "Uziel302", "label": "safe", "comment": "Monohyletic->Monophyletic -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doleserpeton"}
