{"title_page": "Sunshine duration", "text_new": "{{redirect|Sunshine hours|the Canadian TV show|The Sunshine Hour}}\n\n'''Sunshine duration''' or '''sunshine hours''' is a [[climatological]] indicator, measuring duration of [[sunshine]] in given period (usually, a day or a year) for a given location on [[Earth]], typically expressed as an averaged value over several years. It is a general indicator of [[cloud cover|cloudiness]] of a location, and thus differs from [[insolation]], which measures the total [[energy]] delivered by sunlight over a given period.\n\nSunshine duration is usually expressed in hours per year, or in (average) hours per day. The first measure indicates the general sunniness of a location compared with other places, while the latter allows for comparison of sunshine in various seasons in the same location.<ref name=cimo>{{citation|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/gcos/documents/gruanmanuals/CIMO/CIMO_Guide-7th_Edition-2008.pdf |chapter=8.

However, there are physical and astronomical effects that change that picture. Namely, [[atmospheric refraction]] allows the Sun to be still visible even when it physically sets below the [[horizon]]. For that reason, average daytime (disregarding cloud effects) is longest in polar areas, where the apparent Sun spends the most time around the horizon. Places on the [[Arctic Circle]] have the longest total annual daytime, 4,647 hours, while the [[North Pole]] receives 4,575. Because of elliptic nature of the [[Earth's orbit]], the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is not symmetrical: the [[Antarctic Circle]], with 4,530 hours of daylight, receives five days less of sunshine than its [[antipodes]]. The [[Equator]] has a total daytime of 4,422 hours per year.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/spacetimedreamer/2009-06-15/the-sunniest-and-darkest-places-on-earth |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027044102/http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/spacetimedreamer/2009-06-15/the-sunniest-and-darkest-places-on-earth |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-10-27 |title=The Sunniest and Darkest Places on Earth |publisher=Scilogs |author=Gerhard Holtkamp |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Definition and measurement==\n[[File:Campbell-Stokes recorder.jpg|thumb|Campbell\u2013Stokes recorder measures sunshine]]\n\nGiven the theoretical maximum of daytime duration for a given location, there is also a practical consideration at which point the amount of daylight is sufficient to be treated as a \"sunshine hour\". \"Bright\" sunshine hours represent the total hours when the sunlight is stronger than a specified threshold, as opposed to just \"visible\" hours. \"Visible\" sunshine, for example, occurs around sunrise and sunset, but is not strong enough to excite the sensor. Measurement is performed by instruments called [[sunshine recorders]]. For the specific purpose of sunshine duration recording, [[Campbell\u2013Stokes recorder]]s are used, which use a spherical glass [[lens (optics)|lens]] to focus the sun rays on a specially designed tape. When the intensity exceeds a pre-determined threshold, the tape burns.

Newer, electronic recorders have more stable sensitivity than that of the paper tape.\n\nIn order to harmonize the data measured worldwide, in 1962 the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) defined a standardized design of the Campbell\u2013Stokes recorder, called an Interim Reference Sunshine Recorder (IRSR).<ref name=cimo/> In 2003, the sunshine duration was finally defined as the period during which direct solar [[irradiance]] exceeds a threshold value of 120&nbsp;W/m\u00b2.<ref name=cimo/>\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Sunshine.png|thumb|right|400px|Annual sunshine hours map of the world.

and symptoms==\nAgoraphobia is a condition where sufferers become anxious in unfamiliar environments or where they perceive that they have little control. Triggers for this anxiety may include wide-open spaces, crowds (social anxiety), or traveling (even short distances). Agoraphobia is often, but not always, compounded by a fear of social embarrassment, as the agoraphobic fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public. Most of the time they avoid these areas and stay in the comfort of their safe haven, usually their home.<ref name=\"DSM5\" />\n\nAgoraphobia is also defined as \"a fear, sometimes terrifying, by those who have experienced one or more panic attacks\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.nowok.co.uk/agoraphobia.php|title=Agoraphobia \u2013 Dictionary of Psychotherapy|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403100715/http://www.dictionary.nowok.co.uk/agoraphobia.php|archivedate=2016-04-03|df=}}</ref> In these cases, the sufferer is fearful of a particular place because they have experienced a panic attack at the same location at a previous time. Fearing the onset of another panic attack, the sufferer is fearful or even avoids a location. Some refuse to leave their homes even in medical emergencies because the fear of being outside of their comfort areas is too great.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/agoraphobia|title=Agoraphobia|last=|first=|date=|website=betterhealth.vic.gov.au|access-date=21 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322204034/https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/agoraphobia|archivedate=22 March 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe sufferers can sometimes go to great lengths to avoid the locations where they have experienced the onset of a panic attack. Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is actually a symptom professionals check when making a diagnosis of [[panic disorder]]. Other syndromes like [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] or [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] can also cause agoraphobia. Essentially, any irrational fear that keeps one from going outside can cause the syndrome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/sx29.htm|title=Agoraphobia Symptoms|work=Psych Central.com|date=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAgoraphobics may suffer from temporary [[separation anxiety disorder]] when certain other individuals of the household depart from the residence temporarily, such as a parent or spouse, or when the agoraphobic is left home alone.  Such temporary conditions can result in an increase in anxiety or a panic attack or feeling the need to separate themselves from family or maybe friends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/agoraphobia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355987|title=Agoraphobia - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/anxiety-disorders/what-are-anxiety-disorders|title=What Are Anxiety Disorders?|website=www.psychiatry.org|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref>\n\nPeople with agoraphobia sometimes fear waiting outside for long periods of time; that symptom can be called \"macrophobia.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Adamec|first1=Christine|title=The Encyclopedia of Phobias, Fears, and Anxieties, Third Edition|page=328|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2imSyZZDh0C&q=macrophobia#v=snippet&q=macrophobia&f=false|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781438120980}}</ref>\n\n===Panic attacks===\nAgoraphobia patients can experience sudden panic attacks when traveling to places where they fear they are out of control, help would be difficult to obtain, or they could be embarrassed. During a panic attack, [[epinephrine]] is released in large amounts, triggering the body's natural [[fight-or-flight]] response.

Primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be a [[specific phobia]] explained by it once having been evolutionarily advantageous to avoid exposed, large, open spaces without cover or concealment. Agoraphobia with panic attack, though, may be an avoidance response secondary to the panic attacks due to fear of the situations in which the panic attacks occurred.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bracha HS | title = Human brain evolution and the \"Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:\" Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 827\u2013853 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16563589 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008 | url = http://cogprints.org/5013/1/2006_P.N.P._Neuro-evolution_of_fear_circuit_disorders.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{ cite journal|vauthors=Raffaello S, Alessandra SM, Alessandra S |year=2011 |title=[Primary agoraphobia specific symptoms: from natural information to mental representations] |language=Italian |journal=Italian Journal of Psychopathology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=265\u2013276 |url=http://www.gipsicopatol.it/issues/2011/vol17-3/02%20Spiti.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082624/http://www.gipsicopatol.it/issues/2011/vol17-3/02%20Spiti.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nMost people who present to mental health specialists develop agoraphobia after the onset of [[panic disorder]].<ref>[[American Psychiatric Association]], 1998</ref> Agoraphobia is best understood as an adverse behavioral outcome of repeated panic attacks and subsequent anxiety and preoccupation with these attacks that leads to an avoidance of situations where a panic attack could occur.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1988 | author = Barlow DH | title= Anxiety and its disorders: The nature and treatment of anxiety and panic | publisher = Guilford Press }}</ref> Early treatment of panic disorder can often prevent agoraphobia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001921/|title=Agoraphobia \u2013 National Library of Medicine|last=pmhdev|accessdate=25 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330112146/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001921/|archivedate=30 March 2014|df=}}</ref> Agoraphobia is typically determined when symptoms are worse than panic disorder, but also do not meet the criteria for other anxiety disorders such as depression.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kenny|first1=Tim|last2=Lawson|first2=Euan|title=Agoraphobia|url=http://www.patient.info/health/agoraphobia-leaflet|website=Patient.info|accessdate=8 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607021823/http://patient.info/health/agoraphobia-leaflet|archivedate=7 June 2015|df=}}</ref> In rare cases where agoraphobics do not meet the criteria used to diagnose panic disorder, the formal diagnosis of [[agoraphobia without history of panic disorder]] is used (primary agoraphobia).\n\n==Treatments==\n\n===Therapy===\n[[Systematic desensitization]] can provide lasting relief to the majority of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia.

and symptoms==\nAgoraphobia is a condition where sufferers become anxious in unfamiliar environments or where they perceive that they have little control. Triggers for this anxiety may include wide-open spaces, crowds (social anxiety), or traveling (even short distances). Agoraphobia is often, but not always, compounded by a fear of social embarrassment, as the agoraphobic fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public. Most of the time they avoid these areas and stay in the comfort of their safe haven, usually their home.<ref name=\"DSM5\" />\n\nAgoraphobia is also defined as \"a fear, sometimes terrifying, by those who have experienced one or more panic attacks\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.nowok.co.uk/agoraphobia.php|title=Agoraphobia \u2013 Dictionary of Psychotherapy|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403100715/http://www.dictionary.nowok.co.uk/agoraphobia.php|archivedate=2016-04-03|df=}}</ref> In these cases, the sufferer is fearful of a particular place because they have experienced a panic attack at the same location at a previous time. Fearing the onset of another panic attack, the sufferer is fearful or even avoids a location.

Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is actually a symptom professionals check when making a diagnosis of [[panic disorder]]. Other syndromes like [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] or [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] can also cause agoraphobia.

Primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be a [[specific phobia]] explained by it once having been evolutionarily advantageous to avoid exposed, large, open spaces without cover or concealment. Agoraphobia with panic attack, though, may be an avoidance response secondary to the panic attacks due to fear of the situations in which the panic attacks occurred.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bracha HS | title = Human brain evolution and the \"Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:\" Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 827\u2013853 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16563589 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008 | url = http://cogprints.org/5013/1/2006_P.N.P._Neuro-evolution_of_fear_circuit_disorders.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{ cite journal|vauthors=Raffaello S, Alessandra SM, Alessandra S |year=2011 |title=[Primary agoraphobia specific symptoms: from natural information to mental representations] |language=Italian |journal=Italian Journal of Psychopathology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=265\u2013276 |url=http://www.gipsicopatol.it/issues/2011/vol17-3/02%20Spiti.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082624/http://www.gipsicopatol.it/issues/2011/vol17-3/02%20Spiti.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nMost people who present to mental health specialists develop agoraphobia after the onset of [[panic disorder]].<ref>[[American Psychiatric Association]], 1998</ref> Agoraphobia is best understood as an adverse behavioral outcome of repeated panic attacks and subsequent anxiety and preoccupation with these attacks that leads to an avoidance of situations where a panic attack could occur.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1988 | author = Barlow DH | title= Anxiety and its disorders: The nature and treatment of anxiety and panic | publisher = Guilford Press }}</ref> Early treatment of panic disorder can often prevent agoraphobia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001921/|title=Agoraphobia \u2013 National Library of Medicine|last=pmhdev|accessdate=25 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330112146/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001921/|archivedate=30 March 2014|df=}}</ref> Agoraphobia is typically determined when symptoms are worse than panic disorder, but also do not meet the criteria for other anxiety disorders such as depression.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kenny|first1=Tim|last2=Lawson|first2=Euan|title=Agoraphobia|url=http://www.patient.info/health/agoraphobia-leaflet|website=Patient.info|accessdate=8 December 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607021823/http://patient.info/health/agoraphobia-leaflet|archivedate=7 June 2015|df=}}</ref> In rare cases where agoraphobics do not meet the criteria used to diagnose panic disorder, the formal diagnosis of [[agoraphobia without history of panic disorder]] is used (primary agoraphobia).\n\n==Treatments==\n\n===Therapy===\n[[Systematic desensitization]] can provide lasting relief to the majority of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia.

On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13.

On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13.
