They led to prohibition of routine supersonic flight over land. Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle the nuisance due to them may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a practical option.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nA sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the speed of sound; and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the speeding object. Rather the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is travelling at supersonic speeds. But it affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object. As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the ''boom''.\n\n==Causes==\nWhen an aircraft passes through the air, it creates a series of [[P-wave|pressure waves]] in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the [[Bow wave|bow and stern waves]] created by a boat. These waves travel at the [[speed of sound]] and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough. Eventually they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as ''Mach 1'', and is approximately {{convert|1235|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at sea level and {{convert|20|C|F}}.\n\n{{anchor|Mach cone}}In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail.  Because the different radial directions around the aircraft's direction of travel are equivalent (given the \"smooth flight\" condition), the shock wave forms a ''Mach cone'', similar to a [[vapour cone]], with the aircraft at its tip.  The half-angle between direction of flight and the shock wave <math> \\alpha </math> is given by:\n\n:<math>\\sin( \\alpha) =\\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math>,\n\nwhere  <math> \\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math> is the inverse <math>\\Big(\\frac{1}{Ma}\\Big)</math> of the plane's [[Mach number]] (<math>Ma = \\frac{v_\\text{object}}{v_\\text{sound}}</math>).  Thus the faster the plane travels, the finer and more pointed the cone is.\n\nThere is a rise in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This \"[[overpressure]] profile\" is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The \"boom\" is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms \u2013 one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive \"double boom\" from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.\n\nSince the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it fills out a narrow path on the ground following the aircraft's flight path, a bit like an unrolling [[red carpet]], and hence known as the ''boom carpet''.  Its width depends on the altitude of the aircraft. The distance from the point on the ground where the boom is heard to the aircraft depends on its altitude and the angle <math> \\alpha </math>.\n\nFor today's supersonic aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies from less than 50 to 500 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak [[overpressure]]s for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap284/p284.htm Analyzing Sonic Boom Footprints of Military Jets, Andy S. Rogers, A.O.T, Inc.]</ref> In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage \u2014 shattered glass, for example \u2014 will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] and other agencies.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\">USAF Fact Sheet 96-03, Armstrong Laboratory, 1996</ref>\n\nThe power, or volume, of the shock wave depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets ''tighter'' around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes no boom is heard.  The \"length\" of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore \"spread out\" their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.<ref name=seebass>[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFulltext/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-004/$EN-004-06.pdf Sonic Boom Minimization Richard Seebass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the air being forced to turn around these convex points, which generates a shock wave in [[Supersonic speed|supersonic flow]].\n\nThe later shock waves are somewhat faster than the first one, travel faster and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the \"rise time\" of the shock which makes the boom seem louder. On most aircraft designs the characteristic distance is about {{convert|40000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be \"softer\". However, the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.\n\n==Measurement and examples==\nThe [[pressure]] from sonic booms caused by aircraft often is a few pounds per square foot. A vehicle flying at greater altitude will generate lower pressures on the ground, because the shock wave reduces in intensity as it spreads out away from the vehicle, but the sonic booms are less affected by vehicle speed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Testing was recently completed in 2010 of a Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model with micro-array flow control. A NASA aerospace engineer is pictured here in a wind tunnel with the Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model.]]\n\nIn the late 1950s when [[supersonic transport]] (SST) designs were being actively pursued, it was thought that although the boom would be very large, the problems could be avoided by flying higher. This assumption was proven false when the [[North American XB-70]] ''Valkyrie'' started flying, and it was found that the boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000&nbsp;m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.\n\nRichard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at [[Cornell University]] studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a \"[[figure of merit]]\" (FM) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft. FM is a function of the aircraft weight and the aircraft length. The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable. Using this calculation, they found FMs of about 1.4 for [[Concorde]] and 1.9 for the [[Boeing 2707]]. This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment, mixed with politics, eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft impractical (flying supersonically only over water for instance). Another way to express this is [[wing span]]. The [[fuselage]] of even a large supersonic aircraft is very sleek and with enough angle of attack and wing span the plane can fly so high that the boom by the fuselage is not important. The larger the wing span, the greater the downwards impulse which can be applied to the air, the greater the boom felt. A smaller wing span favors small aeroplane designs like [[business jets]].<ref name=seebass/>\n\nSeebass and George also worked on the problem from a different angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused ([[SR-71 Blackbird]], [[Boeing X-43]]) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nose cone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ([[Shock wave|bow shock]]), and using a swept back [[flying wing]] or an [[Oblique wing|oblique flying wing]] to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their [[nose cone]] and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the [[area rule]]. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from {{convert|40000|ft|m}} to 60,000 feet (from 12,000&nbsp;m to 18,000&nbsp;m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.<ref name=seebass/>\n\n[[File:Northrop F-5E (modified) DARPA sonic tests 04.07R.jpg|thumb|NASA F-5E modified for DARPA sonic boom tests]]\nThis remained untested for decades, until [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] started the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration|Quiet Supersonic Platform]] project and funded the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration]] (SSBD) aircraft to test it. SSBD used an [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-5E was modified with a highly refined shape which lengthened the nose to that of the F-5F model.  The [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] extended from the nose all the way back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft.  The SSBD was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a [[chase plane]], the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could have reduced Concorde's boom to an acceptable level below FM = 1.\n\nAs a follow-on to SSBD, in 2006 a [[NASA]]-[[Gulfstream Aerospace]] team tested the [[Quiet Spike]] on NASA-Dryden's F-15B aircraft 836.  The [[Quiet Spike]] is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds. Over 50 test flights were performed.  Several flights included probing of the shockwaves by a second F-15B, NASA's [[Intelligent Flight Control System]] testbed, aircraft 837.\n\nThere are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the [[Busemann's Biplane]]. However, creating a shockwave is inescapable if they generate aerodynamic lift.<ref name=seebass/>\n\nNASA and [[Lockheed Martin]] Aeronautics Co. are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the [[Low Boom Flight Demonstrator]] (LBFD), which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing. The agency has awarded a $247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek, single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft.<ref>{{cite press release \n|last= \n|first= \n|date= 3 April 2018\n|title= NASA Awards Contract to Build Quieter Supersonic Aircraft\n|url= https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-build-quieter-supersonic-aircraft\n|location= \n|publisher= \n|agency= NASA\n|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Perception, noise and other concerns==\n[[File:Sonicboom animation.gif|thumb|A point source emitting spherical fronts while increasing its velocity linearly with time. For short times the Doppler effect is visible. When v=c the sonic boom is visible. When v>c the Mach cone is visible.]]\nThe sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double \"boom\" as the aircraft is usually some distance away. The sound is much like that of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar bombs]], commonly used in [[firework display]]s. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, \"You don't actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane \u2013 it gives an indication on the instruments. And that's what we see around Mach 1. But we don't hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That's rather like the wake of a ship \u2013 it's behind us.\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm BBC News interview with former Concorde Pilot (2003)]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] began the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]], which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a [[class action]] lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.\n\nSonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases the \"torching\" (pointing underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.\n\nThere has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA's Quiet Supersonic Platform studies.  Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content.  Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom \"N\" wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground.  Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the over-pressure is sufficiently long.  A new metric has emerged, known as ''perceived'' loudness, measured in PLdB.  This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc.  A well-known example is the [[Finger snapping|snapping of one's fingers]] in which the \"perceived\" sound is nothing more than an annoyance.\n\nThe energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1\u2013100 [[hertz]] [[frequency range]] that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, [[Gunshot|gunfire]] and most [[industrial noise]]. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the over-pressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Over-pressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately {{convert|1|smi|km}} for each {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} will create a lateral boom spread of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some maneuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other maneuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances weather conditions can distort sonic booms.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nDepending on the aircraft's altitude, sonic booms reach the ground two to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15&nbsp;\u00b0C), the temperature at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (\u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is about {{convert|670|mph|km/h}}, but an aircraft must travel at least {{convert|750|mph|km/h}} (Mach 1.12, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound) for a boom to be heard on the ground.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nThe composition of the atmosphere is also a factor.  Temperature variations, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pollution]], and [[wind]]s can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground.  Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom.  Hard surfaces such as [[concrete]], [[Road surface|pavement]], and large buildings can cause reflections which may amplify the sound of a sonic boom.  Similarly, [[grass]]y fields and lots of [[foliage]] can help attenuate the strength of the over-pressure of a sonic boom.\n\nCurrently there are no industry-accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom. However, work is underway to create metrics that will help in understanding how humans respond to the noise generated by sonic booms. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loubeau|first=Alexandra|last2=Naka|first2=Yusuke|last3=Cook|first3=Brian G.|last4=Sparrow|first4=Victor W.|last5=Morgenstern|first5=John M.|date=2015-10-28|title=A new evaluation of noise metrics for sonic booms using existing data|url=https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4934481|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1685|issue=1|pages=090015|doi=10.1063/1.4934481|issn=0094-243X}}</ref> Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.\n\n==Bullwhip==\n[[File:Bullwhip.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Australian bullwhip.]]\nThe cracking sound a [[bullwhip]] makes when properly wielded is, in fact, a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the ''\"cracker\"'', moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.<ref name=\"americanscientist.org\"/>\n\nA bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the energy is transferred down the length of the tapering whip.

This \"[[overpressure]] profile\" is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The \"boom\" is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms \u2013 one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal.

Peak [[overpressure]]s for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap284/p284.htm Analyzing Sonic Boom Footprints of Military Jets, Andy S. Rogers, A.O.T, Inc.]</ref> In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage \u2014 shattered glass, for example \u2014 will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] and other agencies.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\">USAF Fact Sheet 96-03, Armstrong Laboratory, 1996</ref>\n\nThe power, or volume, of the shock wave depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets ''tighter'' around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes no boom is heard.  The \"length\" of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore \"spread out\" their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.<ref name=seebass>[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFulltext/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-004/$EN-004-06.pdf Sonic Boom Minimization Richard Seebass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the air being forced to turn around these convex points, which generates a shock wave in [[Supersonic speed|supersonic flow]].\n\nThe later shock waves are somewhat faster than the first one, travel faster and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the \"rise time\" of the shock which makes the boom seem louder. On most aircraft designs the characteristic distance is about {{convert|40000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be \"softer\". However, the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.\n\n==Measurement and examples==\nThe [[pressure]] from sonic booms caused by aircraft often is a few pounds per square foot. A vehicle flying at greater altitude will generate lower pressures on the ground, because the shock wave reduces in intensity as it spreads out away from the vehicle, but the sonic booms are less affected by vehicle speed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Testing was recently completed in 2010 of a Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model with micro-array flow control. A NASA aerospace engineer is pictured here in a wind tunnel with the Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model.]]\n\nIn the late 1950s when [[supersonic transport]] (SST) designs were being actively pursued, it was thought that although the boom would be very large, the problems could be avoided by flying higher. This assumption was proven false when the [[North American XB-70]] ''Valkyrie'' started flying, and it was found that the boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000&nbsp;m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.\n\nRichard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at [[Cornell University]] studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a \"[[figure of merit]]\" (FM) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft. FM is a function of the aircraft weight and the aircraft length. The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable. Using this calculation, they found FMs of about 1.4 for [[Concorde]] and 1.9 for the [[Boeing 2707]]. This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment, mixed with politics, eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft impractical (flying supersonically only over water for instance). Another way to express this is [[wing span]]. The [[fuselage]] of even a large supersonic aircraft is very sleek and with enough angle of attack and wing span the plane can fly so high that the boom by the fuselage is not important. The larger the wing span, the greater the downwards impulse which can be applied to the air, the greater the boom felt. A smaller wing span favors small aeroplane designs like [[business jets]].<ref name=seebass/>\n\nSeebass and George also worked on the problem from a different angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused ([[SR-71 Blackbird]], [[Boeing X-43]]) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nose cone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ([[Shock wave|bow shock]]), and using a swept back [[flying wing]] or an [[Oblique wing|oblique flying wing]] to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their [[nose cone]] and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the [[area rule]]. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from {{convert|40000|ft|m}} to 60,000 feet (from 12,000&nbsp;m to 18,000&nbsp;m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.<ref name=seebass/>\n\n[[File:Northrop F-5E (modified) DARPA sonic tests 04.07R.jpg|thumb|NASA F-5E modified for DARPA sonic boom tests]]\nThis remained untested for decades, until [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] started the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration|Quiet Supersonic Platform]] project and funded the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration]] (SSBD) aircraft to test it. SSBD used an [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-5E was modified with a highly refined shape which lengthened the nose to that of the F-5F model.  The [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] extended from the nose all the way back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft.  The SSBD was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a [[chase plane]], the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could have reduced Concorde's boom to an acceptable level; one below the FM&nbsp;= 1 limit stated above, for instance.\n\nAs a follow-on to SSBD, in 2006 a [[NASA]]-[[Gulfstream Aerospace]] team tested the [[Quiet Spike]] on NASA-Dryden's F-15B aircraft 836.  The [[Quiet Spike]] is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds. Over 50 test flights were performed.  Several flights included probing of the shockwaves by a second F-15B, NASA's [[Intelligent Flight Control System]] testbed, aircraft 837.\n\nThere are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the [[Busemann's Biplane]]. However, creating a shockwave is inescapable if they generate aerodynamic lift.<ref name=seebass/>\n\nNASA and [[Lockheed Martin]] Aeronautics Co. are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the [[Low Boom Flight Demonstrator]] (LBFD), which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing. The agency has awarded a $247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek, single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft.<ref>{{cite press release \n|last= \n|first= \n|date= 3 April 2018\n|title= NASA Awards Contract to Build Quieter Supersonic Aircraft\n|url= https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-build-quieter-supersonic-aircraft\n|location= \n|publisher= \n|agency= NASA\n|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Perception, noise and other concerns==\n[[File:Sonicboom animation.gif|thumb|A point source emitting spherical fronts while increasing its velocity linearly with time. For short times the Doppler effect is visible. When v=c the sonic boom is visible. When v>c the Mach cone is visible.]]\nThe sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double \"boom\" as the aircraft is usually some distance away. The sound is much like that of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar bombs]], commonly used in [[firework display]]s. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, \"You don't actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane \u2013 it gives an indication on the instruments. And that's what we see around Mach 1. But we don't hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That's rather like the wake of a ship \u2013 it's behind us.\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm BBC News interview with former Concorde Pilot (2003)]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] began the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]], which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a [[class action]] lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.\n\nSonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases the \"torching\" (pointing underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.\n\nThere has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA's Quiet Supersonic Platform studies.  Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content.  Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom \"N\" wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground.  Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the over-pressure is sufficiently long.  A new metric has emerged, known as ''perceived'' loudness, measured in PLdB.  This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc.  A well-known example is the [[Finger snapping|snapping of one's fingers]] in which the \"perceived\" sound is nothing more than an annoyance.\n\nThe energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1\u2013100 [[hertz]] [[frequency range]] that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, [[Gunshot|gunfire]] and most [[industrial noise]]. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the over-pressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Over-pressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately {{convert|1|smi|km}} for each {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} will create a lateral boom spread of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some maneuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other maneuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances weather conditions can distort sonic booms.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nDepending on the aircraft's altitude, sonic booms reach the ground two to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15&nbsp;\u00b0C), the temperature at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (\u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is about {{convert|670|mph|km/h}}, but an aircraft must travel at least {{convert|750|mph|km/h}} (Mach 1.12, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound) for a boom to be heard on the ground.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nThe composition of the atmosphere is also a factor.  Temperature variations, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pollution]], and [[wind]]s can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground.  Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom.  Hard surfaces such as [[concrete]], [[Road surface|pavement]], and large buildings can cause reflections which may amplify the sound of a sonic boom.  Similarly, [[grass]]y fields and lots of [[foliage]] can help attenuate the strength of the over-pressure of a sonic boom.\n\nCurrently there are no industry-accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom. However, work is underway to create metrics that will help in understanding how humans respond to the noise generated by sonic booms. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loubeau|first=Alexandra|last2=Naka|first2=Yusuke|last3=Cook|first3=Brian G.|last4=Sparrow|first4=Victor W.|last5=Morgenstern|first5=John M.|date=2015-10-28|title=A new evaluation of noise metrics for sonic booms using existing data|url=https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4934481|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1685|issue=1|pages=090015|doi=10.1063/1.4934481|issn=0094-243X}}</ref> Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.\n\n==Bullwhip==\n[[File:Bullwhip.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Australian bullwhip.]]\nThe cracking sound a [[bullwhip]] makes when properly wielded is, in fact, a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the ''\"cracker\"'', moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.<ref name=\"americanscientist.org\"/>\n\nA bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the energy is transferred down the length of the tapering whip.

De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling some 1,000 men. However, [[yellow fever]] quickly reduced the defending forces, and by the time of the siege, they had been reduced to 3,850 soldiers, 5,000 sailors and marines and 2,800 militia. The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]]. It could easily accommodate up to 100 ships of the line. A 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel gave access to the harbour, and Havana housed important shipyards capable of building [[first-rate]] man-of-war ships.\n\nTwo strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. The south side was defended by the ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''. The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long. Havana was considered impregnable, and hadn't been taken since the French pirates in the 16th century.\n\n===British preparations===\nWhen war broke out with Spain, plans were made in Great Britain for an amphibious attack on Havana. The expedition was under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]], with Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]] as naval commander. This plan also called for [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]] to embark 4,000 men from America to join Keppel and to assemble another force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]].\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of [[Martinique]] where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral [[George Rodney]]'s squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15.\n\nOn 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]), was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The force under Albemarle now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy, hoping for a relief force or for an epidemic of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers or for a [[hurricane]] destroying the British fleet. Accordingly, the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers. Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city.\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day. They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana. The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights. Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.  With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance. The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro. Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead. He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']]. The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high. Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June. Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro. Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro. Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived. During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch. At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion. Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort. Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay. Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana. A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m. By the end of the day [[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Fort la Punta]] was silenced. Prado had no other choice left but to surrender.\n\nThe next day negotiations of the articles of capitulation went on, and Prado and his army obtained the honours of war on 13 August. Hevia neglected to burn his fleet which fell intact in the hands of the British.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Perspective view of his majesty's land forces going in flat boats to take possession of the north gate of the city and Punto Castle... LCCN2003653272.jpg|thumb|British land forces going in [[flatboats]] to take possession of the north gate of the city and Punto Castle on 14 August]]\nOn 14 August the British entered the city. They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to  [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August-September 1762.jpg|thumb|left|The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August\u2013September 1762, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival.

Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process.\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule. Spain was required to cede [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain and pay the [[Manila Ransom]].<ref name=\"Schneider219, 224\">Schneider pp. 219, 224</ref> Spain received [[French Louisiana]] as a payment for intervening in the war on the side of the French and as compensation for having lost Florida.<ref name=\"Schneider225\">Schneider p. 225</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\nNumerous paintings and drawings of the battle were made, notably by [[Dominic Serres]]:\n<gallery widths=\"145\" heights=\"115\">\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762- The Morro Castle and the Boom Defence Before the Attack.jpg|The Morro Castle and the [[boom (navigational barrier)|Boom Defence]] Before the Attack\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762- the Landing, 7th June.jpg|The Landing, 7 June\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, Landing Cannon and Stores, 30 June.jpg|Landing Cannon and Stores, 30 June\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762.jpg|Approach of British forces before Morro Castle\nFile:The Capture of Havana, 1762- Storming of Morro Castle, 30 July RMG L6229.tiff|Storming of Morro Castle, 30 July\nFile:British ships in the Seven Years War before Havana.jpg|Bombardment of the Morro Castle ([[Rafael Monle\u00f3n]])\nFile:El Morro.jpg|[[Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro|El Morro fortress]] in Havana, built in 1589\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=Peter|title=British Maritime Enterprise in the New World: From the Late Fifteenth to the Mid-eighteenth Century|date=1999|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press Ltd|isbn=9780773478664}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Brumwell|first1=Stephen|title=Redcoats: The British Soldier and War in the Americas, 1755\u20131763|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521807832}}\n* Diefendorf, Jeffry M./Dorsey, Kurkpatrick (2006).

British forces besieged and captured the city of [[Havana]], which at the time was an important [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] naval base in the [[Caribbean]], and dealt a serious blow to the [[Spanish Navy]]. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\n===Spanish preparations===\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, [[Charles III of Spain]] made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as commander-in-chief.  De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling some 1,000 men. However, [[yellow fever]] quickly reduced the defending forces, and by the time of the siege, they had been reduced to 3,850 soldiers, 5,000 sailors and marines and 2,800 militia. The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]]. It could easily accommodate up to 100 ships of the line. A 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel gave access to the harbour, and Havana housed important shipyards capable of building [[first-rate]] man-of-war ships.\n\nTwo strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. The south side was defended by the ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''. The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long. Havana was considered impregnable, and hadn't been taken since the French pirates in the 16th century.\n\n===British preparations===\nWhen war broke out with Spain, plans were made in Great Britain for an amphibious attack on Havana. The expedition was under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]], with Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]] as naval commander. This plan also called for [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]] to embark 4,000 men from America to join Keppel and to assemble another force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]].\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of [[Martinique]] where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral [[George Rodney]]'s squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15.\n\nOn 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]), was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The force under Albemarle now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy, hoping for a relief force or for an epidemic of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers or for a [[hurricane]] destroying the British fleet. Accordingly, the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers. Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city.\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day. They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana. The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights. Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.  With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance. The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro. Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead. He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']]. The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high. Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June. Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro. Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro. Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived. During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch. At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion. Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort. Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay. Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana. A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m. By the end of the day [[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Fort la Punta]] was silenced. Prado had no other choice left but to surrender.\n\nThe next day negotiations of the articles of capitulation went on, and Prado and his army obtained the honours of war on 13 August. Hevia neglected to burn his fleet which fell intact in the hands of the British.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Perspective view of his majesty's land forces going in flat boats to take possession of the north gate of the city and Punto Castle... LCCN2003653272.jpg|thumb|British land forces going in [[flatboats]] to take possession of the north gate of the city and Punto Castle on 14 August]]\nOn 14 August the British entered the city. They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel| Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August-September 1762.jpg|thumb|left|The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August\u2013September 1762, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival. Three ships of the line were lost either as a direct result of Spanish gunfire or severe damage received which would cause their demise later.

Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process.\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed [[Captaincy General of Cuba| Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule. Spain was required to cede [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain and pay the [[Manila Ransom]].<ref name=\"Schneider219, 224\">Schneider pp. 219, 224</ref> Spain received [[French Louisiana]] as a payment for intervening in the war on the side of the French and as compensation for having lost Florida.<ref name=\"Schneider225\">Schneider p. 225</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\nNumerous paintings and drawings of the battle were made, notably by [[Dominic Serres]]:\n<gallery widths=\"145\" heights=\"115\">\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762- The Morro Castle and the Boom Defence Before the Attack.jpg|The Morro Castle and the [[boom (navigational barrier)|Boom Defence]] Before the Attack\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762- the Landing, 7th June.jpg|The Landing, 7 June\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, Landing Cannon and Stores, 30 June.jpg|Landing Cannon and Stores, 30 June\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762.jpg|Approach of British forces before Morro Castle\nFile:The Capture of Havana, 1762- Storming of Morro Castle, 30 July RMG L6229.tiff|Storming of Morro Castle, 30 July\nFile:British ships in the Seven Years War before Havana.jpg|Bombardment of the Morro Castle ([[Rafael Monle\u00f3n]])\nFile:El Morro.jpg|[[Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro|El Morro fortress]] in Havana, built in 1589\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=Peter|title=British Maritime Enterprise in the New World: From the Late Fifteenth to the Mid-eighteenth Century|date=1999|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press Ltd|isbn=9780773478664}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Brumwell|first1=Stephen|title=Redcoats: The British Soldier and War in the Americas, 1755\u20131763|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521807832}}\n* Diefendorf, Jeffry M./Dorsey, Kurkpatrick (2006).

It's also at least a C+!\n\nIt inhabits the coasts from [[Maine]] to northeast [[Florida]] and the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].\nThe three large biomass populations of black sea bass are the mid-Atlantic stock, from [[Cape Cod]] in [[Massachusetts]] to [[Cape Hatteras]] in [[North Carolina]], the South Atlantic stock, from Cape Hatteras to the southern tip of the [[Florida]] peninsula, and the Gulf of Mexico stock, from the southern tip of the Florida peninsula to [[Texas]]. They can be found in inshore waters (bays and sounds) and offshore in waters up to a depth of {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}. They spend most of their time close to the sea floor and often congregate around bottom formations such as rocks, man-made reefs, wrecks, jetties, piers, and bridge pilings.\n\n==Lifecycle==\nThe sea bass spawns when it is mature, at {{convert|190|mm|in|abbr=on}}, in middle of May to end of June. The [[buoyancy|buoyant]] eggs are {{convert|0.95|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and their development time is 1.6 days at {{convert|23|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The maximum size of a sea bass is {{convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on}}, weighing {{convert|4.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nIt appears off [[New Jersey]] in the first weeks of May, withdrawing in late October or early November, and wintering offshore at {{convert|55|to|130|m|ft|abbr=on}} at temperatures above {{convert|8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. In summer, it is most abundant at less than {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nBlack sea bass are [[Sequential hermaphroditism|protogynous hermaphrodites]], meaning they generally first mature as females and some later become male.

Due to its lack of theology teaching, its willingness to grant degrees (if it were given this power) to non-Anglicans, and its unauthorised assumption of the title of \"university\", this inspired calls in 1827 for the foundation of a 'true and genuine \"London University\"' by royal charter,<ref>{{cite news |title=London University |work=Morning Post |date= 30 October 1827|accessdate=30 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18271030/020/0003| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> to be known (in the same manner as Edinburgh was officially known as the College of King James VI) as \"The College of King George IV in London\".<ref>{{cite news |title=London University |work=Morning Post |date= 3 November 1827|accessdate=30 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18271103/017/0003| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> This became [[King's College London]], granted a royal charter in 1829 \u2013 but as a college rather than a university.\n\nUCL was revolutionary not just in admitting non-Anglicans (indeed non-Anglicans were allowed to study at Cambridge, but not to take degrees, and UCL could not grant them degrees); it also pioneered the study of modern languages and of geography,<ref>{{cite book|title=UCL Undergraduate Prospectus 2016 Entry|page=7|publisher=UCL|date=2015|url=http://issuu.com/ucl-pams/docs/ug16_all}}</ref> as well as appointing the first Professor of English Language and Literature, although the study of English Literature as a distinct subject was pioneered by King's College London.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Victorian Studies|author=Alan Bacon|volume=29|issue=4|title=English Literature Becomes a University Subject: King's College, London as Pioneer|pages=591\u2013612|jstor=3828546|year=1986}}</ref> Neither of the colleges was residential \u2013 a break from the two ancient English universities, although non-residential universities were the norm in Scotland.\n\n1830 saw the election of a Whig government under Earl Grey, and in early 1831 news broke that a charter was to be granted to the London University, officially recognising it as a university and thus enabling it to award degrees.<ref>{{cite news |title=London University |work=Chester Courant|date=15 February 1831 |accessdate=28 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000390/18310215/016/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Cambridge voted to petition the King not to allow the awarding of degrees with the same name as theirs or Oxford's.<ref>{{cite news |title= University Intelligence|work=Morning Post|date=12 March 1831 |accessdate=28 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18310312/005/0002| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> The charter was blocked.\n\nThen, later in 1831, a plan was announced to found a university in Durham. Grey's government supported the bill to establish the university, despite it limiting its degrees to Anglicans. Thus the [[University of Durham]] was established by Act of Parliament in 1832, and opened in 1833. In 1836 it pioneered the system of [[external examiner]]s for its final degree examinations, bringing in Oxford academics to ensure the same standards. It was incorporated by royal charter in 1837 and awarded its first degrees the same year. In 1838 it opened Britain's first course in engineering, and in 1846 pioneered \"halls\" accommodation, where students let rooms ready-furnished and serviced by shared staff, and took all their meals together. This was in contrast to the system at Oxford and Cambridge (and in Durham's original college) where students had to furnish their own rooms, supply their own servants, and provide their own food.\n\nIn 1834, the House of Commons backed the granting of a charter to the London University. In 1835, the government responded by announcing its intention to establish the University of London as an examining board that would grant degrees to affiliated colleges and medical schools. This was done in 1836, with the old London University accepting a charter as a college under the name of University College, London.\n\nThe new University of London achieved one of the principal goals of the founders of UCL: it would award degrees without any religious test, the first university in England to do so. The first degrees were conferred in 1839 to students from UCL and King's College London. But from 1840 it affiliated other colleges and schools, opening up the possibility of degrees for many students who would not previously have attended a university. Another big step came in 1858 when the system of affiliated colleges was abandoned and London degrees were opened to any man who passed the examination. From 1878, University of London degrees were opened to women \u2013 the first in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1845, Queen's Colleges were established across Ireland: in Belfast, Cork and Galway, followed by the establishment of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]] in 1850 as a federal university encompassing the three colleges. In response, the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] (never recognised as a university by the British state, although granted degree awarding power by the Pope) was established in Dublin by the Catholic Church. This eventually led to the dissolution of the Queen's University in 1879 and its replacement by the Royal University of Ireland, an examining board after the pattern of the University of London.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15199b.htm|title=Catholic University of Ireland|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopaedia|date=1912|author=Patrick O'Donnell|volume=15|publisher=New York: Robert Appleton Company|via=New Advent|accessdate=7 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe first women's college was Bedford College in London, which opened in 1849. It was followed by [[Royal Holloway]] (with which it merged in the 1980s) and the [[London School of Medicine for Women]] in London and colleges in Oxford and Cambridge. After London opened its degrees to women in 1878, UCL opened its courses in Arts, Law and Science to women, although it took the First World War to open up the London medical schools. By the end of the 19th century, the only British universities not granting degrees to women were Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin.\n\nNon-Anglicans were admitted to degrees at Oxford in 1854, Cambridge in 1856 and Durham in 1865. The remaining tests were (except in theology) removed by the [[Universities Tests Act 1871]], allowing non-Anglicans to become full members of the university (membership of Convocation at Oxford and Durham or the Senate at Cambridge) and to hold teaching positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.qmul.ac.uk/drwilliams/academies/legislation.html|title=Legislation|publisher=Dr William's Centre for Dissenting Studies, QMUL|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=University of Durham|work=Morning Post |date=18 September 1865 |accessdate=5 December 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18650918/038/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nAn Act of Parliament was passed in 1858 that modernised the constitutions of all of the Scottish universities. Under this Act, the two universities in Aberdeen were united into the [[University of Aberdeen]] (explicitly preserving the foundation date of King's College) and the University of Edinburgh was made independent from the town corporation.\n\nThe first of the civic university colleges was the Anglican [[Queen's College, Birmingham]], built on the nucleus of the Birmingham Medical School, which gained its royal charter in 1843 but did not ultimately prove a success.

Royal commissions were held and a charter was drawn up for the \"Albert University\" that would have seen the two colleges leave the University of London and form a federal body, like the colleges of the Victoria University. In the end it was decided to reform the University of London itself, this was put into effect by an Act of Parliament in 1898, leading to completely new statutes establishing the federal University of London in 1900.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Bbuilding.jpg|thumb|[[University of Birmingham]], the first of the red-brick generation]]\n1900 also saw Mason College, Birmingham (which had absorbed the Medical School from Queen's College in 1892) become the [[University of Birmingham]]. This was the first of the [[redbrick universities]] to gain university status. Over the next decade the Victoria University dissolved, its colleges becoming the universities of [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], and [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]], and the colleges in Sheffield and Bristol also gained university status as the [[University of Sheffield]] and the [[University of Bristol]]. The last of the original provincial university colleges, in Newcastle, remained connected to the University of Durham, but moved to a federal structure with equal Newcastle and Durham divisions. In Ireland, Queen's College Belfast became [[Queen's University Belfast]], and the other colleges formed the [[National University of Ireland]], replacing the Royal University.\n\nThe First World War caused financial crises in many British universities and university colleges. This led to the formation of the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] after the war, with Oxford, Cambridge and the Durham division of Durham University finally accepting government funding. Only one institution, [[Reading University]] (1926), became a university between the wars. New university colleges were set up in Swansea (1920), Leicester (1921), Exeter (1922) and Hull (1927).\n\n===Expansion after 1945===\n[[File:University of Sussex.JPG|thumb|[[University of Sussex]], the first of the plate-glass generation]]\nAfter the Second World War, there was an enormous expansion in the demand for higher education.<ref>Brian Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom, 1951\u20131970'' (2011) pp 357\u201370.</ref>  A final public university college was set up in [[Keele University|Keele]] in 1949; this was the first university college to receive full degree awarding powers as a college rather than on becoming a university (St David's College, Lampeter, held limited degree awarding power from the mid 19th century, but could only award [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] degrees).\n\nBetween 1948 ([[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]]) and 1967 ([[University of Dundee|Dundee]]) all of the university colleges (except those that had become colleges of the University of London) achieved independent university status. [[Newcastle University]] is notable for having been made a university in 1963 by Act of Parliament rather than by royal charter. The 1960s saw a large expansion in the number of universities in the UK with eight universities, known as the [[plateglass university|plateglass universities]], established as new institutions rather than from earlier university colleges, a number of other institutions that had not been university colleges promoted directly to university status following the [[Robbins Report]] in 1963, and the [[Open University]] founded as a distance-learning University.\n\nIn 1973 the University College at Buckingham was established as a private sector, non-profit college, opening in 1976. It awarded \"licences\" that were externally examined in the same manner as degrees, rather than being associated with the University of London or another parent university like the earlier university colleges. In 1983 it became the UK's first private university after being granted a royal charter as the [[University of Buckingham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history|publisher=University of Buckingham|title=History of the University|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Since 1992===\nA major change to UK higher education occurred in 1992 with the abolition of the \"binary divide\" between universities and [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnics]]. By the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]], the polytechnics and the Scottish central institutions all became universities. These [[New university|new or post-1992]] institutions nearly doubled the number of universities in the UK.\n\nIn 1993 the University of London underwent a major shake-up, with the larger colleges being granted direct access to government funding and the right to confer University of London degrees themselves. This was a major step towards their being recognised generally as ''de facto'' universities.\n\nIn 1997, Cardiff University (then the University of Wales, Cardiff) was granted degree awarding powers. This was the first time such powers had been granted to a constituent institution of a university (although the University of Wales, Lampeter held degree awarding powers, these were granted prior to it joining the federal university). Over the next decade, all of the constituent institutions of the University of Wales and many of those of the University of London gained their own degree awarding powers.\n\nIn 2005, Cardiff University left the University of Wales, which shifted to a confederal structure in 2007 before being essentially dissolved following a series of scandals in 2011. In 2007 Imperial College left the University of London, raising fears about the future of that federal institution. However, it has survived and attracted new members, although many of the larger colleges now award their own degrees. In 2016, [[City University, London|City University]], London was the first institute to voluntarily surrender university status when it became a college of the University of London.\n\nIn 2018, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that hundreds of academics has been accused of bullying students and colleagues, leading to calls from [[Venki Ramakrishnan]], president of the [[Royal Society]], for an overhaul of workplace practices in universities and from [[Fiona Watt]], chair of the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]], for an annual national audit of bullying incidents.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/sep/28/academics-uk-universities-accused-bullying-students-colleagues Hundreds of academics at top UK universities accused of bullying] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\n===University funding from 1945===\nIn the years following the end of the Second World War, [[local education authority|local education authorities]] (LEAs) paid student tuition fees and provided non-mature{{clarify|date=May 2014}} students with a maintenance grant. Under the [[Education Act 1962]] a national mandatory award of student maintenance grant was established, payable by the LEAs to students on most full-time courses. In 1980, the level of grant increased from \u00a3380 to \u00a31,430.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8057871/Grants-loans-and-tuition-fees-a-timeline-of-how-university-funding-has-evolved.html|title=Grants, loans and tuition fees: a timeline of how university funding has evolved}}</ref>\n\nAs the university population rose during the 1980s the sums paid to universities became linked to their performance and efficiency, and by the mid-1990s funding per student had dropped by 40% since the mid-1970s, while numbers of full-time students had reached around 2,000,000 (around a third of the age group), up from around 1,300,000.\n\nIn 1989 the levels of maintenance grants were frozen at \u00a32,265 \u2013 which since 1985 had been [[means tested]] \u2013 but a system of [[student loans in the United Kingdom|student loan]]s was introduced to provide for additional funding. Initially loans of up to \u00a3420 were available, and could be taken out by all students.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> The costs of tuition continued to be met in full for all domestic{{clarify|date=February 2016}} students.\n\nFollowing an investigation into the future of universities, the July 1997 report of the [[National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/ |title=Welcome to this site |publisher=University of Leeds |accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> chaired by the then [[Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing|Sir Ronald (later Lord) Dearing]] recommended the ending of universal free higher education, and that students should pay \u00a31,000 towards the cost of their tuition fees, which would be recovered in the form of a graduate tax.\n\nTuition fees were introduced in 1998, raised to  \u00a33,000 a year in 2006, and passed \u00a39,000 a year by 2012.<ref>Vikki Boliver, \"How fair is access to more prestigious UK universities?.\" ''British journal of sociology'' 64#2 (2013): 344\u2013364.</ref> At the time of the Dearing Report, tuition fees were still paid in full by the local education authorities, student grants of up to \u00a31,755 (\u00a32,160 in London) were linked to family income, and a subsidised student loan of \u00a31,685 (\u00a32,085 in London) was available. Instead of following Dearing's suggestions, the grant was replaced by the present loan scheme, introduced for students starting in 1998. There was a transition year when about half the previous means-tested grant was available, though they still had to pay the new \u00a31,000 tuition fee. From 1999, the grant was abolished altogether.\n\nThe abolition of tuition fees was a major issue in the 1999 Scottish parliamentary elections, and subsequently was part of the agreement that led to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]/[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] coalition that governed Scotland from 1999 to 2003.\n\nFrom the academic year 2006/7, a new system of tuition fees was introduced in England. These [[top-up fees|variable tuition fees]] of up to \u00a33,000 per year are paid up-front as previously, but new student loans are available that may only be used to pay for tuition fees, and must be repaid after graduation, in addition to the existing loan. In fact, there is very little variation in the tuition fees charged by universities\u2014nearly all charge the maximum tuition fee on all courses. Instead, the differences appear in the nature and value of various 'access' bursaries that are on offer.   There has been considerable debate since the 1980s about the tendency toward vocationalism and the decline in the humanities, as well as a growing mindset among senior administrators that is preoccupied with marketing and corporate-like measures of \"success.\"<ref>Sharon Gewirtz and Alan Cribb, \"Representing 30 years of higher education change: UK universities and the Times Higher.\" ''Journal of Educational Administration and History'' 45.1 (2013): 58\u201383.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the government voted to raise the amount universities can charge for undergraduate tuition fees (for England only) to between \u00a36,000 \u2013 \u00a39,000 per year though most charge the maximum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11483638|title=Q&A: Tuition fees|publisher=BBC}}</ref> In 2016, the government raised the cap on tuition fees to \u00a39,250 from 2017, with tuition fees expected to continue rising in increments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36322654/heres-why-university-tuition-fees-will-probably-go-up-in-2017|title=Here's why university tuition fees will probably go up in 2017 \u2013 BBC Newsbeat|date=18 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38406733|title=Tuition fee rise 'sneaked out' on website|first=Sean|last=Coughlan|date=22 December 2016|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n{{seealso|UK enterprise law}}\n{{Clist universities}}\nUniversities in the United Kingdom do not have a coherent system of funding or governance, and both remain heavily debated.<ref>See D Farrington and D Palfreyman, ''The Law of Higher Education'' (2nd edn 2012) chs 4-5, and ch 12</ref> A growing body of other legal rights, for instance, for staff in reasonable expectations of fair procedure, or for students in fairness over the awarding of degrees, has grown through [[judicial review]].\n\n===Degree awarding powers and university title===\n\nBoth degree awarding powers and university title are controlled under UK law, and it is illegal for an institution to call itself a university or to purport to offer UK degrees without authorisation.<ref name=\"fake unis\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Lords/2016-11-22/HL3416/|title=Universities:Written question - HL3416|website=parliament.uk|date=10 December 2016}}</ref> Higher education is a devolved power, so the rules for degree awarding powers and university title differ between the four countries of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland the last UK national standards (from 1999) still apply.

Institutions with taught degree powers may be awarded the title of \"university college\", but for university title an institution must hold research degree awarding powers, as well as having over 4,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) students, with over 3,000 on degree -level courses and at least 500 higher education students in each of five broad subject areas.

Under these regulations, which remain in force in Wales, while taught and research degree awarding powers are awarded indefinitely to institutions in the publicly funded higher education sector, they are time limited to six years for other institutions (e.g. private colleges and universities) after which they must be renewed. The rules for university title allowed institutions holding only taught degree awarding powers to become universities in England and Wales from 2004, and the requirement for minimum student numbers across five broad subject areas was dropped. The overall higher education FTE student number criterion remained at 4,000, with 3,000 on degree-level courses (clarified to include foundation degrees, which has been introduced since the 1999 regulations). The final award of degree awarding powers continued to rest with the Privy Council; for university title it lay with the Privy Council for publicly funded institutions while alternative providers had to get permission to use ''University'' in their name under the [[Companies Act 2006]], the recommendation in both cases coming from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) via the relevant government department (in England) or from the Welsh Government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gov.wales/topics/educationandskills/publications/guidance/grant-of-degree-awarding-powers/?lang=en|title=Applications for the grant of Degree Awarding Powers: guidance and criteria for applicants in Wales|date=7 February 2017|accessdate=22 July 2018|publisher=[[Welsh Government]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/11933/|publisher=[[Department for Business Innovation and Skills]]|via=[[UCL Institute of Education]] Digital Education Resource Archive|accessdate=22 July 2018|title=APPLICATIONS FOR THE GRANT OF TAUGHT DEGREE AWARDING POWERS, RESEARCH DEGREE AWARDING POWERS AND UNIVERSITY TITLE|date= August 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"DAP factsheet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/584734/Factsheet_on_Degree_Awarding_Powers_and_University_Title.pdf|title=Higher Education and Research Bill: Factsheet on Degree Awarding Powers and University Title|date=January 2017|accessdate=22 July 2018|publisher=[[Department for Education]]}}</ref>\n\nEngland diverged from Wales in 2012 with a reduction in the number of higher education FTE students needed for university title to 1,000 (750 on degree level courses), with the addition that at least 55% of total FTE students had to be on higher education courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guildhe.ac.uk/blog/university-whats-in-a-title/|title=University: What's in a Title?|publisher=[[GuildHE]]|author=Alex Bols|date=15 February 2016|accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref> There were further technical changes in 2015 before a complete overhaul of the system in England under the [[Higher Education and Research Act 2017]]. This saw the abolition of HEFCE and its replacement by the [[Office for Students]] (OfS). A new tier of degree awarding powers \u2013 bachelor's degree awarding powers, allowing the award of degrees up to level 6 on the [[National qualifications frameworks in the United Kingdom|Framework for Higher Education Qualifications]] \u2013 was introduced. \n\nUnder this act, degree awarding powers were made available on a probationary basis, termed \"New DAPs\" to providers without a track record in higher education, who had previously had to have a validation agreement with a recognised body to establish a track record prior to gaining their own powers. Providers with a track record of the years or more can apply for time-limited \"Full DAPs\" and those who have held time-limited date awarding powers for more than three years can apply for \"Indefinite DAPs\". Another change is that degree awarding powers can now be limited to some subjects rather than covering all possible degrees at that level as previously. There is also an intention to make it possible for institute to gain research degree awarding powers without taught degree awarding powers. New criteria for university title will apply for applications from April 2019, the government had started its intention that student numbers limits will be removed  but that the criterion that 55 percent of students are on higher education courses will remain, and that providers with bachelor's degree awarding powers and single subject degree awarding powers will be eligible for university title. The OfS will take over the responsibility of granting degree awarding powers and university title from the Privy Council, and will also be responsible for the awarding of university title to institutions outside of the publicly-funded higher education sector. The act gives OfS the ability to remove indefinite degree awarding powers and university title from any institution in England, including those granted these by royal charter.<ref name=\"DAP factsheet\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/publications/regulatory-advice-4-transition-arrangements-for-degree-awarding-powers-and-university-title/|title=Regulatory advice 4: Transition arrangements for degree awarding powers and university title|publisher=OfS|date=22 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://qaa.ac.uk/reviewing-higher-education/degree-awarding-powers-and-university-title|title=Degree awarding powers and university title|accessdate=21 July 2018|publisher=Quality Assurance Agency}}</ref>\n\n===Staff and student voice===\n{{seealso|Governance in higher education|Ancient university governance in Scotland}}\n[[File:Maughan-library-1.jpg|thumb|right|Almost all universities by law require staff and student representation in the governing body.

Assessors are appointed by the local authority, chancellor, general council and ''senatus academicus''. Also there are student members, employee representatives and co-opted lay members. For instance, [[Aberdeen University]] has up to a 22 person \"court\", with an elected rector and a person she or he chooses, a principal plus one she or he chooses, a vice-principal (five members), two members appointed by the local councils, four members appointed by the General Council, six members from the Senatus Academicus, and up to five co-opted members.<ref>[[Universities (Scotland) Act 1966]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1966/13/schedule/1 Sch 1, part 3]</ref>\n\nIn England and Wales, the pattern is more haphazard and often deficient in representation. The constitution of the [[London School of Economics]], which unusually takes the legal form of a [[company limited by guarantee]], currently requires its seventeen-member \"Council\" to have two student representatives, and three staff representatives.<ref>''[[London School of Economics, Memorandum and Articles of Association]]'' (2006) [http://www.lse.ac.uk/study/temp/planningAndCorporatePolicy/pdf/LSEMemorandumandArticlesofAssociation.pdf art 10.5] required a 25 member Council of 14 lay governors, 6 elected academic governors, 3 ex-officio governors, and 2 student governors. However, in 2014, the composition was altered, to be set \"by the Court\" of the university. This is a large, mostly self-perpetuating body of lay members.</ref> Anomalously, the [[King\u2019s College London Act 1997]] required a 38 member council with five ex-officio members, twenty lay appointees, eight elected by academics, three elected by students, and two by non-academic staff members, however this provision still remains to be put into effect on the \"appointed day\".<ref>cf King's College, London, [https://www.kcl.ac.uk/governancezone/Assets/GovernanceLegal/Charter%20and%20Statutes.pdf The Charter and Statutes], The Statutes, art 1, \"Membership of the Council\" requires a 21 member board, 12 lay, 8 staff, 1 student, but appears to make no provision for elections by staff.</ref> Other universities have a broad variety of governance structures,<ref>See D Farrington and D Palfreyman, ''The Law of Higher Education'' (2nd edn 2012) ch 5</ref> although if there is not a special statute or constitution, the general rules are set by the [[Education Reform Act 1988]].

The actual executive responsibilities are borne by a vice-chancellor. In recent years, the role of the vice-chancellor has shifted from one of academic administration to strategic management.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/jul/27/theres-a-gulf-between-academics-and-university-management-and-its-growing\n | title =There's a gulf between academics and university management \u2013 and it's growing\n | last =Shepherd\n | first =Sue\n | date =27 July 2017\n | website =The Guardian\n | access-date =3 March 2020}}</ref> Accompanying this shift has been a massive rise in remuneration.

[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]'s endowment, at \u00a36.25bn is the largest, while [[Tuition fees in the UK|tuition fees]] have been abolished in Scotland and remain highly controversial elsewhere.]]\nBefore 1998, universities were funded mainly by central government, although they have been increasingly reliant on charging students and seeking to raise private capital. First, universities have the power to generate income through [[List of UK universities by endowment|endowment trust funds]], accumulated over generations of donations and investment.<ref>In 2016, the [[University of Cambridge]] had combined endowments of \u00a36.25bn, the [[University of Oxford]] \u00a35bn, the [[University of Edinburgh]] \u00a3342m, the [[University of Manchester]] \u00a3196m and [[King's College, London]] \u00a3194. By contrast, the two largest US endowment funds are [[Harvard]] $34bn and [[Yale]] $25bn.</ref> Second, under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] there are [[Research Funding in the UK|funding councils]] paid for through [[general taxation]] for [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|England]], [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales|Wales]], [[Scottish Funding Council|Scotland]] and [[Department for Employment and Learning|Northern Ireland]]. For England and Wales, the [[Secretary of State]] appoints 12 to 15 members and the chair, of which 6 to 9 should be academics and the remainder with \"industrial, commercial or financial\" backgrounds. Funds are administered at the councils' discretion but must consult with \"bodies representing the interests of higher education institutions\" such as the [[University and College Union]] and [[Universities UK]].<ref>[[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/13/part/II ss 62-69]</ref> After the [[Higher Education and Research Act 2017]], the English council from 2018 will be renamed the \"[[Office for Students]]\".<ref>[[HERA 2017]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/29/contents s 1 ff]</ref> Further, there are seven [[research councils]] ([[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]], [[ESRC]], [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|MRC]], etc.) which distribute funds after [[Haldane principle|peer review]] of applications by academics conducting research.<ref>[[HERA 2017]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/29/section/92 s 92] renames the umbrella body \"[[UK Research and Innovate]]\" and add \"Innovate UK\" and \"Research England\".</ref> \n\nThird, and most controversially, funding may come from charging students. From [[WW2]] [[tuition fees in the UK]] were effectively abolished and [[Local government in England|local authorities]] paid [[maintenance grants]]. The [[Education Act 1962]] formally required this position for all UK residents,<ref>[[Education Act 1962]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/10-11/12/section/1/enacted s 1]</ref> and this continued through the expansion of university places recommended by the [[Robbins Report]] of 1963.<ref>See Committee on Higher Education, ''Higher education: report of the Committee appointed by the Prime Minister under the Chairmanship of Lord Robbins 1961\u201363'' (23 September 1963) [http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/robbins/robbins1963.html Cmnd 2154]</ref> However, over the 1980s and 1990s, grants were diminished, requiring students to become ever more reliant on their parents' wealth. Further, appointed in 1996, the [[Dearing Report]] argued for the introduction of [[tuition fees]] because it said graduates had \"improved employment prospects and pay.\"<ref>The National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, ''Higher Education in the learning society: Main Report'' (1997) [http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/dearing1997/dearing1997.html#18 18.24]</ref> Instead of funding university through [[progressive tax]], the [[Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998]] mandated \u00a31,000 fees for home students.

A system of [[Student loans in the United Kingdom|student loans]] is available for UK students through the government owned [[Student Loans Company]]. [[Student loans in the United Kingdom|Means-tested grants]] were also available, but abolished for students who began university after August 2016.

Some new universities are [[company limited by guarantee|companies limited by guarantee]], a common form of incorporation used ''inter alia'' for some charities.

There have also been a number of mergers between colleges of the University of London, of particular note is the merger of Royal Holloway College and Bedford College in 1985 by Act of Parliament.\n\n[[Cardiff University]] merged with the [[University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology]] in 1984, and then re-merged with the [[University of Wales College of Medicine]] in 2004, the two having previously been separated in the 1930s.\n\nAlso in 2004, the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] and the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]] merged to form the [[University of Manchester]].\n\nIn 2002, [[London Guildhall University]] and the [[University of North London]] merged to form [[London Metropolitan University]].<ref name=\"LonMet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/why-london-met/about-the-university/160-years-of-london-met/|title=160 years of London Met|publisher=London Metropolitan University}}</ref>\n\nAt around the same time a merger was proposed between [[Imperial College London]] and [[University College London]], but was abandoned following protests.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/london-merger-why-the-professors-said-no-133814.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|title=London merger: Why the professors said 'no'|author=Lucy Hodges|date=20 November 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a merger was proposed between two universities in [[Scotland]]: [[University of Abertay Dundee]] and [[University of Dundee]]. This similarly did not occur.\n\nIn Wales, the [[University of Wales Lampeter]] and [[Trinity University College]] merged in 2010 to form the [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David]], with [[Swansea Metropolitan University]] joining in 2012 and the [[University of Wales]] committed to joining once out has completed its commitments to current students. Legally this was a takeover rather than a merger as UWTSD remains incorporated under Lampeter's 1828 charter.\n\nAlso in Wales, the [[University of South Wales]] was formed in 2013 by a merger of the [[University of Glamorgan]] and the [[University of Wales, Newport]]. The [[University of Wales Institute Cardiff]] declined to take part in the merger, becoming [[Cardiff Metropolitan University]].\n\n==Categorisation==\nUK universities can be categorised in a number of different ways. Historically, they have frequently been categorised based on age and location, while some more recent categorisations have used statistical techniques such as [[cluster analysis]].\n===Categorisation by age and location===\nOne of the earliest attempts to categorise British universities was by George Edwin Maclean in a 1917 report for the US Department of the Interior.<ref name=MacLean>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r3RItwoRfZ0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Studies in Higher Education in England and Scotland|author=George Edwin Maclean|publisher=[[Department of the Interior]], Bureau of Education|date=1917}}</ref> This split the universities into five groups based on age and location: ancient universities of England, Scottish universities, the University of London, the \"new or provincial universities\", and the university colleges (Maclean's report only covered England and Scotland, Wales and Ireland were omitted).\n\nIn the early 1950s the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] (UGC) divided British universities by age into five groups by age and location.

Ninety nine broad-discipline institutions were classified using the cluster analysis, with heuristics (and in one case manual intervention) being used to identify specialist institutions based on concentration of academics; these were manually assigned by field of specialisation to STEM (subdivided into biosciences and veterinary (5 institutions), engineering (1 institution), and agriculture (3 institutions)), social sciences and business (5 institutions), and arts and design (18 institutions). The cluster analysis identified five clusters, randomly assigned labels to avoid implying any ranking of which cluster was \"better\".

Following the [[Historic counties of England|county boundary changes]], [[Warwick University]]'s campus straddles the [[Warwickshire]] and city of Coventry boundary, although many of its students live in the nearby towns of [[Kenilworth]] and [[Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire.\n\n[[John Banks Jenkinson]] was petitioner for the royal charters of both the [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]] (granted in 1828) and [[Durham University]] (granted in 1837), as [[Bishop of St David's]] and [[Dean of Durham]].\n\n==Post-nominal abbreviations==\nIn common with practice worldwide, graduates of universities in the United Kingdom often place not only their academic qualifications but also the names of the universities that awarded them after their name, the university typically (but not universally) being placed in parentheses, thus: ''John Smith, [[Esquire|Esq]], BSc (Sheffield)'', or ''John Smith BSc Sheffield''. Degrees are generally listed in ascending order of seniority followed by diplomas. An exception may be made when a degree of a different university falls between two degrees of the same university:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwoxacuk/localsites/gazette/documents/universitycalendar/style--current_for_2011.pdf|title=Oxford University Calendar: Notes on Style|publisher= University of Oxford|year=2011|accessdate=20 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/students/graduation/certificates/postnominalletters/|publisher=University of Loughborough|title=Post-Nominal Letters|accessdate=20 December 2015}}</ref> ''John Smith, MSci (York), PhD (London)''; ''Jane Smoth BA, PhD (London), MA (Bristol)''.\n\nSome older British universities are regularly denoted by an abbreviation of their Latin name. Notably ''Oxon'', ''Cantab'', ''Dunelm'' are used for the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Durham University|Durham]], which are different from the English abbreviation. For other universities, such as ''St And'' for [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], ''Glas'' for [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], ''Aberd'' for [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], ''Edin'' for [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] or ''Lond'' for [[University of London]], the Latin and English abbreviations are identical (both ''Aberdon''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oKEfYAAACAAJ|title=Hylas.

More recently established universities also sometimes use Latin abbreviations, especially when they share the name of an episcopal see, in which case they sometimes use the same abbreviation that the bishop uses for his signature.\n\nOn 30 March 2007 the [[University of Oxford]] issued a document entitled \"''Oxford University Calendar'': Notes on Style\", which promulgated a new system of abbreviations for use in publications of that university. The general rule is to use the first syllable and the first letter of the second syllable. Thus [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] became 'Oxf' and 'Camb'. The change was controversial (p.&nbsp;2, n. 1) but was considered essential to preserve consistency since most of the United Kingdom's universities can be rendered only in English.

They argue that the graduate premium has been diluted by the large number of graduates, in particular those with non-vocational degrees from non-elite institutions. Making matters worse, employers have responded to the oversupply of graduates by raising the academic requirements of many occupations [[credentialism and educational inflation|higher than is really necessary to perform the work]]. The study concludes by asking \"why bother to study at any other than the top few institutions when a lifetime of debt will be the almost certain consequence? What then of the public good of having a huge range of purely academic courses on offer?\" The paper then issued a warning that the proposed deregulation of higher education could result in the growth of low-quality for-profit education as in the US.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.if.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Graduate_Premium_final.compressed.pdf\n | title =The Graduate Premium: Manna, Myth, or Plain Mis-selling?\n | last =Kemp-King\n | first =Stephen\n | date =August 2016\n | publisher =Intergenerational Foundation\n | access-date =22 September 2016\n | quote =The UK now finds itself with more over-qualified workers than any OECD country other than Japan, with graduates under increasing pressure to undertake further post-graduate study \u2013 MAs/MScs \u2013 in order to further set themselves apart from their peers, thereby incurring yet more debt. }}</ref> Further study of the graduate premium by HESA and Warwick University shows that, while graduates born in 1970 earned 19% more than their non-graduate peers, the premium has fallen to 11% for graduates born in 1990.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/22-10-2019/return-to-degree-research\n | title =New research shows reduction in the 'graduate premium'\n | last =Nathwani\n | first =Tej\n | date =22 October 2019\n | website =HESA\n | access-date =25 October 2019\n | quote =The change in the percentage by which the hourly pay of graduates exceeds that of non-graduates mainly impacted on those born after 1987.}}</ref>\n\nA 2017 study by the [[Department for Education]] found that the [[median]] annual earnings of university graduates, five years into their careers, ranged from \u00a320,000 in the creative arts and design to \u00a347,000 in medicine and dentistry.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-higher-education-graduate-employment-and-earnings\n | title =Statistics: higher education graduate employment and earnings\n | date =13 June 2017\n | website =\n | publisher =Department of Education\n | access-date =23 September 2017\n | quote =Experimental statistics on longitudinal education outcomes showing university graduate earnings and employment. }}</ref>\n\nA 2017 study by the [[Office for National Statistics]] found that, although university graduates are consistently more likely to be employed than non-graduates, they are increasingly likely to be [[Overqualification|overqualified]] for the jobs which they do hold.

This would become [[University College London|UCL]], founded in 1826 as a [[joint stock company]] under the name of London University. Due to its lack of theology teaching, its willingness to grant degrees (if it were given this power) to non-Anglicans, and its unauthorised assumption of the title of \"university\", this inspired calls in 1827 for the foundation of a 'true and genuine \"London University\"' by royal charter,<ref>{{cite news |title=London University |work=Morning Post |date= 30 October 1827|accessdate=30 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18271030/020/0003| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> to be known (in the same manner as Edinburgh was officially known as the College of King James VI) as \"The College of King George IV in London\".<ref>{{cite news |title=London University |work=Morning Post |date= 3 November 1827|accessdate=30 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18271103/017/0003| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> This became [[King's College London]], granted a royal charter in 1829 \u2013 but as a college rather than a university.\n\nUCL was revolutionary not just in admitting non-Anglicans (indeed non-Anglicans were allowed to study at Cambridge, but not to take degrees, and UCL could not grant them degrees); it also pioneered the study of modern languages and of geography,<ref>{{cite book|title=UCL Undergraduate Prospectus 2016 Entry|page=7|publisher=UCL|date=2015|url=http://issuu.com/ucl-pams/docs/ug16_all}}</ref> as well as appointing the first Professor of English Language and Literature, although the study of English Literature as a distinct subject was pioneered by King's College London.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Victorian Studies|author=Alan Bacon|volume=29|issue=4|title=English Literature Becomes a University Subject: King's College, London as Pioneer|pages=591\u2013612|jstor=3828546|year=1986}}</ref> Neither of the colleges was residential \u2013 a break from the two ancient English universities, although non-residential universities were the norm in Scotland.\n\n1830 saw the election of a Whig government under Earl Grey, and in early 1831 news broke that a charter was to be granted to the London University, officially recognising it as a university and thus enabling it to award degrees.<ref>{{cite news |title=London University |work=Chester Courant|date=15 February 1831 |accessdate=28 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000390/18310215/016/0004| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Cambridge voted to petition the King not to allow the awarding of degrees with the same name as theirs or Oxford's.<ref>{{cite news |title= University Intelligence|work=Morning Post|date=12 March 1831 |accessdate=28 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18310312/005/0002| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> The charter was blocked.\n\nThen, later in 1831, a plan was announced to found a university in Durham. Grey's government supported the bill to establish the university, despite it limiting its degrees to Anglicans. Thus the [[University of Durham]] was established by Act of Parliament in 1832, and opened in 1833. In 1836 it pioneered the system of [[external examiner]]s for its final degree examinations, bringing in Oxford academics to ensure the same standards. It was incorporated by royal charter in 1837 and awarded its first degrees the same year. In 1838 it opened Britain's first course in engineering, and in 1846 pioneered \"halls\" accommodation, where students let rooms ready-furnished and serviced by shared staff, and took all their meals together. This was in contrast to the system at Oxford and Cambridge (and in Durham's original college) where students had to furnish their own rooms, supply their own servants, and provide their own food.\n\nIn 1834, the House of Commons backed the granting of a charter to the London University. In 1835, the government responded by announcing its intention to establish the University of London as an examining board that would grant degrees to affiliated colleges and medical schools. This was done in 1836, with the old London University accepting a charter as a college under the name of University College, London.\n\nThe new University of London achieved one of the principal goals of the founders of UCL: it would award degrees without any religious test, the first university in England to do so. The first degrees were conferred in 1839 to students from UCL and King's College London. But from 1840 it affiliated other colleges and schools, opening up the possibility of degrees for many students who would not previously have attended a university. Another big step came in 1858 when the system of affiliated colleges was abandoned and London degrees were opened to any man who passed the examination. From 1878, University of London degrees were opened to women \u2013 the first in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1845, Queen's Colleges were established across Ireland: in Belfast, Cork and Galway, followed by the establishment of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]] in 1850 as a federal university encompassing the three colleges. In response, the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] (never recognised as a university by the British state, although granted degree awarding power by the Pope) was established in Dublin by the Catholic Church. This eventually led to the dissolution of the Queen's University in 1879 and its replacement by the Royal University of Ireland, an examining board after the pattern of the University of London.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15199b.htm|title=Catholic University of Ireland|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopaedia|date=1912|author=Patrick O'Donnell|volume=15|publisher=New York: Robert Appleton Company|via=New Advent|accessdate=7 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe first women's college was Bedford College in London, which opened in 1849. It was followed by [[Royal Holloway]] (with which it merged in the 1980s) and the [[London School of Medicine for Women]] in London and colleges in Oxford and Cambridge. After London opened its degrees to women in 1878, UCL opened its courses in Arts, Law and Science to women, although it took the First World War to open up the London medical schools. By the end of the 19th century, the only British universities not granting degrees to women were Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin.\n\nNon-Anglicans were admitted to degrees at Oxford in 1854, Cambridge in 1856 and Durham in 1865. The remaining tests were (except in theology) removed by the [[Universities Tests Act 1871]], allowing non-Anglicans to become full members of the university (membership of Convocation at Oxford and Durham or the Senate at Cambridge) and to hold teaching positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.qmul.ac.uk/drwilliams/academies/legislation.html|title=Legislation|publisher=Dr William's Centre for Dissenting Studies, QMUL|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=University of Durham|work=Morning Post |date=18 September 1865 |accessdate=5 December 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18650918/038/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nAn Act of Parliament was passed in 1858 that modernised the constitutions of all of the Scottish universities. Under this Act, the two universities in Aberdeen were united into the [[University of Aberdeen]] (explicitly preserving the foundation date of King's College) and the University of Edinburgh was made independent from the town corporation.\n\nThe first of the civic university colleges was the Anglican [[Queen's College, Birmingham]], built on the nucleus of the Birmingham Medical School, which gained its royal charter in 1843 but did not ultimately prove a success.

Royal commissions were held and a charter was drawn up for the \"Albert University\" that would have seen the two colleges leave the University of London and form a federal body, like the colleges of the Victoria University. In the end it was decided to reform the University of London itself, this was put into effect by an Act of Parliament in 1898, leading to completely new statutes establishing the federal University of London in 1900.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Bbuilding.jpg|thumb|[[University of Birmingham]], the first of the red-brick generation]]\n1900 also saw Mason College, Birmingham (which had absorbed the Medical School from Queen's College in 1892) become the [[University of Birmingham]]. This was the first of the [[redbrick universities]] to gain university status. Over the next decade the Victoria University dissolved, its colleges becoming the universities of [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], and [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]], and the colleges in Sheffield and Bristol also gained university status as the [[University of Sheffield]] and the [[University of Bristol]]. The last of the original provincial university colleges, in Newcastle, remained connected to the University of Durham, but moved to a federal structure with equal Newcastle and Durham divisions. In Ireland, Queen's College Belfast became [[Queen's University Belfast]], and the other colleges formed the [[National University of Ireland]], replacing the Royal University.\n\nThe First World War caused financial crises in many British universities and university colleges. This led to the formation of the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] after the war, with Oxford, Cambridge and the Durham division of Durham University finally accepting government funding. Only one institution, [[Reading University]] (1926), became a university between the wars. New university colleges were set up in Swansea (1920), Leicester (1921), Exeter (1922) and Hull (1927).\n\n===Expansion after 1945===\n[[File:University of Sussex.JPG|thumb|[[University of Sussex]], the first of the plate-glass generation]]\nAfter the Second World War, there was an enormous expansion in the demand for higher education.<ref>Brian Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom, 1951\u20131970'' (2011) pp 357\u201370.</ref>  A final public university college was set up in [[Keele University|Keele]] in 1949; this was the first university college to receive full degree awarding powers as a college rather than on becoming a university (St David's College, Lampeter, held limited degree awarding power from the mid 19th century, but could only award [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] degrees).\n\nBetween 1948 ([[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]]) and 1967 ([[University of Dundee|Dundee]]) all of the university colleges (except those that had become colleges of the University of London) achieved independent university status. [[Newcastle University]] is notable for having been made a university in 1963 by Act of Parliament rather than by royal charter. The 1960s saw a large expansion in the number of universities in the UK with eight universities, known as the [[plateglass university|plateglass universities]], established as new institutions rather than from earlier university colleges, a number of other institutions that had not been university colleges promoted directly to university status following the [[Robbins Report]] in 1963, and the [[Open University]] founded as a distance-learning University.\n\nIn 1973 the University College at Buckingham was established as a private sector, non-profit college, opening in 1976. It awarded \"licences\" that were externally examined in the same manner as degrees, rather than being associated with the University of London or another parent university like the earlier university colleges. In 1983 it became the UK's first private university after being granted a royal charter as the [[University of Buckingham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/about/history|publisher=University of Buckingham|title=History of the University|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Since 1992===\nA major change to UK higher education occurred in 1992 with the abolition of the \"binary divide\" between universities and [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnics]]. By the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]], the polytechnics and the Scottish central institutions all became universities. These [[New university|new or post-1992]] institutions nearly doubled the number of universities in the UK.\n\nIn 1993 the University of London underwent a major shake-up, with the larger colleges being granted direct access to government funding and the right to confer University of London degrees themselves. This was a major step towards their being recognised generally as ''de facto'' universities.\n\nIn 1997, Cardiff University (then the University of Wales, Cardiff) was granted degree awarding powers. This was the first time such powers had been granted to a constituent institution of a university (although the University of Wales, Lampeter held degree awarding powers, these were granted prior to it joining the federal university). Over the next decade, all of the constituent institutions of the University of Wales and many of those of the University of London gained their own degree awarding powers.\n\nIn 2005, Cardiff University left the University of Wales, which shifted to a confederal structure in 2007 before being essentially dissolved following a series of scandals in 2011. In 2007 Imperial College left the University of London, raising fears about the future of that federal institution. However, it has survived and attracted new members, although many of the larger colleges now award their own degrees. In 2016, [[City University, London|City University]], London was the first institute to voluntarily surrender university status when it became a college of the University of London.\n\nIn 2018, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that hundreds of academics has been accused of bullying students and colleagues, leading to calls from [[Venki Ramakrishnan]], president of the [[Royal Society]], for an overhaul of workplace practices in universities and from [[Fiona Watt]], chair of the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]], for an annual national audit of bullying incidents.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/sep/28/academics-uk-universities-accused-bullying-students-colleagues Hundreds of academics at top UK universities accused of bullying] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\n===University funding from 1945===\nIn the years following the end of the Second World War, [[local education authority|local education authorities]] (LEAs) paid student tuition fees and provided non-mature{{clarify|date=May 2014}} students with a maintenance grant. Under the [[Education Act 1962]] a national mandatory award of student maintenance grant was established, payable by the LEAs to students on most full-time courses. In 1980, the level of grant increased from \u00a3380 to \u00a31,430.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8057871/Grants-loans-and-tuition-fees-a-timeline-of-how-university-funding-has-evolved.html|title=Grants, loans and tuition fees: a timeline of how university funding has evolved}}</ref>\n\nAs the university population rose during the 1980s the sums paid to universities became linked to their performance and efficiency, and by the mid-1990s funding per student had dropped by 40% since the mid-1970s, while numbers of full-time students had reached around 2,000,000 (around a third of the age group), up from around 1,300,000.\n\nIn 1989 the levels of maintenance grants were frozen at \u00a32,265 \u2013 which since 1985 had been [[means tested]] \u2013 but a system of [[student loans in the United Kingdom|student loan]]s was introduced to provide for additional funding. Initially loans of up to \u00a3420 were available, and could be taken out by all students.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> The costs of tuition continued to be met in full for all domestic{{clarify|date=February 2016}} students.\n\nFollowing an investigation into the future of universities, the July 1997 report of the [[National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/ |title=Welcome to this site |publisher=University of Leeds |accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> chaired by the then [[Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing|Sir Ronald (later Lord) Dearing]] recommended the ending of universal free higher education, and that students should pay \u00a31,000 towards the cost of their tuition fees, which would be recovered in the form of a graduate tax.\n\nTuition fees were introduced in 1998, raised to  \u00a33,000 a year in 2006, and passed \u00a39,000 a year by 2012.<ref>Vikki Boliver, \"How fair is access to more prestigious UK universities?.\" ''British journal of sociology'' 64#2 (2013): 344\u2013364.</ref> At the time of the Dearing Report, tuition fees were still paid in full by the local education authorities, student grants of up to \u00a31,755 (\u00a32,160 in London) were linked to family income, and a subsidised student loan of \u00a31,685 (\u00a32,085 in London) was available. Instead of following Dearing's suggestions, the grant was replaced by the present loan scheme, introduced for students starting in 1998. There was a transition year when about half the previous means-tested grant was available, though they still had to pay the new \u00a31,000 tuition fee. From 1999, the grant was abolished altogether.\n\nThe abolition of tuition fees was a major issue in the 1999 Scottish parliamentary elections, and subsequently was part of the agreement that led to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]/[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] coalition that governed Scotland from 1999 to 2003.\n\nFrom the academic year 2006/7, a new system of tuition fees was introduced in England. These [[top-up fees|variable tuition fees]] of up to \u00a33,000 per year are paid up-front as previously, but new student loans are available that may only be used to pay for tuition fees, and must be repaid after graduation, in addition to the existing loan. In fact, there is very little variation in the tuition fees charged by universities\u2014nearly all charge the maximum tuition fee on all courses. Instead, the differences appear in the nature and value of various 'access' bursaries that are on offer.   There has been considerable debate since the 1980s about the tendency toward vocationalism and the decline in the humanities, as well as a growing mindset among senior administrators that is preoccupied with marketing and corporate-like measures of \"success.\"<ref>Sharon Gewirtz and Alan Cribb, \"Representing 30 years of higher education change: UK universities and the Times Higher.\" ''Journal of Educational Administration and History'' 45.1 (2013): 58\u201383.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the government voted to raise the amount universities can charge for undergraduate tuition fees (for England only) to between \u00a36,000 \u2013 \u00a39,000 per year though most charge the maximum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11483638|title=Q&A: Tuition fees|publisher=BBC}}</ref> In 2016, the government raised the cap on tuition fees to \u00a39,250 from 2017, with tuition fees expected to continue rising in increments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36322654/heres-why-university-tuition-fees-will-probably-go-up-in-2017|title=Here's why university tuition fees will probably go up in 2017 \u2013 BBC Newsbeat|date=18 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38406733|title=Tuition fee rise 'sneaked out' on website|first=Sean|last=Coughlan|date=22 December 2016|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n{{seealso|UK enterprise law}}\n{{Clist universities}}\nUniversities in the United Kingdom do not have a coherent system of funding or governance, and both remain heavily debated.<ref>See D Farrington and D Palfreyman, ''The Law of Higher Education'' (2nd edn 2012) chs 4-5, and ch 12</ref> A growing body of other legal rights, for instance, for staff in reasonable expectations of fair procedure, or for students in fairness over the awarding of degrees, has grown through [[judicial review]].\n\n===Degree awarding powers and university title===\n\nBoth degree awarding powers and university title are controlled under UK law, and it is illegal for an institution to call itself a university or to purport to offer UK degrees without authorisation.<ref name=\"fake unis\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Lords/2016-11-22/HL3416/|title=Universities:Written question - HL3416|website=parliament.uk|date=10 December 2016}}</ref> Higher education is a devolved power, so the rules for degree awarding powers and university title differ between the four countries of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland the last UK national standards (from 1999) still apply. Institutions may hold taught degree awarding powers, allowing them to award ordinary and honours bachelor's degrees and taught master's degrees, and research degree awarding powers, allowing them additionally to award master's degrees by research and doctoral degrees. Institutions with taught degree powers may be awarded the title of \"university college\", but for university title an institution must hold research degree awarding powers, as well as having over 4,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) students, with over 3,000 on degree -level courses and at least 500 higher education students in each of five broad subject areas. For both degree awarding powers and university title, the final decision is made by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on the advice of the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]] (QAA).<ref name=\"UK degrees\">{{cite web|url=http://qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/guidance/right-to-award-degrees.pdf?sfvrsn=4a2f781_4|title=THE RIGHT TO AWARD UK DEGREES|date=1 January 2016|publisher=QAA|pages=2\u20133|accessdate=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722070118/http://qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/guidance/right-to-award-degrees.pdf?sfvrsn=4a2f781_4|archive-date=22 July 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/27676/|title=Degree awarding powers and university title in Scotland: guidance and criteria for applicants|date=September 2016|publisher=QAA|via=[[UCL Institute of Education]] Digital Education Resource Archive|accessdate=21 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe rules in England and Wales diverged from those in Scotland and Northern Ireland in 2004 and were further modified in 2010 with the introduction of foundation degree awarding powers for further education colleges. Under these regulations, which remain in force in Wales, while taught and research degree awarding powers are awarded indefinitely to institutions in the publicly funded higher education sector, they are time limited to six years for other institutions (e.g. private colleges and universities) after which they must be renewed. The rules for university title allowed institutions holding only taught degree awarding powers to become universities in England and Wales from 2004, and the requirement for minimum student numbers across five broad subject areas was dropped. The overall higher education FTE student number criterion remained at 4,000, with 3,000 on degree-level courses (clarified to include foundation degrees, which has been introduced since the 1999 regulations). The final award of degree awarding powers continued to rest with the Privy Council; for university title it lay with the Privy Council for publicly funded institutions while alternative providers had to get permission to use ''University'' in their name under the [[Companies Act 2006]], the recommendation in both cases coming from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) via the relevant government department (in England) or from the Welsh Government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gov.wales/topics/educationandskills/publications/guidance/grant-of-degree-awarding-powers/?lang=en|title=Applications for the grant of Degree Awarding Powers: guidance and criteria for applicants in Wales|date=7 February 2017|accessdate=22 July 2018|publisher=[[Welsh Government]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/11933/|publisher=[[Department for Business Innovation and Skills]]|via=[[UCL Institute of Education]] Digital Education Resource Archive|accessdate=22 July 2018|title=APPLICATIONS FOR THE GRANT OF TAUGHT DEGREE AWARDING POWERS, RESEARCH DEGREE AWARDING POWERS AND UNIVERSITY TITLE|date= August 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"DAP factsheet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/584734/Factsheet_on_Degree_Awarding_Powers_and_University_Title.pdf|title=Higher Education and Research Bill: Factsheet on Degree Awarding Powers and University Title|date=January 2017|accessdate=22 July 2018|publisher=[[Department for Education]]}}</ref>\n\nEngland diverged from Wales in 2012 with a reduction in the number of higher education FTE students needed for university title to 1,000 (750 on degree level courses), with the addition that at least 55% of total FTE students had to be on higher education courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guildhe.ac.uk/blog/university-whats-in-a-title/|title=University: What's in a Title?|publisher=[[GuildHE]]|author=Alex Bols|date=15 February 2016|accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref> There were further technical changes in 2015 before a complete overhaul of the system in England under the [[Higher Education and Research Act 2017]]. This saw the abolition of HEFCE and its replacement by the [[Office for Students]] (OfS). A new tier of degree awarding powers \u2013 bachelor's degree awarding powers, allowing the award of degrees up to level 6 on the [[National qualifications frameworks in the United Kingdom|Framework for Higher Education Qualifications]] \u2013 was introduced. \n\nUnder this act, degree awarding powers were made available on a probationary basis, termed \"New DAPs\" to providers without a track record in higher education, who had previously had to have a validation agreement with a recognised body to establish a track record prior to gaining their own powers. Providers with a track record of the years or more can apply for time-limited \"Full DAPs\" and those who have held time-limited date awarding powers for more than three years can apply for \"Indefinite DAPs\". Another change is that degree awarding powers can now be limited to some subjects rather than covering all possible degrees at that level as previously. There is also an intention to make it possible for institute to gain research degree awarding powers without taught degree awarding powers. New criteria for university title will apply for applications from April 2019, the government had started its intention that student numbers limits will be removed  but that the criterion that 55 percent of students are on higher education courses will remain, and that providers with bachelor's degree awarding powers and single subject degree awarding powers will be eligible for university title. The OfS will take over the responsibility of granting degree awarding powers and university title from the Privy Council, and will also be responsible for the awarding of university title to institutions outside of the publicly-funded higher education sector.

Assessors are appointed by the local authority, chancellor, general council and ''senatus academicus''. Also there are student members, employee representatives and co-opted lay members. For instance, [[Aberdeen University]] has up to a 22 person \"court\", with an elected rector and a person she or he chooses, a principal plus one she or he chooses, a vice-principal (five members), two members appointed by the local councils, four members appointed by the General Council, six members from the Senatus Academicus, and up to five co-opted members.<ref>[[Universities (Scotland) Act 1966]] [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1966/13/schedule/1 Sch 1, part 3]</ref>\n\nIn England and Wales, the pattern is more haphazard and often deficient in representation.

The form and objectives of the corporation are laid down in the individual charter and statutes, but commonly all graduates are members of the university. Many London colleges were also incorporated by this route. At the ancient Scottish universities the corporation is formed, under the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, by the university court rather than the graduates.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/52-53/55/section/5|title=Universities (Scotland) Act 1889|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref> A chartered corporation may not change its statutes without the approval of the [[Privy Council]].\n\n[[Newcastle University]] is the only English university to be purely a [[statutory corporation]], and the only \"old\" university not incorporated by royal charter, having been created by the Universities of Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne Act 1963.

This makes them both chartered and statutory corporations.<ref name=HELaw/>\n\nAt Oxford and Cambridge, incorporated by a public Act of Parliament in 1571, only graduates who have proceeded to the academic rank of [[Oxbridge MA|MA]] are members of the university. Their statues are made under Acts of Parliament, thus they are also considered statutory corporations for some purposes.<ref name=HELaw/>\n\nMost new universities are Higher Education Corporations, a form of corporation created by the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] to incorporate the polytechnics independently of their local councils. In a higher education corporation, only the governing board is incorporated, not the graduates. Some newer London colleges share this status. Some new universities are [[company limited by guarantee|companies limited by guarantee]], a common form of incorporation used ''inter alia'' for some charities. The [[London School of Economics]] is also incorporated in this manner. The [[University of Chester]] and [[Bishop Grosseteste University]] are both unincorporated [[charitable trust|trusts]] within the [[Church of England]]. This was also the original form of [[Durham University]] (at that time also a church university) between its foundation in 1832 and its incorporation by royal charter in 1837.\n\nUnder the [[Education Reform Act 1988]], higher education providers will be either ''recognised bodies'' or ''listed bodies''.

There have also been a number of mergers between colleges of the University of London, of particular note is the merger of Royal Holloway College and Bedford College in 1985 by Act of Parliament.\n\n[[Cardiff University]] merged with the [[University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology]] in 1984, and then re-merged with the [[University of Wales College of Medicine]] in 2004, the two having previously been separated in the 1930s.\n\nAlso in 2004, the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] and the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]] merged to form the [[University of Manchester]].\n\nIn 2002, [[London Guildhall University]] and the [[University of North London]] merged to form [[London Metropolitan University]].<ref name=\"LonMet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/why-london-met/about-the-university/160-years-of-london-met/|title=160 years of London Met|publisher=London Metropolitan University}}</ref>\n\nAt around the same time a merger was proposed between [[Imperial College London]] and [[University College London]], but was abandoned following protests.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/london-merger-why-the-professors-said-no-133814.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|title=London merger: Why the professors said 'no'|author=Lucy Hodges|date=20 November 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a merger was proposed between two universities in [[Scotland]]: [[University of Abertay Dundee]] and [[University of Dundee]].

Legally this was a takeover rather than a merger as UWTSD remains incorporated under Lampeter's 1828 charter.\n\nAlso in Wales, the [[University of South Wales]] was formed in 2013 by a merger of the [[University of Glamorgan]] and the [[University of Wales, Newport]]. The [[University of Wales Institute Cardiff]] declined to take part in the merger, becoming [[Cardiff Metropolitan University]].\n\n==Categorisation==\nUK universities can be categorised in a number of different ways. Historically, they have frequently been categorised based on age and location, while some more recent categorisations have used statistical techniques such as [[cluster analysis]].\n===Categorisation by age and location===\nOne of the earliest attempts to categorise British universities was by George Edwin Maclean in a 1917 report for the US Department of the Interior.<ref name=MacLean>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r3RItwoRfZ0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Studies in Higher Education in England and Scotland|author=George Edwin Maclean|publisher=[[Department of the Interior]], Bureau of Education|date=1917}}</ref> This split the universities into five groups based on age and location: ancient universities of England, Scottish universities, the University of London, the \"new or provincial universities\", and the university colleges (Maclean's report only covered England and Scotland, Wales and Ireland were omitted).\n\nIn the early 1950s the [[University Grants Committee (UK)|University Grants Committee]] (UGC) divided British universities by age into five groups by age and location.

Most universities in the United Kingdom provide (or at least help organise) rented accommodation for many of their students, particularly in the first year; some British universities provide accommodation for the full duration of their courses. As a result, the lifestyle of university students in the United Kingdom can be quite different from those of European universities where the majority of students live at home with their parents. The introduction of university fees paid by students from 2006 onwards has led many English and Welsh students to apply to institutions closer to their family's homes to reduce the additional costs of moving and living farther away.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe [[University of London]] from its reform in 1900,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vyPiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=University of London, the Historical Record: (1836\u20131912) Being a Supplement to the Calendar, Completed to September 1912.

They have a central governing body with overall responsibility for the maintenance of standards at the constituent colleges. Recently, however, there has been considerable pressure from the larger colleges to become more autonomous and, in some cases, completely independent institutions. Examples of this were the secession of [[Imperial College London]] from the [[University of London]] and [[Cardiff University]] leaving the [[University of Wales]].

It also found that there is a wide variation in graduate earnings within subjects, even between graduates with the same degree from the same institution.

They argue that the graduate premium has been diluted by the large number of graduates, in particular those with non-vocational degrees from non-elite institutions. Making matters worse, employers have responded to the oversupply of graduates by raising the academic requirements of many occupations [[credentialism and educational inflation|higher than is really necessary to perform the work]]. The study concludes by asking \"why bother to study at any other than the top few institutions when a lifetime of debt will be the almost certain consequence? What then of the public good of having a huge range of purely academic courses on offer?\" The paper then issued a warning that the proposed deregulation of higher education could result in the growth of low-quality for-profit education as in the US.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.if.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Graduate_Premium_final.compressed.pdf\n | title =The Graduate Premium: Manna, Myth, or Plain Mis-selling?\n | last =Kemp-King\n | first =Stephen\n | date =August 2016\n | publisher =Intergenerational Foundation\n | access-date =22 September 2016\n | quote =The UK now finds itself with more over-qualified workers than any OECD country other than Japan, with graduates under increasing pressure to undertake further post-graduate study \u2013 MAs/MScs \u2013 in order to further set themselves apart from their peers, thereby incurring yet more debt. }}</ref> Further study of the graduate premium by HESA and Warwick University shows that, while graduates born in 1970 earned 19% more than their non-graduate peers, the premium has fallen to 11% for graduates born in 1990.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/22-10-2019/return-to-degree-research\n | title =New research shows reduction in the 'graduate premium'\n | last =Nathwani\n | first =Tej\n | date =22 October 2019\n | website =HESA\n | access-date =25 October 2019\n | quote =The change in the percentage by which the hourly pay of graduates exceeds that of non-graduates mainly impacted on those born after 1987.}}</ref>\n\nA 2017 study by the [[Department for Education]] found that the [[median]] annual earnings of university graduates, five years into their careers, ranged from \u00a320,000 in the creative arts and design to \u00a347,000 in medicine and dentistry.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-higher-education-graduate-employment-and-earnings\n | title =Statistics: higher education graduate employment and earnings\n | date =13 June 2017\n | website =\n | publisher =Department of Education\n | access-date =23 September 2017\n | quote =Experimental statistics on longitudinal education outcomes showing university graduate earnings and employment. }}</ref>\n\nA 2017 study by the [[Office for National Statistics]] found that, although university graduates are consistently more likely to be employed than non-graduates, they are increasingly likely to be [[Overqualification|overqualified]] for the jobs which they do hold.
