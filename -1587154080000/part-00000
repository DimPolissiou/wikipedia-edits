Its southern terminus is located at the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] south of the town of [[Vestal, New York|Vestal]] in [[Broome County, New York|Broome County]], where it becomes [[Pennsylvania Route&nbsp;267]] (PA&nbsp;267). Its northern terminus is located at a junction with [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] in the village of [[Alexandria Bay, New York|Alexandria Bay]] in [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]]. NY&nbsp;26 serves three cities along its routing; one directly ([[Rome, New York|Rome]]) and two via other roadways ([[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] via [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania\u2013New York)|Interstate 86]] (I-86) and [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]], and [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]] via [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]]). NY&nbsp;26 also intersects several other primary routes including [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] in [[Barker, Broome County, New York|Barker]], an overlap with [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route 20]] (US&nbsp;20) in [[Madison, New York|Madison]], [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] in [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville]], and an overlap with [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] in [[Philadelphia, New York|Philadelphia]].\n\nNY&nbsp;26, as a single route, was established in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]]; however, portions of the route had been signed state routes since the 1920s. Since 1930, the route has been realigned several times in the [[North Country (New York)|North Country]], resulting in a modern routing significantly different from its initial alignment. For a brief period during the 1970s, NY&nbsp;26 ended in [[Carthage, New York|Carthage]]. The truncation directly led to the elimination of one of NY&nbsp;26's two spur routes, and the second was absorbed by other routes shortly afterward.\n\n==Route description==\nMost of NY&nbsp;26 is maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT); however, two locally maintained sections exist in [[Madison County, New York|Madison]] and [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida]] counties. In Madison County, the route is county-maintained from [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] to [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20), where it [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s with the [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] County Route&nbsp;79 (CR&nbsp;79).

It serves mostly rural areas for its first {{convert|6|mi}} before entering a larger valley encompassing the [[Susquehanna River]]. Here, the route widens to four lanes as it enters the densely populated town center of Vestal and connects to [[New York State Route 434|NY&nbsp;434]] by way of a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]]. NY&nbsp;26 continues northward, meeting [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] (Future [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania-New York)|Interstate 86]] {I-86}) at a nearby full [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]] on its way to a bridge over the Susquehanna River and the village of [[Endicott, New York|Endicott]] on the north bank.

At Nanticoke Avenue, NY&nbsp;26 turns to the north, following the street through the community's northern residential neighborhoods. Outside of Endicott, the homes give way to significantly less developed areas as the highway runs through the Nanticoke Creek valley. After {{convert|4|mi}}, the route reaches the small [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Union Center, where [[New York State Route 38#Suffixed routes|NY&nbsp;38B]] leaves to the northwest toward its parent route, [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]]. Past Union Center, NY&nbsp;26 slowly turns to the northeast as it traverses the town of [[Maine, New York|Maine]], following Nanticoke Creek as it runs through the town center. The waterway splits into two branches just past the hamlet of Maine, and NY&nbsp;26 stays with the creek's east branch as the route crosses rural parts of the towns of [[Nanticoke, New York|Nanticoke]] and [[Lisle, New York|Lisle]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nIn Lisle, Nanticoke Creek's east branch leads NY&nbsp;26 into the [[Tioughnioga River]] valley, where the route connects to [[Interstate 81 in New York|Interstate&nbsp;81]] (I-81) by way of a partial [[diamond interchange]] just outside the village of [[Whitney Point, New York|Whitney Point]] in the adjacent town of [[Triangle, New York|Triangle]]. The highway continues into the community, becoming concurrent with [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] for a single block to reach Whitney Point's main intersection. Here, NY&nbsp;26 splits from US&nbsp;11 but joins [[New York State Route 79|NY&nbsp;79]] in order to cross the Tioughnioga River. The overlap ends at a junction on the east bank, where NY&nbsp;79 heads south along the river and [[New York State Route 206|NY&nbsp;206]] begins straight ahead to the east. NY&nbsp;26, meanwhile, follows the nearby [[Otselic River]] and its surrounding gully as it runs northeastward toward the [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland County]] line. Along the way, the highway runs along the east side of Whitney Point Reservoir and serves Dorchester Park, a recreation area overlooking the spillway.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===Cortland and Chenango counties===\n[[File:NY 26 in Whitney Point.JPG|thumb|NY&nbsp;26 heading northbound from NY&nbsp;79 and NY&nbsp;206 in Whitney Point]]\nA rural {{convert|10|mi|sing=on}} stretch brings NY&nbsp;26 to the riverside hamlet of [[Willet, New York|Willet]], based around the route's intersection with [[New York State Route 41|NY&nbsp;41]]. The junction marks the start of a {{convert|3|mi|0|adj=on}} concurrency that runs into the nearby town of [[Cincinnatus, New York|Cincinnatus]]. NY&nbsp;26 and Route&nbsp;41 intersect with [[New York State Route 221|NY&nbsp;221]] just to the west of Willet before splitting southwest of the hamlet of Cincinnatus. The next intersection along the road serves as the west end of [[New York State Route 23|NY&nbsp;23]], which heads eastward into [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango County]]. From here, NY&nbsp;26 runs generally northeastward to the hamlet of [[Taylor, New York|Taylor]], where it turns to the east at a crossroad just north of the community's center. The track of the route becomes more northeastward as it crosses into Chenango County.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nIn Chenango County, NY&nbsp;26 serves only a handful of isolated hamlets scattered across the undeveloped Otselic River valley. About {{convert|7|mi}} from Taylor, the route reaches the hamlet of South Otselic, home to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]-listed [[South Otselic Historic District]] and the [[Holden B. Mathewson House]]. Another 7&nbsp;miles brings the route to the hamlet of Otselic, where NY&nbsp;26 intersects the east\u2013west [[New York State Route 80|NY&nbsp;80]] on the opposite side of the river from the community. NY&nbsp;80 turns northward at this point, following NY&nbsp;26 as the road bends northwestward along the riverbank into [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===Madison and Oneida counties===\n[[File:NY 26 at US 20.jpg|thumb|left|NY&nbsp;26 northbound approaching US&nbsp;20]]\nThe overlap extends for {{convert|2.5|mi}} into Madison County to the hamlet of [[Georgetown, New York|Georgetown]], where NY&nbsp;80 forks to the northwest into a narrow creek valley. NY&nbsp;26, meanwhile, runs northeast from Georgetown through the Otselic River valley, which begins to narrow as the river approaches its [[river source|source]] in the northern part of the town. While the river tapers off, NY&nbsp;26 climbs slightly in elevation to wind its way northeastward around a series of mountains and hills. The road descends into a narrow creek valley at West Eaton, and the highway proceeds east along Eaton Brook to the hamlet of [[Eaton, New York|Eaton]] on the [[Chenango River]]. The stream ends here, leaving the route to traverse another set of mountains to reach a low-lying, marshy area near [[Bouckville, New York|Bouckville]]. Here, NY&nbsp;26 crosses [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] ahead of a junction with [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. NY&nbsp;26 turns east at the junction, following US&nbsp;20 through Bouckville toward the [[Madison (village), New York|village of Madison]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nUS&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;26 pick up [[New York State Route 12B|NY&nbsp;12B]] at a junction east of Bouckville, and all three routes run east\u2013west through Madison as Main Street. The brief stretch of homes and businesses along Main Street quickly fades outside the village limits, and NY&nbsp;12B and NY&nbsp;26 leave US&nbsp;20 soon afterward. While US&nbsp;20 continues to the east, NY&nbsp;12B and NY&nbsp;26 proceed northeast into [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] and the village of [[Oriskany Falls, New York|Oriskany Falls]] on the county's southern edge. The routes head along Madison Street to the community's central business district, where NY&nbsp;26 doubles back to the southwest on Main Street. It continues on this track to the western fringe of the village, where it returns to a northwesterly track and heads for less developed parts of the town of [[Augusta, New York|Augusta]]. The route goes across rolling farmland for several miles before entering the town of [[Vernon, New York|Vernon]] and its hamlet of Vernon Center, where [[New York State Route 31|NY&nbsp;31]] terminates at a [[traffic circle]] in the center of the community.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nAbout {{convert|1|mi}} north of Vernon Center, NY&nbsp;26 intersects [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] at a rural junction {{convert|2|mi}} east of the [[Vernon (village), New York|village of Vernon]]. From here, NY&nbsp;26 traverses more open farmland, crossing over the [[New York State Thruway]] in [[Westmoreland, New York|Westmoreland]] before entering the outer district of the city of [[Rome, New York|Rome]]. The route passes the Oneida and Mohawk correctional facilities just ahead of a junction with [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]], a four-lane [[divided highway]]. NY&nbsp;26 turns east here, overlapping with NY&nbsp;365 for just under {{convert|2|mi}} to a [[directional T interchange]] with [[New York State Route 49|NY&nbsp;49]] and [[New York State Route 69|NY&nbsp;69]]. While NY&nbsp;365 continues northeastward around the perimeter of downtown Rome, NY&nbsp;26 exits the highway and immediately begins an overlap with both NY&nbsp;49 and NY&nbsp;69. The three routes head north on the four-lane East Erie Boulevard, passing a handful of industrial warehouses before crossing over [[CSX Transportation]]'s [[Mohawk Subdivision]] rail line and the [[Erie Canal]] on their way into downtown.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:NY Route 46, 49 and 69.jpg|thumb|left|NY 69 and NY 49 approaching the end of the overlap with NY 46 and NY 26]]\nThe highway runs through a commercial strip for several blocks to an intersection with Black River Boulevard and NY&nbsp;46. While NY&nbsp;46 southbound joins NY&nbsp;49 and NY&nbsp;69 to the northwest, NY&nbsp;26 turns northeast to overlap with NY&nbsp;46 northbound along the four-lane Black River Boulevard, passing along the southeastern edge of the [[Fort Stanwix National Monument]]. The overlap continues for several commercial and residential blocks to East Bloomfield Street, at which point NY&nbsp;26 turns northward to follow the two-lane East Bloomfield and Turin streets across the mostly residential northern part of the city. The homes become more sporadic as the highway leaves Rome for the town of [[Lee, New York|Lee]], home to several hamlets along the west side of [[Delta Lake (New York)|Delta Lake]]. North of the reservoir, the route crosses gradually less developed and more open areas as it crosses into [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis County]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===Lewis and Jefferson counties===\n[[File:NY 294 and NY 26 in West Leyden.jpg|right|thumb|NY&nbsp;26 at an intersection with NY&nbsp;294 in West Leyden]]\nJust across the county line in the town of [[Lewis, Lewis County, New York|Lewis]], NY&nbsp;26 enters the hamlet of West Leyden, built up around the route's junction with the west end of [[New York State Route 294|NY&nbsp;294]]. From West Leyden, the highway heads generally northeastward across another prolonged stretch of farmland, briefly entering the [[Constableville, New York|Constableville]] village limits and passing over the Sugar River on its way to an intersection with [[New York State Route 12D|NY&nbsp;12D]]. The straight path to the northeast continues as part of NY&nbsp;12D while NY&nbsp;26 turns northwestward onto NY&nbsp;12D's right of way, following the eastern edge of [[Tug Hill]] into the town of [[Turin, New York|Turin]]. NY&nbsp;26 passes through several hamlets and the [[Turin (village), New York|village of Turin]] in the towns of Turin and [[Martinsburg, New York|Martinsburg]] before entering the town of [[Lowville, New York|Lowville]], where the route connects to [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] in the southernmost part of the [[Lowville (village), New York|village of Lowville]]. NY&nbsp;12 merges with NY&nbsp;26 here, and the two routes follow South State Street into the community's central business district. Here, NY&nbsp;12 and NY&nbsp;26 meet [[New York State Route 812|NY&nbsp;812]] at a four-way junction with Dayan Street and Shady Avenue.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nWhile NY&nbsp;12 turns west to follow Dayan Street, NY&nbsp;26 continues northwest on North State Street, overlapping with NY&nbsp;812 for several blocks before the latter route splits off to the northeast on Bostwick Street. The business and homes of Lowville lead to much less developed areas at the northern village line, and NY&nbsp;26 traverses little more than open, rolling fields for the next {{convert|5|mi}}. Just north of the Lowville town line in [[Denmark, New York|Denmark]], the highway meets [[New York State Route 410|NY&nbsp;410]], a short connector serving the village of [[Castorland, New York|Castorland]]. Another {{convert|6|mi|sing=on}} stretch of mostly undeveloped fields brings the route across the Deer River and into [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]], the last on NY&nbsp;26's {{convert|200|mi|sing=on}} route. The highway immediately enters the village of [[West Carthage, New York|West Carthage]], where it briefly becomes concurrent with [[New York State Route 126|NY&nbsp;126]] through the sparsely populated western part of the community.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:US Route 11 - New York at NY 26 Philadelphia NY.jpg|thumb|left|NY&nbsp;26 southbound at south end of overlap with US&nbsp;11 in town of Philadelphia]]\nPast West Carthage, the route loosely follows the [[Black River (New York)|Black River]] across rolling farmland in the town of [[Champion, New York|Champion]] to reach the hamlet of [[Great Bend, New York|Great Bend]], located across the Black River from the grounds of [[Fort Drum]]. Here, NY&nbsp;26 meets [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]] before crossing the river and entering Fort Drum. The route runs northwestward across the military reservation to the town of [[Le Ray, New York|Le Ray]], home to an intersection with US&nbsp;11 just outside the [[Evans Mills, New York|Evans Mills]] village limits. NY&nbsp;26 joins US&nbsp;11 here for the second time, following the Indian River northeast across generally rural areas to reach the [[Philadelphia (village), New York|village of Philadelphia]]. The conjoined routes cross the river before splitting in the center of the community. At this point, NY&nbsp;26 returns to a northwesterly alignment as it traverses rolling farmland for {{convert|6|mi}} to access the [[Theresa (village), New York|village of Theresa]]. Named Mill Street, the route crosses the Indian River again before changing names to Commercial Street and gradually curving to the southwest.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:NY 12 at NY 26's northern terminus.jpg|thumb|right|NY&nbsp;12 northbound at NY&nbsp;26's northern terminus]]\nNY&nbsp;26 soon enters Theresa's central business district, where it turns northwest onto Main Street.

At the north end of the overlap, NY&nbsp;26 splits to the northwest toward the town of [[Alexandria, New York|Alexandria]], where it meets [[County Route 192 (Jefferson County, New York)|CR&nbsp;192]]<ref name=\"google\" /> at a junction that was once the western terminus of [[New York State Route 26B|NY&nbsp;26B]], one of two spur routes of NY&nbsp;26 that no longer exist.<ref name=\"1974map\">{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil Company]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company |year=1974}}</ref> From CR&nbsp;192, NY&nbsp;26 continues northwest across rolling farmland to the village of [[Alexandria Bay, New York|Alexandria Bay]], where the route ends at a junction with NY&nbsp;12 several blocks south of the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nIn 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] created a statewide system of unsigned [[legislative route]]s.

At this point, Route&nbsp;27 proceeded northeast to [[Carthage, New York|Carthage]] on modern [[New York State Route 126|NY&nbsp;126]] and west to [[Watertown (city), New York|Watertown]] on current [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]].

Its southern terminus is located at the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] south of the town of [[Vestal, New York|Vestal]] in [[Broome County, New York|Broome County]], where it becomes [[Pennsylvania Route&nbsp;267]] (PA&nbsp;267). Its northern terminus is located at a junction with [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] in the village of [[Alexandria Bay, New York|Alexandria Bay]] in [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]]. NY&nbsp;26 serves three cities along its routing; one directly ([[Rome, New York|Rome]]) and two via other roadways ([[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] via [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania\u2013New York)|Interstate 86]] (I-86) and [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]], and [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]] via [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]]). NY&nbsp;26 also intersects several other primary routes including [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] in [[Barker, Broome County, New York|Barker]], an overlap with [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route 20]] (US&nbsp;20) in [[Madison, New York|Madison]], [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] in [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville]], and an overlap with [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] in [[Philadelphia, New York|Philadelphia]].\n\nNY&nbsp;26, as a single route, was established in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]]; however, portions of the route had been signed state routes since the 1920s. Since 1930, the route has been realigned several times in the [[North Country (New York)|North Country]], resulting in a modern routing significantly different from its initial alignment. For a brief period during the 1970s, NY&nbsp;26 ended in [[Carthage, New York|Carthage]]. The truncation directly led to the elimination of one of NY&nbsp;26's two spur routes, and the second was absorbed by other routes shortly afterward.\n\n==Route description==\nMost of NY&nbsp;26 is maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT); however, two locally maintained sections exist in [[Madison County, New York|Madison]] and [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida]] counties. In Madison County, the route is county-maintained from [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] to [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20), where it [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s with the [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] County Route&nbsp;79 (CR&nbsp;79). In the Oneida County city of [[Rome, New York|Rome]], NY&nbsp;26 is city-maintained from the north end of its overlap with NY&nbsp;46 to the northern boundary of the city's inner district.<ref name=\"inv-madison\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_madison.csv |title=Madison County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"inv-oneida\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_oneida.csv |title=Oneida County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Broome County===\nNY&nbsp;26 begins at the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] in [[Vestal, New York|Vestal]], where it connects to [[Pennsylvania Route 267|PA&nbsp;267]]. The road heads northward through Vestal as a two-lane highway, passing Wildcat Hill and Pierson Hill as it runs along the base of a valley surrounding Choconut Creek. It serves mostly rural areas for its first {{convert|6|mi}} before entering a larger valley encompassing the [[Susquehanna River]]. Here, the route widens to four lanes as it enters the densely populated town center of Vestal and connects to [[New York State Route 434|NY&nbsp;434]] by way of a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]]. NY&nbsp;26 continues northward, meeting [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] (Future [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania-New York)|Interstate 86]] {I-86}) at a nearby full [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]] on its way to a bridge over the Susquehanna River and the village of [[Endicott, New York|Endicott]] on the north bank.

At Nanticoke Avenue, NY&nbsp;26 turns to the north, following the street through the community's northern residential neighborhoods. Outside of Endicott, the homes give way to significantly less developed areas as the highway runs through the Nanticoke Creek valley. After {{convert|4|mi}}, the route reaches the small [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Union Center, where [[New York State Route 38#Suffixed routes|NY&nbsp;38B]] leaves to the northwest toward its parent route, [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]]. Past Union Center, NY&nbsp;26 slowly turns to the northeast as it traverses the town of [[Maine, New York|Maine]], following Nanticoke Creek as it runs through the town center. The waterway splits into two branches just past the hamlet of Maine, and NY&nbsp;26 stays with the creek's east branch as the route crosses rural parts of the towns of [[Nanticoke, New York|Nanticoke]] and [[Lisle, New York|Lisle]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nIn Lisle, Nanticoke Creek's east branch leads NY&nbsp;26 into the [[Tioughnioga River]] valley, where the route connects to [[Interstate 81 in New York|Interstate&nbsp;81]] (I-81) by way of a partial [[diamond interchange]] just outside the village of [[Whitney Point, New York|Whitney Point]] in the adjacent town of [[Triangle, New York|Triangle]]. The highway continues into the community, becoming concurrent with [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] for a single block to reach Whitney Point's main intersection. Here, NY&nbsp;26 splits from US&nbsp;11 but joins [[New York State Route 79|NY&nbsp;79]] in order to cross the Tioughnioga River. The overlap ends at a junction on the east bank, where NY&nbsp;79 heads south along the river and [[New York State Route 206|NY&nbsp;206]] begins straight ahead to the east. NY&nbsp;26, meanwhile, follows the nearby [[Otselic River]] and its surrounding gully as it runs northeastward toward the [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland County]] line. Along the way, the highway runs along the east side of Whitney Point Reservoir and serves Dorchester Park, a recreation area overlooking the spillway.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===Cortland and Chenango counties===\n[[File:NY 26 in Whitney Point.JPG|thumb|NY&nbsp;26 heading northbound from NY&nbsp;79 and NY&nbsp;206 in Whitney Point]]\nA rural {{convert|10|mi|sing=on}} stretch brings NY&nbsp;26 to the riverside hamlet of [[Willet, New York|Willet]], based around the route's intersection with [[New York State Route 41|NY&nbsp;41]].

NY&nbsp;26 and Route&nbsp;41 intersect with [[New York State Route 221|NY&nbsp;221]] just to the west of Willet before splitting southwest of the hamlet of Cincinnatus. The next intersection along the road serves as the west end of [[New York State Route 23|NY&nbsp;23]], which heads eastward into [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango County]]. From here, NY&nbsp;26 runs generally northeastward to the hamlet of [[Taylor, New York|Taylor]], where it turns to the east at a crossroad just north of the community's center. The track of the route becomes more northeastward as it crosses into Chenango County.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nIn Chenango County, NY&nbsp;26 serves only a handful of isolated hamlets scattered across the undeveloped Otselic River valley. About {{convert|7|mi}} from Taylor, the route reaches the hamlet of South Otselic, home to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]-listed [[South Otselic Historic District]] and the [[Holden B. Mathewson House]]. Another 7&nbsp;miles brings the route to the hamlet of Otselic, where NY&nbsp;26 intersects the east\u2013west [[New York State Route 80|NY&nbsp;80]] on the opposite side of the river from the community. NY&nbsp;80 turns northward at this point, following NY&nbsp;26 as the road bends northwestward along the riverbank into [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===Madison and Oneida counties===\n[[File:NY 26 at US 20.jpg|thumb|left|NY&nbsp;26 northbound approaching US&nbsp;20]]\nThe overlap extends for {{convert|2.5|mi}} into Madison County to the hamlet of [[Georgetown, New York|Georgetown]], where NY&nbsp;80 forks to the northwest into a narrow creek valley. NY&nbsp;26, meanwhile, runs northeast from Georgetown through the Otselic River valley, which begins to narrow as the river approaches its [[river source|source]] in the northern part of the town. While the river tapers off, NY&nbsp;26 climbs slightly in elevation to wind its way northeastward around a series of mountains and hills. The road descends into a narrow creek valley at West Eaton, and the highway proceeds east along Eaton Brook to the hamlet of [[Eaton, New York|Eaton]] on the [[Chenango River]]. The stream ends here, leaving the route to traverse another set of mountains to reach a low-lying, marshy area near [[Bouckville, New York|Bouckville]]. Here, NY&nbsp;26 crosses [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] ahead of a junction with [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. NY&nbsp;26 turns east at the junction, following US&nbsp;20 through Bouckville toward the [[Madison (village), New York|village of Madison]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nUS&nbsp;20 and NY&nbsp;26 pick up [[New York State Route 12B|NY&nbsp;12B]] at a junction east of Bouckville, and all three routes run east\u2013west through Madison as Main Street. The brief stretch of homes and businesses along Main Street quickly fades outside the village limits, and NY&nbsp;12B and NY&nbsp;26 leave US&nbsp;20 soon afterward. While US&nbsp;20 continues to the east, NY&nbsp;12B and NY&nbsp;26 proceed northeast into [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] and the village of [[Oriskany Falls, New York|Oriskany Falls]] on the county's southern edge. The routes head along Madison Street to the community's central business district, where NY&nbsp;26 doubles back to the southwest on Main Street. It continues on this track to the western fringe of the village, where it returns to a northwesterly track and heads for less developed parts of the town of [[Augusta, New York|Augusta]]. The route goes across rolling farmland for several miles before entering the town of [[Vernon, New York|Vernon]] and its hamlet of Vernon Center, where [[New York State Route 31|NY&nbsp;31]] terminates at a [[traffic circle]] in the center of the community.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nAbout {{convert|1|mi}} north of Vernon Center, NY&nbsp;26 intersects [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] at a rural junction {{convert|2|mi}} east of the [[Vernon (village), New York|village of Vernon]]. From here, NY&nbsp;26 traverses more open farmland, crossing over the [[New York State Thruway]] in [[Westmoreland, New York|Westmoreland]] before entering the outer district of the city of [[Rome, New York|Rome]]. The route passes the Oneida and Mohawk correctional facilities just ahead of a junction with [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]], a four-lane [[divided highway]]. NY&nbsp;26 turns east here, overlapping with NY&nbsp;365 for just under {{convert|2|mi}} to a [[directional T interchange]] with [[New York State Route 49|NY&nbsp;49]] and [[New York State Route 69|NY&nbsp;69]]. While NY&nbsp;365 continues northeastward around the perimeter of downtown Rome, NY&nbsp;26 exits the highway and immediately begins an overlap with both NY&nbsp;49 and NY&nbsp;69. The three routes head north on the four-lane East Erie Boulevard, passing a handful of industrial warehouses before crossing over [[CSX Transportation]]'s [[Mohawk Subdivision]] rail line and the [[Erie Canal]] on their way into downtown.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:NY Route 46, 49 and 69.jpg|thumb|left|NY 69 and NY 49 approaching the end of the overlap with NY 46 and NY 26]]\nThe highway runs through a commercial strip for several blocks to an intersection with Black River Boulevard and NY&nbsp;46. While NY&nbsp;46 southbound joins NY&nbsp;49 and NY&nbsp;69 to the northwest, NY&nbsp;26 turns northeast to overlap with NY&nbsp;46 northbound along the four-lane Black River Boulevard, passing along the southeastern edge of the [[Fort Stanwix National Monument]]. The overlap continues for several commercial and residential blocks to East Bloomfield Street, at which point NY&nbsp;26 turns northward to follow the two-lane East Bloomfield and Turin streets across the mostly residential northern part of the city. The homes become more sporadic as the highway leaves Rome for the town of [[Lee, New York|Lee]], home to several hamlets along the west side of [[Delta Lake (New York)|Delta Lake]]. North of the reservoir, the route crosses gradually less developed and more open areas as it crosses into [[Lewis County, New York|Lewis County]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n===Lewis and Jefferson counties===\n[[File:NY 294 and NY 26 in West Leyden.jpg|right|thumb|NY&nbsp;26 at an intersection with NY&nbsp;294 in West Leyden]]\nJust across the county line in the town of [[Lewis, Lewis County, New York|Lewis]], NY&nbsp;26 enters the hamlet of West Leyden, built up around the route's junction with the west end of [[New York State Route 294|NY&nbsp;294]]. From West Leyden, the highway heads generally northeastward across another prolonged stretch of farmland, briefly entering the [[Constableville, New York|Constableville]] village limits and passing over the Sugar River on its way to an intersection with [[New York State Route 12D|NY&nbsp;12D]]. The straight path to the northeast continues as part of NY&nbsp;12D while NY&nbsp;26 turns northwestward onto NY&nbsp;12D's right of way, following the eastern edge of [[Tug Hill]] into the town of [[Turin, New York|Turin]]. NY&nbsp;26 passes through several hamlets and the [[Turin (village), New York|village of Turin]] in the towns of Turin and [[Martinsburg, New York|Martinsburg]] before entering the town of [[Lowville, New York|Lowville]], where the route connects to [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]] in the southernmost part of the [[Lowville (village), New York|village of Lowville]]. NY&nbsp;12 merges with NY&nbsp;26 here, and the two routes follow South State Street into the community's central business district. Here, NY&nbsp;12 and NY&nbsp;26 meet [[New York State Route 812|NY&nbsp;812]] at a four-way junction with Dayan Street and Shady Avenue.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nWhile NY&nbsp;12 turns west to follow Dayan Street, NY&nbsp;26 continues northwest on North State Street, overlapping with NY&nbsp;812 for several blocks before the latter route splits off to the northeast on Bostwick Street. The business and homes of Lowville lead to much less developed areas at the northern village line, and NY&nbsp;26 traverses little more than open, rolling fields for the next {{convert|5|mi}}. Just north of the Lowville town line in [[Denmark, New York|Denmark]], the highway meets [[New York State Route 410|NY&nbsp;410]], a short connector serving the village of [[Castorland, New York|Castorland]]. Another {{convert|6|mi|sing=on}} stretch of mostly undeveloped fields brings the route across the Deer River and into [[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]], the last on NY&nbsp;26's {{convert|200|mi|sing=on}} route. The highway immediately enters the village of [[West Carthage, New York|West Carthage]], where it briefly becomes concurrent with [[New York State Route 126|NY&nbsp;126]] through the sparsely populated western part of the community.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:US Route 11 - New York at NY 26 Philadelphia NY.jpg|thumb|left|NY&nbsp;26 southbound at south end of overlap with US&nbsp;11 in town of Philadelphia]]\nPast West Carthage, the route loosely follows the [[Black River (New York)|Black River]] across rolling farmland in the town of [[Champion, New York|Champion]] to reach the hamlet of [[Great Bend, New York|Great Bend]], located across the Black River from the grounds of [[Fort Drum]]. Here, NY&nbsp;26 meets [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]] before crossing the river and entering Fort Drum. The route runs northwestward across the military reservation to the town of [[Le Ray, New York|Le Ray]], home to an intersection with US&nbsp;11 just outside the [[Evans Mills, New York|Evans Mills]] village limits. NY&nbsp;26 joins US&nbsp;11 here for the second time, following the Indian River northeast across generally rural areas to reach the [[Philadelphia (village), New York|village of Philadelphia]]. The conjoined routes cross the river before splitting in the center of the community. At this point, NY&nbsp;26 returns to a northwesterly alignment as it traverses rolling farmland for {{convert|6|mi}} to access the [[Theresa (village), New York|village of Theresa]]. Named Mill Street, the route crosses the Indian River again before changing names to Commercial Street and gradually curving to the southwest.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n[[File:NY 12 at NY 26's northern terminus.jpg|thumb|right|NY&nbsp;12 northbound at NY&nbsp;26's northern terminus]]\nNY&nbsp;26 soon enters Theresa's central business district, where it turns northwest onto Main Street.

At the north end of the overlap, NY&nbsp;26 splits to the northwest toward the town of [[Alexandria, New York|Alexandria]], where it meets [[County Route 192 (Jefferson County, New York)|CR&nbsp;192]]<ref name=\"google\" /> at a junction that was once the western terminus of [[New York State Route 26B|NY&nbsp;26B]], one of two spur routes of NY&nbsp;26 that no longer exist.<ref name=\"1974map\">{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil Company]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company |year=1974}}</ref> From CR&nbsp;192, NY&nbsp;26 continues northwest across rolling farmland to the village of [[Alexandria Bay, New York|Alexandria Bay]], where the route ends at a junction with NY&nbsp;12 several blocks south of the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref name=\"google\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nIn 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] created a statewide system of unsigned [[legislative route]]s.

At this point, Route&nbsp;27 proceeded northeast to [[Carthage, New York|Carthage]] on modern [[New York State Route 126|NY&nbsp;126]] and west to [[Watertown (city), New York|Watertown]] on current [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]].

Machine guns are capable of firing long continuous bursts of fire, but at the cost of increased [[recoil]] (which decreases accuracy), and increased weight (machine guns are heavier in order to absorb the stresses of prolonged fully automatic fire). The tripod permits the operator to rest the weapon on the ground and thus the gun feels lighter to the shooter and accuracy is increased.\n\nTripods are generally restricted to heavier weapons where the weight would be an encumbrance.

They are especially necessary when slow-speed exposures are being made, or when telephoto lenses are used, as any camera shake while the shutter is open will produce a blurred image. In the same vein, they reduce [[camera shake]], and thus are instrumental in achieving maximum [[sharpness (visual)|sharpness]]. A tripod is also helpful in achieving precise framing of the image, or when more than one image is being made of the same scene, for example when bracketing the exposure. Use of a tripod may also allow for a more thoughtful approach to photography. For these reasons, a tripod of some sort is often necessary for professional photography. In relation to film/video, use of the tripod offers stability within a shot as well as certain desired heights. The use of a tripod within film/video is often a creative choice of the Director.\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Cuxhaven 67 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|right|Tripod for [[Offshore wind power|offshore]] [[wind turbines]]]]\n\nFor maximum strength and stability, as well as for easy levelling, most photographic tripods are braced around collapsible telescopic legs, with a center post that moves up and down. To further allow extension, the center post can usually extend above the meeting of three legs. At the top of the tripod is the head, which includes the camera mount (usually a detachable plate with a thumbscrew to hold the camera). The head connects to the frame by several joints, allowing the camera to [[Panning (camera)|pan]], [[tilt (cinematography)|tilt]] and [[wikt:roll|roll]]. The head usually attaches to a lever so that adjustments to the orientation can be performed more delicately. Some tripods also feature integrated remote controls for a camera, though these are usually proprietary to the company that manufactured the camera.\n\n==Surveying==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n{{main|Tripod (surveying)}}\n\nA surveyor's tripod is a device used to support any one of a number of surveying instruments, such as [[theodolite]]s, [[total station]]s, [[Dumpy level|level]]s or transits.\n\n===Usage===\nThe tripod is placed in the location where it is needed.  The surveyor will press down on the legs' platforms to securely anchor the legs in soil or to force the feet to a low position on uneven, pock-marked pavement.  Leg lengths are adjusted to bring the tripod head to a convenient height and make it roughly level.\n\nOnce the tripod is positioned and secure, the instrument is placed on the head.  The mounting screw is pushed up under the instrument to engage the instrument's base and screwed tight when the instrument is in the correct position.  The flat surface of the tripod head is called the foot plate and is used to support the adjustable feet of the instrument.\n\nPositioning the tripod and instrument precisely over an indicated mark on the ground or benchmark requires techniques that are beyond the scope of this article.\n\n===Construction===\nMany modern tripods are constructed of aluminum, though wood is still used for legs.  The feet are either aluminum tipped with a steel point or steel.  The mounting screw is often brass or brass and plastic.  The mounting screw is hollow to allow the optical plumb to be viewed through the screw.  The top is typically threaded with a 5/8\" x 11 tpi screw thread.  The mounting screw is held to the underside of the tripod head by a movable arm.  This permits the screw to be moved anywhere within the head's opening.  The legs are attached to the head with adjustable screws that are usually kept tight enough to allow the legs to be moved with a bit of resistance.  The legs are two part, with the lower part capable of telescoping to adjust the length of the leg to suit the terrain.  Aluminum or steel [[slip joint]]s with a tightening screw are at the bottom of the upper leg to hold the bottom part in place and fix the length.  A shoulder strap is often affixed to the tripod to allow for ease of carrying the equipment over areas to be surveyed.\n\n==Astronomy==\nThe astronomical tripod is a sturdy three-leg stand used to support telescopes or binoculars, though they may also be used to support attached cameras or ancillary equipment.

All straight red cards are subject to review.\n* '''Mistaken identity''' in awarding a red or yellow card.\n\n===Check===\n[[File:VAR decision.jpg|thumb|A VAR decision during an FA Cup match at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester.]]\nThe VAR team, stationed in the video operation room (VOR), automatically checks every on-field referee decision falling under the four reviewable categories. If the VAR does not identify any mistake during the check, this is communicated to the referee. This is called a \"silent check\" and requires no further action, usually not causing any delay to the game. At other times, a VAR check may cause the game to be delayed while the VAR ascertains whether or not a possible mistake has occurred. The referee may delay the restart of play for this to occur, and indicates an ongoing check by pointing to their ear.\n\nWhere the VAR does identify a possible clear and obvious error, there are three possible scenarios:\n* Decision overturned on advice of VAR\n* On-field review (OFR) recommended\n* Referee chooses to ignore VAR advice\n\nA decision can generally be overturned without an OFR where it relates to a factual matter. For example, offside decisions or whether a foul occurred inside or outside the penalty area can be determined by the VAR to the referee without a review. An OFR is generally recommended where there is a subjective decision to make, such as whether a foul was committed in the first place or whether a red card is warranted for a certain offence. In all cases, the final decision rests with the referee, and they can choose to ignore the advice of the VAR altogether.\n\n===On-field review (OFR)===\n[[File:Baldomero Toledo checks VAR - Seattle Sounders vs. Sporting Kansas City.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Major League Soccer]] referee reviewing a play using a sideline monitor]]An OFR can only be conducted on the recommendation of the VAR. This ensures that the referee always makes an on-field ruling and does not rely on OFRs for every close decision. An OFR can be conducted when the ball is out of play, or where the referee stops play for the express purpose of conducting one.\nThe referee signals an OFR by making the outline of a rectangle, indicating a video screen. The OFR takes place in a designated referee review area (RRA), adjacent to the field of play and in public view to ensure transparency. Slow motion replays are only used to establish point of contact for physical offences and handball, while full-speed replays are shown to determine the intensity of an offence or whether a handball occurred in the first place. During an OFR, the VAR transmits several video replays from different camera angles to allow the referee to make their decision.\n\nOnce an OFR is completed, the referee makes the TV signal again, before indicating the decision made. If the ball was out of play, it restarts with either the original decision or the new decision if the on-field one was changed. If play was stopped to conduct an OFR and the decision was not changed, a dropped ball occurs.\n\n===Offences===\nA number of offences relating to the VAR process are codified within the Laws of the Game. Both players and team officials excessively making the TV signal are cautioned. Any player or team official entering the RRA are also cautioned. Finally, entering the VOR will cause a player or team official to be sent off.\n\n===Assistant video assistant referee===\nThe '''assistant video assistant referee''' ('''AVAR''') is a current or former referee appointed to assist the VAR in the video operation room. The responsibilities of the AVAR include watching the live action on the field while the VAR is undertaking a \"check\" or a \"review\", to keep a record of reviewable incidents, and to communicate the outcome of a review to broadcasters.<ref name=\"protocol\"/>\n\n==Glossary==\nA number of technical terms and abbreviations are used in reference to the VAR system.

All straight red cards are subject to review.\n* '''Mistaken identity''' in awarding a red or yellow card.\n\n===Check===\n[[File:VAR decision.jpg|thumb|A VAR decision during an FA Cup match at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester.]]\nThe VAR team, stationed in the video operation room (VOR), automatically checks every on-field referee decision falling under the four reviewable categories. If the VAR does not identify any mistake during the check, this is communicated to the referee. This is called a \"silent check\" and requires no further action, usually not causing any delay to the game. At other times, a VAR check may cause the game to be delayed while the VAR ascertains whether or not a possible mistake has occurred. The referee may delay the restart of play for this to occur, and indicates an ongoing check by pointing to their ear.\n\nWhere the VAR does identify a possible clear and obvious error, there are three possible scenarios:\n* Decision overturned on advice of VAR\n* On-field review (OFR) recommended\n* Referee chooses to ignore VAR advice\n\nA decision can generally be overturned without an OFR where it relates to a factual matter. For example, offside decisions or whether a foul occurred inside or outside the penalty area can be determined by the VAR to the referee without a review. An OFR is generally recommended where there is a subjective decision to make, such as whether a foul was committed in the first place or whether a red card is warranted for a certain offence. In all cases, the final decision rests with the referee, and they can choose to ignore the advice of the VAR altogether.\n\n===On-field review (OFR)===\n[[File:Baldomero Toledo checks VAR - Seattle Sounders vs. Sporting Kansas City.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Major League Soccer]] referee reviewing a play using a sideline monitor]]An OFR can only be conducted on the recommendation of the VAR. This ensures that the referee always makes an on-field ruling and does not rely on OFRs for every close decision. An OFR can be conducted when the ball is out of play, or where the referee stops play for the express purpose of conducting one.\nThe referee signals an OFR by making the outline of a rectangle, indicating a video screen. The OFR takes place in a designated referee review area (RRA), adjacent to the field of play and in public view to ensure transparency. Slow motion replays are only used to establish point of contact for physical offences and handball, while full-speed replays are shown to determine the intensity of an offence or whether a handball occurred in the first place. During an OFR, the VAR transmits several video replays from different camera angles to allow the referee to make their decision.\n\nOnce an OFR is completed, the referee makes the TV signal again, before indicating the decision made. If the ball was out of play, it restarts with either the original decision or the new decision if the on-field one was changed. If play was stopped to conduct an OFR and the decision was not changed, a dropped ball occurs.\n\n===Offences===\nA number of offences relating to the VAR process are codified within the Laws of the Game. Both players and team officials excessively making the TV signal are cautioned. Any player or team official entering the RRA are also cautioned. Finally, entering the VOR will cause a player or team official to be sent off.\n\n===Assistant video assistant referee===\nThe '''assistant video assistant referee''' ('''AVAR''') is a current or former referee appointed to assist the VAR in the video operation room. The responsibilities of the AVAR include watching the live action on the field while the VAR is undertaking a \"check\" or a \"review\", to keep a record of reviewable incidents, and to communicate the outcome of a review to broadcasters.<ref name=\"protocol\"/>\n\n==Glossary==\nA number of technical terms and abbreviations are used in reference to the VAR system.

That included charges of recruiting persons to undertake guerrilla warfare against the South African state, conspiring to aid foreign military against the republic, and furthering acts of communism. The prosecutor [[Percy Yutar]] did not explicitly move for the death penalty, but it was generally believed that that was what the state wanted.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rivonia's Children: Three Families and the Cost of Conscience in White South Africa|first=Glenn|last=Frankel|publisher=Jacana Media|year=2011|page=258}}</ref> All defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.<ref name=SAHistory2>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/rivonia-trial-1963-1964|title=Rivonia Trial 1963\u201364|publisher=Sahistory.org.za |accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nBefore the trial, Mandela and the other defendants decided that instead of testifying as witnesses and submitting to cross-examination he would make a speech from the dock to put the state on trial, by pointing out the injustices of the South African society and its legal system.

I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and oppression of my people by the whites.\"<ref name=Broun/>\n\nMandela argued that all nonviolent means had been tried and that they had resulted only in mounting restrictions and reduced freedom for the African people.  Referring to the [[Sharpeville massacre|Sharpeville shootings]] and a number of other instances of government violence against protesters, he stated that \"the government which uses force to support its rule teaches the oppressed to use force to oppose it\" and that the decision to adopt selective use of violent means was \"not because we desire such a course. Solely because the government left us no other choice.\"<ref name=LeRoux/>\n\nMandela also devoted significant effort to refuting the prosecution's charges that he and the ANC had acted under the domination of the [[Communist Party of South Africa]] and foreign interests. He likened the alliance between the communists and the ANC to the alliance of the US, Britain and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany. He discussed in some detail the relationship between the ANC and the Communist Party and explained that while the two shared a commitment to action against the apartheid system, he was wedded to a model of [[constitutional democracy]] for South Africa (he singled out the British political model for particular praise) and also supported a market economy, rather than a communist economic model. He noted that while there were political differences between the Communists and the ANC, \"theoretical differences among those fighting against oppression is (sic) a luxury that we cannot afford at this stage\". He added that the communists had been the only political group in South Africa who had shown themselves willing to treat Africans as human beings.<ref name=Broun/>\n{{Nelson Mandela series}}\n\n===Impact===\nMandela's friends [[Anthony Sampson]] and [[Nadine Gordimer]], who had both participated in reviewing the speech as written by Mandela,<ref>{{cite web|title=NPW|url=http://www.digitalnpq.org/articles/global/705/04-18-2014/nadine_gordimer|publisher=New Perspectives Quarterly}}</ref> had contrasting reactions to its delivery.

It was situated at the northeast corner of E. 66th Street and Lexington Avenue in the [[Hough, Cleveland|Hough]] neighborhood.  It was built in 1891 as a wood structure and rebuilt using concrete and steel in 1910. The park was home to a number of professional sports teams, most notably the [[Cleveland Indians]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. League Park was first home to the [[Cleveland Spiders]] of the [[National League]] from 1891 to 1899 and of the [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland Lake Shores]] of the [[Western League (original)|Western League]], the minor league predecessor to the Indians, in 1900. From 1914 to 1915, League Park also hosted the [[Cleveland Spiders (American Association)|Cleveland Spiders]] of the minor league [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. In the late 1940s, the park was also the home field of the [[Cleveland Buckeyes]] of the [[Negro American League]].\n\nIn addition to baseball, League Park was also used for [[American football]], serving as the home field for several successive teams in the [[Ohio League]] and early [[National Football League]] (NFL) during the 1920s and 1930s, as well as for [[college football]].  Most notably, the [[History of the Cleveland Rams|Cleveland Rams]] of the NFL played at League Park in 1937 and for much of the early 1940s. Later in the 1940s, the [[Cleveland Browns]] used League Park as a practice field.\n\nThe [[Western Reserve Red Cats football|Western Reserve Red Cats]] college football team from [[Western Reserve University]] played a majority of homes games at League Park from 1929 to 1941, and all home games after joining the [[Mid-American Conference]] from 1947 to 1949.<ref name=\"case.edu\">http://www.case.edu/its/archives/Seasons/wfoot1947.htm</ref> Western Reserve played many of its major college football games at League Park, including against the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]],<ref>http://www.case.edu/its/archives/Seasons/wfoot1934.htm</ref> [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]],<ref>http://www.case.edu/its/archives/Seasons/wfoot1948.htm</ref> [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia Mountaineers]],<ref>http://www.case.edu/its/archives/Seasons/wfoot1938.htm</ref> and [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati Bearcats]].<ref name=\"case.edu\"/> Western Reserve and [[Case Western Reserve Spartans football|Case Tech]] often showcased their annual Thanksgiving Day rivalry game against one another,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.case.edu/archives/2010/11/15/case_vs_wru_thanksgiving_day_football_game |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213172744/http://blog.case.edu/archives/2010/11/15/case_vs_wru_thanksgiving_day_football_game |archive-date=2018-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as well as playing other Big Four Conference games against [[John Carroll Blue Streaks football|John Carroll]] and [[Baldwin-Wallace Yellow Jackets football|Baldwin-Wallace]].

Weekend games, games expecting larger crowds, and night games were held at Cleveland Stadium. Most of the League Park structure was demolished in 1951, although some remnants still remain, including the original ticket office built in 1909.\n\nAfter extensive renovation, the site was rededicated on August 23, 2014, as the [[Baseball Heritage Museum]] and Fannie Lewis Community Park at League Park.<ref name=pd20140824>{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Warsinskey |title=League Park reopens to a historic appreciation, beautiful restoration and hopeful future |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2014/08/league_park_reopens_to_a_histo.html |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=August 23, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nLeague Park was built for the [[Cleveland Spiders]], who were founded in 1887 and played first in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] before joining the [[National League]] in 1889. Team owner [[Frank Robison]] chose the site for the new park, at the corner of Lexington Avenue and Dunham Street, later renamed East 66th Street, in Cleveland's [[Hough, Cleveland|Hough neighborhood]], because it was along the streetcar line he owned. The park opened May 1, 1891, with 9,000 wooden seats, in a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. The first pitch was made by [[Cy Young]], and the Spiders won 12\u20133.<ref name=\"MLB1\">{{cite news |title=League Park may glisten once again |url=http://m.indians.mlb.com/news/article/2133242 |author=Briggs, David |work=MLB.com |date=August 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring their tenure, the Spiders finished as high as 2nd place in the NL in 1892, 1895, and 1896, and won the [[Temple Cup]], an early version of the modern [[National League Championship Series]], in 1895. During the [[1899 Cleveland Spiders season|1899 season]], however, the Spiders had most of their best players stripped from the roster and sent to St. Louis by their owners, who had purchased the [[St. Louis Browns (1882-1900)|St. Louis Browns]] that year. Consequently, Cleveland finished 20\u2013134, and the Spiders season was so poor they drew only 6,088 fans for their entire home season - a \npitiful average of 145 per game - and were forced to play 112 of their 154 games on the road as the other NL teams deemed it pointless to travel to Cleveland's League Park, since their cut of the ticket revenue would not come close to covering their travel and hotel expenses.  \n\nThe team were contracted by the National League after 1899, being replaced the next year by the Cleveland Lake Shores, then a minor league team in the [[American League]]. The American League declared itself a major league after the 1900 season and the Cleveland franchise, initially called the Blues, was a charter member for the 1901 season. \n\nThe park was rebuilt for the [[1910 in baseball|1910 season]] as a concrete-and-steel stadium, one of two to open that year in the American League, the other being [[Comiskey Park]]. The new park seated over 18,000 people, more than double the seating capacity of its predecessor. It opened April 21, 1910, with a 5\u20130 loss to the Detroit Tigers in front of 18,832 fans in a game started by pitcher Cy Young.<ref>{{cite book |title=League Park: historic home of Cleveland baseball, 1891\u20131946 |author1=Krsolovic, Ken |author2=Fritz, Bryan |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc. |year=2013 |pages=8\u201312, 36\u201338 |isbn=978-0-7864-6826-3}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1914 to 1915, the [[Toledo Mud Hens]] of the minor league [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] were temporarily moved to League Park, to discourage the [[Federal League]] from trying to place a franchise in Cleveland.

However, the players and fans complained about the huge outfield, which reduced the number of home runs.  Moreover, as the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] worsened, attendance at the stadium plummeted.<ref name=\"Clem's Baseball ~ League Park IV\"/>  After the 1933 season, the Indians exercised their escape clause in the lease at the stadium and returned to League Park for the [[1934 in baseball|1934 season]].<ref name=Krsolovic1>Krsolovic & Fritz, pp. 99\u2013104</ref>\n\nThe Indians played all home games at League Park for the 1934 and 1935 seasons, and played one home game at Cleveland Stadium in 1936 as part of the [[Great Lakes Exposition]]. In 1937, the Indians began splitting their schedule between the two parks, playing Sunday and holiday games at the stadium during the summer and the remainder at League Park, adding selected important games to the stadium schedule in 1938.  Lights were never installed at League Park, and thus no major league night games were played there.  However, at least one professional night game was played on July 27, 1931, between the [[Homestead Grays]] and the [[House of David (commune)|House of David]], who borrowed the portable lighting system used by the [[Kansas City Monarchs]].<ref name=Krsolovic1/>\n\nBy 1940, the Indians played most of their home schedule at Cleveland Stadium, abandoning League Park entirely after the [[1946 in baseball|1946 season]]. The final Indians game at League Park was played on Saturday, September 21, a 5\u20133 loss in 11 innings to the [[1946 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] in front of 2,772 fans. League Park became the last stadium used in Major League Baseball never to install permanent lights.<ref>Krsolovic & Fritz, pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nThe Indians continued to own League Park until March 1950 when they sold it to the city of Cleveland for $150,000. After the demise of the [[Cleveland Buckeyes]] of the [[Negro American League]] during the [[1950 in baseball|1950 season]], League Park was no longer used as a regular sports venue. Most of the structure was demolished in 1951 by the city to convert the facility for use by local amateur teams and recreation and to prevent any competition with Cleveland Stadium. The lower deck seating between first base and third base remained, as did the Indians' clubhouse under the third base stands. The [[Cleveland Browns]] began using League Park as a practice field in 1952, including the former clubhouse, until 1965. All of the remaining seating areas were removed in 1961 except for the area above the former clubhouse, which was finally torn down in 2002.<ref>Krsolovic & Fritz, pp. 157\u2013177</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:The New Base Ball Park.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Postcard of League Park]]\nWhen it originally opened in 1891, it had 9,000 wooden seats.<ref name=\"MLB1\" />  A single deck grandstand was behind homeplate, a covered pavilion was along the first base line, and bleachers were located at various other places in the park.  The ballpark was configured to fit into the Cleveland street grid, which contorted the dimensions into a rather odd rectangular shape by modern standards.  The fence in left field was {{convert|385|ft|m}},  {{convert|460|ft|m}} away in center, and {{convert|290|ft|m}} down the right field foul line.<ref name=\"BPofB\">[http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/past/LeaguePark.htm League Park] ballparksofbaseball.com (accessed July 22, 2010)</ref>  Batters had to hit the ball over a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} fence to get a home run (by comparison, the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]] is {{convert|37|ft|m}} high).<ref name=Krsolovic2>Krsolovic & Fritz, pp. 33\u201334</ref>\n\nIt was essentially rebuilt prior to the [[1910 in baseball|1910 season]], with concrete and steel double-decker [[grandstand]]s, expanding the seating capacity to 21,414.  The design work was completed by [[Osborn Engineering|Osborn Architects & Engineers]], a local architecture firm that would go on to design several iconic ballparks over the next three years, including [[Comiskey Park]], the [[Polo Grounds]], [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], and Fenway Park.  The front edges of the upper and lower decks were vertically aligned, bringing the up-front rows in the upper deck closer to the action, but those in back could not see much of foul territory.\n\nThe fence was reconfigured, bringing the left field fence in 10 feet closer ({{convert|375|ft|m}}) and center field fence in 40 feet ({{convert|420|ft|m}}); the right field fence remained at {{convert|290|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"BPofB\" />\n\nBatters still had to surmount a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} fence to hit home runs.<ref name=Krsolovic2/> The fence in left field was only five feet tall, but batters had to hit the ball {{convert|375|ft|m}} down the line to hit a home run, and it was fully {{convert|460|ft|m}} to the scoreboard in the deepest part of center field. The diamond, situated in the northwest corner of the block, was slightly tilted counterclockwise, making right field not quite as easy a target as [[Baker Bowl]]'s right field (which had a {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} wall), for example.\n\n==Modern League Park==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=League Park Cleveland circa 1905 CROPPED.jpg|image2=League Park Cleveland Ohio.jpg|width=220|caption2=League Park circa 1905 (top), and in 2009 (bottom).

It was situated at the northeast corner of E. 66th Street and Lexington Avenue in the [[Hough, Cleveland|Hough]] neighborhood.  It was built in 1891 as a wood structure and rebuilt using concrete and steel in 1910. The park was home to a number of professional sports teams, most notably the [[Cleveland Indians]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. League Park was first home to the [[Cleveland Spiders]] of the [[National League]] from 1891 to 1899 and of the [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland Lake Shores]] of the [[Western League (original)|Western League]], the minor league predecessor to the Indians, in 1900. From 1914 to 1915, League Park also hosted the [[Cleveland Spiders (American Association)|Cleveland Spiders]] of the minor league [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. In the late 1940s, the park was also the home field of the [[Cleveland Buckeyes]] of the [[Negro American League]].\n\nIn addition to baseball, League Park was also used for [[American football]], serving as the home field for several successive teams in the [[Ohio League]] and early [[National Football League]] (NFL) during the 1920s and 1930s, as well as for [[college football]].  Most notably, the [[History of the Cleveland Rams|Cleveland Rams]] of the NFL played at League Park in 1937 and for much of the early 1940s. Later in the 1940s, the [[Cleveland Browns]] used League Park as a practice field.\n\nThe [[Western Reserve Red Cats football|Western Reserve Red Cats]] college football team from [[Western Reserve University]] played a majority of homes games at League Park from 1929 to 1941, and all home games after joining the [[Mid-American Conference]] from 1947 to 1949.<ref name=\"case.edu\">http://www.case.edu/its/archives/Seasons/wfoot1947.htm</ref> Western Reserve played many of its major college football games at League Park, including against the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]],<ref>http://www.case.edu/its/archives/Seasons/wfoot1934.htm</ref> [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]],<ref>http://www.case.edu/its/archives/Seasons/wfoot1948.htm</ref> [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia Mountaineers]],<ref>http://www.case.edu/its/archives/Seasons/wfoot1938.htm</ref> and [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati Bearcats]].<ref name=\"case.edu\"/> Western Reserve and [[Case Western Reserve Spartans football|Case Tech]] often showcased their annual Thanksgiving Day rivalry game against one another,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.case.edu/archives/2010/11/15/case_vs_wru_thanksgiving_day_football_game |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213172744/http://blog.case.edu/archives/2010/11/15/case_vs_wru_thanksgiving_day_football_game |archive-date=2018-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as well as playing other Big Four Conference games against [[John Carroll Blue Streaks football|John Carroll]] and [[Baldwin-Wallace Yellow Jackets football|Baldwin-Wallace]].

Weekend games, games expecting larger crowds, and night games were held at Cleveland Stadium. Most of the League Park structure was demolished in 1951, although some remnants still remain, including the original ticket office built in 1909.\n\nAfter extensive renovation, the site was rededicated on August 23, 2014, as the [[Baseball Heritage Museum]] and Fannie Lewis Community Park at League Park.<ref name=pd20140824>{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Warsinskey |title=League Park reopens to a historic appreciation, beautiful restoration and hopeful future |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2014/08/league_park_reopens_to_a_histo.html |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=August 23, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nLeague Park was built for the [[Cleveland Spiders]], who were founded in 1887 and played first in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] before joining the [[National League]] in 1889. Team owner [[Frank Robison]] chose the site for the new park, at the corner of Lexington Avenue and Dunham Street, later renamed East 66th Street, in Cleveland's [[Hough, Cleveland|Hough neighborhood]], because it was along the streetcar line he owned. The park opened May 1, 1891, with 9,000 wooden seats, in a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. The first pitch was made by [[Cy Young]], and the Spiders won 12\u20133.<ref name=\"MLB1\">{{cite news |title=League Park may glisten once again |url=http://m.indians.mlb.com/news/article/2133242 |author=Briggs, David |work=MLB.com |date=August 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring their tenure, the Spiders finished as high as 2nd place in the NL in 1892, 1895, and 1896, and won the [[Temple Cup]], an early version of the modern [[National League Championship Series]], in 1895. During the [[1899 Cleveland Spiders season|1899 season]], however, the Spiders had most of their best players stripped from the roster and sent to St. Louis by their owners, who had purchased the [[St. Louis Browns (1882-1900)|St. Louis Browns]] that year. Consequently, Cleveland finished 20\u2013134, and the Spiders season was so poor they drew only 6,088 fans for their entire home season - a \npitiful average of 145 per game - and were forced to play 112 of their 154 games on the road as the other NL teams deemed it pointless to travel to Cleveland's League Park, since their cut of the ticket revenue would not come close to covering their travel and hotel expenses.  \n\nThe team were contracted by the National League after 1899, being replaced the next year by the Cleveland Lake Shores, then a minor league team in the [[American League]]. The American League declared itself a major league after the 1900 season and the Cleveland franchise, initially called the Blues, was a charter member for the 1901 season. \n\nThe park was rebuilt for the [[1910 in baseball|1910 season]] as a concrete-and-steel stadium, one of two to open that year in the American League, the other being [[Comiskey Park]]. The new park seated over 18,000 people, more than double the seating capacity of its predecessor. It opened April 21, 1910, with a 5\u20130 loss to the Detroit Tigers in front of 18,832 fans in a game started by pitcher Cy Young.<ref>{{cite book |title=League Park: historic home of Cleveland baseball, 1891\u20131946 |author1=Krsolovic, Ken |author2=Fritz, Bryan |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc. |year=2013 |pages=8\u201312, 36\u201338 |isbn=978-0-7864-6826-3}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1914 to 1915, the [[Toledo Mud Hens]] of the minor league [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] were temporarily moved to League Park, to discourage the [[Federal League]] from trying to place a franchise in Cleveland.

However, the players and fans complained about the huge outfield, which reduced the number of home runs.  Moreover, as the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] worsened, attendance at the stadium plummeted.<ref name=\"Clem's Baseball ~ League Park IV\"/>  After the 1933 season, the Indians exercised their escape clause in the lease at the stadium and returned to League Park for the [[1934 in baseball|1934 season]].<ref name=Krsolovic1>Krsolovic & Fritz, pp. 99\u2013104</ref>\n\nThe Indians played all home games at League Park for the 1934 and 1935 seasons, and played one home game at Cleveland Stadium in 1936 as part of the [[Great Lakes Exposition]]. In 1937, the Indians began splitting their schedule between the two parks, playing Sunday and holiday games at the stadium during the summer and the remainder at League Park, adding selected important games to the stadium schedule in 1938.  Lights were never installed at League Park, and thus no major league night games were played there.  However, at least one professional night game was played on July 27, 1931, between the [[Homestead Grays]] and the [[House of David (commune)|House of David]], who borrowed the portable lighting system used by the [[Kansas City Monarchs]].<ref name=Krsolovic1/>\n\nBy 1940, the Indians played most of their home schedule at Cleveland Stadium, abandoning League Park entirely after the [[1946 in baseball|1946 season]]. The final Indians game at League Park was played on Saturday, September 21, a 5\u20133 loss in 11 innings to the [[1946 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] in front of 2,772 fans. League Park became the last stadium used in Major League Baseball never to install permanent lights.<ref>Krsolovic & Fritz, pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nThe Indians continued to own League Park until March 1950 when they sold it to the city of Cleveland for $150,000. After the demise of the [[Cleveland Buckeyes]] of the [[Negro American League]] during the [[1950 in baseball|1950 season]], League Park was no longer used as a regular sports venue. Most of the structure was demolished in 1951 by the city to convert the facility for use by local amateur teams and recreation and to prevent any competition with Cleveland Stadium. The lower deck seating between first base and third base remained, as did the Indians' clubhouse under the third base stands. The [[Cleveland Browns]] began using League Park as a practice field in 1952, including the former clubhouse, until 1965. All of the remaining seating areas were removed in 1961 except for the area above the former clubhouse, which was finally torn down in 2002.<ref>Krsolovic & Fritz, pp. 157\u2013177</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:The New Base Ball Park.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Postcard of League Park]]\nWhen it originally opened in 1891, it had 9,000 wooden seats.<ref name=\"MLB1\" />  A single deck grandstand was behind homeplate, a covered pavilion was along the first base line, and bleachers were located at various other places in the park.  The ballpark was configured to fit into the Cleveland street grid, which contorted the dimensions into a rather odd rectangular shape by modern standards.

The design work was completed by [[Osborn Engineering|Osborn Architects & Engineers]], a local architecture firm that would go on to design several iconic ballparks over the next three years, including [[Comiskey Park]], the [[Polo Grounds]], [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], and Fenway Park.  The front edges of the upper and lower decks were vertically aligned, bringing the up-front rows in the upper deck closer to the action, but those in back could not see much of foul territory.\n\nThe fence was reconfigured, bringing the left field fence in 10 feet closer ({{convert|375|ft|m}}) and center field fence in 40 feet ({{convert|420|ft|m}}); the right field fence remained at {{convert|290|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"BPofB\" />\n\nBatters still had to surmount a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} fence to hit home runs.<ref name=Krsolovic2/> The fence in left field was only five feet tall, but batters had to hit the ball {{convert|375|ft|m}} down the line to hit a home run, and it was fully {{convert|460|ft|m}} to the scoreboard in the deepest part of center field. The diamond, situated in the northwest corner of the block, was slightly tilted counterclockwise, making right field not quite as easy a target as [[Baker Bowl]]'s right field (which had a {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} wall), for example.\n\n==Modern League Park==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=League Park Cleveland circa 1905 CROPPED.jpg|image2=League Park Cleveland Ohio.jpg|width=220|caption2=League Park circa 1905 (top), and in 2009 (bottom).

A small section of the exterior brick facade (along the first-base side) still stands, as well as the old ticket office behind what was the right field corner. The last remnant of the grandstand, crumbling and presumably unsafe, was taken down in 2002 as part of a renovation process to the decaying playground. Local schools' youth teams still compete on the ball field.\n\nOn February 7, 2011, the [[Cleveland City Council]] approved a plan to restore the ticket house and remaining bleacher wall, as well as build a new diamond on the site of the old one (and with the same slightly counterclockwise tilt from the compass points).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/02/cleveland_city_council_approve_5.html|title=Cleveland City Council approves spending to get historic League Park project started|last=Gillispie|first=Mark|date=2011-02-08|accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070806&content_id=2133242&vkey=cle_gameface&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle|title=League Park may glisten once again|last=Briggs|first=David|date=2007-08-08|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> On October 27, 2012, city leaders including Mayor [[Frank G.
