Under third-year head coach [[Danny Hope]], Purdue compiled a record of 7\u20136 and finished in third place in the newly formed Leaders Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. They played their home games at [[Ross\u2013Ade Stadium]] in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]] and are members of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Highlights of Purdue's 2011 season included a 21\u201314 victory over #21 [[2011 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], a 26\u201323 overtime victory over [[2011 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], and the first bowl game since [[2007 Purdue Boilermakers football team|2007]].  Purdue's season ended with a 37\u201332 victory against [[2011 Western Michigan Broncos football team|Western Michigan]] in the [[2011 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl]].\n\nThe Special teams unit for the 2011 season was a key factor in many of the Boilermakers games as they averaged a school-record 28.7 yards per kick-off return.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/mfb/natlRank.jsp?year=2011&div=B&rpt=IA_teamkickret&site=org |title=FBS National Team Report Kickoff Returns |date=January 10, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref> The team title was the first since the 1954 Boilermakers led the NCAA in any yardage category for an entire season, and is merely the third team title in school history (also passing defense in 1941). True freshman [[Raheem Mostert]] was a key contributor, as he averaged 33.5 yards a return,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/mfb/natlRank.jsp?year=2011&div=B&rpt=IA_playerkickret&site=org |title= FBS National Player Report Kickoff Return |date=January 10, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref> capped off with a 99-yard touchdown return in the bowl game. He finished the season with seven returns of 39 or more yards, including an 81-yarder at [[2011 Indiana Hoosiers football team|Indiana]] and a 74-yarder at [[2011 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]]. Against the Badgers, he racked up 206 yards on five kickoff returns to break 42-year-old school records for total yardage and average yards per return.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/011112aag.html |title=Boilers Are FBS Kickoff Return Champs |date=January 11, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Before the season==\nThe Boilermakers are looking to improve on a 4\u20138 record (2\u20136 in conference play) in 2010, in which they finished 9th in the Big Ten conference. The offense will be aided by the return of junior running back, Ralph Bolden, who is returning from a torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] but led the team in rushing yards back in 2009. Their running back depth will be tested, as the running back with the most yards who was still had eligibility remaining, Al-Terek McBurse transferred out of Purdue. [[Rob Henry (American football)|Rob Henry]] was named the starting quarterback in the preseason, but tore his ACL on August 23, and will miss the entire 2011 season. The quarterback play will be split between [[Robert Marve]] and [[Caleb TerBush]]. The receiving core returns its 2010 leader in touchdowns, Antavian Edison, as well as O. J. Ross who saw significant playing time during the 2010 season as a true freshman. On the defense the departure of [[Ryan Kerrigan]], who was selected in the first round of the [[2011 NFL Draft]], will be a tough hole to fill, but will be aided by the return of [[Kawann Short]], the team's top returning sack man. The linebacking group returns all three starters from a season ago, which includes 2 of the team's top 3 tacklers in 2010, Dwayne Beckford and [[Joe Holland (American football)|Joe Holland]]. The secondary also returns all its starters, led by 2010 leading tackler, Logan Link and [[Ricardo Allen]]. The Boilermakers are looking to return to a bowl game for the first time since [[2007 Purdue Boilermakers football team|2007]].\n\n===Recruiting===\n{{College Athlete Recruit Start|40=yes|collapse=no|year=2011}}\n{{College Athlete Recruit Entry\n| recruit  = Sterling Carter\n| position = [[Tight end|TE]]\n| hometown = Wilmington, California\n| highschool = [[Los Angeles Harbor College]]\n| feet   = 6\n| inches = 5\n| weight = 240\n| 40     = 4.7\n| commitdate = 2010-12-14\n| scout stars  = 2\n| rivals stars = 2\n| espn grade = NR\n}}\n{{College Athlete Recruit Entry\n| recruit  =Brandon Cottom\n| position = [[Sportsperson|ATH]]\n| hometown = Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown, Pennsylvania\n| highschool = [[Council Rock High School North|Council Rock H.S.

This led to redshirt junior, [[Caleb TerBush]] making the first start of his career. TerBush had not played since 2009 when he was the backup to [[Joey Elliott]], and he missed the 2010 season with academic problems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boilers' TerBush will be starter in season opener |url=http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20110830/SPORTS0303/308309975/1008/SPORTS/ |website=journalgazette.net |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330164611/http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20110830/SPORTS0303/308309975/1008/SPORTS/ |archivedate=2012-03-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Metamora native will QB Purdue |url=http://www.pjstar.com/sports/x1413004209/Metamora-native-will-QB-Purdue |website=pjstar.com |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TerBush remains Purdue's No. 1 quarterback|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jconline/access/2474120471.html?FMT=ABS&date=Oct+03%2C+2011|date=October 3, 2011|newspaper=Journal and Courier}}</ref>\n\nThe Blue Raiders got off to an early lead when [[Logan Kilgore]] found Malcolm Beyah for a 26-yard touchdown pass. Carson Wiggs added a field goal as Purdue's response score to make it 7\u20133 at the end of the 1st quarter.\n\nPurdue grabbed its first lead of the game when [[Caleb TerBush]]'s rollout pass found Jared Crank for a 2-yard score. The touchdown pass was the first of TerBush's career. The Blue Raiders responded two possessions later, as Logan Kilgore's wide receiver screen pass to Sancho McDonald was taken 21-yards for a score after McDonald was able to dodge a defender. The first half ended with the Boilermakers trailing 14\u201310.\n\nAfter no one scored in the 3rd quarter, Middle Tennessee St., opened up the 2nd half scoring with a 42-yard field goal by [[Alan Gendreau]]. Purdue responded with a 30-yard touchdown run by Akeem Shavers to tie the game at 17. The Blue Raiders responded quickly as they capped a 60-yard drive, with a 2-yard draw run by [[Benny Cunningham]] to reclaim the lead. Purdue was able to get another field goal as Carson Wiggs connected on a 47-yarder to make it 24\u201320 with 5:57 remaining in the game. The Boilermaker defense was able to force a punt, which allowed Purdue to get the ball back with 3:53 left in the game. TerBush led the Boilers down the field and eventually found Antavian Edison with a 35-yard crossing route to give Purdue the lead, 27\u201324 with 49 seconds remaining. The Blue Raiders drove the ball down to the Purdue 30-yard line, and took a shot with a deep pass. Kilgore's pass hit off the fingertips of Beyah and fell harmlessly out of bounds with 5 seconds remaining.

Purdue responded with an 80-yard drive, capped off with a 5-yard [[Caleb TerBush]] run, to give Purdue the lead. Rice responded with a 2-yard touchdown run by Turner Petersen to start the second quarter scoring. Carson Wiggs added a 28-yard field goal to make the score even at 10. After a quick 3 and out by Rice, Purdue scored on a 19-yard reception by Crosby Wright to regain the lead. Rice then scored on a 4-yard touchdown pass by Taylor McHargue to Luke Willson as time expired to tie the game at 17.\n\nRice received the ball to start the 2nd half, and scored on a 19-yard run by [[Sam McGuffie]] to finished off an 11-play, 80-yard drive, and gave the Owls' their first lead since the 1st quarter. Later in the quarter, Purdue had driven down to the Rice 1-yard line, but could not get the ball in the endzone and turn it over on downs. The first play after Rice took over, Purdue tackled Charles Ross in the endzone for a safety to make the score 24\u201319 in favor of Rice. Wiggs added a 27-yard field goal with 7:56 remaining in the game. Purdue's defense remained strong on the next 2 drives, forcing Rice to punt each time. The Boilermakers got the ball on their own 48 with 1:52 remaining, and three long runs by Ralph Bolden moved them inside the 20. With 31 seconds remaining, Purdue ran Akeem Shavers to center the ball in the middle of the field. This set up a 4 & 10 on the Rice 14-yard line. Without a timeout remaining, Purdue was able to run out the special teams unit and get set without any of the players being rushed. Rice's Justin Allen then blocked Wiggs' 31-yard field-goal attempt as time expired, to clinch a 24\u201322 victory over Purdue.\n\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle = background:#000000;color:#B1946C;border:2px solid #B1946C;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Purdue Boilermakers at Rice Owls \u2013 Game summary\n\n |date=September 10\n |time=2:35 p.m. [[North American Central Time Zone|CDT]]\n\n |road=Boilermakers\n |R1=7 |R2=10 |R3=2 |R4=3\n |home='''Owls'''\n |H1=3 |H2=14 |H3=7 |H4=0\n |stadium=[[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]], [[Houston, Texas]]\n\n |attendance=25,317\n |referee=Steve Barth\n |reference=[http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2011-2012/pur11-01.html]\n\n |scoring=\n;1st quarter\n*Rice \u2013 (5:46) Chris Boswell 33-yard field goal, ''Rice 3\u20130''\n*Purdue \u2013 (2:07) Caleb TerBush 5-yard run (Carson Wiggs kick), ''Purdue 7\u20133''\n;2nd quarter\n*Rice \u2013 (13:43) Turner Peterson 2-yard run (Chris Boswell kick), ''Rice 10\u20137''\n*Purdue \u2013 (8:48) Carson Wiggs 28-yard field goal, ''10\u201310''\n*Purdue \u2013 (7:32) Crosby Wright 2-yard pass from Caleb TerBush (Carson Wiggs kick), ''Purdue 17\u201310''\n*Rice \u2013 (0:00) Luke Willson 4-yard pass from Taylor McHargue (Chris Boswell kick), ''17\u201317''\n;3rd quarter\n*Rice \u2013 (10:24) Sam McGuffie 19-yard pass from Taylor McHargue (Chris Boswell kick), ''Rice 24\u201317''\n*Purdue \u2013 (1:06) Team Safety ''Rice 24\u201319''\n;4th quarter\n*Purdue \u2013 (7:56) Carson Wiggs 27-yard field goal, ''Rice 24\u201322''\n\n |stats=\n;Passing\n*Purdue \u2013 Caleb TerBush: 18/31, 183 yards, 1 TD\n*Rice \u2013 Taylor McHargue: 19/29, 230 yards, 2 TD\n\n;Rushing\n*Purdue \u2013 Akeem Shavers: 11 att, 69 yards, 0 TD\n*Rice \u2013 Sam McGuffie: 9 att, 48 yards, 0 TD\n\n;Receiving\n*Purdue \u2013 Antavian Edison: 4 rec, 76 yards, 0 TD\n*Rice \u2013 Luke Willson: 4 rec, 36 yards, 1 TD\n}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Purdue vs Rice (Sep 10, 2011) |url=http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2011-2012/pur11-01.html |publisher=PurdueSports.com |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref>\n\n===SE Missouri St.===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Their 3rd drive was better, as they got their scoring started with a 19-yard [[Carson Wiggs]] field goal. After that, the Boilermakers power run game took over as [[Akeem Shavers]] scored twice in the first quarter on runs of 8 and 1 yards, [[Ralph Bolden]] scored twice in the seconds quarter on runs of 1 and 6 yards, and [[Akeem Hunt]] had two more scores on runs of 13 and 3 yards in the 4th.

They played their home games at [[Ross\u2013Ade Stadium]] in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]] and are members of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Highlights of Purdue's 2011 season included a 21\u201314 victory over #21 [[2011 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], a 26\u201323 overtime victory over [[2011 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], and the first bowl game since [[2007 Purdue Boilermakers football team|2007]].  Purdue's season ended with a 37\u201332 victory against [[2011 Western Michigan Broncos football team|Western Michigan]] in the [[2011 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl]].\n\nThe Special teams unit for the 2011 season was a key factor in many of the Boilermakers games as they averaged a school-record 28.7 yards per kick-off return.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/mfb/natlRank.jsp?year=2011&div=B&rpt=IA_teamkickret&site=org |title=FBS National Team Report Kickoff Returns |date=January 10, 2012 |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref> The team title was the first since the 1954 Boilermakers led the NCAA in any yardage category for an entire season, and is merely the third team title in school history (also passing defense in 1941).

The offense will be aided by the return of junior running back, Ralph Bolden, who is returning from a torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] but led the team in rushing yards back in 2009. Their running back depth will be tested, as the running back with the most yards who was still had eligibility remaining, Al-Terek McBurse transferred out of Purdue. [[Rob Henry (American football)|Rob Henry]] was named the starting quarterback in the preseason, but tore his ACL on August 23, and will miss the entire 2011 season.

Ross who saw significant playing time during the 2010 season as a true freshman. On the defense the departure of [[Ryan Kerrigan]], who was selected in the first round of the [[2011 NFL Draft]], will be a tough hole to fill, but will be aided by the return of [[Kawann Short]], the team's top returning sack man. The linebacking group returns all three starters from a season ago, which includes 2 of the teams top 3 tacklers in 2010, Dwayne Beckford and [[Joe Holland (American football)|Joe Holland]]. The secondary also returns all its starters, led by 2010 leading tackler, Logan Link and [[Ricardo Allen]]. The Boilermakers are looking to return to a bowl game for the first time since [[2007 Purdue Boilermakers football team|2007]].\n\n===Recruiting===\n{{College Athlete Recruit Start|40=yes|collapse=no|year=2011}}\n{{College Athlete Recruit Entry\n| recruit  = Sterling Carter\n| position = [[Tight end|TE]]\n| hometown = Wilmington, California\n| highschool = [[Los Angeles Harbor College]]\n| feet   = 6\n| inches = 5\n| weight = 240\n| 40     = 4.7\n| commitdate = 2010-12-14\n| scout stars  = 2\n| rivals stars = 2\n| espn grade = NR\n}}\n{{College Athlete Recruit Entry\n| recruit  =Brandon Cottom\n| position = [[Sportsperson|ATH]]\n| hometown = Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown, Pennsylvania\n| highschool = [[Council Rock High School North|Council Rock H.S.

This led to redshirt junior, [[Caleb TerBush]] making the first start of his career. TerBush had not played since 2009 when he was the backup to [[Joey Elliott]], and he missed the 2010 season with academic problems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boilers' TerBush will be starter in season opener |url=http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20110830/SPORTS0303/308309975/1008/SPORTS/ |website=journalgazette.net |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330164611/http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20110830/SPORTS0303/308309975/1008/SPORTS/ |archivedate=2012-03-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Metamora native will QB Purdue |url=http://www.pjstar.com/sports/x1413004209/Metamora-native-will-QB-Purdue |website=pjstar.com |accessdate=2011-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TerBush remains Purdue's No. 1 quarterback|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jconline/access/2474120471.html?FMT=ABS&date=Oct+03%2C+2011|date=October 3, 2011|newspaper=Journal and Courier}}</ref>\n\nThe Blue Raiders got off to an early lead when [[Logan Kilgore]] found Malcolm Beyah for a 26-yard touchdown pass. Carson Wiggs added a field goal as Purdue's response score to make it 7\u20133 at the end of the 1st quarter.\n\nPurdue grabbed its first lead of the game when [[Caleb TerBush]]'s rollout pass found Jared Crank for a 2-yard score. The touchdown pass was the first of TerBush's career. The Blue Raiders responded two possessions later, as Logan Kilgore's wide receiver screen pass to Sancho McDonald was taken 21-yards for a score after McDonald was able to dodge a defender. The first half ended with the Boilermakers trailing 14\u201310.\n\nAfter no one scored in the 3rd quarter, Middle Tennessee St., opened up the 2nd half scoring with a 42-yard field goal by [[Alan Gendreau]]. Purdue responded with a 30-yard touchdown run by Akeem Shavers to tie the game at 17. The Blue Raiders responded quickly as they capped a 60-yard drive, with a 2-yard draw run by [[Benny Cunningham]] to reclaim the lead. Purdue was able to get another field goal as Carson Wiggs connected on a 47-yarder to make it 24\u201320 with 5:57 remaining in the game. The Boilermaker defense was able to force a punt, which allowed Purdue to get the ball back with 3:53 left in the game. TerBush led the Boilers down the field and eventually found Antavian Edison with a 35-yard crossing route to give Purdue the lead, 27\u201324 with 49 seconds remaining. The Blue Raiders drove the ball down to the Purdue 30-yard line, and took a shot with a deep pass. Kilgore's pass hit off the fingertips of Beyah and fell harmlessly out of bounds with 5 seconds remaining.

Purdue responded with an 80-yard drive, capped off with a 5-yard [[Caleb TerBush]] run, to give Purdue the lead. Rice responded with a 2-yard touchdown run by Turner Petersen to start the second quarter scoring. Carson Wiggs added a 28-yard field goal to make the score even at 10. After a quick 3 and out by Rice, Purdue scored on a 19-yard reception by Crosby Wright to regain the lead. Rice then scored on a 4-yard touchdown pass by Taylor McHargue to Luke Willson as time expired to tie the game at 17.\n\nRice received the ball to start the 2nd half, and scored on a 19-yard run by [[Sam McGuffie]] to finished off an 11-play, 80-yard drive, and gave the Owls' their first lead since the 1st quarter. Later in the quarter, Purdue had driven down to the Rice 1-yard line, but could not get the ball in the endzone and turn it over on downs. The first play after Rice took over, Purdue tackled Charles Ross in the endzone for a safety to make the score 24\u201319 in favor of Rice. Wiggs added a 27-yard field goal with 7:56 remaining in the game. Purdue's defense remained strong on the next 2 drives, forcing Rice to punt each time. The Boilermakers got the ball on their own 48 with 1:52 remaining, and three long runs by Ralph Bolden moved them inside the 20. With 31 seconds remaining, Purdue ran Akeem Shavers to center the ball in the middle of the field. This set up a 4 & 10 on the Rice 14-yard line. Without a timeout remaining, Purdue was able to run out the special teams unit and get set without any of the players being rushed. Rice's Justin Allen then blocked Wiggs' 31-yard field-goal attempt as time expired, to clinch a 24\u201322 victory over Purdue.\n\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle = background:#000000;color:#B1946C;border:2px solid #B1946C;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Purdue Boilermakers at Rice Owls \u2013 Game summary\n\n |date=September 10\n |time=2:35 p.m. [[North American Central Time Zone|CDT]]\n\n |road=Boilermakers\n |R1=7 |R2=10 |R3=2 |R4=3\n |home='''Owls'''\n |H1=3 |H2=14 |H3=7 |H4=0\n |stadium=[[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]], [[Houston, Texas]]\n\n |attendance=25,317\n |referee=Steve Barth\n |reference=[http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2011-2012/pur11-01.html]\n\n |scoring=\n;1st quarter\n*Rice \u2013 (5:46) Chris Boswell 33-yard field goal, ''Rice 3\u20130''\n*Purdue \u2013 (2:07) Caleb TerBush 5-yard run (Carson Wiggs kick), ''Purdue 7\u20133''\n;2nd quarter\n*Rice \u2013 (13:43) Turner Peterson 2-yard run (Chris Boswell kick), ''Rice 10\u20137''\n*Purdue \u2013 (8:48) Carson Wiggs 28-yard field goal, ''10\u201310''\n*Purdue \u2013 (7:32) Crosby Wright 2-yard pass from Caleb TerBush (Carson Wiggs kick), ''Purdue 17\u201310''\n*Rice \u2013 (0:00) Luke Willson 4-yard pass from Taylor McHargue (Chris Boswell kick), ''17\u201317''\n;3rd quarter\n*Rice \u2013 (10:24) Sam McGuffie 19-yard pass from Taylor McHargue (Chris Boswell kick), ''Rice 24\u201317''\n*Purdue \u2013 (1:06) Team Safety ''Rice 24\u201319''\n;4th quarter\n*Purdue \u2013 (7:56) Carson Wiggs 27-yard field goal, ''Rice 24\u201322''\n\n |stats=\n;Passing\n*Purdue \u2013 Caleb TerBush: 18/31, 183 yards, 1 TD\n*Rice \u2013 Taylor McHargue: 19/29, 230 yards, 2 TD\n\n;Rushing\n*Purdue \u2013 Akeem Shavers: 11 att, 69 yards, 0 TD\n*Rice \u2013 Sam McGuffie: 9 att, 48 yards, 0 TD\n\n;Receiving\n*Purdue \u2013 Antavian Edison: 4 rec, 76 yards, 0 TD\n*Rice \u2013 Luke Willson: 4 rec, 36 yards, 1 TD\n}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Purdue vs Rice (Sep 10, 2011) |url=http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2011-2012/pur11-01.html |publisher=PurdueSports.com |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref>\n\n===SE Missouri St.===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Their 3rd drive was better, as they got their scoring started with a 19-yard [[Carson Wiggs]] field goal. After that, the Boilermakers power run game took over as [[Akeem Shavers]] scored twice in the first quarter on runs of 8 and 1 yards, [[Ralph Bolden]] scored twice in the seconds quarter on runs of 1 and 6 yards, and [[Akeem Hunt]] had two more scores on runs of 13 and 3 yards in the 4th.

Jubin was awarded with Upcoming Male Vocalist of the Year at ''8th [[Mirchi Music Awards]], 2016'' for his song \"Zindagi Kuch Toh Bata (reprise)\" from ''[[Bajrangi Bhaijaan]]'' and his other achievement is the Rising Musical Star Award (2015) received at Zee Business Awards. Early in his career he sang many songs, including several hit songs, for Hindi films. He has also recorded songs for films in various [[Languages of India|Indian languages]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nSinger Jubin was born in [[Dehradun]] to parents Ram and Neena. His father, Ram Sharan Nautiyal, is a businessman and politician in [[Uttarakhand]] and his mother, Neena Nautiyal, is a businesswoman and a homemaker.\n\nJubin showed an inclination towards music at an early age of four taking his father's love for singing. He did his schooling up to eighth grade from [[St. Joseph's Academy, Dehradun]]. Thereafter, he continued his schooling at [[Welham Boys' School]], [[Dehradun]], where he formally studied music as a subject and built a base in classical music. He also learned to play instruments like guitar, piano, harmonium, and drums. By the age of 18, Jubin was well known as a singer in his hometown of Dehradun. He performed live at many events and gave his support to several charities. \n\nAfter completing his schooling, he moved to [[Mumbai]] in 2007 and joined [[Mithibai College]]. He continued to train in music (under Pandit ChhannuLal Mishra Ji in Varanasi) and explore the music scenario of Indian films. During this time he met [[A.R. Rahman]] who appreciated his voice quality and suggested that he continue to work on and explore his voice for a few more years before entering into the Indian Music Industry. Taking Rahman's advice, Jubin moved back to his hometown and continued to train under his schoolteacher, Mrs. Vandana Srivastava. He also took additional music lessons in the Hindustani classical music from his guru Mr. Samant. Jubin spent four years polishing his skills in music, traveling and playing with different musicians. He traveled to [[Benaras]] to learn light classical from [[Chhannulal Mishra]]. He also took training in western music at a music academy in [[Chennai]] where he had the opportunity to study under Veteran Guitarist [[R. Prasanna|Prasanna]].

{"title_page": "Network tap", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nA '''network tap''' is a system that monitors events on a local network in order to aid administrators (or attackers) in analyzing the network.{{cn|date=November 2019}} The tap itself is typically a dedicated hardware device, which provides a way to access the data flowing across a [[computer network]]. In many cases, it is desirable for a third party to monitor the traffic between two points in the network. If the network between points A and B consists of a physical cable, a \"'''network tap'''\" may be the best way to accomplish this monitoring. The network tap has (at least) three ports: an '''A''' port, a '''B''' port, and a '''monitor''' port. A tap inserted between A and B passes all traffic (send and receive data streams) through unimpeded in real time, but also copies that same data to its monitor port, enabling a third party to listen.\nNetwork taps are commonly used for [[network intrusion detection system]]s, [[VoIP recording]], network probes, [[RMON]] probes, [[packet sniffer]]s, and other monitoring and collection devices and software that require access to a [[network segment]]. Taps are used in security applications because they are non-obtrusive, are not detectable on the network (having no physical or logical address), can deal with [[full-duplex]] and non-shared networks, and will usually ''pass through'' or ''bypass'' traffic even if the tap stops working or loses power.\n\n\n=Terminology=\nThe term '''network tap''' is analogous to [[telephone tapping|phone tap]] or [[vampire tap]]. Some vendors define \"TAP\" as an acronym for \"Test Access Point\" or \"Terminal Access Point\"; however, those are most likely [[bacronym]]s.\n\nThe monitored traffic is sometimes referred to as the ''pass-through'' traffic, while the ports that are used for monitoring are the ''monitor'' ports. There may also be an aggregation port for full-duplex traffic, wherein the \"A\" traffic is aggregated with the \"B\" traffic, resulting in one stream of data /packets for monitoring the full-duplex communication. The packets must be aligned into a single stream using a time-of-arrival algorithm.\n\nVendors will tend to use terms in their marketing such as ''breakout'', ''passive'', ''aggregating'', ''regeneration'', bypass, active, ''inline power'', and others; Unfortunately, vendors do not use such terms consistently. Before buying any product it is important to understand the available features, and check with vendors or read the product literature closely to figure out how marketing terms correspond to reality. All of the \"vendor terms\" are common within the industry, have real definitions and are valuable points of consideration when buying a tap device.\n\nA distributed tap is a set of network taps that report to a centralized monitoring system or [[packet analyzer]].\n\n\n\n=Tapping technology methods=\nThere are various methods for monitoring a network. Many tapping methods can be used, according to the network technology, the monitoring objective, the resources avaible and the size of the target network. Varius methods will be developed below.\n\n==Tapping by Software==\nThis type of tapping focuses on tapping by making use of Software, and without making any significant change on an infrastructures hardware. This type of Tapping is often the cheapest one to implement, but it needs several implementations to give a truly complete look of the network.\n\n=== Monitoring Software ===\nThe simplest type of monitoring is [[logging into]] an interesting device and running programs or commands that show performance statistics and other data. This is the cheapest way to monitor a network, and is highly appropriate for small networks. However, it does not [[scale (computing)|scale]] well to large networks. It can also impact the network being monitored; see [[Observer effect (information technology)|observer effect]].\n\n=== SNMP ===\nAnother way to monitor devices is to use a remote management protocol such as [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] to ask devices about their performance. This [[scale (computing)|scales]] well, but is not necessarily appropriate for all types of monitoring. The inherent problems with SNMP are the polling effect. Many vendors have alleviated this by using intelligent polling schedulers, but this may still affect the performance of the device being monitored. It also opens up a host of potential security problems.\n\n=== Port-Mirroring ===\nAnother method to monitor networks is to use [[port mirroring]] (called \"SPAN\", for Switched Port Analyzer, by vendors such as Cisco<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shashank |first1=Singh |title=Catalyst Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) Configuration Example |url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/10570-41.html |website=Cisco |accessdate=7 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>, and given other names, such MLXe telemetry by Brocade Communications and other vendors)(also known as MIRROR port) or a monitoring protocol such as [[TZSP]] on [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[network switch|switches]]. This is a low-cost alternative to network taps, and solves many of the same problems. However, not all routers and switches support port mirroring and, on those that do, using port mirroring can affect the performance of the router or switch. These technologies may also be subject to the problem with [[full-duplex]] described elsewhere in this article, and there are often limits for the router or switch on how many pass-through sessions can be monitored, or how many monitor ports (generally two) can monitor a given session.\nThis is a low-cost alternative to traditional network tap methods.\nOften, when the SPAN port is overloaded, packets will be dropped before reaching the monitoring device. There is also the possibility of losing some of the error packets that may be causing problems. If this data is not sent to the monitoring device because it is dropped, it is impossible to troubleshoot, no matter how advanced a device that may be used.\n\n=== Switch Sniffer ===\nThis tapping method consists in enabling Promiscuous Mode on the device that is used for the monitoring and attaching it to a network switch. This works well with older [[LAN]] technologies such as [[10BASE-T]] [[Ethernet]], [[FDDI]], and [[token ring]]. On such networks, any host can automatically see what all other hosts were doing by enabling promiscuous mode. However, modern [[network switch|switched]] network technologies such as those used on modern Ethernets provide, in effect, point-to-point links between pairs of devices, so it is hard for other devices to see traffic.\n\n\n==Tapping by Hardware==\nThis type of tapping focuses on tapping with remarkable use of hardware\n\n=== In-line Sniffer ===\n[[Image:Fiber optic tap.png|right|thumb|A passive fiber optic tap.]]\nThis method consists in the installation of a device in between a network cable and the device the Admin/Attacker wishes to \"tap\". When a monitoring device is installed in-line, the network will stop every time the device fails, or shutsdown. The \"victim\" device might stop receiving traffic when the ''tapping-device'' is updating/rebooting if said mechanisms weren't integrated in a smart way (aka. that would prevent this scenario from happening).\n\nSome taps, particularly [[Fiber tapping|fiber tap]]s, use no power and no electronics at all for the ''pass-through'' and ''monitor'' portion of the network traffic. This means that the tap should never suffer any kind of electronics failure or power failure that results in a loss of network connectivity. One way this can work, for fiber-based network technologies, is that the tap divides the incoming light using a simple physical apparatus into two outputs, one for the ''pass-through'', one for the ''monitor''. This can be called a ''passive'' tap. Other taps use no power or electronics for the ''pass-through'', but do use power and electronics for the ''monitor'' port. These can also be referred to as ''passive''.\n\n\n\n\n== V-Line Tapping ==\nV-Line Tapping is the most important Tapping system methods. V-Line Tapping (also known as Bypass Tapping) allows placing the served system virtually in-line. Putting this device in-line will compromise the integrity of a critical network. By placing a Tapping system instead of the monitoring device and connecting the monitoring device to the Tapping system, it can guarantee that the traffic will continue to flow and the device will not create a failure point in the network.{{cn|date=November 2019}}  This method always passes every packet, even error packets that a SPAN port may drop, to the monitoring device. This method involves using spying-software on the target machine. For a system-admin, this type of solution is the easiest to implement and the most cost-effective one; However, for an attacker, this type of tapping is very risky, as this is easily detectable by system scans. The tapping system will be removed after a reboot if the spying software was installed in a non-persistent way on a system that is executing a [[Live CD|Live-OS]].\n\n\n\n=Advantages and features=\nModern network technologies are often [[full-duplex]], meaning that data can travel in both directions at the same time. If a network link allows 100 Mbit/s of data to flow in each direction at the same time, this means that the network really allows 200 Mbit/s of aggregate [[throughput]]. This can present a problem for monitoring technologies if they have only one monitor port. Therefore, network taps for full-duplex technologies usually have two monitor ports, one for each half of the connection. The listener must use [[channel bonding]] or [[link aggregation]] to merge the two connections into one aggregate interface to see both halves of the traffic. Other monitoring technologies, such as passive fiber network TAPs do not deal well with the full-duplex traffic.\n\nOnce a network tap is in place, the network can be monitored without interfering with the network itself. Other [[network monitoring]] solutions require [[in-band]] changes to network devices, which means that monitoring can impact the devices being monitored. This scenario is for active, inline security tools, such as [[next-generation fire walls]], [[intrusion prevention systems]] and [[web application firewalls]].\n\nOnce a tap is in place, a monitoring device can be connected to it as-needed without impacting the monitored network.\n\nSome taps have multiple output ports, or multiple pairs of output ports for full-duplex, to allow more than one device to monitor the network at the tap point. These are often called ''regeneration'' taps.\n\nSome taps operate at the [[physical layer]] of the [[OSI model]] rather than the [[data link]] layer. For example, they work with [[multi-mode fiber]] rather than [[1000BASE-SX]]. This means that they can work with most data link network technologies that use that physical media, such as ATM and some forms of Ethernet. Network taps that act as simple [[optical splitter]]s, sometimes called ''passive taps'' (although that term is not used consistently) can have this property.\n\nSome network taps offer both duplication of network traffic for monitoring devices and SNMP services. Most major network tap manufacturers offer taps with remote management through Telnet, HTTP, or SNMP interfaces. Such network tap hybrids can be helpful to network managers who wish to view baseline performance statistics without diverting existing tools. Alternatively, SNMP alarms generated by managed taps can alert network managers to link conditions that merit examination by analyzers to intrusion detection systems.\n\nSome taps get some of their power (i.e., for the ''pass-through'') or all of their power (i.e., for both ''pass-through'' and ''monitor'') from the network itself. These can be referred to as having ''inline power''.\n\nSome taps can also reproduce low-level network errors, such as short frames, bad CRC or corrupted data.\n\n[[File:Optical-tap-schema-wiki.gif|thumb|Basic functionality of an optical network tap]]\n\n==Advantages of a Network TAP==\nHere are some advantages of a Network TAP over port mirroring or SPAN:\n\n* Passive; fail-safe\n* Zero configuration\n* Secure\n* Exact duplicate of network traffic\n* No added latency or altered timing\n* Passes network errors in addition to good frames/packets\n* Oversubscription not an issue\n\n==Disadvantages and problems==\nBecause network taps require additional hardware, they are not as cheap as technologies that use capabilities that are built into the network. However, network taps are easier to manage and normally provide more data than some network devices.\n\nNetwork taps can require [[channel bonding]] on monitoring devices to get around the problem with [[full-duplex]] discussed above. Vendors usually refer to this as aggregation as well.\n\nPutting a network tap into place will disrupt the network being monitored for a short time.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2011-03&post=Sniffing-Tutorial-part-1---Intercepting-Network-Traffic |title=Sniffing Tutorial part 1 - Intercepting Network Traffic|publisher=NETRESEC Network Security Blog|year=2011}}</ref> Even so, a short disruption is preferable to taking a network down multiple times to deploy a monitoring tool. Establishing good guidelines for the placement of network taps is recommended.\n\nMonitoring large networks using network taps can require a lot of monitoring devices. High-end networking devices often allow ports to be enabled as [[Port mirroring|mirror ports]], which is a software network tap. While any free port can be configured as a mirror port, software taps require configuration and place load on the network devices.\n\nEven fully ''passive'' network taps introduce new [[points of failure]] into the network. There are several ways that taps can cause problems, and this should be considered when creating a tap architecture. Consider non-powered taps for optical-only environments or ''throwing [[star network tap]]'' for [[100BT#Copper|copper 100BT]]. This allows you to modify the intelligent aggregation taps that may be in use and avoids any complications when upgrading from 100 megabit to gigabit to 10 gigabit. [[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundant]] [[Power supply unit|power supplies]] are highly recommended.\n\nFully ''passive'' is only possible on optical connections any bandwidth and on copper connections from type G703 (2Mbit) and Ethernet Base-T 10/100 Mbit. On Gigabit and 10 Gbit Base-T connections passive tapping is currently not possible.\n\n\n=Countermeasures=\nCountermeasures for network taps include encryption and alarm systems. Encryption can make the stolen data unintelligible to the thief. However, encryption can be an expensive solution, and there are also concerns about network bandwidth when it is used.\n\nAnother counter-measure is to deploy a fiber-optic sensor into the existing raceway, conduit or armored cable. In this scenario, anyone attempting to physically access the data (copper or fiber infrastructure) is detected by the alarm system. A small number of alarm systems manufacturers provide a simple way to monitor the optical fiber for physical intrusion disturbances. There is also a proven solution that utilizes existing dark (unused) fiber in a multi-strand cable for the purpose of creating an alarm system.\n\nIn the alarmed cable scenario, the sensing mechanism uses optical interferometry in which modally dispersive coherent light traveling through the multi-mode fiber mixes at the fiber's terminus, resulting in a characteristic pattern of light and dark splotches called speckle. The laser speckle is stable as long as the fiber remains immobile, but flickers when the fiber is vibrated. A fiber-optic sensor works by measuring the time dependence of this speckle pattern and applying digital signal processing to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the temporal data.\n\nThe U.S. government has been concerned about the tapping threat for many years, and it also has a concern about other forms of intentional or accidental physical intrusion. In the context of classified information Department of Defense (DOD) networks, Protected Distribution Systems (PDS) is a set of military instructions and guidelines for network physical protection. PDS is defined for a system of carriers (raceways, conduits, ducts, etc.) that are used to distribute Military and National Security Information (NSI) between two or more controlled areas or from a controlled area through an area of lesser classification (i.e., outside the SCIF or other similar area). National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) No. 7003, Protective Distribution Systems (PDS), provides guidance for the protection of SIPRNET wire line and optical fiber PDS to transmit unencrypted classified National Security Information (NSI).\n\n\n=Gigabit Base-T issues=\n[[File:Base-T-Gbit-Physics.gif|thumb|Explains the physical connection on Gbit Ethernet]]\nTo transport 1 Gbit of traffic full duplex (1 Gbit in each direction simultaneously) a very complex signal is used to reach the desired performance and quality. In case of Gbit Ethernet the signal is called PAM 5 modulation, meaning that each cable pair transports 5 bits simultaneously in both directions. The PHY chips at each end of the cable have a very complex task at hand, because they must separate the two signals from each other. This is only possible because they know their own signal, so they can deduct their own send signals from the mixed signals on the line and then interpret the information sent by their link partners.\n\n[[File:Gbit-Tap-schema.gif|thumb|Schematic function of a Gbit Copper TAP]]\n\nTo tap a copper link as shown in the picture above it is not possible to just tap the middle of the wire because all you will see is a complex modulation of two signals. The only way to terminate the signal (as shown in the picture) is to use a PHY chip to separate the signal and then send the signal on to the link partner. This solution is working but causes some other problems.\n\n# It is not passive any longer, so in the case of a failure the link can go down and the services on the link are interrupted. To minimize this problem each copper tap has a bypass switch (relays), which closes in a power down situation (as shown in the picture), to bring the link back up. Also this solution will not detect that the link is down for a minimum of three seconds. These three seconds are a result of the autonegotiation behavior. This can not be changed because it is a vital function of the IEEE 802.3 standard as described in clause 28 and 40. Even this short interruption time could cause big problems in a network.\n#* In some cases these links cannot be re-established without shutting down the services. \n#* Rerouting functions in the network may take place\n#* Streaming applications can collapse and cause more issues.\n# Some layer 1 information is not transported over a copper tap (e.g. pause frames)\n# The clock synchronization is affected. Sync-E over a standard Gbit copper tap is impossible and IEEE 1588 is affected, because of the additional delay a copper tap produces.\n\n=See also=\n* [[TUN/TAP|Virtual TAP device]]\n* [[DShield]]\n* [[ShieldsUP]]\n\n=References=\n{{reflist}}\n\n=External links=\n*[http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Passive-Network-Tap/?ALLSTEPS Make-a-Passive-Network-Tap]\n\n[[Category:Networking hardware|tap]]\n[[Category:Intrusion detection systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nA Network TAP (Terminal Access Point) denotes a system that monitors events on a local network in order to aid administrators (or attackers) in analyzing the network.{{cn|date=November 2019}} The tap itself is typically a dedicated hardware device, which provides a way to access the data flowing across a [[computer network]].

On such networks, any host can automatically see what all other hosts were doing by enabling promiscuous mode. However, modern [[network switch|switched]] network technologies such as those used on modern Ethernets provide, in effect, point-to-point links between pairs of devices, so it is hard for other devices to see traffic.\n\n\n==Tapping by Hardware==\nThis type of tapping focuses on tapping with remarkable use of hardware\n\n=== In-line Sniffer ===\n[[Image:Fiber optic tap.png|right|thumb|A passive fiber optic tap.]]\nThis method consists in the installation of a device in between a network cable and the device the Admin/Attacker wishes to \"tap\". When a monitoring device is installed in-line, the network will stop every time the device fails, or shutsdown. The \"victim\" device might stop receiving traffic when the ''tapping-device'' is updating/rebooting if said mechanisms weren't integrated in a smart way (aka. that would prevent this scenario from happening).\n\nSome taps, particularly [[Fiber tapping|fiber tap]]s, use no power and no electronics at all for the ''pass-through'' and ''monitor'' portion of the network traffic. This means that the tap should never suffer any kind of electronics failure or power failure that results in a loss of network connectivity. One way this can work, for fiber-based network technologies, is that the tap divides the incoming light using a simple physical apparatus into two outputs, one for the ''pass-through'', one for the ''monitor''. This can be called a ''passive'' tap. Other taps use no power or electronics for the ''pass-through'', but do use power and electronics for the ''monitor'' port. These can also be referred to as ''passive''.\n\n\n\n\n== V-Line Tapping ==\nV-Line Tapping is the most important Tapping system methods. V-Line Tapping (also known as Bypass Tapping) allows placing the served system virtually in-line. Putting this device in-line will compromise the integrity of a critical network. By placing a Tapping system instead of the monitoring device and connecting the monitoring device to the Tapping system, it can guarantee that the traffic will continue to flow and the device will not create a failure point in the network.{{cn|date=November 2019}}  This method always passes every packet, even error packets that a SPAN port may drop, to the monitoring device. This method involves using spying-software on the target machine. For a system-admin, this type of solution is the easiest to implement and the most cost-effective one; However, for an attacker, this type of tapping is very risky, as this is easily detectable by system scans. The tapping system will be removed after a reboot if the spying software was installed in a non-persistent way on a system that is executing a [[Live CD|Live-OS]].\n\n\n\n=Advantages and features=\nModern network technologies are often [[full-duplex]], meaning that data can travel in both directions at the same time. If a network link allows 100 Mbit/s of data to flow in each direction at the same time, this means that the network really allows 200 Mbit/s of aggregate [[throughput]]. This can present a problem for monitoring technologies if they have only one monitor port. Therefore, network taps for full-duplex technologies usually have two monitor ports, one for each half of the connection. The listener must use [[channel bonding]] or [[link aggregation]] to merge the two connections into one aggregate interface to see both halves of the traffic. Other monitoring technologies, such as passive fiber network TAPs do not deal well with the full-duplex traffic.\n\nOnce a network tap is in place, the network can be monitored without interfering with the network itself. Other [[network monitoring]] solutions require [[in-band]] changes to network devices, which means that monitoring can impact the devices being monitored. This scenario is for active, inline security tools, such as [[next-generation fire walls]], [[intrusion prevention systems]] and [[web application firewalls]].\n\nOnce a tap is in place, a monitoring device can be connected to it as-needed without impacting the monitored network.\n\nSome taps have multiple output ports, or multiple pairs of output ports for full-duplex, to allow more than one device to monitor the network at the tap point. These are often called ''regeneration'' taps.\n\nSome taps operate at the [[physical layer]] of the [[OSI model]] rather than the [[data link]] layer. For example, they work with [[multi-mode fiber]] rather than [[1000BASE-SX]]. This means that they can work with most data link network technologies that use that physical media, such as ATM and some forms of Ethernet. Network taps that act as simple [[optical splitter]]s, sometimes called ''passive taps'' (although that term is not used consistently) can have this property.\n\nSome network taps offer both duplication of network traffic for monitoring devices and SNMP services. Most major network tap manufacturers offer taps with remote management through Telnet, HTTP, or SNMP interfaces. Such network tap hybrids can be helpful to network managers who wish to view baseline performance statistics without diverting existing tools. Alternatively, SNMP alarms generated by managed taps can alert network managers to link conditions that merit examination by analyzers to intrusion detection systems.\n\nSome taps get some of their power (i.e., for the ''pass-through'') or all of their power (i.e., for both ''pass-through'' and ''monitor'') from the network itself. These can be referred to as having ''inline power''.\n\nSome taps can also reproduce low-level network errors, such as short frames, bad CRC or corrupted data.\n\n[[File:Optical-tap-schema-wiki.gif|thumb|Basic functionality of an optical network tap]]\n\n==Advantages of a Network TAP==\nHere are some advantages of a Network TAP over port mirroring or SPAN:\n\n* Passive; fail-safe\n* Zero configuration\n* Secure\n* Exact duplicate of network traffic\n* No added latency or altered timing\n* Passes network errors in addition to good frames/packets\n* Oversubscription not an issue\n\n==Disadvantages and problems==\nBecause network taps require additional hardware, they are not as cheap as technologies that use capabilities that are built into the network. However, network taps are easier to manage and normally provide more data than some network devices.\n\nNetwork taps can require [[channel bonding]] on monitoring devices to get around the problem with [[full-duplex]] discussed above. Vendors usually refer to this as aggregation as well.\n\nPutting a network tap into place will disrupt the network being monitored for a short time.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2011-03&post=Sniffing-Tutorial-part-1---Intercepting-Network-Traffic |title=Sniffing Tutorial part 1 - Intercepting Network Traffic|publisher=NETRESEC Network Security Blog|year=2011}}</ref> Even so, a short disruption is preferable to taking a network down multiple times to deploy a monitoring tool. Establishing good guidelines for the placement of network taps is recommended.\n\nMonitoring large networks using network taps can require a lot of monitoring devices. High-end networking devices often allow ports to be enabled as [[Port mirroring|mirror ports]], which is a software network tap. While any free port can be configured as a mirror port, software taps require configuration and place load on the network devices.\n\nEven fully ''passive'' network taps introduce new [[points of failure]] into the network. There are several ways that taps can cause problems, and this should be considered when creating a tap architecture. Consider non-powered taps for optical-only environments or ''throwing [[star network tap]]'' for [[100BT#Copper|copper 100BT]]. This allows you to modify the intelligent aggregation taps that may be in use and avoids any complications when upgrading from 100 megabit to gigabit to 10 gigabit. [[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundant]] [[Power supply unit|power supplies]] are highly recommended.\n\nFully ''passive'' is only possible on optical connections any bandwidth and on copper connections from type G703 (2Mbit) and Ethernet Base-T 10/100 Mbit. On Gigabit and 10 Gbit Base-T connections passive tapping is currently not possible.\n\n\n=Countermeasures=\nCountermeasures for network taps include encryption and alarm systems. Encryption can make the stolen data unintelligible to the thief. However, encryption can be an expensive solution, and there are also concerns about network bandwidth when it is used.\n\nAnother counter-measure is to deploy a fiber-optic sensor into the existing raceway, conduit or armored cable. In this scenario, anyone attempting to physically access the data (copper or fiber infrastructure) is detected by the alarm system. A small number of alarm systems manufacturers provide a simple way to monitor the optical fiber for physical intrusion disturbances. There is also a proven solution that utilizes existing dark (unused) fiber in a multi-strand cable for the purpose of creating an alarm system.\n\nIn the alarmed cable scenario, the sensing mechanism uses optical interferometry in which modally dispersive coherent light traveling through the multi-mode fiber mixes at the fiber's terminus, resulting in a characteristic pattern of light and dark splotches called speckle. The laser speckle is stable as long as the fiber remains immobile, but flickers when the fiber is vibrated. A fiber-optic sensor works by measuring the time dependence of this speckle pattern and applying digital signal processing to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the temporal data.\n\nThe U.S. government has been concerned about the tapping threat for many years, and it also has a concern about other forms of intentional or accidental physical intrusion. In the context of classified information Department of Defense (DOD) networks, Protected Distribution Systems (PDS) is a set of military instructions and guidelines for network physical protection. PDS is defined for a system of carriers (raceways, conduits, ducts, etc.) that are used to distribute Military and National Security Information (NSI) between two or more controlled areas or from a controlled area through an area of lesser classification (i.e., outside the SCIF or other similar area). National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) No. 7003, Protective Distribution Systems (PDS), provides guidance for the protection of SIPRNET wire line and optical fiber PDS to transmit unencrypted classified National Security Information (NSI).\n\n\n=Gigabit Base-T issues=\n[[File:Base-T-Gbit-Physics.gif|thumb|Explains the physical connection on Gbit Ethernet]]\nTo transport 1 Gbit of traffic full duplex (1 Gbit in each direction simultaneously) a very complex signal is used to reach the desired performance and quality. In case of Gbit Ethernet the signal is called PAM 5 modulation, meaning that each cable pair transports 5 bits simultaneously in both directions. The PHY chips at each end of the cable have a very complex task at hand, because they must separate the two signals from each other. This is only possible because they know their own signal, so they can deduct their own send signals from the mixed signals on the line and then interpret the information sent by their link partners.\n\n[[File:Gbit-Tap-schema.gif|thumb|Schematic function of a Gbit Copper TAP]]\n\nTo tap a copper link as shown in the picture above it is not possible to just tap the middle of the wire because all you will see is a complex modulation of two signals. The only way to terminate the signal (as shown in the picture) is to use a PHY chip to separate the signal and then send the signal on to the link partner. This solution is working but causes some other problems.\n\n# It is not passive any longer, so in the case of a failure the link can go down and the services on the link are interrupted. To minimize this problem each copper tap has a bypass switch (relays), which closes in a power down situation (as shown in the picture), to bring the link back up. Also this solution will not detect that the link is down for a minimum of three seconds. These three seconds are a result of the autonegotiation behavior. This can not be changed because it is a vital function of the IEEE 802.3 standard as described in clause 28 and 40. Even this short interruption time could cause big problems in a network.\n#* In some cases these links cannot be re-established without shutting down the services. \n#* Rerouting functions in the network may take place\n#* Streaming applications can collapse and cause more issues.\n# Some layer 1 information is not transported over a copper tap (e.g. pause frames)\n# The clock synchronization is affected. Sync-E over a standard Gbit copper tap is impossible and IEEE 1588 is affected, because of the additional delay a copper tap produces.\n\n=See also=\n* [[TUN/TAP|Virtual TAP device]]\n* [[DShield]]\n* [[ShieldsUP]]\n\n=References=\n{{reflist}}\n\n=External links=\n*[http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Passive-Network-Tap/?ALLSTEPS Make-a-Passive-Network-Tap]\n\n[[Category:Networking hardware|tap]]\n[[Category:Intrusion detection systems]]\n", "name_user": "Frumpet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleaned up use of tap/TAP.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_tap"}

A 90-minute event, A New Day... introduced a new form of theatrical entertainment, a fusion of song, performance art, innovative stage craft and state-of-the-art technology. Dion was originally contracted for three years (Dion received about $100 million, plus 50 percent of the profits during the three-year contract), however, due to its immediate success, the show continued for an additional two years. A New Day... ended on 15 December 2007, after a five-year run.

Dion was so moved and impressed by ''O'' that she insisted on going backstage afterwards to get to know the performers. [[Franco Dragone]] in turn heard about Dion's favorable reception of his work, and several weeks later, wrote a letter to them to put forth the idea of an artistic collaboration. Angelil called Dragone, they arranged an in-person meeting, and A New Day... was the result.\n\nDion initially intended for the show to be named ''Muse'', but the [[Muse (band)|band of the same name]] owned worldwide performing rights. Dion offered $50,000 for the rights, but the band declined, with lead singer [[Matthew Bellamy]] explaining that he didn't want people to think they were Celine Dion's backup act.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2339585.stm|title=Band muses on Dion name victory|date=18 October 2002|accessdate=18 October 2002|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe Colosseum venue was built using fast-track construction processes in only about 140 days. The stage was designed to slope upward at 5.7 degrees away from the audience, to provide the best acoustics possible in a circular theatre. The other purpose of the sloped stage was to show lighting details, designs, and textures of the stage for Dion's show. This proved extremely hard on the dancers' bodies, and a few were forced to leave the show early as a result of their injuries.\n\nThe original plan for the stage backdrop/scenery was to simply use a giant [[video projector]], but when the lighting designer, Yves Aucoin, pointed out that this would create unacceptable shadows when dancers ran in front of it, Angelil went back to [[Phil Anschutz]], whose [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG Live]] was underwriting the production, and persuaded him to contribute an extra $10 million for the construction of the largest indoor [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] screen in North America. The LED Screen was produced by Mitsubishi Diamond Vision LED Screens. This was a HDTV LED Screen Installation with an 8mm Display \"Dot Pitch\".

The most uncomfortable moments come when the music stops, the dancers disappear, and it's just Dion and her audience. This is when the show's split personality truly emerges: Dragone's alternate world is gone and now we have a Celine Dion concert, during which the star attempts witty banter as her fans scream out the mandatory declarations \"We love you, Celine!\" and then hold their breath, waiting for her to stop talking and start singing again.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/06-2003/celine-dion-a-new-day_3635.html |title=Celine Dion: A New Day - Reviews |last=Westley |first=Christine |date=16 June 2003}}</ref>\n\nPhil Gallo of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the sets like the former article, but criticized choices in covers.  He stated, \"Her run through a nostalgic trio \u2014 Etta James' first hit, 'At Last,' Peggy Lee's version of 'Fever' and the Frank Sinatra-phrased 'I've Got the World on a String' \u2014 magnified her lack of soulfulness, but they did display her capacity for mimicry: She phrases everything exactly as her predecessors did.  For 'First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,' it appeared Dion and her musical director Claude (Mego) Lemay had the softness of Roberta Flack's original in mind. But they then go out on a bizarre limb, progressively bloating the arrangement and her vocal interpretation. Worse yet, Dion ascends 70 feet into the heavens with dancers all around her. Nice effect, but another song would be more appropriate for it....  It's conceivable that future audiences will have more rapport with Dion and her music than opening night's high rollers and invited guests. Dion never looked like she was struggling, but if she didn't ask for audience participation, she wasn't going to get any anyway.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/music/reviews/celine-dion-a-new-day-1200542553 |title=Celine Dion: A New Day. . . |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |last=Gallo |first=Phil |date=26 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn the documentary, ''A New Day... The Secrets'', included as a bonus in the ''[[Live in Las Vegas: A New Day...]]'', Dion and Dragone commented on making changes to the show through the years to include more appearances of the band members, or to change Dion's look to make it more like what fans expected.<ref>{{Cite AV media|date=2007 |title=A New Day.. The Secrets |publisher=Columbia Music Video}}</ref>\n\nThe year when A New Day... was going to close, Mike Weatherford of ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' wrote a positive review.  He stated how Dion \"...grew into 'A New Day' over the years, and for better or worse the show evolved into more of the diva showcase people expected at the outset: an upscale pop show with some artsy flourishes, not the swing-for-the fences collaboration with Cirque du Soleil director Franco Dragone that often tried too hard.  Some early mistakes disappeared quickly. It's been a long time since Dion flew on a harness rigging, or dressed up like the \"Pat\" character on 'Saturday Night Live,' with slicked-back hair and hitched-up, man-boy suspenders.  Other changes replaced the audacious with safe and sure-footed, but more ordinary choices. The show now opens with\u2014wouldya believe it? -- the title song 'A New Day' instead of the solitary, a capella take on \"Nature Boy.\" The standards \"Fever\" and \"At Last\" were replaced in May 2006 with a now-common tech trick, splicing in Frank Sinatra to help croon 'All the Way.'  And the homestretch now celebrates the cast as a bonded unit with the Ike & Tina Turner classic 'River Deep\u2014Mountain High.' Dragone would have found it cheesy back in '03. Now, he probably realizes the show needed an energy that had been stifled in its overproduced infancy.  The world's largest hi-def screen no longer steals the show as it did before Best Buy shoppers knew the difference between a 720p and 1080p TV. But Dragone's elegant spectacle still makes the jaw drop now and then.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/mike-weatherford/celine-dion-new-day |title=Celine Dion in \"A New Day\" |website=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |last=Weatherford |first=Mike |date=28 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasts and recordings==\n{{main|A New Day...

Due to hernia issues, the song was then performed on stage to be finally cut in May 2004.\n*Initially, \"Ammore Annascunnuto\" was preceded by \"Aria Di Lucia De Lammermoor\" and thus performed in full. The instrumental interlude was cut when Celine stopped flying during \"[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face#Celine Dion version|The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]\" but performed the latter on stage. Since then, \"Ammore Annascunnuto\" served as an instrumental interlude with Celine appearing in the middle of the song and performing it in a shortened version.\n*Since 9 September 2006, Celine stopped performing \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\" but the song's instrumental was used as an outro. In the final year, it was replaced by \"[[My Heart Will Go On]]\" instrumental.\n*Since 10 November 2006, Celine started to leave the stage for the costume change near the end of \"[[Love Can Move Mountains]]\" which included then the rap parts of \"[[Unison]]\" performed by the band.\n*[[Taro Hakase]], the original violinist in \"[[To Love You More]]\", joined Celine on stage to perform the song during the show on 7 July 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celinedionforum.com/topic/16586-a-new-day-review-july-1-9/|title=A New Day Review, July 1\u20139 - A New Day...|website=Celine Dion Forum}}</ref>\n*[[David Foster]] joined Celine on the piano for \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\" during one of the shows in 2007.

A 90-minute event, A New Day... introduced a new form of theatrical entertainment, a fusion of song, performance art, innovative stage craft and state-of-the-art technology. Dion was originally contracted for three years (Dion received about $100 million, plus 50 percent of the profits during the three-year contract), however, due to its immediate success, the show continued for an additional two years. A New Day... ended on 15 December 2007, after a five-year run. A New Day ... is the most successful residency of all time, grossing over US$385 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|385|r=2|2007}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US}} and drawing nearly three million people to 717 shows.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KhQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Review: A New Day\"]; accessed 27 June 2017.</ref>\n\nDion returned to Las Vegas on 15 March 2011 to perform her new residency, [[Celine (concert residency)|Celine]].\n\n==Background and creation==\n\nThe original inspiration for the show occurred when Dion and her husband [[Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil]] visited Las Vegas in 2000, at a time when she was taking a break to start a family, and they watched a performance of ''[[O (Cirque du Soleil)|O]]'' by [[Cirque du Soleil]] at the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]]. Dion was so moved and impressed by ''O'' that she insisted on going backstage afterwards to get to know the performers. [[Franco Dragone]] in turn heard about Dion's favorable reception of his work, and several weeks later, wrote a letter to them to put forth the idea of an artistic collaboration. Angelil called Dragone, they arranged an in-person meeting, and A New Day... was the result.\n\nDion initially intended for the show to be named ''Muse'', but the [[Muse (band)|band of the same name]] owned worldwide performing rights. Dion offered $50,000 for the rights, but the band declined, with lead singer [[Matthew Bellamy]] explaining that he didn't want people to think they were Celine Dion's backup act.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2339585.stm|title=Band muses on Dion name victory|date=18 October 2002|accessdate=18 October 2002|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe Colosseum venue was built using fast-track construction processes in only about 140 days. The stage was designed to slope upward at 5.7 degrees away from the audience, to provide the best acoustics possible in a circular theatre. The other purpose of the sloped stage was to show lighting details, designs, and textures of the stage for Dion's show. This proved extremely hard on the dancers' bodies, and a few were forced to leave the show early as a result of their injuries.\n\nThe original plan for the stage backdrop/scenery was to simply use a giant [[video projector]], but when the lighting designer, Yves Aucoin, pointed out that this would create unacceptable shadows when dancers ran in front of it, Angelil went back to [[Phil Anschutz]], whose [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG Live]] was underwriting the production, and persuaded him to contribute an extra $10 million for the construction of the largest indoor [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] screen in North America. The LED Screen was produced by Mitsubishi Diamond Vision LED Screens. This was a HDTV LED Screen Installation with an 8mm Display \"Dot Pitch\". The screen consisted of many separate LED panels put together.<ref>{{cite book | author=Glatzer, Jenna| title=C\u00e9line Dion: For Keeps | url=https://archive.org/details/celinedionforkee0000glat| url-access=registration| publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing| year=2005 | isbn=0-7407-5559-5}}</ref> The stage backdrop/video content design of the show is done by Dirk Decloedt.\n\nCeline and her family moved to a house in Lake Las Vegas, located in Henderson, Nevada where they lived during the five years of the show.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n{{-}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:Caesars Palace Celine Dion Sign (869274551).jpg|thumb|A New Day... signage at Caesars Palace]]\nThe year the show opened, A New Day... received mostly mixed reviews in the press, commenting on how there was not enough of a balance between concert and theater.  In ''TheaterMania.com'', an article by Christine Westley praised the sets but wrote that Dion's performance was \"inconsequential at best...  The most uncomfortable moments come when the music stops, the dancers disappear, and it's just Dion and her audience. This is when the show's split personality truly emerges: Dragone's alternate world is gone and now we have a Celine Dion concert, during which the star attempts witty banter as her fans scream out the mandatory declarations \"We love you, Celine!\" and then hold their breath, waiting for her to stop talking and start singing again.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/06-2003/celine-dion-a-new-day_3635.html |title=Celine Dion: A New Day - Reviews |last=Westley |first=Christine |date=16 June 2003}}</ref>\n\nPhil Gallo of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the sets like the former article, but criticized choices in covers.  He stated, \"Her run through a nostalgic trio \u2014 Etta James' first hit, 'At Last,' Peggy Lee's version of 'Fever' and the Frank Sinatra-phrased 'I've Got the World on a String' \u2014 magnified her lack of soulfulness, but they did display her capacity for mimicry: She phrases everything exactly as her predecessors did.  For 'First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,' it appeared Dion and her musical director Claude (Mego) Lemay had the softness of Roberta Flack's original in mind. But they then go out on a bizarre limb, progressively bloating the arrangement and her vocal interpretation. Worse yet, Dion ascends 70 feet into the heavens with dancers all around her. Nice effect, but another song would be more appropriate for it....  It's conceivable that future audiences will have more rapport with Dion and her music than opening night's high rollers and invited guests. Dion never looked like she was struggling, but if she didn't ask for audience participation, she wasn't going to get any anyway.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/music/reviews/celine-dion-a-new-day-1200542553 |title=Celine Dion: A New Day. . . |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |last=Gallo |first=Phil |date=26 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn the documentary, ''A New Day... The Secrets'', included as a bonus in the ''[[Live in Las Vegas: A New Day...]]'', Dion and Dragone commented on making changes to the show through the years to include more appearances of the band members, or to change Dion's look to make it more like what fans expected.<ref>{{Cite AV media|date=2007 |title=A New Day.. The Secrets |publisher=Columbia Music Video}}</ref>\n\nThe year when A New Day... was going to close, Mike Weatherford of ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' wrote a positive review.  He stated how Dion \"...grew into 'A New Day' over the years, and for better or worse the show evolved into more of the diva showcase people expected at the outset: an upscale pop show with some artsy flourishes, not the swing-for-the fences collaboration with Cirque du Soleil director Franco Dragone that often tried too hard.  Some early mistakes disappeared quickly. It's been a long time since Dion flew on a harness rigging, or dressed up like the \"Pat\" character on 'Saturday Night Live,' with slicked-back hair and hitched-up, man-boy suspenders.  Other changes replaced the audacious with safe and sure-footed, but more ordinary choices. The show now opens with\u2014wouldya believe it? -- the title song 'A New Day' instead of the solitary, a capella take on \"Nature Boy.\" The standards \"Fever\" and \"At Last\" were replaced in May 2006 with a now-common tech trick, splicing in Frank Sinatra to help croon 'All the Way.'  And the homestretch now celebrates the cast as a bonded unit with the Ike & Tina Turner classic 'River Deep\u2014Mountain High.' Dragone would have found it cheesy back in '03. Now, he probably realizes the show needed an energy that had been stifled in its overproduced infancy.  The world's largest hi-def screen no longer steals the show as it did before Best Buy shoppers knew the difference between a 720p and 1080p TV. But Dragone's elegant spectacle still makes the jaw drop now and then.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/mike-weatherford/celine-dion-new-day |title=Celine Dion in \"A New Day\" |website=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |last=Weatherford |first=Mike |date=28 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasts and recordings==\n{{main|A New Day...

This release was cancelled with no plans to release it in the future. However, this DVD was shown to the audience during one of the shows when Celine was sick and couldn't perform. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nReportedly, another DVD was recorded between 2005-2006 with Celine having long brown hair and new costumes as many different extracts have appeared. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nFinally, A New Day... was re-shot in high-definition during the 17\u201321 January 2007 week and released on DVD on 7 December 2007 and on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on 5 February 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celinedion.com/celinedion/english/whatsgoinon_archive.cgi?page=8 |title=A New Day...

Due to hernia issues, the song was then performed on stage to be finally cut in May 2004.\n*Initially, \"Ammore Annascunnuto\" was preceded by \"Aria Di Lucia De Lammermoor\" and thus performed in full. The instrumental interlude was cut when Celine stopped flying during \"[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face#Celine Dion version|The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]\" but performed the latter on stage. Since then, \"Ammore Annascunnuto\" served as an instrumental interlude with Celine appearing in the middle of the song and performing it in a shortened version.\n*Since 9 September 2006, Celine stopped performing \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\" but the song's instrumental was used as an outro. In the final year, it was replaced by \"[[My Heart Will Go On]]\" instrumental.\n*Since 10 November 2006, Celine started to leave the stage for the costume change near the end of \"[[Love Can Move Mountains]]\" which included then the rap parts of \"[[Unison]]\" performed by the band.\n*[[Taro Hakase]], the original violinist in \"[[To Love You More]]\", joined Celine on stage to perform the song during the show on 7 July 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celinedionforum.com/topic/16586-a-new-day-review-july-1-9/|title=A New Day Review, July 1\u20139 - A New Day...|website=Celine Dion Forum}}</ref>\n*[[David Foster]] joined Celine on the piano for \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\" during one of the shows in 2007. The performance was later included on Foster's DVD entitled \"Hit Man: David Foster & Friends\".\n\n==Shows==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"

In its pure form it may be called '''tritium oxide''' ('''T<sub>2</sub>O''' or '''<sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O'''), '''super-heavy water''' or '''radioactive water'''. Pure T<sub>2</sub>O is [[corrosive]] due to self-[[radiolysis]]. Diluted, tritiated water is mainly H<sub>2</sub>O plus some HTO (<sup>3</sup>HOH).  It is also used as a [[isotopic labelling|tracer]] for water transport studies in life-science research.  Furthermore, since it naturally occurs in minute quantities, it can be used to determine the age of various water-based liquids, such as vintage [[wines]].\n\nThe name ''super-heavy water'' helps distinguish the tritiated material from [[heavy water]], which contains [[deuterium]] instead.\n\n==Applications==\nTritiated water can be used to measure the [[body water|total volume of water in one's body]]. Tritiated water distributes itself into all body compartments relatively quickly. The concentration of tritiated water in [[urine]] is assumed to be similar to the concentration of tritiated water in the body. Knowing the original amount of tritiated water that was ingested and the concentration, one can calculate the volume of water in the body.\n\n* Amount of tritiated water (mg) = Concentration of tritiated water (mg/ml) x Volume of body water (ml)\n* Volume of body water (ml) = [Amount of tritiated water (mg) - Amount excreted (mg)] / Concentration of tritiated water (mg/ml)\n\n==Adverse health effects==\nTritiated water contains the radioactive hydrogen isotope tritium. As a low energy [[beta particle|beta emitter]] with a half-life of about 12 years, it is not dangerous externally because its beta particles are unable to penetrate the skin. However, it is a radiation hazard when inhaled, ingested via food or water, or absorbed through the skin.<ref>Osborne, R.V.
