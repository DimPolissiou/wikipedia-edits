GIZ provided not only funding but also a clear plan of action for forest regeneration which the YISEDA scheme lacked previously due to poor guidance by DENR.<ref name=Lerma />\n*'''Site to site variances in support:'''As evident in the case studies of YISEDA and NPPFRDC, there are disparities in the level of success that CBFM has had, suggesting that the level of support given to a project is highly dependent on location.

Some of his main literary works include ''The Kingdom of the Divine Lovers, The Twelve Beguines, The Spiritual Espousals, A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness, The Little Book of Enlightenment'', and ''The Sparkling Stone''. Some of his letters also survive, as well as several short sayings (recorded by some of his disciples, such as Jan van Leeuwen). He wrote in the Dutch vernacular, the language of the common people of the Low Countries, rather than in Latin, the language of the Church liturgy and official texts, in order to reach a wider audience.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Until his ordination===\nJohn had a devout mother, who brought him up in the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic faith]]; of his father we know nothing. John's [[surname]], ''Van Ruusbroec'', is not a surname in the modern sense but a [[toponym]] that refers to his native [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]; modern-day [[Ruisbroek, Flemish Brabant|Ruisbroek]] near [[Brussels]] (compare [[John of Salisbury]] or [[Democritus of Abdera]]).\n\nAt the age of eleven he left his mother, departing without leave or warning, to place himself under the guidance and [[Tutor|tuition]] of his uncle, [[Jan Hinckaert]], a [[canon regular]] of [[Gudula|St. Gudule's]], Brussels. Hinckaert was living according to his Apostolic views with a fellow-canon, [[Frank van Coudenberg]].  This uncle provided for Ruysbroeck's education with a view to the [[priesthood]]. In due course, John was presented with a [[prebendary|prebend]] in [[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral|St. Gudule's church]], and ordained in 1318. His mother had followed him to Brussels, entered a [[Beguines|B\u00e9guinage]] there, and died shortly before his [[ordination]].\n\n===Priest in Brussels===\nFrom 1318 until 1343 Ruysbroeck served as a parish priest at St Gudula. He continued to lead, together with his uncle Hinckaert and Van Coudenberg, a life of extreme austerity and retirement. At that time the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] were causing controversy in the Netherlands and one of them, a woman named [[Heilwige Bloemardinne]], was particularly active in Brussels, propagating her beliefs chiefly by means of popular pamphlets. Ruysbroeck responded with pamphlets also written in the native tongue ([[Middle Dutch]]). Nothing of these treatises remains.  The controversy had a permanent effect on Ruysbroeck: his later writings bear constant reference, direct and indirect, to the [[heresy|heretical]] views expressed in these times, and he always wrote in the country's native language, chiefly with a view to counteracting these writings which he viewed as heretical.\n\n===Priest in Groenendaal===\n[[File:Ruysbroeck chapel.JPG|thumb|Small chapel in the forest at Groenendaal near the monastery where Ruysbroeck contemplated]]The desire for a more retired life, and possibly also the persecution which followed Ruysbroeck's attack on Bloemardinne, induced Ruysbroeck, Jan Hinckaert (d. 1350) and Vrank van Coudenberg (d. 1386) to leave Brussels in 1343 for the [[Groenendael Priory|hermitage of Groenendaal]], in the neighbouring [[Sonian Forest]], which was made over to them by [[John III, Duke of Brabant]]. The ruins of the monastery are still present in the forest of Soignes.<ref>Michel Erkins. ''De Priorij van Groenendaal''. Gemeentehuis. Jan van Ruusbroecpark. Hoeilaart. 2007.</ref>\n\nBut here so many disciples joined the little company that it was found expedient to organize into a duly-authorized religious body. The hermitage was erected into a community of canons regular on 13 March 1349, and eventually it became the motherhouse of a congregation, which bore its name of Groenendaal. Francis van Coudenberg was appointed first [[provost (religion)|provost]], and Blessed John Ruysbroeck [[prior]]. Hinckaert refrained from making the canonical profession lest the discipline of the house should suffer from the exemptions required by the infirmities of his old age; he dwelt, therefore, in a cell outside the [[cloister]] and there a few years later died.\n\nThis period, from his religious profession (1349) to his death (1381), was the most active and fruitful of Ruysbroeck's career. During this time, his fame as a man of God, as a sublime contemplative and a skilled director of souls, spread beyond the bounds of [[county of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to [[County of Holland|Holland]], Germany, and France.<ref>A characteristic story was that one day two priests came from Paris to ask his opinion of their spiritual state, to be told: \"You are as holy as you wish to be!\" (Evelyn Underhill introduction to ''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''. Translation by C. A. Wynschenk.  London: J. M. Dent, 1916. p3)</ref> He had relations with the nearby Carthusian house at Herne, and also with several communities of Poor Clare Franciscans. We know that he had connections with the [[Friends of God]] in [[Strasbourg]], and also that in about 1378 he was visited by [[Geert Groote]], the founder of the [[Devotio Moderna]]. It is possible, though disputed, that [[John Tauler]] came to see him.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\nJohn died at Groenendaal, aged 82, on 2 December 1381.\n\n==Works==\nIn total, Ruysbroeck wrote twelve books, seven epistles, two hymns and a prayer. All were written in Middle Dutch.\n\nAround 1340, Ruysbroeck wrote his masterpiece, ''The Spiritual Espousals''. The 36 surviving Dutch manuscripts, as well as translations into Latin and Middle High German, are evidence of the book's popularity. Some of the text was also translated into Middle English (via the Latin translation) as ''The Chastising of God's Children'' (which was later printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rozenski|first1=Steven|title=''The Chastising of God\u2019s Children'' from manuscript to print|journal=\u00c9tudes anglaises|date=2013|volume=66|issue=3|pages=369\u201378|url=http://www.cairn.info/load_pdf.php?ID_ARTICLE=ETAN_663_0369|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> Around the same time, he also wrote a short treatise, ''The Sparkling Stone'',<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref> which was also translated into Middle English.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Arblaster|first1=Rob|last2=Faesen|first2=John|title=A Companion to John of Ruusbroec|date=2014|publisher=Brill|pages=243\u20134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ao6fAwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck's most famous writings were composed during his time in Groenendaal. His longest and most popular work (surviving today in 42 manuscripts), ''The Spiritual Tabernacle'' was begun in Brussels but finished at Groenendaal, presumably early on in his time there. Two brief works, ''The Christian Faith'' (an explanation of the Creed) and a treatise on ''The Four Temptations'', also date from around the time of Ruysbroeck's arrival in Groenendaal.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\nHis later works include four writings to Margareta van Meerbeke, a Franciscan nun of Brussels. These are ''The Seven Enclosures'' (c1346-50), the first of his seven surviving letters, ''The Seven Rungs'' (c1359-60), and ''A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness''.\n\nAround 1363 the Carthusians at Herne dispatched a deputation to Groenendaal presenting Ruysbroeck with questions on his first book, ''The Realm of Lovers''. Ruysbroeck went to Herne to clarify his teaching, and afterwards put this in writing in his work ''The Little Book of Enlightenment''.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n[[File:Ruysbroeck weg.JPG|thumb|Jan Ruysbroeck Weg sign on walls of his old monastery at Groenendaal.]]Of Ruysbroeck's works, the treatise ''The Seven Steps of the Ladder of Spiritual Love'' is the one that is currently most-readily available. Of the various treatises preserved, the best-known and the most characteristic is that entitled ''The Spiritual Espousals''. It is divided into three books, treating respectively of the active, the interior, and the contemplative life.\n\nLiterally, Ruysbroeck wrote as the spirit moved him. He loved to [[wander]] and [[meditation|meditate]] in the solitude of the forest adjoining the cloister; he was accustomed to carry a tablet with him, and on this to jot down his thoughts as he felt inspired so to do. Late in life he was able to declare that he had never committed aught to writing save by the motion of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nIn none of his treatises do we find anything like a complete or detailed account of his system; perhaps it would be correct to say that he himself was not conscious of elaborating any system. In his dogmatic writings he explains, illustrates, and enforces traditional teachings with remarkable force and lucidity. In his [[ascetism|ascetic]] works, his favourite virtues are [[detachment (philosophy)|detachment]], [[humility]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]; he loves to dwell on such themes as flight from the world, meditation upon the life of Christ, especially the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion,]] abandonment to the Divine Will, and an intense personal love of God.\n\nIn common with most of the German mystics, Ruysbroeck starts from divine matters before describing humanity. His work often then returns to discussing God, showing how the divine and the human are so closely united as to become one. He demonstrates inclinations towards [[Christian universalism]] in writing that \"Man, having proceeded from God is destined to return, and become one with Him again.\" But here he is careful to clarify his position: \"There where I assert that we are one in God, I must be understood in this sense that we are one in love, not in essence and nature.\" Despite this declaration, however, and other similar saving clauses scattered over his pages, some of Ruysbroeck's expressions are certainly rather unusual and startling. The sublimity of his subject-matter was such that it could scarcely be otherwise. His devoted friend, Gerard Groote, a trained theologian, confessed to a feeling of uneasiness over certain of his phrases and passages, and begged him to change or modify them for the sake at least of the weak. Later on, [[Jean Gerson]] and then [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] both professed to find traces of unconscious [[pantheism]] in his works. But as an offset we may mention the enthusiastic commendations of his contemporaries, Groote, [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]], [[John of Schoonhoven]], and in subsequent times of the [[Franciscan]] [[Henry van Herp]], the [[Carthusian]]s [[Denis the Carthusian|Denis]] and [[Laurentius Surius]], the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[Thomas \u00e1 Jesu]], the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Louis de Blois]], and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Leonardus Lessius]]. [[Ernest Hello]] and especially [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] have done much to make his writings known. Ruysbroeck was a powerful influence in developing [[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]]'s conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as expressed in his book of contemplations called ''[[V\u00e4gm\u00e4rken]]'' ('Markings').<ref>\"[t]he counterpoint to this enormously exposed and public life is Eckhart and Jan van Ruysbroek. They really give me balance and-a more necessary sense of humor.\" Henry P van Dusen. ''Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings''. Faber and Faber. London, 1967. pp49-50</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck insisted that the [[soul]] finds God in its own depths, and noted three stages of progress in what he called the spiritual ladder of Christian attainment: (1) the active life, (2) the inward life, (3) the contemplative life. He did not teach the fusion of the self in God, but held that at the summit of the ascent the soul still preserves its identity.<ref>\"Nevertheless neither is this unity one, but each of those established in singular grace and glory hold in themselves unity and their own function in accordance with their own dignity and nobility. But this unity is situated in the mind and in the form of all powers by means of the bond of love.\" Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. p134.</ref> In the ''Kingdom of the Lovers of God'' he explains that those seeking wisdom must \"flow forth on the waters to all the boundaries of the earth, that is, on compassion, pity and mercy shown to the needs of all men\", must \"fly in the air of the Rational faculty\" and \"refer all actions and virtues to the honour of God\"; thence (through grace) they will find an \"immense and boundless clearness\" bestowed upon their mind.<ref>Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. pp 82-83 and 163</ref> In relation to the contemplative life, he held that three attributes should be acquired: The first is spiritual freedom from worldly desires (\"as empty of every outward work as if he did not work at all\"), the second is a mind unencumbered with images (\"inward silence\"), and the third is a feeling of inward union with God (\"even as a burning and glowing fire which can never more be quenched\").<ref>''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''.

Dent, 1916. pp 89, 94 and 110</ref> His works, of which the most important were ''De vera contemplatione'' (\"On true contemplation\") and ''De septem gradibus amoris'' (\"On the seven steps of love\"), were published in 1848 at [[Hanover]]; also ''Reflections from the Mirror of a Mystic'' (1906) and ''Die Zierde der geistlichen Hochzeit'' (1901).\n[[Image:Jan Van Ruysbroeck.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of Jan van Ruysbroeck]]\n==Veneration==\nAfter John's death in 1381, his [[relic]]s were carefully preserved and his memory honoured as that of a [[saint]]. After his death, stories called him the ''Ecstatic Doctor'' or ''Divine Doctor'', and his views formed a link between the [[Friends of God]] and the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], the ideas which may have helped to bring about the Reformation.\n\nWhen Groenendaal Priory was suppressed by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1783, his relics were transferred to St. Gudule's, Brussels, where, however, they were lost during the [[French Revolution]]. John was beatified on 1 December 1908, by [[Pope]] [[Pius X]].\n\nNo authentic [[portrait]] of John is known to exist; but the traditional picture represents him in the canonical habit, seated in the forest with his writing tablet on his knee, as he was in fact found one day by the brethren\u2014rapt in ecstasy and enveloped in flames, which encircle without consuming the tree under which he is resting.\n\nThere is a secondary school called Jan van Ruusbroeckollege in Laeken near the Royal Palace of Belgium.\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe epigraph of the 1884 novel ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] has the following Ruysbroeck quotation: \"I must rejoice beyond the bounds of time ... though the world may shudder at my joy, and in its coarseness know not what I mean.\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages#Doctors in theology|List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages: Doctors in theology]]\n* [[Evelyn Underhill#Ruysbroeck (1914)|Evelyn Underhill's ''Ruysbroeck'']]\n* [[Hendrik Mande]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Modern editions===\n*''Jan van Ruusbroec: Opera Omnia'', ed.

Some of his main literary works include ''The Kingdom of the Divine Lovers, The Twelve Beguines, The Spiritual Espousals, A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness, The Little Book of Enlightenment'', and ''The Sparkling Stone''. Some of his letters also survive, as well as several short sayings (recorded by some of his disciples, such as Jan van Leeuwen). He wrote in the Dutch vernacular, the language of the common people of the Low Countries, rather than in Latin, the language of the Church liturgy and official texts, in order to reach a wider audience.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Until his ordination===\nJohn had a devout mother, who brought him up in the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic faith]]; of his father we know nothing. John's [[surname]], ''Van Ruusbroec'', is not a surname in the modern sense but a [[toponym]] that refers to his native [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]; modern-day [[Ruisbroek, Flemish Brabant|Ruisbroek]] near [[Brussels]] (compare [[John of Salisbury]] or [[Democritus of Abdera]]).\n\nAt the age of eleven he left his mother, departing without leave or warning, to place himself under the guidance and [[Tutor|tuition]] of his uncle, [[Jan Hinckaert]], a [[canon regular]] of [[Gudula|St. Gudule's]], Brussels. Hinckaert was living according to his Apostolic views with a fellow-canon, [[Frank van Coudenberg]].  This uncle provided for Ruysbroeck's education with a view to the [[priesthood]]. In due course, John was presented with a [[prebendary|prebend]] in [[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral|St. Gudule's church]], and ordained in 1318. His mother had followed him to Brussels, entered a [[Beguines|B\u00e9guinage]] there, and died shortly before his [[ordination]].\n\n===Priest in Brussels===\nFrom 1318 until 1343 Ruysbroeck served as a parish priest at St Gudula. He continued to lead, together with his uncle Hinckaert and Van Coudenberg, a life of extreme austerity and retirement. At that time the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] were causing controversy in the Netherlands and one of them, a woman named [[Heilwige Bloemardinne]], was particularly active in Brussels, propagating her beliefs chiefly by means of popular pamphlets. Ruysbroeck responded with pamphlets also written in the native tongue ([[Middle Dutch]]). Nothing of these treatises remains.  The controversy had a permanent effect on Ruysbroeck: his later writings bear constant reference, direct and indirect, to the [[heresy|heretical]] views expressed in these times, and he always wrote in the country's native language, chiefly with a view to counteracting these writings which he viewed as heretical.\n\n===Priest in Groenendaal===\n[[File:Ruysbroeck chapel.JPG|thumb|Small chapel in the forest at Groenendaal near the monastery where Ruysbroeck contemplated]]The desire for a more retired life, and possibly also the persecution which followed Ruysbroeck's attack on Bloemardinne, induced Ruysbroeck, Jan Hinckaert (d. 1350) and Vrank van Coudenberg (d. 1386) to leave Brussels in 1343 for the [[Groenendael Priory|hermitage of Groenendaal]], in the neighbouring [[Sonian Forest]], which was made over to them by [[John III, Duke of Brabant]]. The ruins of the monastery are still present in the forest of Soignes.<ref>Michel Erkins. ''De Priorij van Groenendaal''. Gemeentehuis. Jan van Ruusbroecpark. Hoeilaart. 2007.</ref>\n\nBut here so many disciples joined the little company that it was found expedient to organize into a duly-authorized religious body. The hermitage was erected into a community of canons regular on 13 March 1349, and eventually it became the motherhouse of a congregation, which bore its name of Groenendaal. Francis van Coudenberg was appointed first [[provost (religion)|provost]], and Blessed John Ruysbroeck [[prior]]. Hinckaert refrained from making the canonical profession lest the discipline of the house should suffer from the exemptions required by the infirmities of his old age; he dwelt, therefore, in a cell outside the [[cloister]] and there a few years later died.\n\nThis period, from his religious profession (1349) to his death (1381), was the most active and fruitful of Ruysbroeck's career. During this time, his fame as a man of God, as a sublime contemplative and a skilled director of souls, spread beyond the bounds of [[county of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to [[County of Holland|Holland]], Germany, and France.<ref>A characteristic story was that one day two priests came from Paris to ask his opinion of their spiritual state, to be told: \"You are as holy as you wish to be!\" (Evelyn Underhill introduction to ''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''. Translation by C. A. Wynschenk.  London: J. M. Dent, 1916. p3)</ref> He had relations with the nearby Carthusian house at Herne, and also with several communities of Poor Clare Franciscans. We know that he had connections with the [[Friends of God]] in [[Strasbourg]], and also that in about 1378 he was visited by [[Geert Groote]], the founder of the [[Devotio Moderna]]. It is possible, though disputed, that [[John Tauler]] came to see him.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\nJohn died at Groenendaal, aged 82, on 2 December 1381.\n\n==Works==\nIn total, Ruysbroeck wrote twelve books, seven epistles, two hymns and a prayer. All were written in Middle Dutch.\n\nAround 1340, Ruysbroeck wrote his masterpiece, ''The Spiritual Espousals''. The 36 surviving Dutch manuscripts, as well as translations into Latin and Middle High German, are evidence of the book's popularity. Some of the text was also translated into Middle English (via the Latin translation) as ''The Chastising of God's Children'' (which was later printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rozenski|first1=Steven|title=''The Chastising of God\u2019s Children'' from manuscript to print|journal=\u00c9tudes anglaises|date=2013|volume=66|issue=3|pages=369\u201378|url=http://www.cairn.info/load_pdf.php?ID_ARTICLE=ETAN_663_0369|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> Around the same time, he also wrote a short treatise, ''The Sparkling Stone'',<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref> which was also translated into Middle English.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Arblaster|first1=Rob|last2=Faesen|first2=John|title=A Companion to John of Ruusbroec|date=2014|publisher=Brill|pages=243\u20134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ao6fAwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck's most famous writings were composed during his time in Groenendaal. His longest and most popular work (surviving today in 42 manuscripts), ''The Spiritual Tabernacle'' was begun in Brussels but finished at Groenendaal, presumably early on in his time there. Two brief works, ''The Christian Faith'' (an explanation of the Creed) and a treatise on ''The Four Temptations'', also date from around the time of Ruysbroeck's arrival in Groenendaal.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\nHis later works include four writings to Margareta van Meerbeke, a Franciscan nun of Brussels. These are ''The Seven Enclosures'' (c1346-50), the first of his seven surviving letters, ''The Seven Rungs'' (c1359-60), and ''A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness''.\n\nAround 1363 the Carthusians at Herne dispatched a deputation to Groenendaal presenting Ruysbroeck with questions on his first book, ''The Realm of Lovers''. Ruysbroeck went to Herne to clarify his teaching, and afterwards put this in writing in his work ''The Little Book of Enlightenment''.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n[[File:Ruysbroeck weg.JPG|thumb|Jan Ruysbroeck Weg sign on walls of his old monastery at Groenendaal.]]Of Ruysbroeck's works, the treatise ''The Seven Steps of the Ladder of Spiritual Love'' is the one that is currently most-readily available. Of the various treatises preserved, the best-known and the most characteristic is that entitled ''The Spiritual Espousals''. It is divided into three books, treating respectively of the active, the interior, and the contemplative life.\n\nLiterally, Ruysbroeck wrote as the spirit moved him. He loved to [[wander]] and [[meditation|meditate]] in the solitude of the forest adjoining the cloister; he was accustomed to carry a tablet with him, and on this to jot down his thoughts as he felt inspired so to do. Late in life he was able to declare that he had never committed aught to writing save by the motion of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nIn none of his treatises do we find anything like a complete or detailed account of his system; perhaps, it would be correct to say that he himself was not conscious of elaborating any system. In his dogmatic writings he explains, illustrates, and enforces traditional teachings with remarkable force and lucidity. In his [[ascetism|ascetic]] works, his favourite virtues are [[detachment (philosophy)|detachment]], [[humility]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]; he loves to dwell on such themes as flight from the world, meditation upon the Life, especially the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], abandonment to the Divine Will, and an intense personal love of God.\n\nIn common with most of the German mystics, Ruysbroeck starts from divine matters before describing humanity. His work often then returns to discussing God, showing how the divine and the human are so closely united as to become one. He demonstrates inclinations towards [[Christian universalism]] in writing that \"Man, having proceeded from God is destined to return, and become one with Him again.\" But here he is careful to clarify his position: \"There where I assert that we are one in God, I must be understood in this sense that we are one in love, not in essence and nature.\" Despite this declaration, however, and other similar saving clauses scattered over his pages, some of Ruysbroeck's expressions are certainly rather unusual and startling. The sublimity of his subject-matter was such that it could scarcely be otherwise. His devoted friend, Gerard Groote, a trained theologian, confessed to a feeling of uneasiness over certain of his phrases and passages, and begged him to change or modify them for the sake at least of the weak. Later on, [[Jean Gerson]] and then [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] both professed to find traces of unconscious [[pantheism]] in his works. But as an offset we may mention the enthusiastic commendations of his contemporaries, Groote, [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]], [[John of Schoonhoven]], and in subsequent times of the [[Franciscan]] [[Henry van Herp]], the [[Carthusian]]s [[Denis the Carthusian|Denis]] and [[Laurentius Surius]], the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[Thomas \u00e1 Jesu]], the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Louis de Blois]], and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Leonardus Lessius]]. [[Ernest Hello]] and especially [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] have done much to make his writings known. Ruysbroeck was a powerful influence in developing [[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]]'s conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as expressed in his book of contemplations called ''[[V\u00e4gm\u00e4rken]]'' ('Markings').<ref>\"[t]he counterpoint to this enormously exposed and public life is Eckhart and Jan van Ruysbroek. They really give me balance and-a more necessary sense of humor.\" Henry P van Dusen. ''Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings''. Faber and Faber. London, 1967. pp49-50</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck insisted that the [[soul]] finds God in its own depths, and noted three stages of progress in what he called the spiritual ladder of Christian attainment: (1) the active life, (2) the inward life, (3) the contemplative life. He did not teach the fusion of the self in God, but held that at the summit of the ascent the soul still preserves its identity.<ref>\"Nevertheless neither is this unity one, but each of those established in singular grace and glory hold in themselves unity and their own function in accordance with their own dignity and nobility. But this unity is situated in the mind and in the form of all powers by means of the bond of love.\" Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. p134.</ref> In the ''Kingdom of the Lovers of God'' he explains that those seeking wisdom must \"flow forth on the waters to all the boundaries of the earth, that is, on compassion, pity and mercy shown to the needs of all men\", must \"fly in the air of the Rational faculty\" and \"refer all actions and virtues to the honour of God\"; thence (through grace) they will find an \"immense and boundless clearness\" bestowed upon their mind.<ref>Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. pp 82-83 and 163</ref> In relation to the contemplative life, he held that three attributes should be acquired: The first is spiritual freedom from worldly desires (\"as empty of every outward work as if he did not work at all\"), the second is a mind unencumbered with images (\"inward silence\"), and the third is a feeling of inward union with God (\"even as a burning and glowing fire which can never more be quenched\").<ref>''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''.

After his death, stories called him the ''Ecstatic Doctor'' or ''Divine Doctor'', and his views formed a link between the [[Friends of God]] and the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], the ideas which may have helped to bring about the Reformation.\n\nWhen Groenendaal Priory was suppressed by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1783, his relics were transferred to St. Gudule's, Brussels, where, however, they were lost during the [[French Revolution]]. John was beatified on 1 December 1908, by [[Pope]] [[Pius X]].\n\nNo authentic [[portrait]] of John is known to exist; but the traditional picture represents him in the canonical habit, seated in the forest with his writing tablet on his knee, as he was in fact found one day by the brethren\u2014rapt in ecstasy and enveloped in flames, which encircle without consuming the tree under which he is resting.\n\nThere is a secondary school called Jan van Ruusbroeckollege in Laeken near the Royal Palace of Belgium.\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe epigraph of the 1884 novel ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] has the following Ruysbroeck quotation: \"I must rejoice beyond the bounds of time...though the world may shudder at my joy, and in its coarseness know not what I mean.\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages#Doctors in theology|List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages: Doctors in theology]]\n* [[Evelyn Underhill#Ruysbroeck (1914)|Evelyn Underhill's ''Ruysbroeck'']]\n* [[Hendrik Mande]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Modern editions===\n*''Jan van Ruusbroec: Opera Omnia'', ed.
