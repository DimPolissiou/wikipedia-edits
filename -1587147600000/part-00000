Austin]], who was an [[Anglo-American]] colonizer of [[Mexican Texas]]. As a teenager, Williams started working in the family's mercantile business in [[Baltimore]]. He spent time in South America and [[New Orleans]], fleeing the latter because of debts. He landed in Mexican Texas in 1822, having learned French and Spanish. Stephen F. Austin hired Williams for his colony in 1824. Williams first worked as a [[clerk]], and later assumed the title of secretary to the ''[[ayuntamiento]]'', a local government established for the colony by the Mexican state of [[Coahuila and Texas]].  He worked for Austin for about a decade.\n\nIn 1834, Williams quit as secretary of the Austin Colony to work as a merchant, then formalized a partnership with [[Thomas F. McKinney]]. The next year he also made deals with the provincial government in [[Monclova]] for a bank charter and for large tracts of land in Texas. At that time he was a representative in the Coahuila and Texas legislature. However, by 1836, Williams and his partner, Thomas F. McKinney, supported the [[Texas Revolution]] against Mexico. Williams borrowed money against his family's lines of credit, which the partners applied to ships and ammunition on behalf of the rebel government.\n\nAfter Texas gained [[Texas independence|independence]], Williams focused most of his business activities in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], and represented Galveston County for one term in the Republic of Texas legislature.  Through his partnership with McKinney he was invested in the Galveston City Company, and established diverse business interests there. The partnership ended when their business was acquired by [[Henry Howell Williams]] in 1842.\n\nAfter 1842, Williams worked toward establishing a bank in Texas. He briefly returned to public service when he accepted a diplomatic mission to negotiate a treaty with Mexico, which had still not recognized the sovereignty of the [[Republic of Texas]]. In the first year of Texas statehood, he ran twice for the U.S. House of Representatives, losing both times. In 1848 Williams succeeded in introducing the first bank in Texas: the Commercial & Agricultural Bank (C & A Bank).  This was the only institution to legally issue paper money, though his charter and the bank's practices faced legal challenges throughout its existence, including anti-banking legislation and scrutiny from various [[Texas Attorney General|Texas Attorneys General]]. Favorable decisions rendered by the district courts saved Williams and his bank for about four years. C & A Bank remained solvent during the [[Panic of 1857]], but anti-banking politics were on the rise. Many of Williams' friends and allies distanced themselves from the bank and encouraged him to give up the project, but he resisted their advice.  He died in 1858 after a short illness.  \n\n==Early life==\nSamuel May Williams was born October 4, 1795, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to Howell and Dorothy (Wheat) Williams.<ref name=tsha>Henson (2010).</ref><ref name=nichols190>Nichols (1952), pp. 190{{endash}}191.</ref><ref name=\"henson5\">Henson (1976), p. 5.</ref> His ancestors arrived in [[New England]] in the 1630s, and his family tree included a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and a president of [[Yale University]].<ref name=frantz>Frantz (1952), pp. 2{{endash}}3.</ref> Williams had four brothers and three sisters.<ref name=tsha/> His immediate family consisted of sailors and merchants; Howell Williams was a ship captain, and Samuel's uncle, Nathaniel Felton Williams, was a commission merchant in [[Baltimore]]. After some schooling in his native city, Samuel apprenticed to Nathaniel. A younger brother, also named Nathaniel Felton Williams, succeeded him as their uncle Nathaniel's apprentice.<ref name=\"henson5\"/>\n\nThe Williams family conducted a robust trade with Argentina, shipping food in exchange for cash or hides.<ref name=\"cartwright60\">Cartwright (1998), p. 60.</ref> Williams left Baltimore to oversee freight bound for [[Buenos Aires]], where he stayed to conduct further business in South America.<ref name=tsha/><ref name=nichols190/> There Williams learned the Spanish and French languages, and his business dealings gave him experience in navigating Spanish business and political customs.<ref name=\"cartwright60\"/> In 1818, Williams boarded at a hotel in Washington, D. C. (where pirate and New Orleans denizen [[Jean Lafitte]] had been a resident), and the next year, Williams was living and working in New Orleans.<ref name=\"henson1976-6\">Henson (1976), pp. 6{{endash}}7.</ref> Historians disagree about the timing of Williams's return to the United States from South America. While Joe B. Frantz and Ruth G. Nichols estimate his arrival to New Orleans as the year 1815,<ref name=nichols190/><ref>Frantz (1952), p. 2.</ref> Margaret Swett Henson disputes this as a possibility, though she is less certain about timeline.<ref name=\"henson1976-6\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Gone to Texas===\nThe [[Panic of 1819]] in the United States forced many Americans into insolvency. By 1822, the opening of Mexican Texas to Anglo-colonization offered these distressed families an opportunity to escape debts by moving outside the jurisdiction of American law. Sometimes these debtors abandoned their property and wrote the letters \"GTT\" on their doors, an acronym for [[Gone to Texas]].<ref name=\"henson3\">Henson (1976), p. 3.</ref> Though Williams sold tobacco to the [[Karankawa people]] on [[Galveston Island]] in 1821,<ref>Cartwright (1991), p. 58.</ref> he joined the ranks of the immigrant debtors in May 1822. He and a female companion left New Orleans and the United States to escape debts and poor economic prospects. They registered under the names of Mr. and Mrs. E. Eccleston, and passed over the gangplanks of the [[sloop]] ''Good Intent''. The sailing ship met a storm in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and finally made landfall at the mouth of the [[Colorado River]] on June 18.<ref name=\"henson3\"/> \n\nAt this time Texas was a part of Mexico. [[Moses Austin]] had negotiated a contract to colonize part of Texas, but his death in 1821 put the deal in limbo. As Williams first arrived in Texas, [[Stephen F. Austin]], the son of Moses Austin, traveled to [[Mexico City]] in order to reinstate the contract and facilitate implementation of the Austin Colony. During Austin's visit, word reached Mexico City of a Mr. Eccleston, who was literate in English, Spanish, and French. By late 1823, Austin had returned to Texas and met Eccleston, who had established a local reputation by clerking and teaching school. Austin hired him in November. This is around the time that Williams reverted to his birth name. For a time both Williams and Austin had lived and worked in the same area of New Orleans, but there is no direct evidence that they had known each other prior to their meeting in 1823.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 3{{endash}}5.</ref>\n\n===Stephen F. Austin Colony===\n{{Main|Old Three Hundred}}\n[[File:San felipe de austin shs cabin 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Replica log cabin representative of 1820s and 1830s Texas at San Felipe, Texas|Replica log cabin at San Felipe de Austin Historic Site]]\nWilliams was with Austin when the new empresario selected a location for his colonial headquarters, [[San Felipe de Austin]]. Austin first hired Williams as a translator and clerk, whose language skills, both in English and Spanish, were necessary to fulfill his responsibilities. Another critical skill was his handwriting. In an era when all documents were written by hand, the ability to write legibly was critical to properly reading them later.  Williams' knowledge of Mexican culture and Spanish business practices were also assets.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 9{{endash}}10.</ref> In the fall of 1824, Austin appointed Williams as a recording secretary for the [[Old Three Hundred|Austin Colony]]. Though [[Mexico]] had not yet established an ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' (local government) in the colony, Austin had told [[Jose Antonio Saucedo]] about his intention to establish the recording secretary position with all of the responsibilities of a secretary for an ''ayuntamiento''.<ref>Barker (1926), p. 117.</ref> Also in 1824, Williams received his own [[headright]], which included two leagues (about 4,428 acres each) and three ''labores'' (about 640 acres each). Austin had promised Williams an annual salary of $1,000, ($24,434 in 2019) but the colony was not generating much revenue.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 11{{endash}}13.</ref>\n\nWilliams continued to accept additional responsibilities at the Austin Colony. He managed the Public Land Office, and he served as its postmaster from 1826. He served as secretary of the ''ayuntamiento'' from 1828 to 1832,<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 192{{endash}}194.</ref> a post requiring him to record official documents in Spanish and send them to the state government.<ref name=henson1992>Henson (1992), p. 4.</ref> Austin later claimed that Williams had been underpaid for his service and later compensated him with {{convert|49000|acre|sqkm}} of land in Texas.<ref name=tsha/> With his existing land grant of {{convert|9387|acre|sqkm}}, Williams had accumulated more than {{convert|58000|acre|sqkm}} of land in Texas.<ref name=henson1992/>\n\n===After the Austin Colony===\nEarly in 1834 Williams co-founded the partnership of McKinney and Williams, setting up a warehouse at [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]], then relocated to [[Quintana, Texas|Quintana]] at the mouth of the [[Brazos River]]. The firm operated small steamboats on the Brazos and used its warehouse to manage transfer of freight to and from the larger ships operating on the Gulf of Mexico.<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 198{{endash}}199.</ref>\n\nAn internal political battle in Mexico caused the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas|Coahuila and Texas]] to split into two capitals. Those loyal to [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] (''santanistas'') controlled the original capital, [[Saltillo]], while the rival ''federalistas'' established their capital at [[Monclova]]. During meetings at the state capital, Williams bought 100 [[league (unit)|leagues]] of land in northeast Texas from the Monclova government at an eighty percent discount. During the trip he also secured a bank charter, while selling $85,000 worth of its stock.<ref>Cartwright (1991), p. 61.</ref> However, back in Anglo-Texas, [[Consultation (Texas)|the Consultation]] nullified the land deal when it declared all large land grants voided in November 1835.<ref>Henson (1992), p. 5.</ref>\n\nIn 1835, Williams was elected as a delegate to the Coahuila and Texas Legislature, representing the district of Brazos.<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 196.</ref> That legislature offered for sale 3.5 million acres of land in the Mexican state, an action which many Texians (ethnic Anglos living in Mexican Texas) perceived as corrupt. His participation in the Monclova government aroused the resentment of such persons, many of whom were already suspicious of Williams because of his former position of power in granting land in the Austin Colony. From the perspective of Williams, a member of the federalist Monclova government, the massive land sale was a justified state action in defense of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]], which was challenged by Santa Anna and the Saltillo government. The Monclova government was raising money to prepare for a possible civil war in Coahuila.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 62{{endash}}63.</ref>\n\n===Texas independence===\n[[File:Wreck of the Invincible.jpg|thumb|alt=Artist's depiction of the Invincible as wrecked in 1837|''Invincible'' depicted as wrecked in 1837]]\nWith ''santanista'' [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos|General Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] marching from Saltillo, the Monclova legislature ended its session in late-May 1835 with most of its members fleeing the region. Many of the federalists were captured, including Williams who was taken after crossing the [[Rio Grande River]] at [[Presidio|Presidio, Texas]]. He was incarcerated at [[San Antonio]], but escaped on horseback in a plot engineered by his friend, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro]]. Williams arrived in San Felipe de Austin as an enemy of Santa Anna and Cos. At the same time, his actions in Monclova made him unpopular with Anglos in Texas.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 73{{endash}}75.</ref>\n\nWilliams went on a tour of the eastern United States in order to raise capital for his bank.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 79.</ref> Williams was selling stock in [[New York City|New York]] when he read about a possible war in Texas. He pivoted toward [[Texas independence]] while relying on financial assistance from his brother, Henry Howell Williams. He borrowed against his brother's credit to obtain the 125-ton schooner [[Texan schooner Invincible|''Invincible'']] in support of a Texian naval force.<ref>Cartwright (1991), pp. 63{{endash}}64.</ref> In May 1836, Williams returned with ammunition and supplies loaded on his schooner, along with as many as 700 volunteers on three other boats.<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 200.</ref> Mostly as a result of procurements Williams made in the United States in 1835, the McKinney and Williams partnership had contracted $99,000 in short-term debt on behalf of the [[Republic of Texas]]. The new government was not able to repay the debt.<ref name=frantz/><ref>Henson (1992), pp. 8{{endash}}9.</ref> These loans to the Texas cause had been leveraged by letters of credit from Henry Howell Williams. Thus the Republic of Texas mounted substantial debt from the account of the McKinney and Williams partnership, which in turn had at least of portion of its financial backing from Henry Howell Williams. After independence, Williams served the Republic of Texas as its loan commissioner while serving simultaneously as a procurement officer for the Texas Navy, serving both the [[Sam Houston]] and [[Mirabeau Lamar]] administrations.<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 203.</ref>\n\n===Galveston===\n====Mercantile business====\n[[File:Sb new york.png|thumb|alt=1842 advertisement for a steam packet line, with McKinney and Williams listed as agents|Advertisement for the steamer ''New York'' (via Portal to Texas History)]]\n[[File:Galveston wharf fees18Feb43.png|thumb|right|alt=1843 rates at the Galveston Wharf|Rates at the Galveston Wharf, 1843 (via Portal to Texas History)]]\n[[File:Galveston strand adv1844.png|thumb|alt=1844 advertisement|An 1844 advertisement jeweler near McKinney and Williams (via Portal to Texas History)]]\n[[File:Plan of the City of Galveston, Texas.jpg|thumb|alt=1845 Galveston map|Map of Galveston, circa 1845]]\nMcKinney and Williams were investors and co-founders of the Galveston City Company with [[Michel Branamour Menard|Michel B. Menard]]. Menard hatched the development scheme in 1833, coordinating to acquire a Mexican title to bayside land at the east end of Galveston Island from [[Juan Seguin]]. The next year Galveston City Company purchased from Seguin a ''[[Spanish customary units#League (unit of area)|league]] and a [[Spanish customary units#Labor (unit of area)|labor]]'', or about 4,605 acres.<ref name=mccomb42>McComb (1986), pp. 42{{endash}}43.</ref><ref>Henson (1976), p. 94.</ref> The McKinney and Williams investment was initially a fifty-percent share.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 94.</ref> In December 1836, the Republic of Texas announced it would validate this title in exchange for $50,000 in cash or merchandise. While there is no evidence of any payment to the Texas government, this action transferred land on the east end of the island to the Galveston City Company.<ref>Cartwright (1991), pp. 71{{endash}}72.</ref><ref name=mccomb42/> Both Williams and McKinney joined the company's board of directors, and voted with the board to make lots available for sale on April 20, 1838.<ref>McComb (1986), p. 43.</ref> \n\nMcKinney and Williams relocated its headquarters from Quintana to Galveston in 1838. The firm already operated a diverse set of businesses on the island: they owned a race track, operated a tavern and stables, and offered houses for let,<ref name=\":0\" /> and they owned the Tremont hotel, for which Henry Howell Williams was the managing partner.  The Tremont continued operating in Galveston through 1865.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />  Their principal developments were their three-story warehouse and the wharf at Twenty-fourth Street.<ref name=\":0\">Henson (1976), p. 105.</ref> In 1839, McKinney and Williams received goods from [[Liverpool]], [[England]], and loaded the same ship with Texas [[cotton]], establishing direct trade between England and the Republic of Texas.<ref name=\":1\">Nichols (1952), pp. 204{{endash}}205.</ref> McKinney and Williams divested their commission business in 1842, selling it to Henry Howell Williams, who ran it as a division of his commission house in Baltimore.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 115.</ref>\n\nIn 1839, Williams represented [[Galveston County, Texas|Galveston County]] in the lower house of the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]].<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 206.</ref> McKinney and Williams used their commission house to support the Williams campaign. They offered to buy Texas Treasury notes (redbacks) for 50 cents on the dollar just as rival commission houses offered only 37.5 cents on the dollar.<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 76.</ref> Substantively, he campaigned based on a conservative monetary policy in response to the Republic's devaluing currency.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 105\u2013109.</ref> \n\nWilliams once used his position in the House to assert the interests of the Galveston City Company, challenging the election of [[John M. Allen (soldier)|John M. Allen]], the town's first mayor. He led the passage of a bill to change Galveston's charter, which imposed a requirement of land ownership in order to vote in municipal elections. Effectively this reduced the number of eligible voters by half, and this paved the way for the \"conservatives\" to elect John W. Walton over the \"liberal\" John M. Allen in 1840. Allen transported the town's archives and stored them in his home, which was guarded by two artillery pieces. McKinney recruited a group of men to recapture the archives, and Allen surrendered them without incident.<ref>McComb (1986), pp. 43{{endash}}44.</ref>\n    \nWilliams chaired the finance committee for the lower house, and served as a member of the naval affairs committee. Williams allied with [[Sam Houston]]'s faction against President [[Mirabeau Lamar]]'s spending proposals and his Indian policy. He issued a finance report and proposal on January 12, 1840, which included two Hamiltonian recommendations: the recall of older debt instruments and stopping further issuance of unsecured debt. In addition, he proposed that Texas only accept payments in cash from importers and suggested a broad fifteen percent tariff on imported goods. This proposal was a political success, as all of its recommendations were adopted. However, inflation continued into 1841, as Texas redbacks traded at 37.5 cents on the dollar before he went to Austin and later depreciated to 12.5 cents. He sponsored a successful bill which established a state charter for the city of Galveston and another to build a local lighthouse. Williams promoted a bill to emancipate Cary McKinney, a slave of his business partner. Cary was just one of two enslaved persons emancipated in recognition of service to the Republic of Texas. Though Cary's family was not emancipated, he was able to reunite his family by purchased his family members himself.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 105\u2013109.</ref>\n\nPresident Sam Houston selected Williams for a diplomatic mission to Mexico. As late as 1843, Mexico did not recognize the sovereignty of Texas, while Santa Anna offered a general amnesty and other concessions to Texas provided it agreed to re-incorporate itself into Mexico. Houston agreed to a cease fire and peace talks. He appointed Williams and [[George Washington Hockley|George W. Hockley]] as envoys, charging them with entertaining a proposal which was unpopular in Texas.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 116{{endash}}118.</ref> The two envoys accepted their official orders in September 1843, but they lacked the authority to stand behind their own agreements, which would be subject to approval by the President and the Texas Congress. According to the Secretary of State, [[Anson Jones]], their job was to extend the process as long as possible. Meanwhile, unknown to Williams and Hockley, Texas negotiated an annexation treaty with the United States and appealed for sovereign recognition from Great Britain. The Texas War Department, on the other hand, instructed them to demand demilitarization of the [[Nueces Strip]], the corridor in south Texas between the Rio Grande and [[Nueces River|Nueces]] rivers. Diplomatically, Mexico claimed all of Texas as its sovereign territory; militarily, Mexico fortified at the Nueces River. Withdrawing from the Nueces Strip was an untenable position for Mexico, though Jones had told them that Mexico would agree to it. Williams and Hockley sailed for [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] in early October, but the venue changed to [[Sabinas]] while they were in transit. After arriving, an illness postponed the meetings, so negotiations did not start until December. Their counterparts, Cayetano Montero and Alexander Ybara, did not consent to the Texans' proposal that Mexico withdraw troops beyond the Rio Grande River.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 120{{endash}}125.</ref>\n\nWilliams acquired a sugar plantation in 1844. This 1,100 acre parcel was located near the coast and west of Quintana, at the San Bernard River. Joseph and Austin Williams, two of his sons, managed the plantation for a brief period before its sale in 1850.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 149.</ref> \n\nWilliams ran for US Congress twice. A special election in 1846 was necessary to determine representation for Texas for the few months remaining of the Twenty-ninth Congress. Williams was one of six candidates for the Texas Second district while running on a platform of national assumption of Texas's debt. Texans would benefit from the passage of such legislation; however, Williams and his former business partner had not been repaid by the Republic of Texas for its war debt. He finished second to [[Timothy Pillsbury]]. He challenged Pillsbury for the seat in November and lost by a wider margin; it was the last time he ran for public office.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 132{{endash}}137.</ref>\n\n====Commercial and Agricultural Bank====\n[[File:Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas $1.00 (one dollar) private scrip (8519862080).jpg|thumb|alt=One dollar scrip issued by the Commercial & Agricultural Bank|$1.00 (one dollar) private scrip issued by Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas]]\n[[File:Galveston island 1853.png|thumb|alt=1853 map of Galveston|Map of 1853 showing eastern entrance to Galveston Bay and the east end of Galveston Island (via Portal to Texas History]]\nWilliams was president of the first incorporated bank to operate in Texas. The Commercial and Agricultural Bank opened in Galveston on December 30, 1847, and later established a branch in [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], as well as agencies in New Orleans, New York City, and [[Akron, Ohio]]. Williams continued as the bank's president until his death.<ref>Nichols, pp. 208{{endash}}210.</ref> Williams exploited his latent 1835 Mexican bank charter and an old resolution from the Republic of Texas. He had permission to open a bank during the Texas Republic, but did not use this privilege. The Texas bank inspector, Niles F. Smith, never had an opportunity to execute his duties in 1837, but he was never officially relieved of his appointed post. Williams recalled inspector Smith in 1847, who certified the bank's assets in Galveston, New Orleans, and New York. Williams operated out of a building at the corner of Market and Tremont streets.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nThree months later the Texas Legislature proscribed the distribution of paper money, creating a civil fine of $5,000 per offense. Despite this law, $30,000 of the Commercial & Agricultural bank notes had been circulating in New Orleans that year, with another $18,000 distributed in Texas. Meanwhile, Williams maintained a large cache of specie to cover redemptions of his notes. Two members of the Texas Congress headed an opposition to the C & A Bank: [[Guy M. Bryan]] and [[Elisha M. Pease]]. Attorney General and Pease-ally John W. Harris filed a lawsuit against Williams, who retained Galveston-attorney, [[Ebenezer Allen (Texas politician)|Ebenezer C. Allen]]. Harris filed a total of four suits against Williams with $75,000 in fines. In 1849, a District Court ruled that an 1841 law that gave Williams banking privileges was still valid.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 141\u2013144.</ref>\n\nIn 1849, Williams gained an ally in the state congress. His former partner in the mercantile trade, Thomas McKinney gained a seat in the lower house and sought to repeal the 1848 banking laws. McKinney also found common cause with Williams in relation to the incoming Attorney General, [[Andrew Jackson Hamilton]]. For McKinney it was personal, and for Williams it was business. Hamilton had prosecuted the case against Williams in district court and was then the official in charge of enforcing the 1848 banking act. McKinney took over as chairman of a special investigations committee, which determined that Hamilton had failed to report \"widespread corruption\". After the legislature passed a reform bill to change the office of Attorney General into an elected one, McKinney campaigned for the election of Ebenezer C. Allen, Williams's lawyer.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 144\u2013145.</ref>\n\nLiquidity in Galveston conferred an advantage for local business interests to finance large infrastructure projects. The C & A bank financed the Galveston and Brazos Navigation Company, chartered in 1850. The company cut a channel through the shallow, sandy bottoms, from the coast at the west end of Galveston Island to the mouth of the Brazos River.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 147.</ref>\n\nIn March 1852, the Texas Supreme Court ruled on the state's appeal in the Williams case. The prosecution strategy was based on challenging the legality of the charter, but the court affirmed the 1835 charter and the 1841 relief law. In response to the decision, Bryan and Hamilton devised a new strategy, emphasizing the illegality of paper money issuance, and fining anyone who issued or circulated paper money. By the end of the year, a new attorney general, [[Thomas J. Jennings]] sued officers of the C & A Bank, though it was dismissed by District Judge [[Peter W. Gray]]. Jennings continued to file similar suits against two Galveston financiers into the next year, while Gray continued to dismiss them.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 151\u2013153.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1857, District Judge Gray fined [[Robert G. Mills]] $100,000 after a jury found him guilty of violating the 1848 banking act. The jury in the Williams trial was deadlocked, but his legal team recommended that he consent to a fine of $2,000 with a guilty plea. A few weeks later, Gray lost his election bid for the Texas Supreme Court to [[Oran M. Roberts]], with the court seating an anti-banking, pro-agrarian judge. The political climate did not favor Williams and his banking interests in 1857, but an economic panic was a greater threat. A bank closed for business in New York that August, and by October, three banks in New Orleans stopped paying in specie. This triggered a mass of demands for redemptions at both Galveston banks, which prompted Williams to refuse to honor some depositors' checks. An early closing triggered a sharp discount on his bank notes, but local fears were allayed after local merchants honored the Williams notes at par, and Williams reversed his policy, resuming payments in specie. Williams survived the Panic of 1857. However, political and legal prospects for his bank did not improve. Williams persisted in the banking business despite the legal challenges, and he resisted the advice of family and friends to divest of C & A Bank.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 156\u2013161.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Family life===\nIn 1822, Williams and a female companion arrived in Texas under the assumed names of Mr. and Mrs. E. Eccleston.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 3.</ref> He left unresolved debt in New Orleans, but there may have been other reasons for his departure. The couple lived together in San Felipe de Austin, but there is no indication of their marital status or even her name. They had a son together named Joseph Guadalupe Victoria Williams, who was born in San Felipe de Austin in 1825. The next year Williams split up with her, and she left the colony, taking their son with her. After her death, Williams brought Joseph back to Texas and raised him as a member of his family.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 7{{endash}}8.</ref>\n\nWilliams married Sarah Patterson Scott on March 4, 1828, at San Felipe de Austin. A native of [[Kentucky]], she emigrated to Texas with her parents William and Mary Scott in 1824. Sarah Williams gave birth to nine children, five of whom survived to adulthood.<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 195{{endash}}196.</ref> By 1829, Samuel and Sarah Williams were caring for two children: their newborn daughter Sophia Caroline Williams and his four-year-old son \"Vic\" from the previous relationship. By 1830, Williams had already moved his family from ''Calle Commercio'' to a lot on the outskirts of town, and added onto this wood-framed house, then finished it with locally milled siding and brick, and with imported sash from New Orleans. In addition to his annual salary of $1,000, he received a seven-league bonus in 1830 for service to the ''ayuntamiento''. He selected seven leagues scattered throughout the colony.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 19{{endash}}21.</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from jail in June 1835, Williams moved his family from the seat of the Austin Colony to Quintana.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 74, 76.</ref> While Samuel was in the United States, Sarah fled her home during the [[Runaway Scrape]] early in 1836. By that time, the Williams's had already relocated from San Felipe de Austin to Quintana, the site of the McKinney and Williams warehouse, where the McKinneys also lived. Thomas McKinney and [[William H. Jack]] transported a small contingent of people from Quintana over the Gulf to McKinney's warehouse at the mouth of the [[Neches River]].<ref>Henson (2012), pp. 85{{endash}}86.</ref>\n\nFor the four years ending in the summer of 1839, business travels on behalf of his own interests and in support of the Texas cause kept him occupied in the United States. He only resided with his family for eight months during this period.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. vi{{endash}}vii.</ref>\n\n===Freemasonry===\nThe Independent Royal Arch Lodge No. 2, Free & Accepted Masons initiated Williams in New York City on November 21, 1835.<ref>Duncan (1904), p. 280.</ref> Williams received the first three degrees of Freemasonry that same night. Four days later, on November 25, 1835, he received all the degrees of the Royal Arch chapter in Jerusalem Chapter No. 8, Royal Arch Masons. Six days later, on December 1, 1835, he received the orders of Masonic Knighthood in Morton Commandery No. 4, Knights Templar. A week after that, on December 8, 1835, the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, meeting in Washington, D.C., granted Williams a charter for a chapter of Royal Arch Masons to be known as San Felipe de Austin Chapter No. 1, it being the first Royal Arch chapter in Texas, and he was installed as its first presiding officer.<ref>Lightfoot (1943), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nAs a Freemason, Williams became a member of a fraternity that included a number of other early Texas patriots like Stephen F. Austin, Sam Houston, [[Jose Antonio Navarro]] and [[Lorenzo de Zavala]].<ref>Carter (1955), pp. 425\u2013466.</ref> Williams \"was the moving spirit\" behind the formation of the first Masonic lodge in Galveston, and is considered \"the father\" of Galveston's Harmony Lodge No. 6.<ref>Petitfils (1997)</ref> Williams represented Harmony Lodge at the annual Grand Lodge meeting in December 1839.

The large tract included a pasture, a vegetable garden, and several outbuildings. They kept henhouse and a cowpen for their own consumption of eggs and other dairy, as well as stables and a carriage house. The Williams' owned slaves, perhaps all from the same family, who worked in the house and other parts of the property. Allegedly a cook attempted to poison the family in 1842; however, there is no record to indicate any punishment, legal or otherwise.<ref>Henson (1992), pp. 17, 19.</ref>\n\nThis suburban area near the Williams house was home to several local merchants during the 1840s. In addition to the McKinney house, his neighbors included Michel Menard, John Sydnor, and two of the Borden brothers. Menard was a co-founder of Galveston with McKinney and Williams, and engaged as a merchant with J. Temple Doswell. Sydnor was a commission merchant, and is known to have auctioned enslaved persons, though there is a question about whether this was a regular part of his business. Thomas and [[Gail Borden|Gail Borden Jr.]] co-published the ''[[Telegraph and Texas Register]]'' before moving to Galveston. Thomas surveyed land in the Austin Colony before the Texas Revolution. Gail, during part of his stay in Galveston, was a collector of customs, but he is best known for inventing a process for condensed milk.<ref>Henson (1992), pp. 27{{endash}}37.</ref> Despite the population growth of Galveston through 1850, this neighborhood ceded its popularity among the wealthy to the Broadway corridor in the next decade.<ref>Henson (1992), p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nWilliams died on September 13, 1858 after an illness of about two weeks.

The ruling had three consequences for the bank: it made the bank responsible for paying a large fine imposed by the lower court, it lost the ability to issue notes, and all notes outstanding were to be redeemed and destroyed. This effectively killed the bank, though Williams did not live quite long enough to witness its ending.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 162{{endash}}163.</ref> Biographer Margaret Swett Henson writes, \"The ten-year court battle with its political overtones had eroded his once robust health, and despairing of vindication, he relinquished the struggle and allowed despondency to triumph.\"<ref>Henson (1976), p. 163.</ref> Journalist Gary Cartwright claims that Williams \"died a bitter and frustrated old man, emotionally, physically, and financially drained.\"<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 83.</ref> \n\nWilliams, through his business partnership with McKinney, supported the war for independence with cash, and with goods and services in-kind, including ships, mercenaries, and ammunition. Williams died in 1858, without seeing any repayment by the Republic or by the State of Texas. McKinney continued to assert the claims of the partnership, but died in 1873 before succeeding in this advocacy. Upon his death, the state acknowledged $17,000, a small portion of the claim, but did not remit any funds to his estate. The State of Texas finally acknowledged the legacy of the Williams and McKinney contributions through a repayment in 1835.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 137-138.</ref> \n\nTexas historian Joe Frantz characterizes the partnership of McKinney and Williams as \"Underwriters of the Texas Revolution,\" since, \"without their aid [Sam] Houston's army conceivably would have lacked clothes, provisions, and most especially, arms.\"<ref>Frantz (1952), p. 1.</ref> Yet Cartwright notes a lack of acknowledgement of the legacy of Williams in his adopted hometown: \"Today hardly anyone in Galveston remembers his name or what he did. The city of Galveston is tireless, almost shameless, in its devotion to its heroes, but there is no street, no park, no school or building or monument that bears the name Samuel May Williams.\"<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 83.</ref> He also cites examples of actions by Williams which were corrupt, or at least, perceived to be corrupt by dint of their association with what many Texans considered to be unsavory business and political dealings. Williams was labelled a \"Monclova speculator\" by some of his Texian contemporaries, a reference to his advantageous land acquisitions from the rebelling anti-Santanista faction in Coahuila.<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 61.</ref> After Texas independence, the Republic brokered a deal acknowledging a legacy land grant from the Monclova government and conveying it to the Galveston Town Company, which included Williams as one of its business partners.<ref>Cartwright (1998), pp. 71{{endash}}72.</ref> Cartwright alleges that Williams was conscious of his own standing in Galveston when he ran for the Congress of the Texas Republic in 1839. Leading up to the election, McKinney and Williams offered favorable exchange rates for Texas treasury notes compared to their local business rivals, which Cartwright suggests was a successful attempt to buy votes.<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 76.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Eugene C.|year=1926|version=1969 reprint| title=The Life of Stephen F.

Austin]], who was an [[Anglo-American]] colonizer of [[Mexican Texas]]. As a teenager, Williams started working in the family's mercantile business in [[Baltimore]]. He spent time in South America and [[New Orleans]], fleeing the latter because of debts. He landed in Mexican Texas in 1822, having learned French and Spanish. Stephen F. Austin hired Williams for his colony in 1824. Williams first worked as a [[clerk]], and later assumed the title of secretary to the ''[[ayuntamiento]]'', a local government established for the colony by the Mexican state of [[Coahuila and Texas]].  He worked for Austin for about a decade.\n\nIn 1834, Williams quit as secretary of the Austin Colony to work as a merchant, then formalized a partnership with [[Thomas F. McKinney]]. The next year he also made deals with the provincial government in [[Monclova]] for a bank charter and for large tracts of land in Texas. At that time he was a representative in the Coahuila and Texas legislature. However, by 1836, Williams and his partner, Thomas F. McKinney, supported the [[Texas Revolution]] against Mexico. Williams borrowed money against his family's lines of credit, which the partners applied to ships and ammunition on behalf of the rebel government.\n\nAfter Texas gained [[Texas independence|independence]], Williams focused most of his business activities in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], and represented Galveston County for one term in the Republic of Texas legislature.  Through his partnership with McKinney he was invested in the Galveston City Company, and established diverse business interests there. The partnership ended when their business was acquired by [[Henry Howell Williams]] in 1842.\n\nAfter 1842, Williams worked toward establishing a bank in Texas. He briefly returned to public service when he accepted a diplomatic mission to negotiate a treaty with Mexico, which had still not recognized the sovereignty of the [[Republic of Texas]]. In the first year of Texas statehood, he ran twice for the U.S. House of Representatives, losing both times. In 1848 Williams succeeded in introducing the first bank in Texas: the Commercial & Agricultural Bank (C & A Bank).  This was the only institution to legally issue paper money, though his charter and the bank's practices faced legal challenges throughout its existence, including anti-banking legislation and scrutiny from various [[Texas Attorney General|Texas Attorneys General]]. Favorable decisions rendered by the district courts saved Williams and his bank for about four years. C & A Bank remained solvent during the [[Panic of 1857]], but anti-banking politics were on the rise. Many of Williams' friends and allies distanced themselves from the bank and encouraged him to give up the project, but he resisted their advice.  He died in 1858 after a short illness.  \n\n==Early life==\nSamuel May Williams was born October 4, 1795, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to Howell and Dorothy (Wheat) Williams.<ref name=tsha>Henson (2010).</ref><ref name=nichols190>Nichols (1952), pp. 190{{endash}}191.</ref><ref name=\"henson5\">Henson (1976), p. 5.</ref> His ancestors arrived in [[New England]] in the 1630s, and his family tree included a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and a president of [[Yale University]].<ref name=frantz>Frantz (1952), pp. 2{{endash}}3.</ref> Williams had four brothers and three sisters.<ref name=tsha/> His immediate family consisted of sailors and merchants; Howell Williams was a ship captain, and Samuel's uncle, Nathaniel Felton Williams, was a commission merchant in [[Baltimore]]. After some schooling in his native city, Samuel apprenticed to Nathaniel. A younger brother, also named Nathaniel Felton Williams, succeeded him as their uncle Nathaniel's apprentice.<ref name=\"henson5\"/>\n\nThe Williams family conducted a robust trade with Argentina, shipping food in exchange for cash or hides.<ref name=\"cartwright60\">Cartwright (1998), p. 60.</ref> Williams left Baltimore to oversee freight bound for [[Buenos Aires]], where he stayed to conduct further business in South America.<ref name=tsha/><ref name=nichols190/> There Williams learned the Spanish and French languages, and his business dealings gave him experience in navigating Spanish business and political customs.<ref name=\"cartwright60\"/> In 1818, Williams boarded at a hotel in Washington, D. C. (where pirate and New Orleans denizen [[Jean Lafitte]] had been a resident), and the next year, Williams was living and working in New Orleans.<ref name=\"henson1976-6\">Henson (1976), pp. 6{{endash}}7.</ref> Historians disagree about the timing of Williams's return to the United States from South America. While Joe B. Frantz and Ruth G. Nichols estimate his arrival to New Orleans as the year 1815,<ref name=nichols190/><ref>Frantz (1952), p. 2.</ref> Margaret Swett Henson disputes this as a possibility, though she is less certain about timeline.<ref name=\"henson1976-6\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Gone to Texas===\nThe [[Panic of 1819]] in the United States forced many Americans into insolvency. By 1822, the opening of Mexican Texas to Anglo-colonization offered these distressed families an opportunity to escape debts by moving outside the jurisdiction of American law. Sometimes these debtors abandoned their property and wrote the letters \"GTT\" on their doors, an acronym for [[Gone to Texas]].<ref name=\"henson3\">Henson (1976), p. 3.</ref> Though Williams sold tobacco to the [[Karankawa people]] on [[Galveston Island]] in 1821,<ref>Cartwright (1991), p. 58.</ref> he joined the ranks of the immigrant debtors in May 1822. He and a female companion left New Orleans and the United States to escape debts and poor economic prospects. They registered under the names of Mr. and Mrs. E. Eccleston, and passed over the gangplanks of the [[sloop]] ''Good Intent''. The sailing ship met a storm in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and finally made landfall at the mouth of the [[Colorado River]] on June 18.<ref name=\"henson3\"/> \n\nAt this time Texas was a part of Mexico. [[Moses Austin]] had negotiated a contract to colonize part of Texas, but his death in 1821 put the deal in limbo. As Williams first arrived in Texas, [[Stephen F. Austin]], the son of Moses Austin, traveled to [[Mexico City]] in order to reinstate the contract and facilitate implementation of the Austin Colony. During Austin's visit, word reached Mexico City of a Mr. Eccleston, who was literate in English, Spanish, and French. By late 1823, Austin had returned to Texas and met Eccleston, who had established a local reputation by clerking and teaching school. Austin hired him in November. This is around the time that Williams reverted to his birth name. For a time both Williams and Austin had lived and worked in the same area of New Orleans, but there is no direct evidence that they had known each other prior to their meeting in 1823.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 3{{endash}}5.</ref>\n\n===Stephen F. Austin Colony===\n{{Main|Old Three Hundred}}\n[[File:San felipe de austin shs cabin 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Replica log cabin representative of 1820s and 1830s Texas at San Felipe, Texas|Replica log cabin at San Felipe de Austin Historic Site]]\nWilliams was with Austin when the new empresario selected a location for his colonial headquarters, [[San Felipe de Austin]]. Austin first hired Williams as a translator and clerk, whose language skills, both in English and Spanish, were necessary to fulfill his responsibilities. Another critical skill was his handwriting. In an era when all documents were written by hand, the ability to write legibly was critical to properly reading them later.  Williams' knowledge of Mexican culture and Spanish business practices were also assets.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 9{{endash}}10.</ref> In the fall of 1824, Austin appointed Williams as a recording secretary for the [[Old Three Hundred|Austin Colony]]. Though [[Mexico]] had not yet established an ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' (local government) in the colony, Austin had told [[Jose Antonio Saucedo]] about his intention to establish the recording secretary position with all of the responsibilities of a secretary for an ''ayuntamiento''.<ref>Barker (1926), p. 117.</ref> Also in 1824, Williams received his own [[headright]], which included two leagues (about 4,428 acres each) and three ''labores'' (about 640 acres each). Austin had promised Williams an annual salary of $1,000, ($24,434 in 2019) but the colony was not generating much revenue.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 11{{endash}}13.</ref>\n\nWilliams continued to accept additional responsibilities at the Austin Colony. He managed the Public Land Office, and he served as its postmaster from 1826. He served as secretary of the ''ayuntamiento'' from 1828 to 1832,<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 192{{endash}}194.</ref> a post requiring him to record official documents in Spanish and send them to the state government.<ref name=henson1992>Henson (1992), p. 4.</ref> Austin later claimed that Williams had been underpaid for his service and later compensated him with {{convert|49000|acre|sqkm}} of land in Texas.<ref name=tsha/> With his existing land grant of {{convert|9387|acre|sqkm}}, Williams had accumulated more than {{convert|58000|acre|sqkm}} of land in Texas.<ref name=henson1992/>\n\n===After the Austin Colony===\nEarly in 1834 Williams co-founded the partnership of McKinney and Williams, setting up a warehouse at [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]], then relocated to [[Quintana, Texas|Quintana]] at the mouth of the [[Brazos River]]. The firm operated small steamboats on the Brazos and used its warehouse to manage transfer of freight to and from the larger ships operating on the Gulf of Mexico.<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 198{{endash}}199.</ref>\n\nAn internal political battle in Mexico caused the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas|Coahuila and Texas]] to split into two capitals. Those loyal to [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] (''santanistas'') controlled the original capital, [[Saltillo]], while the rival ''federalistas'' established their capital at [[Monclova]]. During meetings at the state capital, Williams bought 100 [[league (unit)|leagues]] of land in northeast Texas from the Monclova government at an eighty percent discount.

His participation in the Monclova government aroused the resentment of such persons, many of whom were already suspicious of Williams because of his former position of power in granting land in the Austin Colony. From the perspective of Williams, a member of the federalist Monclova government, the massive land sale was a justified state action in defense of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]], which was challenged by Santa Anna and the Saltillo government. The Monclova government was raising money to prepare for a possible civil war in Coahuila.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 62{{endash}}63.</ref>\n\n===Texas independence===\n[[File:Wreck of the Invincible.jpg|thumb|alt=Artist's depiction of the Invincible as wrecked in 1837|''Invincible'' depicted as wrecked in 1837]]\nWith ''santanista'' [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos|General Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] marching from Saltillo, the Monclova legislature ended its session in late-May 1835 with most of its members fleeing the region. Many of the federalists were captured, including Williams who was taken after crossing the [[Rio Grande River]] at [[Presidio|Presidio, Texas]]. He was incarcerated at [[San Antonio]], but escaped on horseback in a plot engineered by his friend, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro]]. Williams arrived in San Felipe de Austin as an enemy of Santa Anna and Cos.

Thus the Republic of Texas mounted substantial debt from the account of the McKinney and Williams partnership, which in turn had at least of portion of its financial backing from Henry Howell Williams.

The next year Galveston City Company purchased from Seguin a ''[[Spanish customary units#League (unit of area)|league]] and a [[Spanish customary units#Labor (unit of area)|labor]]'', or about 4,605 acres.<ref name=mccomb42>McComb (1986), pp. 42{{endash}}43.</ref><ref>Henson (1976), p. 94.</ref> The McKinney and Williams investment was initially a fifty-percent share.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 94.</ref> In December 1836, the Republic of Texas announced it would validate this title in exchange for $50,000 in cash or merchandise.

The firm already operated a diverse set of businesses on the island: they owned a race track, operated a tavern and stables, and offered houses for let,<ref name=\":0\" /> and they owned the Tremont hotel, for which Henry Howell Williams was the managing partner.  The Tremont continued operating in Galveston through 1865.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />  Their principal developments were their three-story warehouse and the wharf at Twenty-fourth Street.<ref name=\":0\">Henson (1976), p. 105.</ref> In 1839, McKinney and Williams received goods from [[Liverpool]], [[England]], and loaded the same ship with Texas [[cotton]], establishing direct trade between England and the Republic of Texas.<ref name=\":1\">Nichols (1952), pp. 204{{endash}}205.</ref> McKinney and Williams divested their commission business in 1842, selling it to Henry Howell Williams, who ran it as a division of his commission house in Baltimore.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 115.</ref>\n\nIn 1839, Williams represented [[Galveston County, Texas|Galveston County]] in the lower house of the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]].<ref>Nichols (1952), p. 206.</ref> McKinney and Williams used their commission house to support the Williams campaign.

Allen (soldier)|John M. Allen]], the town's first mayor. He led the passage of a bill to change Galveston's charter, which imposed a requirement of land ownership in order to vote in municipal elections. Effectively this reduced the number of eligible voters by half, and this paved the way for the \"conservatives\" to elect John W. Walton over the \"liberal\" John M. Allen in 1840. Allen transported the town's archives and stored them in his home, which was guarded by two artillery pieces. McKinney recruited a group of men to recapture the archives, and Allen surrendered them without incident.<ref>McComb (1986), pp. 43{{endash}}44.</ref>\n    \nWilliams chaired the finance committee for the lower house, and served as a member of the naval affairs committee. Williams allied with [[Sam Houston]]'s faction against President [[Mirabeau Lamar]]'s spending proposals and his Indian policy. He issued a finance report and proposal on January 12, 1840, which included two Hamiltonian recommendations: the recall of older debt instruments and stopping further issuance of unsecured debt. In addition, he proposed that Texas only accept payments in cash from importers and suggested a broad fifteen percent tariff on imported goods. This proposal was a political success, as all of its recommendations were adopted. However, inflation continued into 1841, as Texas redbacks traded at 37.5 cents on the dollar before he went to Austin and later depreciated to 12.5 cents. He sponsored a successful bill which established a state charter for the city of Galveston and another to build a local lighthouse. Williams promoted a bill to emancipate Cary McKinney, a slave of his business partner. Cary was just one of two enslaved persons emancipated in recognition of service to the Republic of Texas. Though Cary's family was not emancipated, he was able to reunite his family by purchased his family members himself.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 105\u2013109.</ref>\n\nPresident Sam Houston selected Williams for a diplomatic mission to Mexico. As late as 1843, Mexico did not recognize the sovereignty of Texas, while Santa Anna offered a general amnesty and other concessions to Texas provided it agreed to re-incorporate itself into Mexico. Houston agreed to a cease fire and peace talks. He appointed Williams and [[George Washington Hockley|George W. Hockley]] as envoys, charging them with entertaining a proposal which was unpopular in Texas.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 116{{endash}}118.</ref> The two envoys accepted their official orders in September 1843, but they lacked the authority to stand behind their own agreements, which would be subject to approval by the President and the Texas Congress. According to the Secretary of State, [[Anson Jones]], their job was to extend the process as long as possible. Meanwhile, unknown to Williams and Hockley, Texas negotiated an annexation treaty with the United States and appealed for sovereign recognition from Great Britain. The Texas War Department, on the other hand, instructed them to demand demilitarization of the [[Nueces Strip]], the corridor in south Texas between the Rio Grande and [[Nueces River|Nueces]] rivers. Diplomatically, Mexico claimed all of Texas as its sovereign territory; militarily, Mexico fortified at the Nueces River. Withdrawing from the Nueces Strip was an untenable position for Mexico, though Jones had told them that Mexico would agree to it. Williams and Hockley sailed for [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] in early October, but the venue changed to [[Sabinas]] while they were in transit. After arriving, an illness postponed the meetings, so negotiations did not start until December. Their counterparts, Cayetano Montero and Alexander Ybara, did not consent to the Texans' proposal that Mexico withdraw troops beyond the Rio Grande River.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 120{{endash}}125.</ref>\n\nWilliams acquired a sugar plantation in 1844. This 1,100 acre parcel was located near the coast and west of Quintana, at the San Bernard River. Joseph and Austin Williams, two of his sons, managed the plantation for a brief period before its sale in 1850.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 149.</ref> \n\nWilliams ran for US Congress twice. A special election in 1846 was necessary to determine representation for Texas for the few months remaining of the Twenty-ninth Congress. Williams was one of six candidates for the Texas Second district while running on a platform of national assumption of Texas's debt. Texans would benefit from the passage of such legislation; however, Williams and his former business partner had not been repaid by the Republic of Texas for its war debt. He finished second to [[Timothy Pillsbury]]. He challenged Pillsbury for the seat in November and lost by a wider margin; it was the last time he ran for public office.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 132{{endash}}137.</ref>\n\n====Commercial and Agricultural Bank====\n[[File:Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas $1.00 (one dollar) private scrip (8519862080).jpg|thumb|alt=One dollar scrip issued by the Commercial & Agricultural Bank|$1.00 (one dollar) private scrip issued by Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Texas]]\n[[File:Galveston island 1853.png|thumb|alt=1853 map of Galveston|Map of 1853 showing eastern entrance to Galveston Bay and the east end of Galveston Island (via Portal to Texas History]]\nWilliams was president of the first incorporated bank to operate in Texas. The Commercial and Agricultural Bank opened in Galveston on December 30, 1847, and later established a branch in [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], as well as agencies in New Orleans, New York City, and [[Akron, Ohio]]. Williams continued as the bank's president until his death.<ref>Nichols, pp. 208{{endash}}210.</ref> Williams exploited his latent 1835 Mexican bank charter and an old resolution from the Republic of Texas. He had permission to open a bank during the Texas Republic, but did not use this privilege. The Texas bank inspector, Niles F. Smith, never had an opportunity to execute his duties in 1837, but he was never officially relieved of his appointed post. Williams recalled inspector Smith in 1847, who certified the bank's assets in Galveston, New Orleans, and New York. Williams operated out of a building at the corner of Market and Tremont streets.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nThree months later the Texas Legislature proscribed the distribution of paper money, creating a civil fine of $5,000 per offense. Despite this law, $30,000 of the Commercial & Agricultural bank notes had been circulating in New Orleans that year, with another $18,000 distributed in Texas. Meanwhile, Williams maintained a large cache of specie to cover redemptions of his notes. Two members of the Texas Congress headed an opposition to the C & A Bank: [[Guy M. Bryan]] and [[Elisha M. Pease]]. Attorney General and Pease-ally John W. Harris filed a lawsuit against Williams, who retained Galveston-attorney, [[Ebenezer Allen (Texas politician)|Ebenezer C. Allen]]. Harris filed a total of four suits against Williams with $75,000 in fines. In 1849, a District Court ruled that an 1841 law that gave Williams banking privileges was still valid.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 141\u2013144.</ref>\n\nIn 1849, Williams gained an ally in the state congress. His former partner in the mercantile trade, Thomas McKinney gained a seat in the lower house and sought to repeal the 1848 banking laws. McKinney also found common cause with Williams in relation to the incoming Attorney General, [[Andrew Jackson Hamilton]]. For McKinney it was personal, and for Williams it was business. Hamilton had prosecuted the case against Williams in district court and was then the official in charge of enforcing the 1848 banking act. McKinney took over as chairman of a special investigations committee, which determined that Hamilton had failed to report \"widespread corruption\". After the legislature passed a reform bill to change the office of Attorney General into an elected one, McKinney campaigned for the election of Ebenezer C. Allen, Williams's lawyer.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 144\u2013145.</ref>\n\nLiquidity in Galveston conferred an advantage for local business interests to finance large infrastructure projects. The C & A bank financed the Galveston and Brazos Navigation Company, chartered in 1850. The company cut a channel through the shallow, sandy bottoms, from the coast at the west end of Galveston Island to the mouth of the Brazos River.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 147.</ref>\n\nIn March 1852, the Texas Supreme Court ruled on the state's appeal in the Williams case. The prosecution strategy was based on challenging the legality of the charter, but the court affirmed the 1835 charter and the 1841 relief law. In response to the decision, Bryan and Hamilton devised a new strategy, emphasizing the illegality of paper money issuance, and fining anyone who issued or circulated paper money. By the end of the year, a new attorney general, [[Thomas J. Jennings]] sued officers of the C & A Bank, though it was dismissed by District Judge [[Peter W. Gray]]. Jennings continued to file similar suits against two Galveston financiers into the next year, while Gray continued to dismiss them.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 151\u2013153.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1857, District Judge Gray fined [[Robert G. Mills]] $100,000 after a jury found him guilty of violating the 1848 banking act. The jury in the Williams trial was deadlocked, but his legal team recommended that he consent to a fine of $2,000 with a guilty plea. A few weeks later, Gray lost his election bid for the Texas Supreme Court to [[Oran M. Roberts]], with the court seating an anti-banking, pro-agrarian judge. The political climate did not favor Williams and his banking interests in 1857, but an economic panic was a greater threat. A bank closed for business in New York that August, and by October, three banks in New Orleans stopped paying in specie. This triggered a mass of demands for redemptions at both Galveston banks, which prompted Williams to refuse to honor some depositors' checks. An early closing triggered a sharp discount on his bank notes, but local fears were allayed after local merchants honored the Williams notes at par, and Williams reversed his policy, resuming payments in specie. Williams survived the Panic of 1857. However, political and legal prospects for his bank did not improve. Williams persisted in the banking business despite the legal challenges, and he resisted the advice of family and friends to divest of C & A Bank.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 156\u2013161.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Family life===\nIn 1822, Williams and a female companion arrived in Texas under the assumed names of Mr. and Mrs. E. Eccleston.<ref>Henson (1976), p. 3.</ref> He left unresolved debt in New Orleans, but there may have been other reasons for his departure. The couple lived together in San Felipe de Austin, but there is no indication of their marital status or even her name. They had a son together named Joseph Guadalupe Victoria Williams, who was born in San Felipe de Austin in 1825. The next year Williams split up with her, and she left the colony, taking their son with her. After her death, Williams brought Joseph back to Texas and raised him as a member of his family.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 7{{endash}}8.</ref>\n\nWilliams married Sarah Patterson Scott on March 4, 1828, at San Felipe de Austin. A native of [[Kentucky]], she emigrated to Texas with her parents William and Mary Scott in 1824. Sarah Williams gave birth to nine children, five of whom survived to adulthood.<ref>Nichols (1952), pp. 195{{endash}}196.</ref> By 1829, Samuel and Sarah Williams were caring for two children: their newborn daughter Sophia Caroline Williams and his four-year-old son \"Vic\" from the previous relationship. By 1830, Williams had already moved his family from ''Calle Commercio'' to a lot on the outskirts of town, and added onto this wood-framed house, then finished it with locally milled siding and brick, and with imported sash from New Orleans. In addition to his annual salary of $1,000, he received a seven-league bonus in 1830 for service to the ''ayuntamiento''. He selected seven leagues scattered throughout the colony.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 19{{endash}}21.</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from jail in June 1835, Williams moved his family from the seat of the Austin Colony to Quintana.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 74, 76.</ref> While Samuel was in the United States, Sarah fled her home during the [[Runaway Scrape]] early in 1836. By that time, the Williams's had already relocated from San Felipe de Austin to Quintana, the site of the McKinney and Williams warehouse, where the McKinneys also lived. Thomas McKinney and [[William H. Jack]] transported a small contingent of people from Quintana over the Gulf to McKinney's warehouse at the mouth of the [[Neches River]].<ref>Henson (2012), pp. 85{{endash}}86.</ref>\n\nFor the four years ending in the summer of 1839, business travels on behalf of his own interests and in support of the Texas cause kept him occupied in the United States. He only resided with his family for eight months during this period.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. vi{{endash}}vii.</ref>\n\n===Freemasonry===\nThe Independent Royal Arch Lodge No. 2, Free & Accepted Masons initiated Williams in New York City on November 21, 1835.<ref>Duncan (1904), p. 280.</ref> Williams received the first three degrees of Freemasonry that same night. Four days later, on November 25, 1835, he received all the degrees of the Royal Arch chapter in Jerusalem Chapter No. 8, Royal Arch Masons. Six days later, on December 1, 1835, he received the orders of Masonic Knighthood in Morton Commandery No. 4, Knights Templar. A week after that, on December 8, 1835, the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, meeting in Washington, D.C., granted Williams a charter for a chapter of Royal Arch Masons to be known as San Felipe de Austin Chapter No. 1, it being the first Royal Arch chapter in Texas, and he was installed as its first presiding officer.<ref>Lightfoot (1943), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nAs a Freemason, Williams became a member of a fraternity that included a number of other early Texas patriots like Stephen F.

The large tract included a pasture, a vegetable garden, and several outbuildings. They kept henhouse and a cowpen for their own consumption of eggs and other dairy, as well as stables and a carriage house. The Williams' owned slaves, perhaps all from the same family, who worked in the house and other parts of the property. Allegedly a cook attempted to poison the family in 1842; however, there is no record to indicate any punishment, legal or otherwise.<ref>Henson (1992), pp. 17, 19.</ref>\n\nThis suburban area near the Williams house was home to several local merchants during the 1840s. In addition to the McKinney house, his neighbors included Michel Menard, John Sydnor, and two of the Borden brothers. Menard was a co-founder of Galveston with McKinney and Williams, and engaged as a merchant with J. Temple Doswell. Sydnor was a commission merchant, and is known to have auctioned enslaved persons, though there is a question about whether this was a regular part of his business. Thomas and [[Gail Borden|Gail Borden Jr.]] co-published the ''[[Telegraph and Texas Register]]'' before moving to Galveston. Thomas surveyed land in the Austin Colony before the Texas Revolution. Gail, during part of his stay in Galveston, was a collector of customs, but he is best known for inventing a process for condensed milk.<ref>Henson (1992), pp. 27{{endash}}37.</ref> Despite the population growth of Galveston through 1850, this neighborhood ceded its popularity among the wealthy to the Broadway corridor in the next decade.<ref>Henson (1992), p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nWilliams died on September 13, 1858 after an illness of about two weeks.

The ruling had three consequences for the bank: it made the bank responsible for paying a large fine imposed by the lower court, it lost the ability to issue notes, and all notes outstanding were to be redeemed and destroyed. This effectively killed the bank, though Williams did not live quite long enough to witness its ending.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 162{{endash}}163.</ref> Biographer Margaret Swett Henson writes, \"The ten-year court battle with its political overtones had eroded his once robust health, and despairing of vindication, he relinquished the struggle and allowed despondency to triumph.\"<ref>Henson (1976), p. 163.</ref> Journalist Gary Cartwright claims that Williams \"died a bitter and frustrated old man, emotionally, physically, and financially drained.\"<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 83.</ref> \n\nWilliams, through his business partnership with McKinney, supported the war for independence with cash, and with goods and services in-kind, including ships, mercenaries, and ammunition. Williams died in 1858, without seeing any repayment by the Republic or by the State of Texas. McKinney continued to assert the claims of the partnership, but died in 1873 before succeeding in this advocacy. Upon his death, the state acknowledged $17,000, a small portion of the claim, but did not remit any funds to his estate. The State of Texas finally acknowledged the legacy of the Williams and McKinney contributions through a repayment in 1835.<ref>Henson (1976), pp. 137-138.</ref> \n\nTexas historian Joe Frantz characterizes the partnership of McKinney and Williams as \"Underwriters of the Texas Revolution,\" since, \"without their aid [Sam] Houston's army conceivably would have lacked clothes, provisions, and most especially, arms.\"<ref>Frantz (1952), p. 1.</ref> Yet Cartwright notes a lack of acknowledgement of the legacy of Williams in his adopted hometown: \"Today hardly anyone in Galveston remembers his name or what he did. The city of Galveston is tireless, almost shameless, in its devotion to its heroes, but there is no street, no park, no school or building or monument that bears the name Samuel May Williams.\"<ref>Cartwright (1998), p. 83.</ref> He also cites examples of actions by Williams which were corrupt, or at least, perceived to be corrupt by dint of their association with what many Texans considered to be unsavory business and political dealings.

This is achieved by binding the DOI to [[metadata]] about the object, such as a [[URL]], indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as [[ISBN]]s and [[ISRC]]s which aim only to identify their referents uniquely. The DOI system uses the [[indecs Content Model]] for representing metadata.\n\nThe DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL. But every time a URL changes, the publisher has to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.<ref>{{cite book|author= Witten, Ian H.|author2= David Bainbridge|author3= David M.

It also associates [[metadata]] with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the [[Handle System]] and the [[indecs Content Model]] with a social infrastructure.\n\nThe Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on [[open architecture]]s, incorporates [[Computational trust|trust mechanisms]], and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1/|title= DOIs and their discontents|last= Timmer|first= John|date= 6 March 2010|work= [[Ars Technica]]|accessdate= 5 March 2013}}</ref> DOI name-resolution may be used with [[OpenURL]] to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1= Susanne|last1= DeRisi|first2= Rebecca|last2= Kennison|first3= Nick|last3= Twyman|title= Editorial: The what and whys of DOIs|journal= [[PLoS Biology]]|volume= 1|issue= 2|page= e57|date= 2003|doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000057|pmid= 14624257|pmc= 261894}} {{open access}}</ref> However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.<ref>{{Cite book|contribution= Open access to scientific and technical information: the state of the art|first= Jack|last= Franklin|title= Open access to scientific and technical information: state of the art and future trends|editor1-first= Herbert|editor1-last= Gr\u00fcttemeier|editor2-first= Barry|editor2-last= Mahon|publisher= IOS Press|date= 2003|page= 74|url= https://books.google.com/?id=2X3gW1lUvN4C&pg=PA74|isbn= 978-1-58603-377-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[indecs Content Model]] as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.\n\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as [[GS1]] and [[ISBN]].\n\n==Comparison with other identifier schemes==\nA DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a [[First class (computing)|first-class entity]], rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] ([[Uniform Resource Name]]) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifierSpecs.html |title=DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications |publisher=Doi.org |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nA DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]], [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC]], etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifiers.html |title=DOI System and standard identifier registries |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe DOI system offers persistent, [[Semantic interoperability|semantically-interoperable]] resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as \"identifiers\" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other \"identifier systems\" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include [[Persistent Uniform Resource Locator]] (PURL), URLs, [[Globally Unique Identifier]]s (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., [[Archival Resource Key|ARK]]).\n\nA DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.\n\n==Resolution==\nDOI name resolution is provided through the [[Handle System]], developed by [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]], and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its <code><type></code> field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.\n\nTo resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as [https://doi.org/ doi.org].\n\nAnother approach, which avoids typing or [[cut-and-paste|cutting-and-pasting]] into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as <code><nowiki>https://doi.org/</nowiki></code> (preferred)<ref>{{cite web|author1=International DOI Foundation|title=Resolution|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html#3.7.3|website=DOI Handbook|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=7 August 2014}}</ref> or <code><nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/</nowiki></code>, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI <code>10.1000/182</code> can be included in a reference or [[hyperlink]] as <code>https://doi.org/10.1000/182</code>. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal [[hyperlink]]. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.\n\nOther DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, and https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a [[paywall|non-paywalled]] version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version.<ref name=\"capsh\">{{cite web|url=http://doai.io/|title=DOAI|publisher=CAPSH (Committee for the Accessibility of Publications in Sciences and Humanities)|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Schonfeld| first = Roger C.| title = Co-opting 'Official' Channels through Infrastructures for Openness |work = The Scholarly Kitchen| accessdate = 17 October 2016| date = 3 March 2016| url = https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/03/03/coopting-official-channels/}}</ref> Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016.<ref name=\"impactstory\">{{cite web| last=Piwowar| first=Heather| title=Introducing oaDOI: resolve a DOI straight to OA |url=http://blog.impactstory.org/introducting-oadoi/ |date= 25 October 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017 }}</ref> While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).<ref name=\"capsh\"/><ref name=\"impactstory\"/>\n\nAn alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for [[Web browser|browser]]s, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.org/tools.html|title=DOI System Tools}}</ref> which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the [https://www.handle.net/firefox_hdlclient.html CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox], enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like <code>hdl:4263537/4000</code> or <code>doi:10.1000/1</code> directly in the [[Firefox]] browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, [[mail reader]], or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.\n\n==IDF organizational structure==\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organisation created in 1998, is the governance body of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html#7.5 |title=DOI Handbook |chapter=Chapter 7: The International DOI Foundation |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> It safeguards all [[intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.\n\nThe IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.\n\nRegistration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level <code>10</code> prefix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dona.net/mpa/|title=DONA Foundation Multi-Primary Administrators|access-date=7 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114120514/https://dona.net/mpa/|archive-date=14 January 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRegistration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a [[not-for-profit]] cost recovery basis.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe DOI system is an international standard developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1561 |title=Digital object identifier (DOI) becomes an ISO standard |publisher=iso.org |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref> The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation \u2013 Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval.

DOI is not registered as a URN namespace, despite fulfilling all the functional requirements, since URN registration appears to offer no advantage to the DOI System. It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string {{code|urn:doi:10.1000/1}} rather than the simpler {{code|doi:10.1000/1}}) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution.

This is achieved by binding the DOI to [[metadata]] about the object, such as a [[URL]], indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as [[ISBN]]s and [[ISRC]]s which aim only to identify their referents uniquely. The DOI system uses the [[indecs Content Model]] for representing metadata.\n\nThe DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL.

Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the [[Handle System]] and the [[indecs Content Model]] with a social infrastructure.\n\nThe Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on [[open architecture]]s, incorporates [[Computational trust|trust mechanisms]], and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1/|title= DOIs and their discontents|last= Timmer|first= John|date= 6 March 2010|work= [[Ars Technica]]|accessdate= 5 March 2013}}</ref> DOI name-resolution may be used with [[OpenURL]] to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1= Susanne|last1= DeRisi|first2= Rebecca|last2= Kennison|first3= Nick|last3= Twyman|title= Editorial: The what and whys of DOIs|journal= [[PLoS Biology]]|volume= 1|issue= 2|page= e57|date= 2003|doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000057|pmid= 14624257|pmc= 261894}} {{open access}}</ref> However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.<ref>{{Cite book|contribution= Open access to scientific and technical information: the state of the art|first= Jack|last= Franklin|title= Open access to scientific and technical information: state of the art and future trends|editor1-first= Herbert|editor1-last= Gr\u00fcttemeier|editor2-first= Barry|editor2-last= Mahon|publisher= IOS Press|date= 2003|page= 74|url= https://books.google.com/?id=2X3gW1lUvN4C&pg=PA74|isbn= 978-1-58603-377-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[indecs Content Model]] as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.\n\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as [[GS1]] and [[ISBN]].\n\n==Comparison with other identifier schemes==\nA DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a [[First class (computing)|first-class entity]], rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] ([[Uniform Resource Name]]) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifierSpecs.html |title=DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications |publisher=Doi.org |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nA DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]], [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC]], etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifiers.html |title=DOI System and standard identifier registries |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe DOI system offers persistent, [[Semantic interoperability|semantically-interoperable]] resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as \"identifiers\" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other \"identifier systems\" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include [[Persistent Uniform Resource Locator]] (PURL), URLs, [[Globally Unique Identifier]]s (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., [[Archival Resource Key|ARK]]).\n\nA DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.\n\n==Resolution==\nDOI name resolution is provided through the [[Handle System]], developed by [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]], and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its <code><type></code> field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.\n\nTo resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as [https://doi.org/ doi.org].\n\nAnother approach, which avoids typing or [[cut-and-paste|cutting-and-pasting]] into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as <code><nowiki>https://doi.org/</nowiki></code> (preferred)<ref>{{cite web|author1=International DOI Foundation|title=Resolution|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html#3.7.3|website=DOI Handbook|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=7 August 2014}}</ref> or <code><nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/</nowiki></code>, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI <code>10.1000/182</code> can be included in a reference or [[hyperlink]] as <code>https://doi.org/10.1000/182</code>. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal [[hyperlink]]. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.\n\nOther DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, and https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a [[paywall|non-paywalled]] version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version.<ref name=\"capsh\">{{cite web|url=http://doai.io/|title=DOAI|publisher=CAPSH (Committee for the Accessibility of Publications in Sciences and Humanities)|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Schonfeld| first = Roger C.| title = Co-opting 'Official' Channels through Infrastructures for Openness |work = The Scholarly Kitchen| accessdate = 17 October 2016| date = 3 March 2016| url = https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/03/03/coopting-official-channels/}}</ref> Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016.<ref name=\"impactstory\">{{cite web| last=Piwowar| first=Heather| title=Introducing oaDOI: resolve a DOI straight to OA |url=http://blog.impactstory.org/introducting-oadoi/ |date= 25 October 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017 }}</ref> While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).<ref name=\"capsh\"/><ref name=\"impactstory\"/>\n\nAn alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for [[Web browser|browser]]s, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.org/tools.html|title=DOI System Tools}}</ref> which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the [https://www.handle.net/firefox_hdlclient.html CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox], enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like <code>hdl:4263537/4000</code> or <code>doi:10.1000/1</code> directly in the [[Firefox]] browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, [[mail reader]], or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.\n\n==IDF organizational structure==\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organisation created in 1998, is the governance body of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html#7.5 |title=DOI Handbook |chapter=Chapter 7: The International DOI Foundation |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> It safeguards all [[intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.\n\nThe IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.\n\nRegistration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level <code>10</code> prefix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dona.net/mpa/|title=DONA Foundation Multi-Primary Administrators|access-date=7 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114120514/https://dona.net/mpa/|archive-date=14 January 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRegistration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a [[not-for-profit]] cost recovery basis.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe DOI system is an international standard developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1561 |title=Digital object identifier (DOI) becomes an ISO standard |publisher=iso.org |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref> The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation \u2013 Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval.

However no such widely deployed RDS schemes currently exist.... DOI is not registered as a URN namespace, despite fulfilling all the functional requirements, since URN registration appears to offer no advantage to the DOI System. It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string {{code|urn:doi:10.1000/1}} rather than the simpler {{code|doi:10.1000/1}}) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution.

The building was demolished in 2010,<ref name=\"Ref_2010\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8650872.stm |title=Demolition work begins at Heathrow's Terminal 2 |publisher=BBC News |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> and the resulting space was combined with the adjacent area where the Queen's Building stood until its demolition in 2009 to form the site for the new terminal.\n\n==Ground transportation==\n===Inter-terminal transport===\nTerminal 2 is connected by an underground walkway to Terminal 3. Terminals 4 and 5 can be reached by the free [[Heathrow Express]] rail service. [[London Underground]] services can also be used to transfer to Terminals 4 and 5 (the former requiring a change of train at [[Hatton Cross tube station|Hatton Cross]]), but this service is only free to [[Oyster card]] holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/heathrow-airport-guide/travel-between-terminals|title=Travel between terminals - Heathrow|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, numerous buses ply between the Central Bus Station (for Terminals 2 and 3) and the other terminals. However, using the train service is much quicker and easier for passengers with luggage. The bus service is free between terminals.\n\n===Road links===\nAs part of the three central terminals at Heathrow, it is well linked to the [[M4 motorway]] via the M4 spur road and through a tunnel under the north runway.\n\n===Rail links===\nTerminal 2 is accessed by the Piccadilly Line of the [[Piccadilly line|London Underground]] from [[Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 tube station]], with trains towards [[Cockfosters tube station|Cockfosters]] via Central London. The Terminal is also accessed by [[TfL Rail]] and Heathrow Express from [[Heathrow Central railway station|Heathrow Central]] where services go to [[Paddington station|Paddington]]. TfL Rail services are due to be replaced by [[Crossrail]] when it finally opens at some point in the future and services would be increased from two trains per hour (about every 30 minutes) to four trains per hour (about every 15 minutes).\n\n===Bus links===\nTerminal 2 is accessible to both bus and coach services from [[Heathrow Central bus station]].\n\nThere are also several coach services operated by [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] operating to other London airports such as [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]], [[Stansted Airport|Stansted]] and [[Luton Airport|Luton]]; and other cities in the United Kingdom.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat inline|Heathrow Terminal 2}}\n*[http://www.heathrow.com/airport-guide/terminal-2 Heathrow Airport Terminal 2 <small>(official web page)</small>]\n\n{{London Heathrow Airport}}\n{{Major Development Projects in London}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:London Heathrow Terminal 2 - The Queen's Terminal}}\n[[Category:Heathrow Airport|2 London Heathrow Terminal 2]]\n[[Category:Airport terminals]]\n[[Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 2014]]\n[[Category:2014 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures at Heathrow Airport|Terminal 2]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "defunct", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Terminal_2"}

Ten ships were built in total, of a type roughly comparable to British [[frigate]]s or American [[destroyer escort]]s. They were the only such type of ship built by the ''Kriegsmarine''. The ten ships were not given names, but were designated ''F1'' through ''F10''.\n\n==Construction==\nThe ships were built by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] (F&nbsp;1 \u2013 F&nbsp;6), [[Kiel]], [[Blohm & Voss]] (F&nbsp;7, F&nbsp;8) and Wilhelmshaven dockyard (F&nbsp;9, F&nbsp;10). They entered service between 1936 and 1939. The ships were originally conceived as fast fleet or convoy escort ships that could also perform [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] and [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeping]] work. They were also used as a testbed class for a new high-pressure steam power plant intended for use in future [[destroyer]]s.\n\nAs a class, they were overloaded and over-engined, which contributed to severe hull stress and very poor sea-keeping characteristics; these flaws were partially remedied by extensive rebuilds between 1938 and 1940. The power plants likewise proved to be prone to frequent breakdowns, and most of the ships were removed from operational service during the later years of the war after machinery failures meant the ships spent more time in repair than in use.\n\n==Use and administration==\nWith the exception of fleet service and convoy duties between 1939 and 1941, they spent most of the war in use as tenders or [[U-boat]] [[training ship]]s.  Between 1943 and 1945, the escort ships were grouped into five [[Surface flotillas of the Kriegsmarine#Escort flotillas|escort flotillas]] augmented by converted civilian craft as well as [[torpedo boat]]s of the ''[[Torpedoboot Ausland]]'' program.\n\n==Ships==\n[[File:Lot-2275-29 (26251121633).jpg|thumb|F-class ship in heavy weather]]\nOne ship, ''F&nbsp;9'', was sunk in December 1939 after being torpedoed by {{HMS|Ursula|N59|6}}. F 5 was damaged by a mine in the Baltic Sea and sank under tow 29 January 1945. F 3 was sunk by British aircraft 3 May 1945 and F 6 was sunk by US aircraft 30 March 1945. The others survived the war and were scrapped or sunk as target ships. One 'F' Class craft was blown up and sunk in Tobruk Harbour by a Black South African whilst a POW from the 2nd South African Division with a home-made explosive and a long wick that he hid in the hold and lit it.
