Around 40 villages grouped in eight archaeological parks situated in north-western Syria provide an insight into rural life in [[Late Antiquity]] and during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]]. Most of the villages, which date from the 1st to 7th centuries, were  abandoned between the 8th and 10th centuries. The settlements feature the well-preserved architectural remains of dwellings, pagan temples, churches, cisterns, bathhouses etc. Important dead cities include the [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites]], [[Serjilla]] and [[Bara, Syria|al Bara]].\n\nThe Dead Cities are situated in an elevated area of limestone known as [[Limestone Massif]]. These ancient settlements cover an area {{convert|20|-|40|km|abbr=on}} wide and some {{convert|140|km|abbr=on}} long.<ref>Burns, Ross., Monuments of Syria: An Historical Guide, p.109</ref> The Massif includes three groups of highlands: the first is the northern group of [[Mount Simeon]] and [[Kurd Mountain|Mount Kurd]]; the second middle group is the group of [[Harim Mountains]]; the third southern group is the group of [[Zawiya Mountain]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Karte Tote St\u00e4dte in Syrien.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The location of Dead Cities in the northwestern parts of Syria]]\n[[Chris Wickham]], in the authoritative survey of the post-Roman world, \"[[Framing the Early Middle Ages]]\" (2006) argues that these were settlements of prosperous peasants which have few or no specifically urban features. The impressive remains of domestic architecture are the result of the prosperity of peasants who benefited from a strong international trade in [[olive oil]] at the end of Antiquity.\n\nAnother argument is that these were prosperous cities that flourished because they were located along major trade routes in the Byzantine Empire, and not merely prosperous peasant settlements.  After conquest by the Arabs, the trade routes changed, and as a result these towns lost the majority of the business which fostered their economies. On this view, settlers eventually abandoned their towns and headed for other cities that were flourishing under the Arabs and the [[Umayyad]]s as increasing urbanisation took its toll.\n\nThe ancient villages of the Dead Cities illustrate the transition from the ancient pagan world of the [[Roman Empire]] to Byzantine Christianity.\n\nThe Dead Cites were inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2011, under the name of \"Ancient Villages of Northern Syria\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1348|title=Ancient Villages of Northern Syria|author=UNESCO |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Syrian Civil War]] most sites had become easily accessible, the majority of the dead cities were well-preserved and tourists could access the sites quite freely, though some of the Dead Cities are quite difficult to reach without a guide (there is a guidebook by Abdallah Hadjar with a detailed map that is useful for finding the lesser known sites; ''The Church of St Simeon Stylites and Other Archaeological Sites in the Mountains of Simeon and Halaqa'').\n\nEven before the war relatively few of the Dead Cities had any archaeological excavations taking place, and unfortunately the majority of people living in close proximity to them have no understanding of their importance.\n\n==Archeological sites==\nDead cities and [[archeological sites]] in '''[[Limestone Massif]]''' include [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites]], [[Serjilla]], [[Bara, Syria|Bara]], [[Basufan]], [[Barisha, Harem District|Barisha]], [[Qalb Loze]], [[Barad, Syria|Barad]], [[Cyrrhus]], [[Turmanin]], [[Banabil]], [[Kafr Aruq]], [[Kafr Dariyan]], [[Babuline]], [[Hazarin]], [[Jarada]], [[Maghara]], [[Shinan, Syria|Shinan]], [[Farkya]], [[Ein Laruz]], [[Ebla]], [[Deir Sunbul, Idlib|Deir Sunbul]], [[Al-Dana, Maarrat al-Nu'man|Al-Dana]], [[Sarmada]] and [[Al-Dana, Syria|Al-Dana]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.syriaphotoguide.com/home/ |title=Syria Photo Guide |access-date=2017-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514025537/http://www.syriaphotoguide.com/home/ |archive-date=2017-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dgam.gov.sy/damages/Homepage.php|title=\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062b\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0636\u0631\u0631\u0629|website=www.dgam.gov.sy|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref>\n===[[Mount Simeon]], [[Kurd Mountain|Mount Kurd]] and Mount \u1e24alqa===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"12%\" | Name<br/>\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=\"94px\" | Image\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=\"10%\" | Coordinates\n! width=\"8%\" | Governorate\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| [[Ain Dara temple]]<br/>({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0639\u064a\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629}})\n| [[File:SYRIE_291.jpg|235px]]\n| {{Coord|36|27|33.7|N|36|51|7.5|E|name=Ain Dara temple}}\n| [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]]\n| An [[Iron Age]] [[Syro-Hittite]] [[temple]] dating between the tenth and eighth centuries BC, is {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of Aleppo.\n|-\n| [[Barad, Syria|Barad]]<br/>({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f}})\n| [[File:Brad_Northern_Basilica.jpg|235px]]\n| {{Coord|36|23|8|N|36|53|57|E|name=Barad, Syria}}\n| [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]]\n| An ancient settlement, located {{convert|32|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Aleppo, has many old basilicas; for example, the [[Julian of Antioch|Saint Julianus]] Maronite monastery (399-402 AD) where the shrine of [[Maron|Saint Maron]] is located, and a basilica at the northern part of the village built in 561.\n|-\n| Barjaka or Burj Suleiman village<br/>({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0631\u062c\u0643\u0629}})\n| \n| {{Coord|36|19|25.80|N|36|53|35.71|E|name=Barjaka}}\n| [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]]\n| Located {{convert|26|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of Aleppo.

Around 40 villages grouped in eight archaeological parks situated in north-western Syria provide an insight into rural life in [[Late Antiquity]] and during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]]. Most of the villages, which date from the 1st to 7th centuries, were  abandoned between the 8th and 10th centuries. The settlements feature the well-preserved architectural remains of dwellings, pagan temples, churches, cisterns, bathhouses etc. Important dead cities include the [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites]], [[Serjilla]] and [[Bara, Syria|al Bara]].\n\nThe Dead Cities are situated in an elevated area of limestone known as [[Limestone Massif]]. These ancient settlements cover an area {{convert|20|-|40|km|abbr=on}} wide and some {{convert|140|km|abbr=on}} long.<ref>Burns, Ross., Monuments of Syria: An Historical Guide, p.109</ref> The Massif includes three groups of highlands: the first is the northern group of [[Mount Simeon]] and [[Kurd Mountain|Mount Kurd]]; the second middle group is the group of [[Harim Mountains]]; the third southern group is the group of [[Zawiya Mountain]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Karte Tote St\u00e4dte in Syrien.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The location of Dead Cities in the northwestern parts of Syria]]\n[[Chris Wickham]], in the authoritative survey of the post-Roman world, \"[[Framing the Early Middle Ages]]\" (2006) argues that these were settlements of prosperous peasants which have few or no specifically urban features. The impressive remains of domestic architecture are the result of the prosperity of peasants who benefited from a strong international trade in [[olive oil]] at the end of Antiquity.\n\nAnother argument is that these were prosperous cities that flourished because they were located along major trade routes in the Byzantine Empire, and not merely prosperous peasant settlements.  After conquest by the Arabs, the trade routes changed, and as a result these towns lost the majority of the business which fostered their economies. On this view, settlers eventually abandoned their towns and headed for other cities that were flourishing under the Arabs and the [[Umayyad]]s as increasing urbanisation took its toll.\n\nThe ancient villages of the Dead Cities illustrate the transition from the ancient pagan world of the [[Roman Empire]] to Byzantine Christianity.\n\nThe Dead Cites were inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2011, under the name of \"Ancient Villages of Northern Syria\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1348|title=Ancient Villages of Northern Syria|author=UNESCO |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Syrian Civil War]] most sites had become easily accessible, the majority of the dead cities were well-preserved and tourists could access the sites quite freely, though some of the Dead Cities are quite difficult to reach without a guide (there is a guidebook by Abdallah Hadjar with a detailed map that is useful for finding the lesser known sites; ''The Church of St Simeon Stylites and Other Archaeological Sites in the Mountains of Simeon and Halaqa'').\n\nEven before the war relatively few of the Dead Cities had any archaeological excavations taking place, and unfortunately the majority of people living in close proximity to them have no understanding of their importance.\n\n==Archeological sites==\nDead cities and [[archeological sites]] in '''[[Limestone Massif]]''' include [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites]], [[Serjilla]], [[Bara, Syria|Bara]], [[Basufan]], [[Barisha, Harem District|Barisha]], [[Qalb Loze]], [[Barad, Syria|Barad]], [[Cyrrhus]], [[Turmanin]], [[Banabil]], [[Kafr Aruq]], [[Kafr Dariyan]], [[Babuline]], [[Hazarin]], [[Jarada]], [[Maghara]], [[Shinan, Syria|Shinan]], [[Farkya]], [[Ein Laruz]], [[Ebla]], [[Deir Sunbul, Idlib|Deir Sunbul]], [[Al-Dana, Maarrat al-Nu'man|Al-Dana]], [[Sarmada]] and [[Al-Dana, Syria|Al-Dana]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.syriaphotoguide.com/home/ |title=Syria Photo Guide |access-date=2017-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514025537/http://www.syriaphotoguide.com/home/ |archive-date=2017-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dgam.gov.sy/damages/Homepage.php|title=\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062b\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0636\u0631\u0631\u0629|website=www.dgam.gov.sy|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref>\n===[[Mount Simeon]], [[Kurd Mountain|Mount Kurd]] and Mount \u1e24alqa===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"12%\" | Name<br/>\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=\"94px\" | Image\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=\"10%\" | Coordinates\n! width=\"8%\" | Governorate\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| [[Ain Dara temple]]<br/>({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0639\u064a\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629}})\n| [[File:SYRIE_291.jpg|235px]]\n| {{Coord|36|27|33.7|N|36|51|7.5|E|name=Ain Dara temple}}\n| [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]]\n| An [[Iron Age]] [[Syro-Hittite]] [[temple]] dating between the tenth and eighth centuries BC, is {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of Aleppo.\n|-\n| [[Barad, Syria|Barad]]<br/>({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f}})\n| [[File:Brad_Northern_Basilica.jpg|235px]]\n| {{Coord|36|23|8|N|36|53|57|E|name=Barad, Syria}}\n| [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]]\n| An ancient settlement, located {{convert|32|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Aleppo, has many old basilicas; for example, the [[Julian of Antioch|Saint Julianus]] Maronite monastery (399-402 AD) where the shrine of [[Maron|Saint Maron]] is located, and a basilica at the northern part of the village built in 561.\n|-\n| Barjaka or Burj Suleiman village<br/>({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0631\u062c\u0643\u0629}})\n| \n| {{Coord|36|19|25.80|N|36|53|35.71|E|name=Barjaka}}\n| [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]]\n| Located {{convert|26|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of Aleppo.

Midrashic literature attributes this transition as a consequence due to Melchizedek preceding the name of [[Abraham]] to that of God, such as in the [[Midrash Rabbah]] to Genesis,<ref>Tractate Nedarim</ref> while some Jewish commentators, such as [[Chaim ibn Attar]], write that Melchizedek gave the priesthood to Abraham willingly.\n\n[[Maimonides]], in his Mishna Torah compilation, explains that [[Jacob]] separated his son [[Levi]] from his other sons and appointed him to instruct and teach the ways of \"service to God\", specifically the servicial methods used by his forefather [[Abraham]], to his brothers.

For the prelude of this choice see [[Targum Yonathan]] to Genesis 32:25, and/or [[Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer]] ch. 37. In midrash, it is written that [[Amram]] the son of [[Kohath]] the son of Levi was the spiritual leader of the sons of Jacob (\"Israel\") during their Egyptian Bondage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Following his passing, his post was assumed by his son Aaron.\n\nAt the time of the erection of the [[Tabernacle]], God commanded Moses to appoint Aaron and his sons to the Jewish priestly service as a precondition to God revealing his [[Shechinah]] amongst the nation of Israel;\n\n{{quote|And Aaron and his sons I will sanctify to serve me and I will dwell amidst the sons of Israel and I will be to them a God, and they will know that I (am) God their Master that took them out from the land of Egypt (in order that) I (will) dwell in their midst|Exodus 29:44-46}}\n\nThe majority of [[Chazal]]ic literature attributes the primary character of psalm 110 as [[King David]]<ref>based on the text \u05e9\u05d1 \u05dc'''\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9''' with \"Yemini\" referring either to [[King Saul]] of the [[tribe of Benjamin]] (Bin'''yamin''') whom David was careful not to overthrow ''or'' to the [[Torah]] (as per it being referred to as \"from his right hand -a fire of religion to them\" -Deuteronomy) -Targum Yonathan to Psalm 110</ref> who was a \"righteous king\" (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7) of Salem (Jerusalem) and, like Melchizedek, had certain priest-like responsibilities, while the [[Babylonian Talmud]] understands the chapter as referring to Abram who was victorious in battling to save his nephew Lot and merited priesthood.<ref>Babylonian Talmud to Nedarim, p. 32</ref> The Zohar defines the noted Melchizedek as referring to [[Ahron]] the [[Kohen Gadol]] (high priest).<ref>zohar vol. 3 p.53b</ref>\n\n==In Christianity==\n[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]] is the [[Messiah]] spoken of as \"a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek\" ({{Bibleverse||Ps.|110:4|HE}}), and so Jesus plays the role of the king-priest once and for all. According to the writer of [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] (7:13-17) Jesus is considered a priest in the order of Melchizedek because, like Melchizedek, Jesus was not a [[Kohen|descendant of Aaron]], and thus would not qualify for the Jewish priesthood under the [[Law of Moses]].\n\nMelchizedek is referred to again in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 5:6-10; Hebrews 6:20; Hebrews 7:1-21: \"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\"; and Hebrews 8:1.\n\n<blockquote>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises\" (Hebrews 7:5-6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law\" (Hebrews 7:11-12).</blockquote>\n\nThe author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] in the [[New Testament]] discussed this subject considerably, listing the following reasons for why the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the Aaronic priesthood:\n\n#Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek; later, the Levites would receive tithes from their countrymen. Since Aaron was in Abraham's loins then, it was as if the Aaronic priesthood were paying tithes to Melchizedek. (Heb. 7:4-10)\n#The one who blesses is always greater than the one being blessed. Thus, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham. As Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham, it follows that Melchizedek is greater than Levi. (Heb. 7:7-10)\n#If the priesthood of Aaron were effective, God would not have called a new priest in a different order in Psalm 110. (Heb. 7:11)\n#The basis of the Aaronic priesthood was ancestry; the basis of the priesthood of Melchizedek is everlasting life. That is, there is no interruption due to a priest's death. (Heb. 7:8,15-16,23-25)\n#Christ, being sinless, does not need a sacrifice for his own sins. (Heb. 7:26-27)\n#The priesthood of Melchizedek is more effective because it required a single sacrifice once and for all (Jesus), while the Levitical priesthood made endless sacrifices. (Heb. 7:27)\n#The [[kohen|Aaronic priests]] serve (or, rather, served) in an earthly copy and shadow of the heavenly Temple, which Jesus serves in. (Heb. 8:5)\n\nThe epistle goes on to say that the [[New Covenant (theology)|covenant]] of Jesus is superior to the [[Mosaic Covenant|covenant]] the Levitical priesthood is under. Some Christians hold that Melchizedek was a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ, and some other Christians hold that Melchizedek indeed ''was'' Christ. Reasons provided include that Melchizedek's name means \"king of righteousness\" according to the author of Hebrews, and that being king of Salem makes Melchizedek the \"king of peace\". Heb. 7:3 states, \"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever.\" Melchizedek gave Abraham bread and wine, which some Christians consider symbols of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice to confirm a covenant.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[Catholicism|Catholics]] find the roots of their priesthood in the tradition of Melchizedek (CCC 1544).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722004028/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM |date=July 22, 2016 }} \"The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, \"priest of God Most High,\" as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the unique \"high priest after the order of Melchizedek\";16 \"holy, blameless, unstained,\"</ref> In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18, Melchizedek offers a sacrifice of bread and wine. Christ therefore fulfilled the prophecy of Ps 110:4, that he would be a priest \"after the order of Melchizedek\" at the [[Last Supper]], when he broke and shared bread with his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]]. Catholics interpret more literally Christ's commands that the Apostles should \"do this in memory of Me\" and \"as often as you can\". As such, the Catholic Church, at least once a day in every parish, offers the same sacrifice of bread and wine at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], as part of the [[Sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}} \n{{Further|Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the Melchizedek Priesthood is viewed as the priesthood authority of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]], as well as [[Old Testament]] prophets, higher than that of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic]] authority of [[John the Baptist]] and of the Levites.\n\nAccording to the [[Book of Mormon]], the prophet [[Melchizedek]] preached repentance to the people of a wicked city, and established peace in the land. According to {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=13|verse=18}}, Melchizedek's efforts earned him the title \"the prince of peace\". Of particular importance is the parallel Hebrew meaning of \"prince of peace\" and \"king of Salem\", another of Melchizedek's titles, and his association with (or typology of) Jesus Christ, who is also called the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:2), as well as the Great High Priest (Heb. 4:14). Later, Melchizedek's people were, according to [[Joseph Smith]], caught up, or \"[[Translation (LDS Church)|translated]]\", to meet the city of Enoch ([[Joseph Smith Translation]] of Genesis 14:34). The priesthood is referred to by the name of Melchizedek because he was such a great high priest (Doctrine & Covenants {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=2}}). The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] states that before Melchizedek's day the Priesthood \"was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God. But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too-frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in the ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood\" (Doctrine and Covenants {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=3-4}}). Initially, the only Melchizedek Priesthood office in the Latter Day Saint movement was [[Elder (LDS Church)|Elder]].

In midrash, it is written that [[Amram]] the son of [[Kohath]] the son of Levi was the spiritual leader of the sons of Jacob (\"Israel\") during their Egyptian Bondage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Following his passing, his post was assumed by his son Aaron.\n\nAt the time of the erection of the [[Tabernacle]], God commanded Moses to appoint Aaron and his sons to the Jewish priestly service as a precondition to God revealing his [[Shechinah]] amongst the nation of Israel;\n\n{{quote|And Aaron and his sons I will sanctify to serve me and I will dwell amidst the sons of Israel and I will be to them a God, and they will know that I (am) God their Master that took them out from the land of Egypt (in order that) I (will) dwell in their midst|Exodus 29:44-46}}\n\nThe majority of [[Chazal]]ic literature attributes the primary character of psalm 110 as [[King David]]<ref>based on the text \u05e9\u05d1 \u05dc'''\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9''' with \"Yemini\" referring either to [[King Saul]] of the [[tribe of Benjamin]] (Bin'''yamin''') whom David was careful not to overthrow ''or'' to the [[Torah]] (as per it being referred to as \"from his right hand -a fire of religion to them\" -Deuteronomy) -Targum Yonathan to Psalm 110</ref> who was a \"righteous king\" (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7) of Salem (Jerusalem) and, like Melchizedek, had certain priest-like responsibilities, while the [[Babylonian Talmud]] understands the chapter as referring to Abram who was victorious in battling to save his nephew Lot and merited priesthood.<ref>Babylonian Talmud to Nedarim, p. 32</ref>  The Zohar defines the noted Melchizedek as referring to [[Ahron]] the [[Kohen Gadol]] (high priest).<ref>zohar vol. 3 p.53b</ref>\n\n==In Christianity==\n[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]] is the [[Messiah]] spoken of as \"a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek\" ({{Bibleverse||Ps.|110:4|HE}}), and so Jesus plays the role of the king-priest once and for all. According to the writer of [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] (7:13-17) Jesus is considered a priest in the order of Melchizedek because, like Melchizedek, Jesus was not a [[Kohen|descendant of Aaron]], and thus would not qualify for the Jewish priesthood under the [[Law of Moses]].\n\nMelchizedek is referred to again in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 5:6-10; Hebrews 6:20; Hebrews 7:1-21: \"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\"; and Hebrews 8:1.\n\n<blockquote>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises\" (Hebrews 7:5-6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law\" (Hebrews 7:11-12).</blockquote>\n\nThe author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] in the [[New Testament]] discussed this subject considerably, listing the following reasons for why the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the Aaronic priesthood:\n\n#Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek; later, the Levites would receive tithes from their countrymen. Since Aaron was in Abraham's loins then, it was as if the Aaronic priesthood were paying tithes to Melchizedek. (Heb. 7:4-10)\n#The one who blesses is always greater than the one being blessed. Thus, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham.  As Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham, it follows that Melchizedek is greater than Levi. (Heb. 7:7-10)\n#If the priesthood of Aaron were effective, God would not have called a new priest in a different order in Psalm 110. (Heb. 7:11)\n#The basis of the Aaronic priesthood was ancestry; the basis of the priesthood of Melchizedek is everlasting life. That is, there is no interruption due to a priest's death. (Heb. 7:8,15-16,23-25)\n#Christ, being sinless, does not need a sacrifice for his own sins. (Heb. 7:26-27)\n#The priesthood of Melchizedek is more effective because it required a single sacrifice once and for all (Jesus), while the Levitical priesthood made endless sacrifices. (Heb. 7:27)\n#The [[kohen|Aaronic priests]] serve (or, rather, served) in an earthly copy and shadow of the heavenly Temple, which Jesus serves in. (Heb. 8:5)\n\nThe epistle goes on to say that the [[New Covenant (theology)|covenant]] of Jesus is superior to the [[Mosaic Covenant|covenant]] the Levitical priesthood is under. Some Christians hold that Melchizedek was a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ, and some other Christians hold that Melchizedek indeed ''was'' Christ. Reasons provided include that Melchizedek's name means \"king of righteousness\" according to the author of Hebrews, and that being king of Salem makes Melchizedek the \"king of peace\". Heb. 7:3 states, \"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever.\" Melchizedek gave Abraham bread and wine, which some Christians consider symbols of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice to confirm a covenant.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[Catholicism|Catholics]] find the roots of their priesthood in the tradition of Melchizedek (CCC 1544).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722004028/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM |date=July 22, 2016 }} \"The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, \"priest of God Most High,\" as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the unique \"high priest after the order of Melchizedek\";16 \"holy, blameless, unstained,\"</ref> In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18, Melchizedek offers a sacrifice of bread and wine. Christ therefore fulfilled the prophecy of Ps 110:4, that he would be a priest \"after the order of Melchizedek\" at the [[Last Supper]], when he broke and shared bread with his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]]. Catholics interpret  more literally Christ's commands that the Apostles should \"do this in memory of Me\" and \"as often as you can\". As such, the Catholic Church, at least once a day in every parish, offers the same sacrifice of bread and wine at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], as part of the [[Sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}} \n{{Further|Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the Melchizedek Priesthood is viewed as the priesthood authority of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]], as well as [[Old Testament]] prophets, higher than that of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic]] authority of [[John the Baptist]] and of the Levites.\n\nAccording to the [[Book of Mormon]], the prophet [[Melchizedek]] preached repentance to the people of a wicked city, and established peace in the land. According to {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=13|verse=18}}, Melchizedek's efforts earned him the title \"the prince of peace\". Of particular importance is the parallel Hebrew meaning of \"prince of peace\" and \"king of Salem\", another of Melchizedek's titles, and his association with (or typology of) Jesus Christ, who is also called the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:2), as well as the Great High Priest (Heb. 4:14). Later, Melchizedek's people were, according to [[Joseph Smith]], caught up, or \"[[Translation (LDS Church)|translated]]\", to meet the city of Enoch ([[Joseph Smith Translation]] of Genesis 14:34). The priesthood is referred to by the name of Melchizedek because he was such a great high priest (Doctrine & Covenants {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=2}}). The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] states that before Melchizedek's day the Priesthood \"was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God. But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too-frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in the ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood\" (Doctrine and Covenants {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=3-4}}). Initially, the only Melchizedek Priesthood office in the Latter Day Saint movement was [[Elder (LDS Church)|Elder]]. Later revelations extended the office complement to [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Seventy]], [[High Priest (LDS Church)|High Priest]], [[Patriarch (LDS Church)|Patriarch]] and [[Apostle (LDS Church)|Apostle]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102082300/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=815&cuItem_itemID=1190 WELS Topical Q&A: Hebrews 5:6 - Melchizedek's Importance?] ([[Confessional Lutheran]] perspective)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615061639/http://www.catholic.com/library/Institution_of_the_Mass.asp Melchizedek priesthood] in the theology of the Catholic Mass\n*[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/melchizedek-priesthood?lang=eng Melchizedek Priesthood] in the theology of the Latter-day Saints\n*{{CathEncy|wstitle=Melchisedech}}\nhttps://www.createspace.com/3670614 The Mystery of Melchizedek, M.M.Ninan\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Melchizedek Priesthood}}\n[[Category:Religious terminology]]\n[[Category:Jewish theology]]\n[[Category:Melchizedek]]\n[[Category:Lech-Lecha]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLatter Day Saint movement:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_of_Melchizedek"}

Each of the four division winners advanced to the [[1967 NFL playoffs|playoffs]].\n\nThe Packers clinched the Central division title at [[Wrigley Field]] on November 26 at 8\u20132\u20131, with three games remaining, as the second-place [[1967 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] fell to 5\u20136.<ref name=pdbccrn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F3tIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JxEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7505%2C5909695 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Lea |first=Bud |title=Packers defeat Bears, clinch crown |date=November 27, 1967 |page=1, part 2 }}</ref><ref name=pwt3wke>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iQcqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_icEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7226%2C4287864 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |last=Johnson |first=Chuck |title=Packers win title 3 weeks early |date=November 27, 1967 |page=10, part 2 }}</ref><ref name=pbtbrs>{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/11/27/page/65/article/packers-beat-bears-win-division-title |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |last=Strickler |first=George |title=Packers beat Bears; win division title |date=November 27, 1967 |page=1, section 3 }}</ref> With the rotational system (in place until {{nfly|1975}}), they had home field advantage for the playoffs in 1967, with the first round (conference) scheduled at Milwaukee against the Coastal division champion.<ref name=gwwwtd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QYZRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=thAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7172%2C2005380 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Vince: Got what we wanted|date=July 11, 1967 |page=1, part 2}}</ref><ref name=mwgpog>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s1A0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=dH4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7017%2C158692 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |last=Johnson |first=Chuck |title=Milwaukee will get play-off game if the Packers win division crown |date=July 11, 1967 |page=9, part 2}}</ref>\n\n===Schedule===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The game was played on December 31, 1967, at Lambeau Field in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. The official game-time temperature was \u221213&nbsp;\u00b0F / -25&nbsp;\u00b0C, with a wind chill around \u221248&nbsp;\u00b0F / -44&nbsp;\u00b0C. The bitter cold overwhelmed Lambeau Field's new turf heating system, leaving the playing surface hard as a rock and nearly as smooth as ice. The officials were unable to use their whistles after the opening kickoff when a whistle stuck to a referee's lips.\n\nEarly in the game, the Packers jumped to a 14\u20130 lead with a pair of touchdown passes from [[Bart Starr]] to wide receiver [[Boyd Dowler]]. Green Bay committed two costly turnovers in the second quarter that led to ten Dallas points. Neither team was able to score any points in the third quarter, but then on the first play of the final period, the Cowboys took a 17\u201314 lead with running back [[Dan Reeves]]' 50-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Lance Rentzel]] on a [[halfback option play]].\n\nStarting from his own 32-yard line with 4:54 left in the game, Starr led his team down the field to the one-yard line. Running back [[Donny Anderson]] attempted two runs into the end zone, but fell short. Facing a third down with sixteen seconds left in the game, Starr executed a [[quarterback sneak]] behind center Ken Bowman and guard [[Jerry Kramer]]'s block through defensive tackle [[Jethro Pugh]], scoring a touchdown that gave the Packers a 21\u201317 win and their unprecedented third consecutive NFL championship.\n\n===Super Bowl II===\n{{main article|Super Bowl II}}\n{{Americanfootballbox | \n|titlestyle= {{NFLPrimaryColor|Green Bay Packers}}; {{NFLSecondaryColor|Green Bay Packers}};text-align:center;\n|title=Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14\n|Road='''Packers'''\n|R1=3\n|R2=13\n|R3=10\n|R4=7\n|Home=Raiders\n|H1=0\n|H2=7\n|H3=0\n|H4=7\n|stadium=[[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]], [[Miami]], [[Florida]]\n|date=January 14, 1968\n|time = 3:05 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|weather={{convert|68|F|}}, partly cloudy\n|attendance=75,546\n|scoring=\n'''First Quarter'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 [[Don Chandler]] 39-yard field goal - '''Packers 3\u20130'''\n'''Second quarter'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 Don Chandler 20-yard field goal - '''Packers 6\u20130'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 [[Boyd Dowler]] 62-yard pass from [[Bart Starr]] (Don Chandler kick) - '''Packers 13\u20130'''\n* OAK \u2013 [[Bill Miller (wide receiver)|Bill Miller]] 23-yard pass from [[Daryle Lamonica]] ([[George Blanda]] kick) - '''Packers 13\u20137'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 Don Chandler 43-yard field goal - '''Packers 16\u20137'''\n'''Third quarter'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 [[Donny Anderson]] 2-yard run (Don Chandler kick) - '''Packers 23\u20137'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 Don Chandler 31-yard field goal - '''Packers 26\u20137'''\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 [[Herb Adderley]] 60-yard interception return (Don Chandler kick) - '''Packers 33\u20137'''\n* OAK \u2013 Bill Miller 23-yard pass from Daryle Lamonica (George Blanda kick) - '''Packers 33\u201314'''\n}}\nAfter beating the Cowboys in the NFL Championship game, the Packers advanced to the [[AFL-NFL World Championship Game]] to face the American Football League champions, the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]].

The bitter cold overwhelmed Lambeau Field's new turf heating system, leaving the playing surface hard as a rock and nearly as smooth as ice. The officials were unable to use their whistles after the opening kickoff when a whistle stuck to a referee's lips.\n\nEarly in the game, the Packers jumped to a 14\u20130 lead with a pair of touchdown passes from [[Bart Starr]] to wide receiver [[Boyd Dowler]]. Green Bay committed two costly turnovers in the second quarter that led to ten Dallas points. Neither team was able to score any points in the third quarter, but then on the first play of the final period, the Cowboys took a 17\u201314 lead with running back [[Dan Reeves]]' 50-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Lance Rentzel]] on a [[halfback option play]].\n\nStarting from his own 32-yard line with 4:54 left in the game, Starr led his team down the field to the one-yard line. Running back [[Donny Anderson]] attempted two runs into the end zone, but fell short. Facing a third down with sixteen seconds left in the game, Starr executed a [[quarterback sneak]] behind center Ken Bowman and guard [[Jerry Kramer]]'s block through defensive tackle [[Jethro Pugh]], scoring a touchdown that gave the Packers a 21\u201317 win and their unprecedented third consecutive NFL championship.\n\n===Super Bowl II===\n{{main article|Super Bowl II}}\n{{Americanfootballbox | \n|titlestyle= {{NFLPrimaryColor|Green Bay Packers}}; {{NFLSecondaryColor|Green Bay Packers}};text-align:center;\n|title=Green Bay Packers 33, Oakland Raiders 14\n|Road='''Packers'''\n|R1=3\n|R2=13\n|R3=10\n|R4=7\n|Home=Raiders\n|H1=0\n|H2=7\n|H3=0\n|H4=7\n|stadium=[[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]], [[Miami]], [[Florida]]\n|date=January 14, 1968\n|time = 3:05 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|weather={{convert|68|F|}}, partly cloudy\n|attendance=75,546\n|scoring=\n'''First Quarter'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 [[Don Chandler]] 39-yard field goal - '''Packers 3\u20130'''\n'''Second quarter'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 Don Chandler 20-yard field goal - '''Packers 6\u20130'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 [[Boyd Dowler]] 62-yard pass from [[Bart Starr]] (Don Chandler kick) - '''Packers 13\u20130'''\n* OAK \u2013 [[Bill Miller (American football)|Bill Miller]] 23-yard pass from [[Daryle Lamonica]] ([[George Blanda]] kick) - '''Packers 13\u20137'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 Don Chandler 43-yard field goal - '''Packers 16\u20137'''\n'''Third quarter'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 [[Donny Anderson]] 2-yard run (Don Chandler kick) - '''Packers 23\u20137'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 Don Chandler 31-yard field goal - '''Packers 26\u20137'''\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n* GB &nbsp; \u2013 [[Herb Adderley]] 60-yard interception return (Don Chandler kick) - '''Packers 33\u20137'''\n* OAK \u2013 Bill Miller 23-yard pass from Daryle Lamonica (George Blanda kick) - '''Packers 33\u201314'''\n}}\nAfter beating the Cowboys in the NFL Championship game, the Packers advanced to the [[AFL-NFL World Championship Game]] to face the American Football League champions, the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]].

At the end of the half, Don Chandler added another field goal, making the score 16\u20137.\n\nIn the second half, Starr completed a 35-yard pass to receiver Max McGee, which was the last reception of McGee's career. The pass helped set up [[Donny Anderson]]'s two-yard touchdown run. Early in the fourth quarter, Chandler kicked his fourth field goal, making the score 26\u20137. After the field goal, Starr was injured on a sack and was replaced by [[Zeke Bratkowski]]. Later in the fourth quarter, Packers defensive back [[Herb Adderley]] intercepted a Raiders pass and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown, making the score 33\u20137. The Raiders managed to score a second touchdown on a 23-yard touchdown pass from Lamonica to Bill Miller late in the fourth quarter. The Packers went on to win the game 33\u201314.
