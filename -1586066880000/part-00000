Although originally formulated in terms of species within a genus, it has often been recast in terms of populations within a species. It is also often cast in terms of latitude. It is possible that the rule also applies to some plants, such as ''[[Rapicactus]]''.\n\nThe rule is named after nineteenth century [[Germany|German]] biologist [[Carl Bergmann (anatomist)|Carl Bergmann]], who described the pattern in 1847, although he was not the first to notice it. Bergmann's rule is most often applied to mammals and birds which are [[endotherm]]s, but some researchers have also found evidence for the rule in studies of [[ectothermic]] species.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Miguel \u00c1.  |last1=Olalla-T\u00e1rraga  |first2=Miguel \u00c1.  |last2=Rodr\u00edguez  |first3=Bradford A.  |last3=Hawkins |year=2006 |title=Broad-scale patterns of body size in squamate reptiles of Europe and North America |journal=[[Journal of Biogeography]] |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=781\u2013793 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01435.x |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/8rh6d1qg  }}</ref><ref name=\"Timofeev2001\">{{cite journal | last=Timofeev | first=S.

Warmer climates impose the opposite problem: body heat generated by metabolism needs to be dissipated quickly rather than stored within.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=James H. |first2=Anthony K. |last2=Lee |title=Bergmann's Rule and Climatic Adaptation in Woodrats (Neotoma) |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=329\u2013338 |date=January 1969 |jstor=2406795 |doi=10.2307/2406795}}</ref>\n\nThus, the higher surface area-to-volume ratio of smaller animals in hot and dry climates facilitates heat loss through the skin and helps cool the body.

Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} believe that latitude itself is a poor predictor of body mass. Examples of other selective factors that may contribute to body mass changes are the size of food items available, effects of body size on success as a [[predator]], effects of body size on vulnerability to predation, and resource availability. For example, if an organism is adapted to tolerate cold temperatures, it may also tolerate periods of food shortage, due to correlation between cold temperature and food scarcity.<ref name=\"Ashton2000\"/> A larger organism can rely on its greater fat stores to provide the energy needed for survival as well being able to procreate for longer periods.\n\nResource availability is a major constraint on the overall success of many organisms. Resource scarcity can limit the total number of organisms in a habitat, and over time can also cause organisms to adapt by becoming smaller in body size. Resource availability thus becomes a modifying restraint on Bergmann's Rule.<ref name=\"Clauss2013\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00463.x| title=Bergmann\u2032s rule in mammals: A cross-species interspecific pattern| journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=122| issue=10| pages=1465\u20131472| date=October 2013 | last1=Clauss | first1=Marcus | last2=Dittmann | first2=Marei T. | last3=M\u00fcller | first3=Dennis W.

Warmer climates impose the opposite problem: body heat generated by metabolism needs to be dissipated quickly rather than stored within.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=James H. |first2=Anthony K. |last2=Lee |title=Bergmann's Rule and Climatic Adaptation in Woodrats (Neotoma) |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=329\u2013338 |date=January 1969 |jstor=2406795 |doi=10.2307/2406795}}</ref>\n\nThus, the higher surface area-to-volume ratio of smaller animals in hot and dry climates facilitates heat loss through the skin and helps cool the body. It is important to note that when analyzing Bergmann's Rule in the field that groups of populations being studied are of different thermal environments, and also have been separated long enough to genetically differentiate in response to these thermal conditions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn marine [[crustacean]]s, it has been proposed that an increase in size with latitude is observed because decreasing temperature results in increased [[Cell (biology)|cell]] size and increased [[Longevity|life span]], both of which lead to an increase in maximum body size (continued growth throughout life is characteristic of crustaceans).<ref name=\"Timofeev2001\"/> The size trend has been observed in [[Hyperiidae|hyperiid]] and [[gammarid]] [[amphipod]]s, [[copepod]]s, [[stomatopod]]s, [[mysid]]s, and planktonic [[euphausiid]]s, both in comparisons of related species as well as within widely distributed species.<ref name=\"Timofeev2001\"/> [[Deep-sea gigantism]] is observed in some of the same groups, possibly for the same reasons.<ref name=\"Timofeev2001\"/> An additional factor in aquatic species may be the greater dissolved oxygen concentration at lower temperature.

Some{{Who|date=September 2019}} believe that latitude itself is a poor predictor of body mass. Examples of other selective factors that may contribute to body mass changes are the size of food items available, effects of body size on success as a [[predator]], effects of body size on vulnerability to predation, and resource availability. For example, if an organism is adapted to tolerate cold temperatures, it may also tolerate periods of food shortage, due to correlation between cold temperature and food scarcity.<ref name=\"Ashton2000\"/> A larger organism can rely on its greater fat stores to provide the energy needed for survival as well being able to procreate for longer periods.\n\nResource availability is a major constraint on the overall success of many organisms. Resource scarcity can limit the total number of organisms in a habitat, and over time can also cause organisms to adapt by becoming smaller in body size. Resource availability thus becomes a modifying restraint on Bergmann's Rule.<ref name=\"Clauss2013\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00463.x| title=Bergmann\u2032s rule in mammals: A cross-species interspecific pattern| journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=122| issue=10| pages=1465\u20131472| date=October 2013 | last1=Clauss | first1=Marcus | last2=Dittmann | first2=Marei T. | last3=M\u00fcller | first3=Dennis W.
