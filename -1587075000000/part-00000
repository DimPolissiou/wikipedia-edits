The earliest source to mention this is the 2nd Century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' (a part of ''[[Divyavadana]]''). According to this account, Pushyamitra (described as the last Mauryan king) wanted to be famous. His ministers advised him that as long as Buddhism remained the dominant faith, he would never be as famous as his ancestor [[Ashoka]], who had commissioned 84,000 [[stupa]]s. One advisor told him that he could become famous by destroying Buddhism. Pushyamitra then tried to destroy the [[Kukkutarama]] monastery, but it was saved by a miracle. He then proceeded to [[Sagala|Shakala]] in the north-west, where he offered a prize of one hundred ''dinara''s (gold coins) for every head of a Buddhist monk brought to him. Next, he proceeded to the Koshthaka kingdom, where a Buddhist [[yaksha]] named Damshtranivasin killed him and his army with help of another yaksha named Krimisha.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=95-96}}{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=33}}\n\n{{quote|... Pushyamitra equipped a fourfold army, and intending to destroy the Buddhist religion, he went to the [[Kukkutarama]] (in [[Pataliputra]]). ... Pushyamitra therefore destroyed the [[sangharama]], killed the monks there, and departed. ... After some time, he arrived in [[Sagala|Sakala]], and proclaimed that he would give a ... reward to whoever brought him the head of a Buddhist monk.{{sf|Strong|1989|p=293}}}}\n\n''Vibhasa'', another 2nd century text, states that Pushyamitra burned Buddhist scriptures, killed Buddhist monks, and destroyed 500 monasteries in and around [[Kashmir]]. In this campaign, he was supported by yakshas, ''kumbhanda''s, and other demons. However, when he reached the [[Bodhi tree]], the deity of that tree took the form of a beautiful woman and killed him.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=96}} ''Shariputrapariprichha'', translated into Chinese between 317 and 420 CE also mentions this legend, but this particular version is more detailed, and describes eastern India (not Kashmir) as the center of Pushyamitra's anti-Buddhist campaign.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=96}}\n\nThe medieval-era ''Arya-Manjushri-Mula-Kalpa'' mentions a wicked and foolish king named Gomimukhya (\"cattle-faced\"), or Gomishanda (\"Gomin, the bull\"), who seized the territory from the east to Kashmir, destroying monasteries and killing monks. Ultimately, he and his officers were killed in the north by falling mountain rocks.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=96}}{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=33-34}} This king is identified with Pushyamitra by some scholars.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jayantanuja |last=Bandyopadhyaya |title=Class and Religion in Ancient India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwUF11NRyT4C&pg=PA209 |year=2007 |publisher=Anthem |isbn=978-1-84331-332-8 |page=209 }}</ref>\n\nThe 16th-century Tibetan Buddhist historian [[Taranatha]] also states that Pushyamitra and his allies killed Buddhist monks and destroyed monasteries from ''madhyadesha'' (midland) to [[Jalandhar]]a. These activities wiped out the Buddhist doctrine from the north, within five years.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=96}}\n\n=== Authenticity of Buddhist claims ===\n[[File:Procession on Elephants. Bharhut, c. 100 BC. Indian Museum, Calcutta ei05-19.jpg|thumb|Men riding elephants. [[Bharhut]], Sunga period.]]\nBased on Buddhist tradition, some scholars believe that Pushyamitra was indeed a persecutor of the Buddhist faith. However, others believe that Buddhist scholars were biased against Pushyamitra, because he did not patronize them.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|pp=34-35}}\n\n[[Vincent Arthur Smith|V. A. Smith]] and H. P. Shastri believed that Pushyamitra's rebellion against the Maurya dynasty was a Brahminical reaction to the rise of Buddhism.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=34}} According to archaeologist [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]], there is evidence of some damage to Buddhist establishments at [[Takshashila]] around the time of Shunga rule. He also theorized that the [[Sanchi Stupa|Sanchi stupa]] was vandalized in 2nd century BCE (that is, during Pushyamitra's reign), before being rebuilt on a larger scale.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=96-97}} G. R. Sharma, who excavated the Buddhist ruins at [[Kosambi|Kaushambi]], suggested that the destruction of the local monastery might have happened during the reign of Pushyamitra Shunga. P. K. Mishra believes that the damage to the [[Deur Kothar]] stupa is also datable to Pushyamitra's period.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=97}} H. C. Raychaudhari pointed out that Buddhist monuments were constructed at [[Bharhut]] during the Shunga rule.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=34}} However, according to N. N. Ghosh, these were constructed during the reign of later Shunga rulers, not Pushyamitra's period.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=97}}\n\nH. Bhattacharya theorized that Pushyamitra might have persecuted Buddhists for political, rather than religious, reasons: the politically active Buddhists probably supported the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek]] rivals of Pushyamitra, which might have prompted him to persecute them.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=100}} The ''Ashokavadana'' states that Pushyamitra declared a reward for killing Buddhist monks in [[Sagala|Shakala]] (present-day Sialkot), which was located near the Indo-Greek frontiers. According to K. P. Jayaswal, this further highlights a political motivation behind his alleged persecution of Buddhists.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=99-100}}\n\nMany other scholars have expressed skepticism about the Buddhist claims of persecution by Pushyamitra. [[\u00c9tienne Lamotte]] points out that the Buddhist legends are not consistent about the location of Pushyamitra's anti-Buddhist campaign and his death.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=98}} The ''Ashokavadana'' claims that Pushyamitra offered ''dinara''s as a reward for killing Buddhist monks, but the ''dinara'' did not come into circulation in India before the 1st century CE. ''Ashokavadana'' also claims that Ashoka persecuted ''Nirgrantha''s ([[Ajivika]]s), which is an obvious fabrication, considering that Ashoka's edicts express tolerance towards all religious sects.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=99}} The Sri Lankan Buddhist text ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' suggests that several monasteries existed in present-day Bihar, Awadh and Malwa at the time Pushyamitra's contemporary [[Dutthagamani]] ruled in Lanka. This suggests that these monasteries survived Pushyamitra Shunga's reign.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=100}}\n\nH. C. Raychaudhury argued that Pushyamitra's overthrow of the Mauryans cannot be considered as a Brahmin uprising against Buddhist rule, as Brahmins did not suffer during the Mauryan rule: Ashoka's edicts mention the Brahmins before [[Shramana]]s, and the appointment of a Brahmin general (Pushyamitra) shows that the Brahmins were honoured at the Mauryan court.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=34}} The fact that the ''Ashokavadana'' mentions Pushyamitra as a Mauryan further erodes its historical credibility, and weakens the hypothesis that he persecuted Buddhists because he was a Brahmin.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|p=99}} Raychaudhury also aruged that according to ''[[Malavikagnimitra]]'', a Buddhist nun named Bhagavati Kaushiki attended Pushyamitra's court, which indicates that they did not persecute Buddhists. However, Shankar Goyal states that there is no evidence of Kaushiki being a Buddhist nun.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxpuAAAAMAAJ |title=Aspects of ancient Indian history and historiography |author=Shankar Goyal |publisher=Harman |year=1993 |isbn=9788185151694 |page=30 }}</ref> [[Romila Thapar]] writes that the lack of concrete archaeological evidence casts doubt on the claims of Buddhist persecution by Pushyamitra.<ref>A\u015boka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the Buddhist influence at the Mauryan court declined during Pushyamitra's reign, and the Buddhist monasteries and other institutions stopped receiving royal patronage. This change might have led to discontent among the Buddhists, resulting in exaggerated accounts of persecution.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=99-100}}\n\n[[Michael Witzel]] states that ''[[Manu Smriti|Manudharma]]'', which emphasizes the role of orthodox faith in state-craft and society, was first compiled under Pushyamitra's rule.
