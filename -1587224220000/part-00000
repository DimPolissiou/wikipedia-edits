It supports [[IPv6]] and, for those on IPv4 networks, [[Hole punching (networking)|NAT punching]] and relaying are offered. Devices connecting to each other require explicit approval (unless using the Introducer feature) which increases the security of the [[Mesh networking|mesh]].

The relaying performed is similar in nature to the [[Traversal Using Relays around NAT|TURN]] protocol, with the traffic [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]-encrypted end-to-end between devices (thus even the relay server cannot see the data, only the encrypted stream). Private relays can also be set up and configured, with or without public relays, if desired.

[[Antoon van Croy|Antoine I de Cro\u00ff]] demolished the medieval castle and started works to build the current ch\u00e2teau in 1455 on the site, of which he destroyed all but one tower. His grandson, [[Willem van Cro\u00ff|William de Cro\u00ff]], completed the works on the ch\u00e2teau in 1515, and founded a monastery on the ch\u00e2teau grounds for the [[Benedictine]] [[Celestines]]. The architectural style is in large part traditionally Flemish, with sandstone window frames and brick walls, though it has been structurally altered since 1515 and has elements of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], and [[Neo-Gothic architecture|Neo Gothic]] architecture. Its large corner towers are typical, once surmounted by a German eagle.\n\n[[Charles III de Cro\u00ff|Charles III of Croy]] was the 4th and  last duke, and after his death in 1612 without issue the ch\u00e2teau passed to the [[Duke of Arenberg|Arenberg family]] into which his sister had married, and remained in that family until the [[First World War]].\n \nEven before the First World War, the 8th duke of Arenberg wanted to sell the ch\u00e2teau and its grounds to the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], for a reasonable price.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} During the [[First World War]], the ch\u00e2teau and grounds were occupied by the Germans and Austrians. The ch\u00e2teau and park were seized by the Belgian government on the outbreak of, and then after the war since the Arenberg family was considered to be German or Austrian due to their close Habsburg connection, monarchs of Austria-Hungary. It took until 1921 for the University to acquire them, becoming an expanded natural sciences and engineering campus in the style of that of an American university. After the partitioning of the university along language lines in 1968, the ch\u00e2teau and grounds remained with the Dutch speaking half as one of the main campuses for the new, independent [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]. The ch\u00e2teau itself is the main building of the Faculty of Engineering and houses lecture rooms and studios for the Department of Architecture, Urbanism and Urban Planning, including the Post-Graduate Centre Human Settlements and the Raymond Lemaire International Centre for Conservation (named after [[Raymond M. Lemaire]]). The building is open to the public. The former Celestine monastery on the ch\u00e2teau grounds now houses the campus library, and the addresses of many of the science buildings are on the street named ''Celestijnenlaan'' (Dutch for \"Celestine Street\").\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of castles in Belgium]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Kasteel van Arenberg}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120627134710/http://www.leuven.be/en/tourism/sightseeing/university/kasteel-arenberg/index.jsp Local tourism information]\n\n{{coord|50|51|48|N|4|40|59|E|display=title|region:BE_type:landmark_source:dewiki}}\n\n{{Universities of Louvain}}{{Castles in Belgium}}\n[[Category:Castles in Belgium|Arenberg]]\n[[Category:Castles in Flemish Brabant|Arenberg]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Leuven]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|text=the [[Arenberg Castle, Salzburg|Arenberg Castle]] in [[Salzburg]] or the Napoleonic chateau of [[Arenenberg]]}}\n{{unreferenced|date=August 2012}}\n[[Image:Castle Arenberg, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven adj.jpg|thumb|250px|Arenberg Castle]]\n\n'''Arenberg Castle''' ([[French language|French]]: Ch\u00e2teau d'Arenberg, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Kasteel van Arenberg) is a [[ch\u00e2teau]] in [[Heverlee]] close to [[Leuven]] in [[Belgium]].

Its large corner towers are typical, once surmounted by a German eagle.\n\n[[Charles III de Cro\u00ff|Charles III of Croy]] was the 4th and  last duke, and after his death in 1612 without issue the ch\u00e2teau passed to the [[Duke of Arenberg|Arenberg family]] into which his sister had married, and remained in that family until the [[First World War]].\n \nEven before the First World War, the 8th duke of Arenberg wanted to sell the ch\u00e2teau and its grounds to the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], for a reasonable price.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} During the [[First World War]], the ch\u00e2teau and grounds were occupied by the Germans and Austrians. The ch\u00e2teau and park were seized by the Belgian government on the outbreak of, and then after the war since the Arenberg family was considered to be German or Austrian due to their close Habsburg connection, monarchs of Austria-Hungary. It took until 1921 for the University to acquire them, becoming an expanded natural sciences and engineering campus in the style of that of an American university. After the partitioning of the university along language lines in 1968, the ch\u00e2teau and grounds remained with the Dutch speaking half as one of the main campuses for the new, independent [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]. The ch\u00e2teau itself is the main building of the Faculty of Engineering and houses lecture rooms and studios for the Department of Architecture, Urbanism and Urban Planning, including the Post-Graduate Centre Human Settlements and the Raymond Lemaire International Centre for Conservation (named after [[Raymond M. Lemaire]]). The building is open to the public. The former Celestine monastery on the ch\u00e2teau grounds now houses the campus library, and the addresses of many of the science buildings are on the street named ''Celestijnenlaan'' (Dutch for \"Celestine Street\").\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of castles in Belgium]]\n\n==References==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Kasteel van Arenberg}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120627134710/http://www.leuven.be/en/tourism/sightseeing/university/kasteel-arenberg/index.jsp Local tourism information]\n\n{{coord|50|51|48|N|4|40|59|E|display=title|region:BE_type:landmark_source:dewiki}}\n\n{{Universities of Louvain}}{{Castles in Belgium}}\n[[Category:Castles in Belgium|Arenberg]]\n[[Category:Castles in Flemish Brabant|Arenberg]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Leuven]]\n", "name_user": "Rfl0216", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasteel_van_Arenberg"}

He paid $192&nbsp;million, a league record at that time.<ref name=\"New York Times\"/> Glazer served as president of the team, while sons Bryan, Joel and Edward were co-chairmen at the time.\n\nSince coming under the Glazer family's ownership, the club has experienced an upswing in its fortunes, winning 131 regular season games, earning seven playoff berths and capturing its first Super Bowl Championship in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]. Prior to Glazer's purchase, the Buccaneers had won just 87 games in 19 seasons and had advanced to the postseason just three times.\n\nTampa Bay also eclipsed the club record for wins in a regular season with 12 in 2002. The top five single-season win totals in club history (12 in 2002, 11 in 2005, 11 in 1999, 10 in 2010, 10 in 2000 and 10 in 1997. The team also won 10 games in 1979) have all come under Glazer's stewardship, and Tampa Bay was the only team in the league to play in the postseason each year from 1999 to 2002. The 2007 campaign saw the Buccaneers claim their third NFC South Division title in six years, the sixth division crown in franchise history.\n\nAfter the team finished 9\u20137 in 2008, the team fired [[Jon Gruden]], the most successful coach in franchise history. The team has not made it back to the playoffs since.\n\nIn January 2009, Glazer and his family hired Raheem Morris as head coach of the Buccaneers, making him the youngest head coach in the National Football League upon his appointment. In addition, the family named longtime Director of Pro Personnel Mark Dominik as the fourth general manager in club history. Morris went 17\u201331 as a head coach and was fired after three seasons. The fact that the Bucs lost their final 10 games of the 2011 season was a likely contributor to the decision.\n\nOn January 27, 2012, Glazer and his family hired long-time Rutgers University head coach [[Greg Schiano]] as the ninth head coach in franchise history. Schiano only lasted two seasons, being fired following a disappointing 4\u201312 season in 2013. Mark Dominik was also fired at that time, lasting five seasons. During his tenure the team compiled a record of 28\u201352, which included only one winning season.\n\nGlazer devoted a significant amount of time working to make the organization more fan-friendly by greatly increasing fan activities at Buccaneers home games through the expansion of the club's community relations and special events departments. His mandate to enhance the team's visibility in the community was reflected through increased appearances by Buccaneer players,coaches, cheerleaders and front office officials in recent years. Since 1999, the team has also coordinated with the Glazer Family Foundation to host \"Gameday for Kids\", a program that has hosted over 13,000 underprivileged youth at Buccaneers home games, giving them an opportunity to spend pregame moments on the playing field and to cheer on the Buccaneers from exclusive seats in [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\n===Manchester United===\n{{main|Glazer ownership of Manchester United}}\n[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] is one of the most popular and profitable football clubs in the world.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45edmjk/2-manchester-united-2/ | title = The World's 50 Most Valuable Sports Teams 2013 | work=Forbes | first=Kurt | last=Badenhausen}}</ref> Glazer acquired ownership of United in a \u00a3790m takeover by gradually buying out United shareholders between 2003 and 2005.<ref name=BBC1>{{cite web|title=Malcolm Glazer dies: Man Utd's former owner dies aged 85|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27614216|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref> Glazer's takeover was protested by a large portion of United's fans due to financial concerns.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|title=Malcolm Glazer, Owner of Buccaneers and Manchester United, Is Dead at 85|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/sports/malcolm-glazer-owner-of-buccaneers-and-manchester-united-is-dead-at-85.html|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref><ref name=BBC2>{{cite web|title=Malcolm Glazer dies: Manchester United legacy examined|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27614221|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref> However, Glazer's stroke in April 2006 resulted in his sons Joel and Avram, taking over the day-to-day running of the club, and Glazer's family continued to control the club through his death in 2014.<ref name=BBC1/> After Glazer's death, his family owned a 90% stake in the club that is equally split among Glazer's six children.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manchester United, Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Malcolm Glazer dies at 85|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/29/us-glazer-obituary-idUSKBN0E82CA20140529|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nPeter King wrote of Glazer's \"quiet legacy,\" saying \"Glazer was a stealth owner if there ever was one. The longtime owner of the Bucs, he bought them from Hugh Culverhouse in 1995, very seldom spoke publicly. Tampa Bay won one Super Bowl under Glazer's ownership, the Jon Gruden-led title 12 years ago, after Glazer made the difficult decision to fire [[Tony Dungy]] and go with new blood. But it's Dungy who is part of Glazer's real legacy, both to the Bucs and to the game. The Glazers, in their two decades as owners, have hired three African-American coaches\u2014Dungy, Raheem Morris and Lovie Smith. No other owner in NFL history has hired as many African-American coaches. That should be the significance of Glazer's run in the NFL\u2014he was colorblind at a time when many teams, and owners, in the league were not.\n\"Yes, it is notable,'' Dungy said over the weekend. \"He hired me when there was still trepidation by some people. And he may not have made the final decision on Lovie, but he set the tone in the organization and he put the mindset in his sons to look at people impartially. He and I had many conversations about relationships and how you treat others. That was very important to him.\"\nNo one around the NFL will remember many impassioned speeches by Glazer. But his actions spoke louder. The league should hold him up as an example of hiring the best guy.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Peter|title=NFL Locker-room culture change targeted in upcoming initiative|url=http://mmqb.si.com/2014/06/02/nfl-locker-room-culture-peter-king-25-years-si|website=MMQB}}</ref>\n\n\"Malcolm Glazer was the guiding force behind the building of a Super Bowl champion organization,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \"His dedication to the community was evident in all he did, including his leadership in bringing Super Bowls to Tampa Bay.

He launched the Glazer Family Foundation in 1999, which is dedicated to assisting charitable and educational causes in the [[Tampa Bay]] community. During its existence, the foundation has donated millions in programs, tickets, grants and in-kind contributions. The foundation donated $5&nbsp;million toward the construction of the [[Glazer Children's Museum]] in [[downtown Tampa]], which opened on September 25, 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.visittampabay.com/blog/bay-blogger/glazer-childrens-museum-opening-and-membership-special|title=Glazer Children's Museum Opening and Membership Special!|publisher=Visit Tampa Bay|date=July 7, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213014157/http://www.visittampabay.com/blog/bay-blogger/glazer-childrens-museum-opening-and-membership-special|archivedate=December 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nGlazer also oversaw the operations of the far-reaching Glazer Family Foundation's Vision Program, created in 2006 to provide school children with an opportunity to have vision problems identified in schools at an early age.

Glazer successfully diversified it into fish protein and Caribbean supermarkets.\n\nGlazer owned a diverse portfolio of investments, which included food service equipment, food packaging and food supplies, marine protein, broadcasting, health care, property, banking, natural gas and oil, the Internet, stocks and bonds.<ref name=\"New York Times\"/>\n\n==Sports ownership==\n\n===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===\nGlazer purchased the Tampa Bay Buccaneers franchise on January 16, 1995, following the death of former owner [[Hugh Culverhouse]]. He paid $192&nbsp;million, a league record at that time.<ref name=\"New York Times\"/> Glazer served as president of the team, while sons Bryan, Joel and Edward were co-chairmen at the time.\n\nSince coming under the Glazer family's ownership, the club has experienced an upswing in its fortunes, winning 131 regular season games, earning seven playoff berths and capturing its first Super Bowl Championship in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]. Prior to Glazer's purchase, the Buccaneers had won just 87 games in 19 seasons and had advanced to the postseason just three times.\n\nTampa Bay also eclipsed the club record for wins in a regular season with 12 in 2002. The top five single-season win totals in club history (12 in 2002, 11 in 2005, 11 in 1999, 10 in 2010, 10 in 2000 and 10 in 1997. The team also won 10 games in 1979) have all come under Glazer's stewardship, and Tampa Bay was the only team in the league to play in the postseason each year from 1999 to 2002. The 2007 campaign saw the Buccaneers claim their third NFC South Division title in six years, the sixth division crown in franchise history.\n\nAfter the team finished 9\u20137 in 2008, the team fired [[Jon Gruden]], the most successful coach in franchise history. The team has not made it back to the playoffs since.\n\nIn January 2009, Glazer and his family hired Raheem Morris as head coach of the Buccaneers, making him the youngest head coach in the National Football League upon his appointment. In addition, the family named longtime Director of Pro Personnel Mark Dominik as the fourth general manager in club history. Morris went 17\u201331 as a head coach and was fired after three seasons. The fact that the Bucs lost their final 10 games of the 2011 season was a likely contributor to the decision.\n\nOn January 27, 2012, Glazer and his family hired long-time Rutgers University head coach [[Greg Schiano]] as the ninth head coach in franchise history. Schiano only lasted two seasons, being fired following a disappointing 4\u201312 season in 2013. Mark Dominik was also fired at that time, lasting five seasons. During his tenure the team compiled a record of 28\u201352, which included only one winning season.\n\nGlazer devoted a significant amount of time working to make the organization more fan-friendly by greatly increasing fan activities at Buccaneers home games through the expansion of the club's community relations and special events departments. His mandate to enhance the team's visibility in the community was reflected through increased appearances by Buccaneer players,coaches, cheerleaders and front office officials in recent years. Since 1999, the team has also coordinated with the Glazer Family Foundation to host \"Gameday for Kids\", a program that has hosted over 13,000 underprivileged youth at Buccaneers home games, giving them an opportunity to spend pregame moments on the playing field and to cheer on the Buccaneers from exclusive seats in [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\n===Manchester United===\n{{main|Glazer ownership of Manchester United}}\n[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] is one of the most popular and profitable football clubs in the world.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45edmjk/2-manchester-united-2/ | title = The World's 50 Most Valuable Sports Teams 2013 | work=Forbes | first=Kurt | last=Badenhausen}}</ref> Glazer acquired ownership of United in a \u00a3790m takeover by gradually buying out United shareholders between 2003 and 2005.<ref name=BBC1>{{cite web|title=Malcolm Glazer dies: Man Utd's former owner dies aged 85|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27614216|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref> Glazer's takeover was protested by a large portion of United's fans due to financial concerns.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|title=Malcolm Glazer, Owner of Buccaneers and Manchester United, Is Dead at 85|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/sports/malcolm-glazer-owner-of-buccaneers-and-manchester-united-is-dead-at-85.html|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref><ref name=BBC2>{{cite web|title=Malcolm Glazer dies: Manchester United legacy examined|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27614221|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref> However, Glazer's stroke in April 2006 resulted in his sons Joel and Avram, taking over the day-to-day running of the club, and Glazer's family continued to control the club through his death in 2014.<ref name=BBC1/> After Glazer's death, his family owned a 90% stake in the club that is equally split among Glazer's six children.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manchester United, Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Malcolm Glazer dies at 85|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/29/us-glazer-obituary-idUSKBN0E82CA20140529|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nPeter King wrote of Glazer's \"quiet legacy,\" saying \"Glazer was a stealth owner if there ever was one. The longtime owner of the Bucs, he bought them from Hugh Culverhouse in 1995, very seldom spoke publicly. Tampa Bay won one Super Bowl under Glazer's ownership, the Jon Gruden-led title 12 years ago, after Glazer made the difficult decision to fire [[Tony Dungy]] and go with new blood. But it's Dungy who is part of Glazer's real legacy, both to the Bucs and to the game. The Glazers, in their two decades as owners, have hired three African-American coaches\u2014Dungy, Raheem Morris and Lovie Smith. No other owner in NFL history has hired as many African-American coaches. That should be the significance of Glazer's run in the NFL\u2014he was colorblind at a time when many teams, and owners, in the league were not.\n\"Yes, it is notable,'' Dungy said over the weekend. \"He hired me when there was still trepidation by some people. And he may not have made the final decision on Lovie, but he set the tone in the organization and he put the mindset in his sons to look at people impartially. He and I had many conversations about relationships and how you treat others. That was very important to him.\"\nNo one around the NFL will remember many impassioned speeches by Glazer. But his actions spoke louder. The league should hold him up as an example of hiring the best guy.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Peter|title=NFL Locker-room culture change targeted in upcoming initiative|url=http://mmqb.si.com/2014/06/02/nfl-locker-room-culture-peter-king-25-years-si|website=MMQB}}</ref>\n\n\"Malcolm Glazer was the guiding force behind the building of a Super Bowl champion organization,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \"His dedication to the community was evident in all he did, including his leadership in bringing Super Bowls to Tampa Bay.

He launched the Glazer Family Foundation in 1999, which is dedicated to assisting charitable and educational causes in the [[Tampa Bay]] community. During its existence, the foundation has donated millions in programs, tickets, grants and in-kind contributions. The foundation donated $5&nbsp;million toward the construction of the [[Glazer Children's Museum]] in [[downtown Tampa]], which opened on September 25, 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.visittampabay.com/blog/bay-blogger/glazer-childrens-museum-opening-and-membership-special|title=Glazer Children's Museum Opening and Membership Special!|publisher=Visit Tampa Bay|date=July 7, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213014157/http://www.visittampabay.com/blog/bay-blogger/glazer-childrens-museum-opening-and-membership-special|archivedate=December 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nGlazer also oversaw the operations of the far-reaching Glazer Family Foundation's Vision Program, created in 2006 to provide school children with an opportunity to have vision problems identified in schools at an early age.
