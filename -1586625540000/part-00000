Based on reports provided by the [[Euro-Med HRM|Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor]], more than a million residents in Mosul are at risk and many of them were killed or used as human shields against the advance of Iraqi army. Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor warns that Iraqi government and international forces have to put an end to the humanitarian crisis in Mosul and provide its residents with their basic needs. ISIL has driven some of Mosul's residents out of their neighborhoods while others were prevented from fleeing to the regions controlled by Iraqi army. Human rights are violated by both ISIL, which drove about 550 families from the villages of As-Semalyya and An-Nejafyya, and Iraqi troops which captured 1,500 civilians from mosques and schools in the Dybka refugee camp. On 21 October 2016, another human rights violation committed by Iraqi army and police as they arrested almost hundreds of civilians and executing some villagers in the south of Mosul claiming that they are hosting ISIL militias. On the same day, Iraqi airstrikes targeted a funeral in Kirkuk province causing death of 20 people and injuring dozens others. Mosul's population reached to 1.5 million people, including 600,000 children who are besieged by ISIL militias and suffering from the shortage of food, water, electricity and medical care. ISIL militias monopolize the local hospitals in Mosul and Al-Hemdanyya District to treat only its supporters and members. About 690 families have been evacuated from the Makhmoor District east of Mosul and Al-Hemdanyya District to the Al- Hood camp.<ref>{{cite news |title=ISIS is creating humanitarian crisis in Mosul, but government/international forces are contributing to mayhem |url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1516/ISIS-is-creating-humanitarian-crisis-in-Mosul--but-government/international-forces-are-contributing-to-mayhem/ |accessdate=17 November 2016 |date=23 October 2016 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117213535/http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1516/ISIS-is-creating-humanitarian-crisis-in-Mosul--but-government/international-forces-are-contributing-to-mayhem/ |archivedate=17 November 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 October, a member of the [[Nineveh Governorate|Nineveh Provincial Council]] stated that ISIL executed 300 civilians and former security members in the village of Moshairefa, north of Mosul.

Based on reports provided by the [[Euro-Med HRM|Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor]], more than a million residents in Mosul are at risk and many of them were killed or used as human shields against the advance of Iraqi army. Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor warns that Iraqi government and international forces have to put an end to the humanitarian crisis in Mosul and provide its residents with their basic needs. ISIL has driven some of Mosul's residents out of their neighborhoods while others were prevented from fleeing to the regions controlled by Iraqi army. Human rights are violated by both ISIL, which drove about 550 families from the villages of As-Semalyya and An-Nejafyya, and Iraqi troops which captured 1,500 civilians from mosques and schools in the Dybka refugee camp. On 21 October 2016, another human rights violation committed by Iraqi army and police as they arrested almost hundreds of civilians and executing some villagers in the south of Mosul claiming that they are hosting ISIL militias. On the same day, Iraqi airstrikes targeted a funeral in Kirkuk province causing death of 20 people and injuring dozens others. Mosul's population reached to 1.5 million people, including 600,000 children who are besieged by ISIL militias and suffering from the shortage of food, water, electricity and medical care. ISIL militias monopolize the local hospitals in Mosul and Al-Hemdanyya District to treat only its supporters and members. About 690 families have been evacuated from the Makhmoor District east of Mosul and Al-Hemdanyya District to the Al- Hood camp.<ref>{{cite news |title=ISIS is creating humanitarian crisis in Mosul, but government/international forces are contributing to mayhem |url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1516/ISIS-is-creating-humanitarian-crisis-in-Mosul--but-government/international-forces-are-contributing-to-mayhem/ |accessdate=17 November 2016 |date=23 October 2016 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117213535/http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1516/ISIS-is-creating-humanitarian-crisis-in-Mosul--but-government/international-forces-are-contributing-to-mayhem/ |archivedate=17 November 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 October, a member of the [[Nineveh Governorate|Nineveh Provincial Council]] stated that ISIL executed 300 civilians and former security members in the village of Moshairefa, north of Mosul.

Its span is {{convert|2.75|mi|km|abbr=off}}. It is the second bridge to occupy the site.\n\nPlans for a bridge over the Tay to replace the [[train ferry]] service emerged in 1854, but the first Tay Bridge did not open until 1878. It was a lightweight lattice design of relatively low cost with a [[Single-track railway|single track]]. On 28 December 1879, the [[Tay Bridge disaster|bridge suddenly collapse]]d in high winds. The incident is one of the greatest bridge-related engineering disasters to have occurred. An enquiry determined that the bridge was insufficiently engineered to cope with high winds.\n\nIt was replaced by a second bridge constructed of iron and steel with a [[Double-track railway|double-track]] parallel to the remains of the first bridge. Work commenced on 6 July 1883 and the bridge was opened in 1887. The new bridge was subject to extensive testing by the [[Board of Trade]], whose report was favourable. In 2003, the bridge was strengthened and refurbished, winning a [[British Construction Industry Awards|British Construction Industry Engineering Award]] to mark the scale and difficulty of the project.\n\n== First bridge ==\n===Origins and concept===\nProposals to build a bridge across the Tay date to 1854 but it was not until 15 July 1870 that the North British Railway Tay Bridge Act received [[royal assent]]. On 22 July 1871, the foundation stone of the bridge was laid.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe bridge was designed by [[engineer]] [[Thomas Bouch]], who received a [[knighthood]] following the bridge's completion.<ref name=\"structurae\">{{Structurae |id=20000445 |title=Firth of Tay Bridge (1877)}}</ref> The bridge was a lattice-grid design, combining [[Cast iron|cast]] and [[wrought iron]]. The design had been used by [[Thomas W. Kennard]] in the [[Crumlin Viaduct]] in South Wales in 1858, after the use of cast iron in [[The Crystal Palace]]. The Crystal Palace was not as heavily loaded as a railway bridge. An earlier cast-iron design, the [[Dee bridge disaster|Dee bridge]] collapsed in 1847, having failed because of poor use of cast-iron girders. [[Gustave Eiffel]] used a similar design to create several large viaducts in the [[Massif Central]] in 1867.\n\n[[File:Dusk on a sunny summers day across Dundee, Scotland, July 17, 2007.jpg|thumb|At dusk. One of the stumps of the original bridge is silhouetted against the sunlit Firth.]]\nThe original design was for lattice girders supported by brick piers resting on the bedrock, shown by trial borings to lie at no great depth under the river. At either end of the bridge, the single track ran on top of the bridge girder, most of which lay below the pier tops. At the centre section of the bridge (the high girders), the railway ran inside the bridge girder, which was above the pier tops to give clearance for the passage of sailing ships. To accommodate [[thermal expansion]], there were non-rigid connections between girders and piers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAs the bridge extended out into the river, by December 1873, it became clear that the bedrock lay much deeper; too deep to act as a foundation for the bridge piers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Minutes of Evidence p. 402. \u2013 evidence of Sir T Bouch.</ref> Bouch redesigned the bridge to reduce the number of piers and increase the span of the girders. The pier foundations were no longer resting on bedrock; instead they were constructed by sinking brick-lined wrought-iron caissons onto the riverbed, removing sand until they rested on the consolidated gravel layer which had been misreported as rock, and then filling the caissons with concrete.<ref name=\"Grothe\" />\n\nTo reduce the weight that the ground underneath the caissons would have to support, the brick piers were replaced by open lattice iron skeleton piers. Each pier had multiple cast-iron columns taking the weight of the bridging girders, with wrought iron horizontal braces and diagonal tiebars linking the columns to give rigidity and stability. The basic concept was well known, having been used by Kennard in the [[Crumlin Viaduct]] in South Wales in 1858.<ref name=\"Maynard\">Maynard, H. M. \"Handbook to the Crumlin Viaduct.\" J M Wilson: London, 1862. retrievable via Google Books [https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_to_the_Crumlin_viaduct.html?id=XoEHAAAAQAAJ&redir_esc=y] Maynard claims the loading on the Crumlin viaduct foundations to be 1/5th what they would have been had brick piers been used.</ref> Bouch had used the technique for viaducts, including the [[Belah Viaduct]] (1860)) on the [[South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway]] line over [[Stainmore]], but for the Tay Bridge, even with the largest practicable caissons, the pier dimensions were constrained by their size. Bouch\u2019s pier design set six columns in a hexagon maximising the pier width but not the number of diagonal braces directly resisting sideways forces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Structure  !!

The machined base of each column section docked securely into a machined enlarged section of the top of the section below.<ref>\"like the spigot and faucet of a domestic water pipe\" was felt be a useful analogy at the Tay Bridge Court of Inquiry but would probably baffle modern householders</ref> The joint was then secured by bolts through matching holes on lugs (Crumlin<ref name=\"Maynard\" />) or flanges (Belah) on the two sections. This 'spigot and faucet' configuration was used, apparently without machining, on some Tay Bridge pier columns, but on some the bolts were relied upon to ensure correct alignment. In the event, the joints were made using undersized bolts, of a smaller diameter than that which would just go through the hole. This made assembling the column easier, as the bolt holes would not need to align exactly before inserting the bolt. However,this allowed the two members, so joined, to move relative to each other under load, weakening the column.\n\nOn the Tay Bridge the diagonal bracing was by means of flat bars running from the top of one column-section diagonally down to the bottom of the adjacent column section. The top connection was to a lug that was an integral part of the column casting.<ref>\u201c..although cast-iron lugs are peculiarly liable to fail from shock, they have been used in precisely this way successfully in tens of thousands of yards of viaduct; therefore, Sir Thomas Bouch was only following precedent in using them here.  Mr Barlow will know that on the Bombay and Baroda line they were used for a great many viaducts\u201d Minutes of Evidence \u2013 evidence of B Baker p 507</ref> The bottom connection was to two sling plates bolted to the base of the equivalent section on an adjacent column. The bar and sling plates all had matching longitudinal slots in them. The tie bar was placed between the sling plates with all three slots aligned and overlapping. A [[Gib and cotter|gib]] was driven through all three slots and secured. Two cotters, metal wedges, were then positioned to fill the rest of the slot overlap, and driven in hard to put the tie under tension. Horizontal bracing was provided by wrought iron channel iron.<ref>Minutes of Evidence \u2013 evidence of H Law p246</ref> The various bolt heads were too close to each other, and to the column for easy tightening up with spanners; this coupled with lack of precision in the preparation of the channel iron braces led to various on site fitting expedients (one of them described by a witness to the enquiry as \"about as slovenly a piece of work as ever I saw in my life\".<ref>Minutes of Evidence \u2013 evidence of H Law page 331</ref>\n\nOn the Crumlin and [[Belah Viaduct]]s, however, horizontal bracing was provided by substantial fitted cast-iron girders securely attached to the columns, with the diagonal braces then being attached to the girders.<ref>Details of the bracing of the Crumlin viaduct are given in Maynard, see also a photograph of painters at work on a pier in 1914 to be found at [http://www.crumlinviaduct.co.uk/photo.htm Crumlin Viaduct] which will probably be found of considerable assistance</ref> The Chairman of the Court of Inquiry quoted at length from a contemporary book<ref name=\"Humber 1870\">{{cite book|last=Humber|first=William|title=Complete Treatise on Cast and Wrought Iron Bridge Construction &c Volume 1|year=1870|publisher=Longwood|location=London|pages=264|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SJRAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> praising the detailed engineering of the Belah viaduct piers, and describing the viaduct as one of the lightest and cheapest of the kind that had ever been erected.\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;It is a distinguishing feature in this viaduct that the cross, or distance girders<ref>made of cast iron Minutes of Evidence \u2013 evidence of Sir T Bouch p 430</ref> of the piers encircle the columns, which are turned up at that point, the girders being bored out to fit the turned part with great accuracy. No cement of any kind was used in the whole structure, and the piers when completed, and the vertical and horizontal wrough-iron bracings keyed up, are nearly as rigid as though they were one solid piece...</blockquote>  <blockquote>.... The fitting was all done by machines, which were specially designed for the purpose, and finished the work with mathematical accuracy The flanges of the column were all faced up and their edges turned, and every column was stepped into the one below it with a lip of about 5/8 of an inch<ref>ie c 16 mm</ref> in depth, the lip and socket for it being actually turned and bored. That portion of the column against which the cross girders rested was also turned. The whole of these operations were performed at one time, the column being centred in a hollow mandril-lathe. After being turned the columns passed on to a drilling machine, in which all the holes in each flange were drilled out of the solid simultaneously. And as this was done with them all in the same machine, the holes of course, perfectly coincided when the columns were placed one on the other in the progress of erection. Similar care was taken with the cross-girders, which were bored out at the ends by machines designed for that purpose. Thus, when the pieces of the viaduct had to be put together at the place of erection there was literally not a tool required, and neither chipping or filing to retard the progress of the work.<ref>Rothery in Court of Inquiry report pp 43\u201344 quoting Humber op cit p 224-5</ref></blockquote>\nEither, said the Chairman, the Belah viaduct had been over-engineered, or the Tay Bridge had been under engineered.<ref>Rothery in Court of Inquiry report pp 43\u201344</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nWhilst Bouch was in the process of revising his design, the company which had been awarded the contract for the bridge's construction, Messrs De Bergue of [[Cardiff]], went out of business.<ref>Reportedly, the company's owner, Mr De Bergue, had gone [[insanity|insane]] and then died \u2013 Minutes of Court of Inquiry.</ref> During June 1874, a replacement contract for the work was issued to [[Gilkes Wilson and Company|Hopkin Gilkes and Company]], successors to the [[Middlesbrough]] company which had previously provided the ironwork for the Belah viaduct.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Minutes of Evidence p. 406. \u2013 evidence of Sir T Bouch.</ref><ref>Bouch\u2019s brother William was Locomotive Superintendent of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] and also a director of Gilkes which made locomotives for the S&D. On his brother\u2019s death in January 1876, Bouch as his sole executor effectively inherited his shares, and also his personal guarante of the firm\u2019s borrowings. The firm was not in good enough shape for Bouch to dispose of his interest, and he lost a large amount of money when it went bankrupt during 1880. In principle, there was therefore a conflict of interest with Bouch\u2019s duty to advise the railway company on the acceptability of the contractor\u2019s work. (Minutes of Evidence p. 440. \u2013 evidence of Sir T Bouch.)</ref> Gilkes had originally intended to produce all the bridge ironwork on Teesside, but in the event continued to use a foundry at Wormit to produce the cast-iron components, and to carry out limited post-casting machining operations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe change in design increased cost and necessitated delay, intensified after two of the high girders fell when being lifted into place during the night of Friday, 3 February 1877.<ref name=\"Grothe\">{{cite web |url=http://www.todayinsci.com/Events/Bridges/BridgeTay-GoodWords(1878).htm |title=The Tay Bridge |work=todayinsci.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Dundee Courier and Argus |date=5 February 1877 |title=The Tay Bridge Accident }} gives detailed accounts by those actually involved:</ref> \n<blockquote>The fallen girders had to be removed and new ones built.<ref>One of the fallen girders was recovered and reused.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}</ref> and the piers to be erected again ; and this threatened seriously to interfere with the expectation of having the bridge finished for the passage of a train by September. Only eight months were now available for the erection and floating out of six, and the lifting of ten 245\u2019 spans. Five and seven respectively of the 145\u2019 spans had yet to go through the same process. Seven large and three small piers had yet to be built. The weight of iron which had to be put in its place was 2,700 tons, and it seemed incredible that all this could he done in eight months. A good deal would depend on the weather but this was far from favourable.<ref>\"The Tay Bridge by A.

A train with six carriages carrying seventy-five passengers and crew, crossing at the time of the collapse, plunged into the icy waters of the Tay. All seventy-five people on board were killed. The disaster stunned the whole country and sent shock waves through the Victorian engineering community. The ensuing enquiry revealed that the design of the bridge had not accommodated for high winds. At the time of the collapse, a gale estimated at force ten or eleven (Tropical Storm force winds: 55\u201372&nbsp;mph/80\u2013117&nbsp;km/h) had been blowing down the Tay estuary at right angles to the bridge. The engine itself ([[NBR 224 Class|North British Railway no. 224]]) was salvaged from the river and subsequently restored for service on the railway.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe collapse of the bridge, despite having only opened nineteen months earlier and having been passed as safe by the [[Board of Trade]], had a long-term impact on wider society. According to some commenters, it is still regarded as having been the most notorious [[bridge disaster]] to have ever occurred in the British Isles. The disaster was commemorated in \"[[The Tay Bridge Disaster]]\", one of the best-known verse efforts of [[William McGonagall]].

The bill was reviewed by a special committee, chaired by [[Massey Lopes|Sir Lopes Massey Lopes, 3rd Baronet]]; Lopes drew attention to the substantial pressure for safety factors to be considered in light of the loss of the earlier bridge, including the need to examine the suitability of the location.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> In response to this inquiry, Mr Walker, the general manager of the North British Railway, stated his opinion that there was no more suitable site than what had been chosen, emphasising the relatively large interchange of traffic in the area and the importance of making the line as direct as practically possible. Additionally, a number of local witnesses, who included several leading merchants from Dundee, spoke favourably of the proposed location.<ref name = \"fife pictor\">[http://www.newportarchive.co.uk/Texts/millar_bridges.php \"Fife Pictorial & Historical: Vol. II, A H Millar, 1895: pp. 287\u2013295.\"] ''newportarchive.co.uk'', Retrieved: 9 May 2018.</ref>\n\nPlans for the reconstructed bridge was submitted by civil engineer [[James Brunlees|Sir James Brunlees]].<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> His proposed design would have involved doubling the piers of the first bridge by installing the new columns on the east side of each of the existing piers, while arched brickwork would have been used to join the old and new elements alike. On top of these foundations, a brick decking that would be sufficiently wide as to carry two sets of girders as well as a double-track layout would be laid.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Brunlees proposed that the permanent way should be laid on the upper booms of the girders. The addition of bowstring girders, positioned {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=}} high over the fairway, was considered to have much less exposure to the wind and greater lateral stiffness than the girders of the first bridge.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The girders would also have been doubled, to be capable of resisting {{Convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=}} to the square foot of wind pressure, while the piers as designed were to be capable of resisting a pressure of 900 lb per square foot. Overall, Brunlees' proposed structure would have possessed greater strength for resisting lateral pressure over the original.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> This proposal had an estimated total cost of \u00a3356,323. While it was carefully considered, the Board of Trade regarded the practice of connecting the old bridge's to a new design to be dangerous, leading to the rejection of both the proposed design and the overall bill.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\nWhile the bill's rejection was a setback, the North British Railway, placing great importance on the connection between Fife and Forfarshire, was committed to developing a viable design.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> During August 1880, the noted railway engineer [[William Henry Barlow]], of Barlow & Sons, London, was consulted on the matter. Following experiments upon the first bridge's remains, Barlow gave his opinion that the intact portions should be abandoned in favour of a new structure spanning between the two shores.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Adopting this as the basis of their next submission, a new bill was raised and put before a select committee of the [[House of Commons]] on 10 May 1881. With little alteration or suggestions issued, this was soon passed.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> During November 1881, a contract for the new bridge's construction was awarded to [[Sir William Arrol & Co.|Messrs William Arrol & Co]] of Glasgow. For the new bridge's design, Messrs Barlow elected to refrain from using any untested engineering principles, instead choosing to strictly adhere to established methodology.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\n===Design details===\n[[Image:Tay Rail Bridge and Signal Box Wormit 2.JPG|thumb|right|Tay Bridge and Signal Box Wormit]]\n[[File:Crossing the Tay Rail Bridge (northwards looking east).webm|thumb|right|Video showing view from northbound passenger train crossing bridge towards Dundee. Camera pointing primarily eastwards. (Contains some flickering).]]\n\nThe second Tay Bridge is a straightforward pier-and-lattice girder bridge; aside from its considerable length, it lacks any distinguishing characteristics.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> It has an overall length of {{Convert|10780|ft||abbr=}}, which is covered by a total of 85 spans. These spans are ordinary brick arches, backed by cement concrete and set on top of piers which are supported by pairs of columns.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Wanting to avoid a repeat of the fate of the First Tay Bridge, a principal intention of the design is stability, followed in importance by measures to minimise the bridge's weight and the adoption of aesthetically pleasing shaping where possible without compromising on structural strength.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\nThe piers, which are primarily built from brick and concrete, are enclosed by a [[wrought iron]] caisson up to the low-water mark, above which a brick exterior is used, which cannot be infiltrated by water.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The submerged portions are cased with blue vitrified brick. Above the high-water mark, each pair of piers have a connecting masonry section, terminating at the superstructure's base.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Due to the high proportion of masonry on the piers, they were extremely heavy, which meant that Messrs Barlow worked to minimise the structure's weight without the piers being weakening. As such, a graceful iron superstructure was adopted.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\nAbove the brickwork, two firmly braced octagonal columns continued upwards to meet the inner members in the form of an arch.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Other members were used to provide a bed for the girders to provide for substantial pier that took much of its weight away from the basal area. Since the Second Tay Bridge's completion, the lattice girder arrangement has become a commonplace feature, near-universally adopted for bridge construction.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The configuration provides for a high levels of compression strain despite the girders being comparatively light. The decking is composed of steel and is surrounded both sides of the bridge by a closely knit latticework, which functions as a wind screen as well as somewhat protecting the workers.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\n===Construction===\nOn 9 March 1882, the work on the second bridge commenced, located {{convert|18|m}} upstream of, and parallel to, the original bridge.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The first portions of the bridge to be erected were built upon the southern shore; work proceeded for some time before construction activities were initiated on the northern shore.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Despite this, the majority of bridge was erected simultaneously at both ends, continuing until the centre girders were connected and the junction was completed. Only some of the girders of the old bridge were reused for the new structure, and none had been used without having been subjected to considerable testing beforehand.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> It is believed that fourteen men lost their lives during the bridge's construction, most by drowning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nLarge quantities of materials were used in the construction of the bridge. In terms of wrought iron, 16,300 tons were used for the piers and girders, if the 118 girders from the previous bridge were also included, the total weight is believed to amount to roughly 19,000 tons.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> 3,500 tons of steel was also used, while the cast iron elements of the piers weighs 2,500 tons, for a combined 25,000 tons of iron and steel having been used. Around 10 million bricks, possessing a combined weight of 37,500 tons, were used to build both the approaches to the bridge and the cylinders.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The total weight of the concrete used is 70,000 tons. Additionally, the bridge contains around 3,000,000 [[rivet]]s.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/><ref name=\"paint 2012\">Shirres, David.

When the construction work is broken down, the founding of the piers was calculated as having cost \u00a3282,000, the installation of the girders and parapets \u00a3268,000, while \u00a390,000 was involved in producing the approaches and arches.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Some additional costs of roughly \u00a316,000 had been incurred to improve the approach to the bridge from Newport, the branch line was reconstructed for a distance of half a mile eastward. When combined with the \u00a3350,000 cost of the first Tay Bridge, the North British Railway had spent roughly a million pounds to bridge the Tay.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\n===Operational use===\n[[File:Dundee & Broughty Ferry RJD 26.jpg|thumb|right|A 1910 [[Railway Clearing House]] Junction Diagram showing the Tay Bridge and connecting lines, also the ferry connecting Tayport with Broughty Ferry]]\nPrior to entering service, the completed structure was subjected to an extensive examination by inspectors working for the Board of Trade.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Being keen to avoid a repeat of the disaster of the first Tay Bridge, the second bridge was subjected to stringent testing, which in some cases simulated conditions that were far in excess of any ever likely to be encountered during the entirety of its service life. According to the reports submitted, the results from this testing were satisfying, clearing the way for operational use.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> On 11 June 1887, the first passenger-carrying trains passed along the second Tay Bridge. On 20 June 1887, which also happened to be the 50th anniversary of Queen Victoria's accession, the bridge was opened for use by general traffic.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=The opening of the Tay Bridge |work=Dundee Courier |date=20 June 1887}}</ref>\n\nThe second Tay Bridge has remained in use to the present day.

Its span is {{convert|2.75|mi|km|abbr=off}}. It is the second bridge to occupy the site.\n\nPlans for a bridge over the Tay to replace the [[train ferry]] service emerged in 1854, but the first Tay Bridge did not open until 1878. It was a lightweight lattice design of relatively low cost with a [[Single-track railway|single track]]. On 28 December 1879, the [[Tay Bridge disaster|bridge suddenly collapse]]d in high winds. The incident is one of the greatest bridge-related engineering disasters to have occurred. An enquiry determined that the bridge was insufficiently engineered to cope with high winds.\n\nIt was replaced by a second bridge constructed of iron and steel with a [[Double-track railway|double-track]] parallel to the remains of the first bridge. Work commenced on 6 July 1883 and the bridge was opened in 1887. The new bridge was subject to extensive testing by the [[Board of Trade]], whose report was favourable. In 2003, the bridge was strengthened and refurbished, winning a [[British Construction Industry Awards|British Construction Industry Engineering Award]] to mark the scale and difficulty of the project.\n\n== First bridge ==\n===Origins and concept===\nProposals to build a bridge across the Tay date to 1854 but it was not until 15 July 1870 that the North British Railway Tay Bridge Act received [[royal assent]]. On 22 July 1871, the foundation stone of the bridge was laid.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe bridge was designed by [[engineer]] [[Thomas Bouch]], who received a [[knighthood]] following the bridge's completion.<ref name=\"structurae\">{{Structurae |id=20000445 |title=Firth of Tay Bridge (1877)}}</ref> The bridge was a lattice-grid design, combining [[Cast iron|cast]] and [[wrought iron]]. The design had been used by [[Thomas W. Kennard]] in the [[Crumlin Viaduct]] in South Wales in 1858, after the use of cast iron in [[The Crystal Palace]]. The Crystal Palace was not as heavily loaded as a railway bridge. An earlier cast-iron design, the [[Dee bridge disaster|Dee bridge]] collapsed in 1847, having failed because of poor use of cast-iron girders. [[Gustave Eiffel]] used a similar design to create several large viaducts in the [[Massif Central]] in 1867.\n\n[[File:Dusk on a sunny summers day across Dundee, Scotland, July 17, 2007.jpg|thumb|At dusk. One of the stumps of the original bridge is silhouetted against the sunlit Firth.]]\nThe original design was for lattice girders supported by brick piers resting on the bedrock, shown by trial borings to lie at no great depth under the river. At either end of the bridge, the single track ran on top of the bridge girder, most of which lay below the pier tops. At the centre section of the bridge (the high girders), the railway ran inside the bridge girder, which was above the pier tops to give clearance for the passage of sailing ships. To accommodate [[thermal expansion]], there were non-rigid connections between girders and piers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAs the bridge extended out into the river, by December 1873, it became clear that the bedrock lay much deeper; too deep to act as a foundation for the bridge piers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Minutes of Evidence p. 402. \u2013 evidence of Sir T Bouch.</ref> Bouch redesigned the bridge to reduce the number of piers and increase the span of the girders. The pier foundations were no longer resting on bedrock; instead they were constructed by sinking brick-lined wrought-iron caissons onto the riverbed, removing sand until they rested on the consolidated gravel layer which had been misreported as rock, and then filling the caissons with concrete.<ref name=\"Grothe\" />\n\nTo reduce the weight that the ground underneath the caissons would have to support, the brick piers were replaced by open lattice iron skeleton piers. Each pier had multiple cast-iron columns taking the weight of the bridging girders, with wrought iron horizontal braces and diagonal tiebars linking the columns to give rigidity and stability. The basic concept was well known, having been used by Kennard in the [[Crumlin Viaduct]] in South Wales in 1858.<ref name=\"Maynard\">Maynard, H. M. \"Handbook to the Crumlin Viaduct.\" J M Wilson: London, 1862. retrievable via Google Books [https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_to_the_Crumlin_viaduct.html?id=XoEHAAAAQAAJ&redir_esc=y] Maynard claims the loading on the Crumlin viaduct foundations to be 1/5th what they would have been had brick piers been used.</ref> Bouch had used the technique for viaducts, including the [[Belah Viaduct]] (1860)) on the [[South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway]] line over [[Stainmore]], but for the Tay Bridge, even with the largest practicable caissons, the pier dimensions were constrained by their size. Bouch\u2019s pier design set six columns in a hexagon maximising the pier width but not the number of diagonal braces directly resisting sideways forces.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Structure  !!

The machined base of each column section docked securely into a machined enlarged section of the top of the section below.<ref>\"like the spigot and faucet of a domestic water pipe\" was felt be a useful analogy at the Tay Bridge Court of Inquiry but would probably baffle modern householders</ref> The joint was then secured by bolts through matching holes on lugs (Crumlin<ref name=\"Maynard\" />) or flanges (Belah) on the two sections. This 'spigot and faucet' configuration was used, apparently without machining, on some Tay Bridge pier columns, but on some the bolts were relied upon to ensure correct alignment. In the event, the joints were made using undersized bolts, of a smaller diameter than that which would just go through the hole. This made assembling the column easier, as the bolt holes would not need to align exactly before inserting the bolt. However,this allowed the two members, so joined, to move relative to each other under load, weakening the column.\n\nOn the Tay Bridge the diagonal bracing was by means of flat bars running from the top of one column-section diagonally down to the bottom of the adjacent column section. The top connection was to a lug that was an integral part of the column casting.<ref>\u201c..although cast-iron lugs are peculiarly liable to fail from shock, they have been used in precisely this way successfully in tens of thousands of yards of viaduct; therefore, Sir Thomas Bouch was only following precedent in using them here.  Mr Barlow will know that on the Bombay and Baroda line they were used for a great many viaducts\u201d Minutes of Evidence \u2013 evidence of B Baker p 507</ref> The bottom connection was to two sling plates bolted to the base of the equivalent section on an adjacent column. The bar and sling plates all had matching longitudinal slots in them. The tie bar was placed between the sling plates with all three slots aligned and overlapping. A [[Gib and cotter|gib]] was driven through all three slots and secured. Two cotters, metal wedges, were then positioned to fill the rest of the slot overlap, and driven in hard to put the tie under tension. Horizontal bracing was provided by wrought iron channel iron.<ref>Minutes of Evidence \u2013 evidence of H Law p246</ref> The various bolt heads were too close to each other, and to the column for easy tightening up with spanners; this coupled with lack of precision in the preparation of the channel iron braces led to various on site fitting expedients (one of them described by a witness to the enquiry as \"about as slovenly a piece of work as ever I saw in my life\".<ref>Minutes of Evidence \u2013 evidence of H Law page 331</ref>\n\nOn the Crumlin and [[Belah Viaduct]]s, however, horizontal bracing was provided by substantial fitted cast-iron girders securely attached to the columns, with the diagonal braces then being attached to the girders.<ref>Details of the bracing of the Crumlin viaduct are given in Maynard, see also a photograph of painters at work on a pier in 1914 to be found at [http://www.crumlinviaduct.co.uk/photo.htm Crumlin Viaduct] which will probably be found of considerable assistance</ref> The Chairman of the Court of Inquiry quoted at length from a contemporary book<ref name=\"Humber 1870\">{{cite book|last=Humber|first=William|title=Complete Treatise on Cast and Wrought Iron Bridge Construction &c Volume 1|year=1870|publisher=Longwood|location=London|pages=264|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SJRAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> praising the detailed engineering of the Belah viaduct piers, and describing the viaduct as one of the lightest and cheapest of the kind that had ever been erected.\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;It is a distinguishing feature in this viaduct that the cross, or distance girders<ref>made of cast iron Minutes of Evidence \u2013 evidence of Sir T Bouch p 430</ref> of the piers encircle the columns, which are turned up at that point, the girders being bored out to fit the turned part with great accuracy.

The fitting was all done by machines, which were specially designed for the purpose, and finished the work with mathematical accuracy The flanges of the column were all faced up and their edges turned, and every column was stepped into the one below it with a lip of about 5/8 of an inch<ref>ie c 16 mm</ref> in depth, the lip and socket for it being actually turned and bored. That portion of the column against which the cross girders rested was also turned. The whole of these operations were performed at one time, the column being centred in a hollow mandril-lathe. After being turned the columns passed on to a drilling machine, in which all the holes in each flange were drilled out of the solid simultaneously. And as this was done with them all in the same machine, the holes of course, perfectly coincided when the columns were placed one on the other in the progress of erection. Similar care was taken with the cross-girders, which were bored out at the ends by machines designed for that purpose. Thus, when the pieces of the viaduct had to be put together at the place of erection there was literally not a tool required, and neither chipping or filing to retard the progress of the work.<ref>Rothery in Court of Inquiry report pp 43\u201344 quoting Humber op cit p 224-5</ref></blockquote>\nEither, said the Chairman, the Belah viaduct had been over-engineered, or the Tay Bridge had been under engineered.<ref>Rothery in Court of Inquiry report pp 43\u201344</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nWhilst Bouch was in the process of revising his design, the company which had been awarded the contract for the bridge's construction, Messrs De Bergue of [[Cardiff]], went out of business.<ref>Reportedly, the company's owner, Mr De Bergue, had gone [[insanity|insane]] and then died \u2013 Minutes of Court of Inquiry.</ref> During June 1874, a replacement contract for the work was issued to [[Gilkes Wilson and Company|Hopkin Gilkes and Company]], successors to the [[Middlesbrough]] company which had previously provided the ironwork for the Belah viaduct.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Minutes of Evidence p. 406. \u2013 evidence of Sir T Bouch.</ref><ref>Bouch\u2019s brother William was Locomotive Superintendent of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] and also a director of Gilkes which made locomotives for the S&D.

The firm was not in good enough shape for Bouch to dispose of his interest, and he lost a large amount of money when it went bankrupt during 1880. In principle, there was therefore a conflict of interest with Bouch\u2019s duty to advise the railway company on the acceptability of the contractor\u2019s work.

A train with six carriages carrying seventy-five passengers and crew, crossing at the time of the collapse, plunged into the icy waters of the Tay. All seventy-five people on board were killed. The disaster stunned the whole country and sent shock waves through the Victorian engineering community. The ensuing enquiry revealed that the design of the bridge had not accommodated for high winds. At the time of the collapse, a gale estimated at force ten or eleven (Tropical Storm force winds: 55\u201372&nbsp;mph/80\u2013117&nbsp;km/h) had been blowing down the Tay estuary at right angles to the bridge. The engine itself ([[NBR 224 Class|North British Railway no. 224]]) was salvaged from the river and subsequently restored for service on the railway.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe collapse of the bridge, despite having only opened nineteen months earlier and having been passed as safe by the [[Board of Trade]], had a long-term impact on wider society. According to some commenters, it is still regarded as having been the most notorious [[bridge disaster]] to have ever occurred in the British Isles. The disaster was commemorated in \"[[The Tay Bridge Disaster]]\", one of the best-known verse efforts of [[William McGonagall]]. Today, the stumps of the original bridge piers are still visible above the surface of the Tay even at high tide.\n\n{{wide image|Tay Rail Bridge with pier stumps 2017-05-28.jpg|1250px|Northern segment of the second Tay Bridge, showing stumps of the original bridge's piers poking above the Tay|alt=Northern segment of the second Tay Bridge, showing stumps of the original bridge's piers poking above the Tay}}\n\n==Second bridge==\n===Proposals===\nAlmost immediately following the disaster that befell the first Tay Bridge, the North British Railway company set about developing plans for its reconstruction or replacement.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> During 1880, barely six months after the accident, the North British Railway (Tay Bridge) Bill for a construction of a new bridge was submitted to Parliament. The bill was reviewed by a special committee, chaired by [[Massey Lopes|Sir Lopes Massey Lopes, 3rd Baronet]]; Lopes drew attention to the substantial pressure for safety factors to be considered in light of the loss of the earlier bridge, including the need to examine the suitability of the location.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> In response to this inquiry, Mr Walker, the general manager of the North British Railway, stated his opinion that there was no more suitable site than what had been chosen, emphasising the relatively large interchange of traffic in the area and the importance of making the line as direct as practically possible. Additionally, a number of local witnesses, who included several leading merchants from Dundee, spoke favourably of the proposed location.<ref name = \"fife pictor\">[http://www.newportarchive.co.uk/Texts/millar_bridges.php \"Fife Pictorial & Historical: Vol. II, A H Millar, 1895: pp. 287\u2013295.\"] ''newportarchive.co.uk'', Retrieved: 9 May 2018.</ref>\n\nPlans for the reconstructed bridge was submitted by civil engineer [[James Brunlees|Sir James Brunlees]].<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> His proposed design would have involved doubling the piers of the first bridge by installing the new columns on the east side of each of the existing piers, while arched brickwork would have been used to join the old and new elements alike. On top of these foundations, a brick decking that would be sufficiently wide as to carry two sets of girders as well as a double-track layout would be laid.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Brunlees proposed that the permanent way should be laid on the upper booms of the girders. The addition of bowstring girders, positioned {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=}} high over the fairway, was considered to have much less exposure to the wind and greater lateral stiffness than the girders of the first bridge.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The girders would also have been doubled, to be capable of resisting {{Convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=}} to the square foot of wind pressure, while the piers as designed were to be capable of resisting a pressure of 900 lb per square foot. Overall, Brunlees' proposed structure would have possessed greater strength for resisting lateral pressure over the original.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> This proposal had an estimated total cost of \u00a3356,323. While it was carefully considered, the Board of Trade regarded the practice of connecting the old bridge's to a new design to be dangerous, leading to the rejection of both the proposed design and the overall bill.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\nWhile the bill's rejection was a setback, the North British Railway, placing great importance on the connection between Fife and Forfarshire, was committed to developing a viable design.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> During August 1880, the noted railway engineer [[William Henry Barlow]], of Barlow & Sons, London, was consulted on the matter. Following experiments upon the first bridge's remains, Barlow gave his opinion that the intact portions should be abandoned in favour of a new structure spanning between the two shores.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Adopting this as the basis of their next submission, a new bill was raised and put before a select committee of the [[House of Commons]] on 10 May 1881. With little alteration or suggestions issued, this was soon passed.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> During November 1881, a contract for the new bridge's construction was awarded to [[Sir William Arrol & Co.|Messrs William Arrol & Co]] of Glasgow. For the new bridge's design, Messrs Barlow elected to refrain from using any untested engineering principles, instead choosing to strictly adhere to established methodology.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\n===Design details===\n[[Image:Tay Rail Bridge and Signal Box Wormit 2.JPG|thumb|right|Tay Bridge and Signal Box Wormit]]\n[[File:Crossing the Tay Rail Bridge (northwards looking east).webm|thumb|right|Video showing view from northbound passenger train crossing bridge towards Dundee. Camera pointing primarily eastwards. (Contains some flickering).]]\n\nThe second Tay Bridge is a straightforward pier-and-lattice girder bridge; aside from its considerable length, it lacks any distinguishing characteristics.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> It has an overall length of {{Convert|10780|ft||abbr=}}, which is covered by a total of 85 spans. These spans are ordinary brick arches, backed by cement concrete and set on top of piers which are supported by pairs of columns.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Wanting to avoid a repeat of the fate of the First Tay Bridge, a principal intention of the design is stability, followed in importance by measures to minimise the bridge's weight and the adoption of aesthetically pleasing shaping where possible without compromising on structural strength.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\nThe piers, which are primarily built from brick and concrete, are enclosed by a [[wrought iron]] caisson up to the low-water mark, above which a brick exterior is used, which cannot be infiltrated by water.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The submerged portions are cased with blue vitrified brick. Above the high-water mark, each pair of piers have a connecting masonry section, terminating at the superstructure's base.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Due to the high proportion of masonry on the piers, they were extremely heavy, which meant that Messrs Barlow worked to minimise the structure's weight without the piers being weakening. As such, a graceful iron superstructure was adopted.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\nAbove the brickwork, two firmly braced octagonal columns continued upwards to meet the inner members in the form of an arch.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Other members were used to provide a bed for the girders to provide for substantial pier that took much of its weight away from the basal area. Since the Second Tay Bridge's completion, the lattice girder arrangement has become a commonplace feature, near-universally adopted for bridge construction.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The configuration provides for a high levels of compression strain despite the girders being comparatively light. The decking is composed of steel and is surrounded both sides of the bridge by a closely knit latticework, which functions as a wind screen as well as somewhat protecting the workers.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\n===Construction===\nOn 9 March 1882, the work on the second bridge commenced, located {{convert|18|m}} upstream of, and parallel to, the original bridge.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The first portions of the bridge to be erected were built upon the southern shore; work proceeded for some time before construction activities were initiated on the northern shore.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Despite this, the majority of bridge was erected simultaneously at both ends, continuing until the centre girders were connected and the junction was completed. Only some of the girders of the old bridge were reused for the new structure, and none had been used without having been subjected to considerable testing beforehand.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> It is believed that fourteen men lost their lives during the bridge's construction, most by drowning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nLarge quantities of materials were used in the construction of the bridge. In terms of wrought iron, 16,300 tons were used for the piers and girders, if the 118 girders from the previous bridge were also included, the total weight is believed to amount to roughly 19,000 tons.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> 3,500 tons of steel was also used, while the cast iron elements of the piers weighs 2,500 tons, for a combined 25,000 tons of iron and steel having been used. Around 10 million bricks, possessing a combined weight of 37,500 tons, were used to build both the approaches to the bridge and the cylinders.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> The total weight of the concrete used is 70,000 tons. Additionally, the bridge contains around 3,000,000 [[rivet]]s.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/><ref name=\"paint 2012\">Shirres, David. [https://www.railengineer.uk/2012/11/05/painting-the-tay-bridge/ \"Painting the Tay Bridge.\"] ''Rail Engineer'', 5 November 2012.</ref>\n\nThe estimated cost for the second bridge was \u00a3640,000; while this figure was overran, it did not prove to have been overly optimistic. When the construction work is broken down, the founding of the piers was calculated as having cost \u00a3282,000, the installation of the girders and parapets \u00a3268,000, while \u00a390,000 was involved in producing the approaches and arches.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Some additional costs of roughly \u00a316,000 had been incurred to improve the approach to the bridge from Newport, the branch line was reconstructed for a distance of half a mile eastward. When combined with the \u00a3350,000 cost of the first Tay Bridge, the North British Railway had spent roughly a million pounds to bridge the Tay.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/>\n\n===Operational use===\n[[File:Dundee & Broughty Ferry RJD 26.jpg|thumb|right|A 1910 [[Railway Clearing House]] Junction Diagram showing the Tay Bridge and connecting lines, also the ferry connecting Tayport with Broughty Ferry]]\nPrior to entering service, the completed structure was subjected to an extensive examination by inspectors working for the Board of Trade.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> Being keen to avoid a repeat of the disaster of the first Tay Bridge, the second bridge was subjected to stringent testing, which in some cases simulated conditions that were far in excess of any ever likely to be encountered during the entirety of its service life. According to the reports submitted, the results from this testing were satisfying, clearing the way for operational use.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/> On 11 June 1887, the first passenger-carrying trains passed along the second Tay Bridge. On 20 June 1887, which also happened to be the 50th anniversary of Queen Victoria's accession, the bridge was opened for use by general traffic.<ref name = \"fife pictor\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=The opening of the Tay Bridge |work=Dundee Courier |date=20 June 1887}}</ref>\n\nThe second Tay Bridge has remained in use to the present day. To protect the structure from sustaining damage, the [[double-heading]] of locomotives is prohibited on all trains that traverse the bridge; it has been stipulated that consecutive locomotives must be separated by at least {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2}} using [[barrier vehicle|barrier]] or reach wagons.<ref name=\"drivers-manual\">{{cite book |title=Company Train Drivers Guide |author=Operations Training |publisher=English Welsh and Scottish Railway |issue=1 |date=April 2005 |page=29 |quote=Over the Tay Bridge double heading is prohibited \u2026 if assistance is provided from the front \u2026 at least 60 feet must be provided between}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2003, a \u00a320.85&nbsp;million strengthening and refurbishment project on the bridge won the [[British Construction Industry Awards|British Construction Industry Civil Engineering Award]], in consideration of the staggering scale and logistics involved. More than {{convert|1000|MT|ST}} of bird droppings were scraped off the ironwork lattice of the bridge using hand tools, and bagged into {{convert|25|kg|adj=on}} sacks. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of [[rivet]]s were removed and replaced, all of which was being done by workers who were in exposed conditions while high over a [[firth]] with fast-running tides.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[David Kirkaldy]]\n*[[Harry Watts]]\n*[[History of Dundee]]\n*[[List of bridge disasters]]\n*[[List of structural failures and collapses]]\n*[[Structural engineering]]\n*[[Structural failure]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Norrie, Charles Matthew ''Bridging the Years: A Short History of British Civil Engineering'', Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd., 1956.\n* Lewis, Peter R.
