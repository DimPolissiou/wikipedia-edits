The attractions in the funhouse include a group of waxworks including a beautiful one of the princess of [[Trabzon|Tr\u00e9bizonde]]. Among the members of the travelling entertainers are also Cabriolo's sister Paola, who is an acrobat, his daughters Zanetta and Regina,and Tr\u00e9molini, Regina's former sweetheart. While dusting the waxwork of the princess of Tr\u00e9bizonde, Zanetta accidentally breaks its nose off and therefore she has no choice but to impersonate the statue herself. A nobleman, Prince Rapha\u00ebl, comes to visit the funfair and instead of paying for admission in money he is allowed to give a lottery ticket to the troupe in order to gain entrance. Prince Rapha\u00ebl falls madly in love with, as he thinks, the waxwork of the princess. The troupe of entertainers are amazed and overjoyed to receive the news that the lottery ticket has won and the prize is - a castle!\n\n=== Act 2 ===\n\n''The castle''\n\nSix months have passed, and Cabriolo and his band of entertainers are not finding life in a castle nearly as glamourous as they had imagined it would be. In fact they are all terribly bored and miss their previous lives as travelling players. Out on a hunting trip, Prince Rapha\u00ebl, his father Prince Casimir and his tutor Sparadrap present themselves at the castle. Raphael persuades his father to purchase all the waxwork figures of the old funhouse and to make Cabriolo curator of a museum containing them.\n\n=== Act 3 ===\n[[File:Princesse-de-Tr\u00e9bizonde-la--224x300.jpg|thumb|<center>Poster for ''La princesse de Tr\u00e9bizonde'', 1869</center>]]\n''Prince Casimir's palace''\n\nCabriolo has been elevated to the title of \"Baron of La Cascatella\" and he and his family are living in Prince Casimir's palace. Tr\u00e9molini and Regina have re-kindled their romance, and Prince Raphael's tutor Sparadrap and Paola the lady acrobat have also fallen for each other. Prince Rapha\u00ebl has discovered that ''the princess of Tr\u00e9bizonde'' he so loves is not a statue but a real girl, Zanetta. This presents difficulties as he explains to her, because while being in love with a waxwork is harmless enough, his father would never allow him to marry a girl so far below him in rank as Zanetta is. Prince Casimir turns up and is indeed displeased to find his son in love with a carnival performer, but when it is discovered that he himself had once been married to a lady acrobat - Paola's sister - he can offer no objection to his son's choice, and the work concludes with festive preparations for a triple marriage.<ref name=\"Operette\">{{cite web|title=''La princesse de Tr\u00e9bizonde''|url=http://www.operette-theatremusical.fr/2015/09/20/operette-la-princesse-de-trebizonde/|website=Op\u00e9rette \u2013 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Musical|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Clarke\">{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Kevin|title=Offenbach\u2019s \"La Princesse de Tr\u00e9bizonde\" Returns To The Stage|url=http://operetta-research-center.org/offenbachs-la-princesse-de-trebizonde-returns-stage/|website=Operetta Research Center|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception and performance history==\n\nThe work was a success with audiences and critics, and was revived at the Bouffes-Parisiens in 1871, 1875 and 1876.

It became the first national flag of China and is usually referred to as the \"[[Yellow Dragon]] Flag\" ({{zh|s=\u9ec4\u9f99\u65d7|t=\u9ec3\u9f8d\u65d7|p=hu\u00e1ng l\u00f3ng q\u00ed|first=t}}).\n\nRuling China from 1644 until the overthrow of the monarchy during the [[Xinhai Revolution]], the Qing dynasty was the last imperial dynasty in China's history. Between 1862 and 1912, the dynasty represented itself with the dragon flag.\n\n== Design ==\nThroughout the history of China's imperial dynasties, yellow was considered the royal color of successive Chinese emperors. The legendary first emperor of China was known as the [[Yellow Emperor]] ({{zh|s=\u9ec4\u5e1d|t=\u9ec3\u5e1d|p=hu\u00e1ng d\u00ec|first=t}}). Members of the imperial family of China at that time were the only ones allowed to display the color yellow in buildings and on garments. The Emperor of China  usually used a Chinese dragon as a symbol of the imperial power and strength. Generally, a five-clawed dragon was used by emperors only.\n\nIn [[Chinese culture]], a flaming pearl is shown on top of the dragon's head. The pearl is associated with wealth, good luck, and prosperity.\n\nThe design of the flag was largely based on the [[Plain Yellow Banner]], the one of three \"upper\" banner armies among the [[Eight Banners]] under the direct command of the [[Emperor of China|emperor]] himself, and one of the four \"right wing\" banners.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=79}}<ref name=\"book2011\" />\n\n;The [[Eight Banners]]\nThe [[Eight Banners]] were administrative/military divisions under the Qing dynasty into which all Manchu households were placed.

Between 1862 and 1912, the dynasty represented itself with the dragon flag.\n\n== Design ==\nThroughout the history of China's imperial dynasties, yellow was considered the royal color of successive Chinese emperors.

Members of the imperial family of China at that time were the only ones allowed to display the color yellow in buildings and on garments. The Emperor of China  usually used a Chinese dragon as a symbol of the imperial power and strength. Generally, a five-clawed dragon was used by emperors only.\n\nIn [[Chinese culture]], a flaming pearl is shown on top of the dragon's head. The pearl is associated with wealth, good luck, and prosperity.\n\nThe design of the flag was largely based on the [[Plain Yellow Banner]], the one of three \"upper\" banner armies among the [[Eight Banners]] under the direct command of the [[Emperor of China|emperor]] himself, and one of the four \"right wing\" banners.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=79}} .<ref name=\"book2011\" />{{why}}\n\n;The [[Eight Banners]]\nThe [[Eight Banners]] were administrative/military divisions under the Qing dynasty into which all Manchu households were placed.

ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]]. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]], as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.\n\n===Under Roone Arledge===\nOnly after [[Roone Arledge]], the president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast \"model\", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html|title=ESPN Classic \u2013 Arledge brought modern innovations to TV sports|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nABC News' longtime slogan, \"More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source\" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]].

Swift|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 1942}}</ref> The split (which NBC conducted voluntarily in the event that its appeal to have the ruling overturned was denied) was enforced to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the [[United States]] as the industry had only a few companies such as NBC and [[CBS]] that dominated the radio market, and in particular, was intended to prevent the limited competition from dominating news and political broadcasting and projecting narrow [[point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. Television [[History of television#United States and Canada|broadcasting was suspended]], however, during [[World War II]].\n\nRegular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated television station]] (WJZ-TV, now [[WABC-TV]]) and production center in [[New York City]] in August 1948. ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]]. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]], as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.\n\n===Under Roone Arledge===\nOnly after [[Roone Arledge]], the president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast \"model\", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html|title=ESPN Classic \u2013 Arledge brought modern innovations to TV sports|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nABC News' longtime slogan, \"More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source\" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]].

The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol.

In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.\n\n== Technology ==\n=== Protocol ===\n{{Main|Skype protocol}}\n\nSkype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client\u2013server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).\n\nOn 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol\u2014[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.\n\nAs far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Protocol detection and control ===\nMany networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications.

J. Aiton'', ''A. M. Duncan'', \"J. V. Field'', 1997, {{isbn|0-87169-209-0}} (page 123)</ref> There are different truncations of a rhombic triacontahedron into a [[topology|topological]] rhombicosidodecahedron: Prominently its [[rectification (geometry)|rectification]] (left), the one that creates the uniform solid (center), and the rectification of the dual [[icosidodecahedron]] (right), which is the core of the [[dual compound]].\n\nIt can also be called an ''[[Expansion (geometry)|expanded]]'' or ''[[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]]'' dodecahedron or icosahedron, from truncation operations on either [[uniform polyhedron]].\n\n==Geometric relations==\nIf you [[Expansion (geometry)|expand]] an [[icosahedron]] by moving the faces away from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] the right amount, without changing the orientation or size of the faces, and do the same to its [[dual polyhedron|dual]] [[dodecahedron]], and patch the square holes in the result, you get a rhombicosidodecahedron. Therefore, it has the same number of triangles as an icosahedron and the same number of pentagons as a dodecahedron, with a square for each edge of either.\n\nAlternatively, if you [[Expansion (geometry)|expand]] each of five cubes by moving the faces away from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] the right amount and rotating each of the five 72\u00b0 around so they are equidisant from each other, without changing the orientation or size of the faces, and patch the pentagonal and triangular holes in the result, you get a rhombicosidodecahedron. Therefore, it has the same number of triangles as an icosahedron and the same number of pentagons as a dodecahedron, with a square for each edge of either.\n\nThe rhombicosidodecahedron shares the vertex arrangement with the [[small stellated truncated dodecahedron]], and with the uniform compounds of six or twelve [[pentagrammic prism]]s.\n\nThe [[Zometool]] kits for making [[geodesic dome]]s and other polyhedra use slotted balls as connectors. The balls are \"expanded\" rhombicosidodecahedra, with the squares replaced by rectangles. The expansion is chosen so that the resulting rectangles are [[golden rectangle]]s.\n\nTwelve of the 92 [[Johnson solid]]s are derived from the rhombicosidodecahedron, four of them by rotation of one or more [[pentagonal cupola]]e: the [[gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron|gyrate]], [[parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron|parabigyrate]], [[metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron|metabigyrate]], and [[trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron]]. Eight more can be constructed by removing up to three cupolae, sometimes also rotating one or more of the other cupolae.\n\n==Cartesian coordinates==\n[[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a rhombicosidodecahedron with an edge length of 2 centered at the origin are all [[even permutation]]s of:<ref>{{mathworld |title=Icosahedral group |urlname=IcosahedralGroup}}</ref>\n:(\u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b1''\u03c6''<sup>3</sup>),\n:(\u00b1''\u03c6''<sup>2</sup>, \u00b1''\u03c6'', \u00b12''\u03c6''),\n:(\u00b1(2+''\u03c6''), 0, \u00b1''\u03c6''<sup>2</sup>),\nwhere ''\u03c6''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1 + {{sqrt|5}}|2}} is the [[golden ratio]]. Therefore, the circumradius of this rhombicosidodecahedron is the common distance of these points from the origin, namely {{sqrt|''\u03c6''<sup>6</sup>+2}} = {{sqrt|''8\u03c6+7''}} for edge length 2. For unit edge length, R must be halved, giving \n:''R'' = {{sfrac|{{sqrt|8''\u03c6''+7}}|2}} = {{sfrac|{{sqrt|11+4{{sqrt|5}}}}|2}} &asymp; 2.233.\n\n==Orthogonal projections==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right | perrow = 1 | total_width = 200\n | image1 = Houghton Typ 520.43.454, crop solid and owl.jpg\n | image2 = Fotothek df tg 0003625, crop rhombicosidodecahedron.jpg\n | footer = Orthogonal projections in ''Geometria'' (1543) by [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]\n}}\nThe ''rhombicosidodecahedron'' has six special [[orthogonal projection]]s, centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and three types of faces: triangles, squares, and pentagons.

Therefore, it has the same number of triangles as an icosahedron and the same number of pentagons as a dodecahedron, with a square for each edge of either.\n\nAlternatively, if you [[Expansion (geometry)|expand]] each of five cubes by moving the faces away from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] the right amount and rotating each of the five 72\u00b0 around so they are equidisant from each other, without changing the orientation or size of the faces, and patch the pentagonal and triangular holes in the result, you get a rhombicosidodecahedron. Therefore, it has the same number of triangles as an icosahedron and the same number of pentagons as a dodecahedron, with a square for each edge of either.\n\nThe rhombicosidodecahedron shares the vertex arrangement with the [[small stellated truncated dodecahedron]], and with the uniform compounds of six or twelve [[pentagrammic prism]]s.\n\nThe [[Zometool]] kits for making [[geodesic dome]]s and other polyhedra use slotted balls as connectors. The balls are \"expanded\" rhombicosidodecahedra, with the squares replaced by rectangles. The expansion is chosen so that the resulting rectangles are [[golden rectangle]]s.\n\nTwelve of the 92 [[Johnson solid]]s are derived from the rhombicosidodecahedron, four of them by rotation of one or more [[pentagonal cupola]]e: the [[gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron|gyrate]], [[parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron|parabigyrate]], [[metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron|metabigyrate]], and [[trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron]]. Eight more can be constructed by removing up to three cupolae, sometimes also rotating one or more of the other cupolae.\n\n==Cartesian coordinates==\n[[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a rhombicosidodecahedron with an edge length of 2 centered at the origin are all [[even permutation]]s of:<ref>{{mathworld |title=Icosahedral group |urlname=IcosahedralGroup}}</ref>\n:(\u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b1''\u03c6''<sup>3</sup>),\n:(\u00b1''\u03c6''<sup>2</sup>, \u00b1''\u03c6'', \u00b12''\u03c6''),\n:(\u00b1(2+''\u03c6''), 0, \u00b1''\u03c6''<sup>2</sup>),\nwhere ''\u03c6''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1 + {{sqrt|5}}|2}} is the [[golden ratio]]. Therefore, the circumradius of this rhombicosidodecahedron is the common distance of these points from the origin, namely {{sqrt|''\u03c6''<sup>6</sup>+2}} = {{sqrt|''8\u03c6+7''}} for edge length 2. For unit edge length, R must be halved, giving \n:''R'' = {{sfrac|{{sqrt|8''\u03c6''+7}}|2}} = {{sfrac|{{sqrt|11+4{{sqrt|5}}}}|2}} &asymp; 2.233.\n\n==Orthogonal projections==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right | perrow = 1 | total_width = 200\n | image1 = Houghton Typ 520.43.454, crop solid and owl.jpg\n | image2 = Fotothek df tg 0003625, crop rhombicosidodecahedron.jpg\n | footer = Orthogonal projections in ''Geometria'' (1543) by [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]\n}}\nThe ''rhombicosidodecahedron'' has six special [[orthogonal projection]]s, centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and three types of faces: triangles, squares, and pentagons.
