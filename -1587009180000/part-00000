Coincidentally, in the civil aviation sector, [[Baron]] [[Pierre de Caters]] earned the first civil pilot's brevet that same year. Caters would promptly establish an aviation school. At approximately the same time, the War Ministry followed the French military's example and had pilots earn a civil pilot's [[Aircrew brevet|brevet]] before their military one.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|p=9}}\n\nIn 1910, three Belgian lieutenants earned their pilot's brevets at the school, paying their own fees. Two of the artillery lieutenants were Baudouin Montens d'Oosterwyck, who earned Brevet No. 19 on 30 September, and Alfred Sarteel, granted No. 23 on 10 November. The third lieutenant, Georges Nelis, was the new force's first aviation candidate, gaining Brevet No. 28 on 21 December. An aircraft was personally purchased for him.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|p=9}}\n\nIn spring of 1911, the new air force established its military aviation school with five pilots, two mechanics, and a woodworker. It received its first aircraft via Baron Caters, who gave the aircraft to King Albert, who in turn presented it to the school.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|p=9}}\n\nOn 12 September 1912, pilot Lieutenant Nelis and observer ''Sous Lieutenant'' Stellingwerff were the first Europeans to fire a machine gun from an aircraft; while Nelis brought the aircraft low, Stellingwerff put some bullets through a sheet staked out on the ground. They were disciplined for their efforts. Nelis then accompanied ''Capitaine Commandant'' \u00c9mile Mathieu to England during November 1913 to demonstrate aerial use of the [[Lewis machine gun]] at [[Hendon]] and [[Aldershot]]; as a result, the British adopted the Lewis, although the Belgians did not. Belgium entered World War I with aircraft tasked solely for reconnaissance missions.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|p=11}}\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Airship Belgique.jpg|thumb|links|''Belgique'', the first Belgian airship]]\nBy the time of Belgium's entry into the First World War on 4 August 1914, the military aviation branch, now called the ''Aviation Militaire Belge'' (''Belgische militaire luchtvaart''), consisted of four squadrons, each consisting of four 80-horsepower [[Henri Farman]] aircraft, although ''Escadrilles'' III and IV were still forming. A truck was assigned to each squadron, along with a fifth truck serving as a mobile workshop. Each squadron had a commander, five pilots, and six observers, with all officers seconded from parent units. As a result, most of the new aviators were from the Engineers and Artillery components of the Belgian armed forces. As the war began, a fifth squadron was created, staffed with civilian pilots called to the colors and equipped with [[Bl\u00e9riot A\u00e9ronautique|Bleriot]]s.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=10-11}}\n\n''Sous Lieutenant'' [[Henri Crombez]] flew one of the first war patrols, in a [[Deperdussin Monocoque|Deperdussin racer]] on 4 August 1914 above Li\u00e8ge.<ref>{{cite book |title= Luchtoorlog boven Belgi\u00eb 1914 |trans-title=Air War over Belgium in 1914 |last1=Deneckere |first1=Bernard |location=[[Roeselare]] |publisher=Roularta |year=2010 |isbn=9789086793013 |language=Dutch}}</ref> Adjutant Behaeghe was the first to engage an enemy, a few days later. On 26 September, the Belgian air crew of ''Sous Lieutenant'' de Petrowski and Sergeant Benselin mortally wounded a German pilot with a rifle bullet and forced his [[Etrich Taube|Taube]] to land at [[Sint-Agatha-Berchem]]; if they had submitted a claim for this victory, its approval would have marked history's first air-to-air combat victory.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=11-13,21}}\n\nOn 3 January 1915, two machine guns supplied by British were fitted to two Belgian aircraft, making a dual effort against the foe possible; these were Belgium's first dedicated fighter planes. In February, thirteen of the Belgian airmen flew 28 offensive patrols; their first dogfight was fought on the 26th, with ten [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatroses]] against three Belgian Farmans. On 26 March, ''Sous Lieutenant'' Boschmans sent a German two-seater into a steep dive when he seemed to hit the pilot; the German was not seen to either crash or land. This was the Belgian aviators' first victory claim.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|p=12}}\n\nIn April, Lieutenant [[Fernand Jacquet]] mounted a machine gun on his [[pusher configuration|pusher]] aircraft and sought out the enemy. On the 17th, he and his observer (Lieutenant Henri Vindevoghel) scored Belgium's first confirmed aerial victory, sending an Albatros reconnaissance aircraft down in flames over [[Roeselare]]. Apparently at about the same time, Adjutant [[Jos\u00e9 Orta]] and ''Sous Lieutenant'' [[Louis de Burlet]] were the first to attack an enemy [[observation balloon]] when they dropped three small bombs on a gasbag over [[Houthulst]]. Luckily for them, they missed; success would probably have blown them out of the sky.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|p=12}}\n\n[[File:Museum Stampe Sopwith Camel 04.JPG|thumb|left|[[Sopwith Camel]] in the colours of the Belgian 1st Squadron]]\nOn 18 January 1916, the decision was made to form a dedicated fighter squadron. On 22 February 1916, Escadrille I became the ''[[1\u00e8re Escadrille de Chasse]]''. It consisted of newly supplied [[Nieuport 10]]s and one obsolete Farman two-seater. In August, the new squadron would upgrade to [[Nieuport 11]]s, and ''Escadrille V'' was turned into the [[5me Escadrille de Chasse|''5\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'']]. The new unit was the first to mount an offensive formation for the new air force; on 15 February 1917, they flew an offensive patrol of seven. By this time, the AMB had grown to 44 aircraft, including 21 fighters. At this point, individual aircraft bore personal markings affixed by their pilots, but no unit designations.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|p=14}}\n\nIn the summer of 1917, the AMB was allotted an active role in Allied aviation operations at the beginning of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]. In March 1918, the AMB matured into a ''[[Groupe de Chasse]]''. At this time, the role of the ''Escadrilles de Chasse'' was finally focused on their operation strictly as fighter units. There was a sorting out of pilots into fighter or reconnaissance roles. Not all fighter pilots went into the new fighter units; as of 1 May, 22 remained with reconnaissance units to fly escort missions. The King insisted that Jacquet be given the command of the Group. The newly organized fighter wing contained the two fighter escadrilles; however, ''1\u00e8re Escadrille de Chasse'' became [[9 Squadron (Belgian Air Force)|''9\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'']], and ''5\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'' became [[10me Escadrille de Chasse|''10\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'']]. The [[11 Squadron (Belgian Air Force)|''11\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'']] was founded on 28 May to join them. By the start of the Allies final offensive in September 1918, the AMB was incorporated in the Allied aviation effort, and could send 40-plus aircraft into the air at one time. In its short span of service, the Groupe fought over 700 aerial combats and was credited with 71 confirmed and 50 probable victories.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=17-18}}\n\n====Aircraft procurement difficulties====\nIn June 1916 the nascent air force had received newer aircraft from the French in both single and double-seat versions of the [[Nieuport 10]]. The Belgians would continue to upgrade their aircraft throughout the war, though through their dependence on French manufacturers they became the stepchildren of the Allied effort from 1916 onwards.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=12, 17}} The introduction dates of various types, compared to the date of their acquisition by the Belgians, tells the tale. The Franco-American ''[[Lafayette Escadrille]]'' had [[Nieuport 16]]s as early as May 1916;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/france/124.php |title=Escadrille 124 |work=The Aerodrome |year=2015 |accessdate=21 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018055716/http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/france/124.php |archive-date=18 October 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the Belgians got them at the end of the year. The [[Nieuport 17]] came into service with the French as early as June 1916, but the Belgians received so few that in June 1917 they were still operating all their earlier Nieuports. They then contracted for newer [[Nieuport 23]]s, which were basically up-engined Nieuport 17s. [[Spad VII]]s had entered French service on 2 September 1916; the Belgians first received them almost an entire year later, with the first one on board on 22 August 1917. In September 1917, Belgium had the [[Hanriot HD.1]] supplied to it the year after it was introduced. [[Spad XIII]]s also came on line that month, but would not show up in Belgian inventory until the next year. [[Sopwith Camel]]s first went into service in May 1917 and the AMB received its first one on 29 November 1917.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=15-16}}\n\nThe AMB did make one attempt to design and build its own aircraft. However the Ponnier M1 was not good enough for production, and the ten or so manufactured ended up with clipped wings as powered \"Penguin\" rollers for training rookie pilots.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|p=16}}\n\n====Operational summary====\nOne of its [[flying ace]] pilots, [[Willy Coppens]], became the top ranking [[balloon buster]] of World War I, as well as one of the war's top aces. Four other pilots from the tiny force also became aces with it: [[Andre de Meulemeester]],{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=46-47}} [[Edmond Thieffry]],{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=78-79}}  [[Jan Olieslagers]],{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=72-73}} and [[Fernand Jacquet]].{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=62-63}} A sixth Belgian, [[Adolphe DuBois d'Aische]], became the war's oldest ace while in French service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/belgium/duboisdaische.php |title=Adolphe Aloys Marie Hubert duBois d'Aische |work=The Aerodrome |year=2015 |accessdate=21 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126123310/http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/belgium/duboisdaische.php |archive-date=26 January 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe fledgling air force was entrusted with flying both [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876\u20131965)|Queen Elizabeth]] over the battle front at times.{{sfn|Pieters|1998|pp=21-22}}\n\n===Between the world wars===\nDuring the [[interwar period]], the Belgian Air Force flew the [[Breguet 19]]. Some efforts were made to acquire aircraft from local production, such as those by [[Stampe et Vertongen]] and [[Alfred Renard|Renard]]. They also evaluated native designs like the [[ACAZ C.2]] and [[LACAB GR.8]], none of which entered mass production however.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Firefly y17.jpg|thumb|Belgian [[Fairey Firefly II]], 1931]]\nAt the start of World War II, the Army Air Force had three active Air Force Regiments. Aircraft which were used by those regiments were the [[Renard R-31]] and [[Renard R-32|R-32]], the [[Fiat CR.42]], the [[Hawker Hurricane]], the [[Gloster Gladiator]], the [[Fairey Fox]], and the [[Fairey Battle]]. These were massacred by the much superior German Luftwaffe in the German invasion of May 1940. Before the outbreak of the war Belgium also sought to equip the ''Aviation Militaire'' with foreign designs, ordering production licences in [[Poland]] and [[France]] and aircraft in the USA. However, the acquired licences could not be used until May 1940 and the aircraft produced in the USA were eventually delivered to [[France]] and to the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nAfter the surrender of Belgium on 28 May 1940, a very small Belgian Air Force in exile was created in Great Britain as the Belgian section of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]]. This small force was active within the British [[Royal Air Force]], and its squadrons were equipped with the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Typhoon]].\n\n===The Cold War===\n{{see also|Structure of the Belgian Armed Forces in 1989#Air Force|Second Allied Tactical Air Force}}\n\nOn 15 October 1946, the Belgian military aviation was turned into an autonomous force, independent of the Belgian Army. From September 1953 to 1960, the ''Ecole de Pilotage Avanc\u00e9'' (\"Advanced Pilots' School\") operated Harvards from the [[Kamina]] military base in the [[Belgian Congo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ailes-militaires-belges.be/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=197&Itemid=571&lang=en |title=EPA \u00e0 Kamina |first=V. |last=P\u00e9criaux |work=Les Ailes Militaires Belges |year=2015 |accessdate=21 August 2015 |language=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919225213/http://www.ailes-militaires-belges.be/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=197&Itemid=571&lang=en |archive-date=19 September 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Seemingly about 60 Harvards were at the base.\n\n===Post-Cold War reforms \u2013 COMOPSAIR (Commandement Op\u00e9rationnel Air - Operational Command Air)===\n[[File:Agusta A109BA 5 (7567963708).jpg|thumb|left|[[AgustaWestland AW109|Agusta A109]] of the Air Component]]\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the end of the Cold War caused the Belgian government to restructure the Belgian Armed Forces in order to cope with the changed threats. The Belgian Air Force was hit hard and saw its strength more than halved with the disbanding of the 3rd Tactical Wing in Bierset (1994); the disbanding of the 1st Fighter Wing in [[Beauvechain]]; the 9th Training Wing in [[Sint-Truiden Air Base]]; and the Elementary Flying School in [[Goetsenhoven Military Airfield|Goetsenhoven]] (1996).\n\nIn 2002, the Belgian government decided to emulate [[Canada]] and impose a \"single structure\" on its armed forces in which the independent Belgian Air Force ceased to exist. The Belgian Air Component (''COMOPSAIR being the HQ'') consists of the [[2nd Tactical Wing]] in [[Florennes Air Base]] and the [[10th Tactical Wing]] in [[Kleine Brogel Air Base]], both flying F-16s in four squadrons. Out of the 160 F-16s originally bought by Belgium, only 105 were upgraded; with further reductions to 72 aircraft in 2005; and planned to 60 by 2012. The [[1st Wing (Belgium)|1st Wing]] at [[Beauvechain Air Base]] is assigned for the training of pilots, using the piston-powered [[Aermacchi SF.260]] for elementary training, and the [[Alpha Jet]] for advanced training.

The [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] helicopters flown for the Belgian Navy in a utility-role and will be phased out in 2021.\n\nIn 2004, as part of the unified structure, the Army Aviation units of the [[Wing Heli]] were transferred to the COMOPSAIR. These contain the [[Agusta A109]] attack helicopter, and the [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]] training and recce helicopter.\nIn 2005, the Belgian [[Alpha Jet]]s moved to Cazaux in France to continue the [[11 Squadron (Belgian Air Force)|Initial Operational Training]], while the Advanced Jet Training was done on French [[Alpha Jet]]s at Tours. As from 2013 both Advanced Jet Training as well as Initial Operational Training are completed in Cazaux in France.\nWithin the framework of its commitments within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, [[NATO]], Belgium has assigned its 72 F-16s to NATO purposes. Two squadrons with a total of 16 aircraft have been designated for use by the ''Rapid Reaction Forces''.\nIn February 2008, Defense Minister [[Pieter De Crem]] announced that due to increasing problems and poor serviceability, the two A310s were to be replaced as soon as possible by two aircraft in the same class. An [[Airbus A330]] was dry-leased to take their place till March 2014 where it was replaced by an [[Airbus A321]].\nOn September 1, 2010, the [[Wing Heli]] in Bierset was disbanded and the [[Agusta A109]] helicopters moved to [[Beauvechain Air Base]] to become [[1st Wing (Belgium)|1st Wing]]. The [[Aermacchi SF.260|SF260]] squadrons became part of the [[Basic Flying Training School (Belgian Air Component)|Basic Flying Training School]].\nOn May 24, 2011, it was reported that the two retired [[Airbus A310]] aircraft have been sold to the [[Brussels]]-based company MAD Africa for the amount of 700,000 euros.

During this operation, Belgian aircraft carried out several flights along the Iraqi border. After this operation the obsolete Mirage 5s were phased out.\n\nOn 15 July 1996, a C-130 with serial CH-06 carrying 37 members of the Dutch Army Fanfare Band and four Belgian crew members crashed at [[Eindhoven Airport|Eindhoven]] after a bird strike while executing a go-around, resulting in the loss of power to two engines. 34 passengers were killed, and only 7 survived. The accident is known in the Netherlands as the [[Herculesramp]].\n\nFrom October 1996, the Belgian Air Force cooperated with the Dutch Royal Air Force in the \"Deployable Air Task Force\" in patrolling former Yugoslavian airspace. F-16s of the 2nd and 10th Tactical Wings, operating from the Italian bases of [[Villafranca Air Base|Villafranca]] and [[Amendola Air Base|Amendola]], were assigned to missions insuring the control of a No-Fly Zone over Yugoslavia, and providing the air support necessary for UN and NATO troops. Between March 24 and June 10, 1999, twelve Belgian F-16s carried out 679 combat sorties \u2013 the first time since the second World War that Belgian aircraft took part in active war operations in enemy territory \u2013 against [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo]] crisis. The last Belgian F-16 detachment left [[Italy]] in August 2001.\n\n===2000s===\nOn 29 March 2004, four F-16s from [[Kleine Brogel Air Base|Kleine Brogel]] were transferred under [[NATO|NATO's]] [[Baltic Air Policing]] mission to the [[\u0160iauliai International Airport|\u0160iauliai Air Base]] in [[Lithuania]] for three months, where they were employed in monitoring the [[Lithuania]]n, [[Latvia]]n, and [[Estonia]]n skies.\n\nIn 2005, the Helicopter Wing (WHeli \u2013 HeliW) deployed four A-109 (including one Medevac) in [[Tuzla]], Bosnia.

Coincidentally, in the civil aviation sector, [[Baron]] [[Pierre de Caters]] earned the first civil pilot's brevet that same year. Caters would promptly establish an aviation school. At approximately the same time, the War Ministry followed the French military's example and had pilots earn a civil pilot's [[Aircrew brevet|brevet]] before their military one.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pieters (1998), p.9</ref>\n\nIn 1910, three Belgian lieutenants earned their pilot's brevets at the school, paying their own fees. Two of the artillery lieutenants were Baudouin Montens d'Oosterwyck, who earned Brevet No. 19 on 30 September, and Alfred Sarteel, granted No. 23 on 10 November. The third lieutenant, Georges Nelis, was the new force's first aviation candidate, gaining Brevet No. 28 on 21 December. An aircraft was personally purchased for him.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn spring of 1911, the new air force established its military aviation school with five pilots, two mechanics, and a woodworker. It received its first aircraft via Baron Caters, who gave the aircraft to King Albert, who in turn presented it to the school.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOn 12 September 1912, pilot Lieutenant Nelis and observer ''Sous Lieutenant'' Stellingwerff were the first Europeans to fire a machine gun from an aircraft; while Nelis brought the aircraft low, Stellingwerff put some bullets through a sheet staked out on the ground. They were disciplined for their efforts. Nelis then accompanied ''Capitaine Commandant'' \u00c9mile Mathieu to England during November 1913 to demonstrate aerial use of the [[Lewis machine gun]] at [[Hendon]] and [[Aldershot]]; as a result, the British adopted the Lewis, although the Belgians did not. Belgium entered World War I with aircraft tasked solely for reconnaissance missions.<ref>Pieters (1998), p.11</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Airship Belgique.jpg|thumb|links|''Belgique'', the first Belgian airship]]\nBy the time of Belgium's entry into the First World War on 4 August 1914, the military aviation branch, now called the ''Aviation Militaire Belge'' (''Belgische militaire luchtvaart''), consisted of four squadrons, each consisting of four 80-horsepower [[Henri Farman]] aircraft, although ''Escadrilles'' III and IV were still forming. A truck was assigned to each squadron, along with a fifth truck serving as a mobile workshop. Each squadron had a commander, five pilots, and six observers, with all officers seconded from parent units. As a result, most of the new aviators were from the Engineers and Artillery components of the Belgian armed forces. As the war began, a fifth squadron was created, staffed with civilian pilots called to the colors and equipped with [[Bl\u00e9riot A\u00e9ronautique|Bleriot]]s.<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.10\u201311</ref>\n\n''Sous Lieutenant'' [[Henri Crombez]] flew one of the first war patrols, in a [[Deperdussin Monocoque|Deperdussin racer]] on 4 August 1914 above Li\u00e8ge.<ref>{{cite book |title= Luchtoorlog boven Belgi\u00eb 1914 |trans-title=Air War over Belgium in 1914 |last1=Deneckere |first1=Bernard |location=[[Roeselare]] |publisher=Roularta |year=2010 |isbn=9789086793013 |language=Dutch}}</ref> Adjutant Behaeghe was the first to engage an enemy, a few days later. On 26 September, the Belgian air crew of ''Sous Lieutenant'' de Petrowski and Sergeant Benselin mortally wounded a German pilot with a rifle bullet and forced his [[Etrich Taube|Taube]] to land at [[Sint-Agatha-Berchem]]; if they had submitted a claim for this victory, its approval would have marked history's first air-to-air combat victory.<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.11\u201313, 21</ref>\n\nOn 3 January 1915, two machine guns supplied by British were fitted to two Belgian aircraft, making a dual effort against the foe possible; these were Belgium's first dedicated fighter planes. In February, thirteen of the Belgian airmen flew 28 offensive patrols; their first dogfight was fought on the 26th, with ten [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|Albatroses]] against three Belgian Farmans. On 26 March, ''Sous Lieutenant'' Boschmans sent a German two-seater into a steep dive when he seemed to hit the pilot; the German was not seen to either crash or land. This was the Belgian aviators' first victory claim.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Pieters (1998), p.12</ref>\n\nIn April, Lieutenant [[Fernand Jacquet]] mounted a machine gun on his [[pusher configuration|pusher]] aircraft and sought out the enemy. On the 17th, he and his observer (Lieutenant Henri Vindevoghel) scored Belgium's first confirmed aerial victory, sending an Albatros reconnaissance aircraft down in flames over [[Roeselare]]. Apparently at about the same time, Adjutant [[Jos\u00e9 Orta]] and ''Sous Lieutenant'' [[Louis de Burlet]] were the first to attack an enemy [[observation balloon]] when they dropped three small bombs on a gasbag over [[Houthulst]]. Luckily for them, they missed; success would probably have blown them out of the sky.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Museum Stampe Sopwith Camel 04.JPG|thumb|left|[[Sopwith Camel]] in the colours of the Belgian 1st Squadron]]\nOn 18 January 1916, the decision was made to form a dedicated fighter squadron. On 22 February 1916, Escadrille I became the ''[[1\u00e8re Escadrille de Chasse]]''. It consisted of newly supplied [[Nieuport 10]]s and one obsolete Farman two-seater. In August, the new squadron would upgrade to [[Nieuport 11]]s, and ''Escadrille V'' was turned into the [[5me Escadrille de Chasse|''5\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'']]. The new unit was the first to mount an offensive formation for the new air force; on 15 February 1917, they flew an offensive patrol of seven. By this time, the AMB had grown to 44 aircraft, including 21 fighters. At this point, individual aircraft bore personal markings affixed by their pilots, but no unit designations.<ref>Pieters (1998), p.14</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1917, the AMB was allotted an active role in Allied aviation operations at the beginning of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]. In March 1918, the AMB matured into a ''[[Groupe de Chasse]]''. At this time, the role of the ''Escadrilles de Chasse'' was finally focused on their operation strictly as fighter units. There was a sorting out of pilots into fighter or reconnaissance roles. Not all fighter pilots went into the new fighter units; as of 1 May, 22 remained with reconnaissance units to fly escort missions. The King insisted that Jacquet be given the command of the Group. The newly organized fighter wing contained the two fighter escadrilles; however, ''1\u00e8re Escadrille de Chasse'' became [[9 Squadron (Belgian Air Force)|''9\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'']], and ''5\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'' became [[10me Escadrille de Chasse|''10\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'']]. The [[11 Squadron (Belgian Air Force)|''11\u00e8me Escadrille de Chasse'']] was founded on 28 May to join them. By the start of the Allies final offensive in September 1918, the AMB was incorporated in the Allied aviation effort, and could send 40-plus aircraft into the air at one time. In its short span of service, the Groupe fought over 700 aerial combats and was credited with 71 confirmed and 50 probable victories.<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.17\u201318</ref>\n\n====Aircraft procurement difficulties====\nIn June 1916 the nascent air force had received newer aircraft from the French in both single and double-seat versions of the [[Nieuport 10]]. The Belgians would continue to upgrade their aircraft throughout the war, though through their dependence on French manufacturers they became the stepchildren of the Allied effort from 1916 onwards.<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.12, 17</ref> The introduction dates of various types, compared to the date of their acquisition by the Belgians, tells the tale. The Franco-American ''[[Lafayette Escadrille]]'' had [[Nieuport 16]]s as early as May 1916;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/france/124.php |title=Escadrille 124 |work=The Aerodrome |year=2015 |accessdate=21 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018055716/http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/france/124.php |archive-date=18 October 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the Belgians got them at the end of the year. The [[Nieuport 17]] came into service with the French as early as June 1916, but the Belgians received so few that in June 1917 they were still operating all their earlier Nieuports. They then contracted for newer [[Nieuport 23]]s, which were basically up-engined Nieuport 17s. [[Spad VII]]s had entered French service on 2 September 1916; the Belgians first received them almost an entire year later, with the first one on board on 22 August 1917. In September 1917, Belgium had the [[Hanriot HD.1]] supplied to it the year after it was introduced. [[Spad XIII]]s also came on line that month, but would not show up in Belgian inventory until the next year. [[Sopwith Camel]]s first went into service in May 1917 and the AMB received its first one on 29 November 1917.<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.15\u201316</ref>\n\nThe AMB did make one attempt to design and build its own aircraft. However the Ponnier M1 was not good enough for production, and the ten or so manufactured ended up with clipped wings as powered \"Penguin\" rollers for training rookie pilots.<ref>Pieters (1998), p.16</ref>\n\n====Operational summary====\nOne of its [[flying ace]] pilots, [[Willy Coppens]], became the top ranking [[balloon buster]] of World War I, as well as one of the war's top aces. Four other pilots from the tiny force also became aces with it: [[Andre de Meulemeester]],<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.46\u201347</ref> [[Edmond Thieffry]],<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.78\u201379</ref>  [[Jan Olieslagers]],<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.72\u201373</ref> and [[Fernand Jacquet]].<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.62\u201363</ref> A sixth Belgian, [[Adolphe DuBois d'Aische]], became the war's oldest ace while in French service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/belgium/duboisdaische.php |title=Adolphe Aloys Marie Hubert duBois d'Aische |work=The Aerodrome |year=2015 |accessdate=21 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126123310/http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/belgium/duboisdaische.php |archive-date=26 January 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe fledgling air force was entrusted with flying both [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876\u20131965)|Queen Elizabeth]] over the battle front at times.<ref>Pieters (1998), pp.21\u201322</ref>\n\n===Between the world wars===\nDuring the [[interwar period]], the Belgian Air Force flew the [[Breguet 19]]. Some efforts were made to acquire aircraft from local production, such as those by [[Stampe et Vertongen]] and [[Alfred Renard|Renard]]. They also evaluated native designs like the [[ACAZ C.2]] and [[LACAB GR.8]], none of which entered mass production however.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Firefly y17.jpg|thumb|Belgian [[Fairey Firefly II]], 1931]]\nAt the start of World War II, the Army Air Force had three active Air Force Regiments. Aircraft which were used by those regiments were the [[Renard R-31]] and [[Renard R-32|R-32]], the [[Fiat CR.42]], the [[Hawker Hurricane]], the [[Gloster Gladiator]], the [[Fairey Fox]], and the [[Fairey Battle]]. These were massacred by the much superior German Luftwaffe in the German invasion of May 1940. Before the outbreak of the war Belgium also sought to equip the ''Aviation Militaire'' with foreign designs, ordering production licences in [[Poland]] and [[France]] and aircraft in the USA. However, the acquired licences could not be used until May 1940 and the aircraft produced in the USA were eventually delivered to [[France]] and to the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nAfter the surrender of Belgium on 28 May 1940, a very small Belgian Air Force in exile was created in Great Britain as the Belgian section of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]]. This small force was active within the British [[Royal Air Force]], and its squadrons were equipped with the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Typhoon]].\n\n===The Cold War===\n{{see also|Structure of the Belgian Armed Forces in 1989#Air Force|Second Allied Tactical Air Force}}\n\nOn 15 October 1946, the Belgian military aviation was turned into an autonomous force, independent of the Belgian Army. From September 1953 to 1960, the ''Ecole de Pilotage Avanc\u00e9'' (\"Advanced Pilots' School\") operated Harvards from the [[Kamina]] military base in the [[Belgian Congo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ailes-militaires-belges.be/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=197&Itemid=571&lang=en |title=EPA \u00e0 Kamina |first=V. |last=P\u00e9criaux |work=Les Ailes Militaires Belges |year=2015 |accessdate=21 August 2015 |language=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919225213/http://www.ailes-militaires-belges.be/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=197&Itemid=571&lang=en |archive-date=19 September 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Seemingly about 60 Harvards were at the base.\n\n===Post-Cold War reforms \u2013 COMOPSAIR (Commandement Op\u00e9rationnel Air - Operational Command Air)===\n[[File:Agusta A109BA 5 (7567963708).jpg|thumb|left|[[AgustaWestland AW109|Agusta A109]] of the Air Component]]\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the end of the Cold War caused the Belgian government to restructure the Belgian Armed Forces in order to cope with the changed threats. The Belgian Air Force was hit hard and saw its strength more than halved with the disbanding of the 3rd Tactical Wing in Bierset (1994); the disbanding of the 1st Fighter Wing in [[Beauvechain]]; the 9th Training Wing in [[Sint-Truiden Air Base]]; and the Elementary Flying School in [[Goetsenhoven Military Airfield|Goetsenhoven]] (1996).\n\nIn 2002, the Belgian government decided to emulate [[Canada]] and impose a \"single structure\" on its armed forces in which the independent Belgian Air Force ceased to exist. The Belgian Air Component (''COMOPSAIR being the HQ'') consists of the [[2nd Tactical Wing]] in [[Florennes Air Base]] and the [[10th Tactical Wing]] in [[Kleine Brogel Air Base]], both flying F-16s in four squadrons. Out of the 160 F-16s originally bought by Belgium, only 105 were upgraded; with further reductions to 72 aircraft in 2005; and planned to 60 by 2012. The [[1st Wing (Belgium)|1st Wing]] at [[Beauvechain Air Base]] is assigned for the training of pilots, using the piston-powered [[Aermacchi SF.260]] for elementary training, and the [[Alpha Jet]] for advanced training. Advanced combat training is done on F-16's at [[Kleine Brogel Air Base|Kleine Brogel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scramblemagazine.nl/orbats/belgium |title=Belgium Air Component Order of Battle |work=Scramble.nl |accessdate=24 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206161023/http://www.scramblemagazine.nl/orbats/belgium |archive-date=6 December 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> COMOPSAIR still operates the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[C-130 Hercules]] in the [[15th Air Transport Wing]] based at [[Melsbroek Air Base]], planning to replace them by seven [[Airbus A400M]] transport aircraft.

The [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] helicopters flown for the Belgian Navy in a utility-role and will be phased out in 2021.\n\nIn 2004, as part of the unified structure, the Army Aviation units of the [[Wing Heli]] were transferred to the COMOPSAIR. These contain the [[Agusta A109]] attack helicopter, and the [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]] training and recce helicopter.\nIn 2005, the Belgian [[Alpha Jet]]s moved to Cazaux in France to continue the [[11 Squadron (Belgian Air Force)|Initial Operational Training]], while the Advanced Jet Training was done on French [[Alpha Jet]]s at Tours. As from 2013 both Advanced Jet Training as well as Initial Operational Training are completed in Cazaux in France.\nWithin the framework of its commitments within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, [[NATO]], Belgium has assigned its 72 F-16s to NATO purposes. Two squadrons with a total of 16 aircraft have been designated for use by the ''Rapid Reaction Forces''.\nIn February 2008, Defense Minister [[Pieter De Crem]] announced that due to increasing problems and poor serviceability, the two A310s were to be replaced as soon as possible by two aircraft in the same class. An [[Airbus A330]] was dry-leased to take their place till March 2014 where it was replaced by an [[Airbus A321]].\nOn September 1, 2010, the [[Wing Heli]] in Bierset was disbanded and the [[Agusta A109]] helicopters moved to [[Beauvechain Air Base]] to become [[1st Wing (Belgium)|1st Wing]]. The [[Aermacchi SF.260|SF260]] squadrons became part of the [[Basic Flying Training School (Belgian Air Component)|Basic Flying Training School]].\nOn May 24, 2011, it was reported that the two retired [[Airbus A310]] aircraft have been sold to the [[Brussels]]-based company MAD Africa for the amount of 700,000 euros.

During this operation, Belgian aircraft carried out several flights along the Iraqi border. After this operation the obsolete Mirage 5s were phased out.\n\nOn 15 July 1996, a C-130 with serial CH-06 carrying 37 members of the Dutch Army Fanfare Band and four Belgian crew members crashed at [[Eindhoven Airport|Eindhoven]] after a bird strike while executing a go-around, resulting in the loss of power to two engines. 34 passengers were killed, and only 7 survived. The accident is known in the Netherlands as the [[Herculesramp]].\n\nFrom October 1996, the Belgian Air Force cooperated with the Dutch Royal Air Force in the \"Deployable Air Task Force\" in patrolling former Yugoslavian airspace. F-16s of the 2nd and 10th Tactical Wings, operating from the Italian bases of [[Villafranca Air Base|Villafranca]] and [[Amendola Air Base|Amendola]], were assigned to missions insuring the control of a No-Fly Zone over Yugoslavia, and providing the air support necessary for UN and NATO troops. Between March 24 and June 10, 1999, twelve Belgian F-16s carried out 679 combat sorties \u2013 the first time since the second World War that Belgian aircraft took part in active war operations in enemy territory \u2013 against [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo]] crisis. The last Belgian F-16 detachment left [[Italy]] in August 2001.\n\n===2000s===\nOn 29 March 2004, four F-16s from [[Kleine Brogel Air Base|Kleine Brogel]] were transferred under [[NATO|NATO's]] [[Baltic Air Policing]] mission to the [[\u0160iauliai International Airport|\u0160iauliai Air Base]] in [[Lithuania]] for three months, where they were employed in monitoring the [[Lithuania]]n, [[Latvia]]n, and [[Estonia]]n skies.\n\nIn 2005, the Helicopter Wing (WHeli \u2013 HeliW) deployed four A-109 (including one Medevac) in [[Tuzla]], Bosnia.

founding and [[Ruling party|ruling political party]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[List of largest political parties|second largest political party in the world]]. The CPC is the [[One-party state|sole governing party]] within [[mainland China]], [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|permitting only eight other]], subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the [[United Front (China)|United Front]]. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]]. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT)'s [[nationalist government]] from [[mainland China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It also controls the world's largest armed forces, the [[People's Liberation Army]].\n\nThe CPC is officially organised on the basis of [[democratic centralism]], a principle conceived by Russian [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]] [[Vladimir Lenin]] which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]], convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year most duties and responsibilities are vested in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] and its [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]]. The [[List of leaders of the Communist Party of China|party's leader]] recently holds the offices of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] (responsible for civilian party duties), [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and [[President of the People's Republic of China|State President]] (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts, the party leader is the country's [[paramount leader]]. The current paramount leader is General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]], elected at the [[18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|18th Central Committee]] held on 15 November 2012.\n\nThe CPC is committed to [[communism]] and continues to participate in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]] each year. According to the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party constitution]], the CPC adheres to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[Mao Zedong Thought]], [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]], the [[Three Represents]], the [[Scientific Outlook on Development]], and [[Xi Jinping Thought]]. The official explanation for [[Reform and opening-up|China's economic reforms]] is that the country is in the [[primary stage of socialism]], a developmental stage similar to the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. The [[command economy]] established under [[Mao Zedong]] was replaced by the [[socialist market economy]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]], the [[Economy of China|current economic system]], on the basis that \"Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth\".\n\nSince the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of Eastern European communist governments]] in 1989\u20131990 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the CPC has emphasised its party-to-party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining [[socialist state]]s. While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling [[communist parties]] around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with ruling parties of [[one-party states]] (whatever their ideology), [[Dominant-party system|dominant parties]] in [[democracies]] (whatever their ideology) and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Communist Party of China}}\n\n=== Founding and early history (1921\u20131927) ===\n[[File:The First National Congress of CPC.jpg|thumb|[[Site of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party|Site of the first CPC congress]], in the former [[Shanghai French Concession]]]]\n\nThe CPC has its origins in the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, during which radical Western ideologies like [[Marxism]] and [[Anarchism in China|anarchism]] gained traction among [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectuals]].<ref name=\"XinhuaCCPhistory\" /> Other influences stemming from the Bolshevik revolution and Marxist theory inspired the Communist Party of China.<ref>{{cite book |title=The World Transformed:1945 to the Present |last=Hunt |first=Michael |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |location= |page = 114 }}</ref> [[Li Dazhao]] was the first leading Chinese intellectual who publicly supported [[Leninism]] and [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=26}} In contrast to [[Chen Duxiu]], Li did not renounce participation in the affairs of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} Both of them regarded the [[October Revolution]] in Russia as groundbreaking, believing it to herald a new era for oppressed countries everywhere.{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} The CPC was modeled on [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s theory of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|pp=34\u201338}} Study circles were, according to [[Cai Hesen]], \"the rudiments [of our party]\".{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=38}} Several study circles were established during the [[New Culture Movement]], but \"by 1920 skepticism about their suitability as vehicles for reform had become widespread.\"{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=44}}\n\nThe [[1st National Congress of the Communist Party of China|founding National Congress]] of the CPC was held on 23\u201331 July 1921.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinatoday.com/org/cpc/cpc_1st_congress_standing_polibureau.htm |title=1st.

The two countries' friendship has withstood the test of a changeable international situation, and the friendship has been further strengthened and consolidated.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n=== Non-communist parties ===\nSince the decline and fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the CPC has begun establishing party-to-party relations with non-communist parties.{{sfn|Smith|West|2012|p=127}} These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=86\u201392}} For instance, the CPC has been eager to understand how the [[People's Action Party|People's Action Party of Singapore]] (PAP) maintains its total domination over [[Politics of Singapore|Singaporean politics]] through its \"low-key presence, but total control.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} According to the CPC's own analysis of [[Singapore]], the PAP's dominance can be explained by its \"well-developed social network, which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party-controlled groups.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a [[liberal democracy]], they view it as a [[guided democracy]] led by the PAP.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} Other differences are, according to the CPC, \"that it is not a political party based on the working class\u2014instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the [[parliamentary system]], not a [[vanguard party|revolutionary party]].\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=94}} Other parties which the CPC studies and maintains strong party-to-party relations with are the [[United Malays National Organisation]], which has ruled [[Malaysia]] (1957-2018), and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in [[Japan]], which dominated [[Japanese politics]] since 1955.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nThe CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made friendly overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party relations with the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} For instance, the longevity of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Syrian Regional Branch]] of the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] is attributed to the personalization of power in the [[al-Assad family]], the strong [[presidential system]], the inheritance of power, which passed from [[Hafez al-Assad]] to his son [[Bashar al-Assad]], and the role given to the [[Syrian military]] in politics.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}}\n[[File:Cena de Estado que en honor del Excmo.

founding and [[Ruling party|ruling political party]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[List of largest political parties|second largest political party in the world]]. The CPC is the [[One-party state|sole governing party]] within [[mainland China]], [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|permitting only eight other]], subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the [[United Front (China)|United Front]]. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]]. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT)'s [[nationalist government]] from [[mainland China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It also controls the world's largest armed forces, the [[People's Liberation Army]].\n\nThe CPC is officially organised on the basis of [[democratic centralism]], a principle conceived by Russian [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]] [[Vladimir Lenin]] which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]], convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year most duties and responsibilities are vested in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] and its [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]]. The [[List of leaders of the Communist Party of China|party's leader]] recently holds the offices of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] (responsible for civilian party duties), [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and [[President of the People's Republic of China|State President]] (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts, the party leader is the country's [[paramount leader]]. The current paramount leader is General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]], elected at the [[18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|18th Central Committee]] held on 15 November 2012.\n\nThe CPC is committed to [[communism]] and continues to participate in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]] each year. According to the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party constitution]], the CPC adheres to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[Mao Zedong Thought]], [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]], the [[Three Represents]], the [[Scientific Outlook on Development]], and [[Xi Jinping Thought]]. The official explanation for [[Reform and opening-up|China's economic reforms]] is that the country is in the [[primary stage of socialism]], a developmental stage similar to the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].

[[Cuba]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]] and their respective ruling parties as well as [[North Korea]] and its ruling party, which officially abandoned communism in 2009.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=81}} It spends a fair amount of time analyzing the situation in the remaining socialist states, trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not, following the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Eastern European socialist states]] in 1989 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} In general, the analyses of the remaining socialist states and their chances of survival have been positive, and the CPC believes that the socialist movement will be revitalized sometime in the future.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}}\n\nThe ruling party which the CPC is most interested in is the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} In general the CPV is considered a model example of socialist development in the post-Soviet era.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} Chinese analysts on Vietnam believe that the introduction of the [[Doi Moi]] reform policy at the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th CPV National Congress]] is the key reason for Vietnam's current success.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}}\n\nWhile the CPC is probably the organization with [[China-North Korea relations|most access to North Korea]], writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} The few reports accessible to the general public are those about [[North Korean economic reform]]s.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for [[Economy of North Korea|North Korea's economic system]], the [[North Korea's cult of personality|cult of personality]] which pervades society, the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]], the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the [[Korean People's Army]] and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=82\u201383}} There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the [[First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK general secretary]] [[Kim Jong-il]] to [[North China Plain|Guandong province]] to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}}\n\nThere is a considerable degree of interest in Cuba within the CPC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[Fidel Castro]], the former [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] (PCC), is greatly admired, and books have been written focusing on the successes of the [[Cuban Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[China-Cuba relations|Communication between the CPC and the PCC]] has increased considerably since the 1990s, hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=85}} At the 4th Plenary Session of the [[16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|16th Central Committee]], which discussed the possibility of the CPC learning from other ruling parties, praise was heaped on the PCC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008 |p=85}} When [[Wu Guanzheng]], a Central Politburo member, met with Fidel Castro in 2007, he gave him a personal letter written by Hu Jintao: \"Facts have shown that China and Cuba are trustworthy good friends, good comrades, and good brothers who treat each other with sincerity. The two countries' friendship has withstood the test of a changeable international situation, and the friendship has been further strengthened and consolidated.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n=== Non-communist parties ===\nSince the decline and fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the CPC has begun establishing party-to-party relations with non-communist parties.{{sfn|Smith|West|2012|p=127}} These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=86\u201392}} For instance, the CPC has been eager to understand how the [[People's Action Party|People's Action Party of Singapore]] (PAP) maintains its total domination over [[Politics of Singapore|Singaporean politics]] through its \"low-key presence, but total control.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} According to the CPC's own analysis of [[Singapore]], the PAP's dominance can be explained by its \"well-developed social network, which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party-controlled groups.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a [[liberal democracy]], they view it as a [[guided democracy]] led by the PAP.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} Other differences are, according to the CPC, \"that it is not a political party based on the working class\u2014instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the [[parliamentary system]], not a [[vanguard party|revolutionary party]].\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=94}} Other parties which the CPC studies and maintains strong party-to-party relations with are the [[United Malays National Organisation]], which has ruled [[Malaysia]] (1957-2018), and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in [[Japan]], which dominated [[Japanese politics]] since 1955.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nThe CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made friendly overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party relations with the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} For instance, the longevity of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Syrian Regional Branch]] of the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] is attributed to the personalization of power in the [[al-Assad family]], the strong [[presidential system]], the inheritance of power, which passed from [[Hafez al-Assad]] to his son [[Bashar al-Assad]], and the role given to the [[Syrian military]] in politics.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}}\n[[File:Cena de Estado que en honor del Excmo.

Accusations of being a [[Cult]] group have been made repeatedly over the years, especially in newspaper articles and by cult watchers. Ching Hai\u2019s response to this accusation is that participants were free to leave at any time.<ref name=eichman/> \n\nIn Eichman's own view, as infuriating as Hai's persona, her materialism and unsystematic religious synthesizing is to the Taiwanese Buddhist community and to others who have called her a cult leader, when we set aside her Buddhist roots and compare her work to that of an ever-changing array of self-made gurus, spiritual guides and newly formed religions that make up the New Age marketplace, it becomes evident that Ching Hai\u2019s work is neither the most radical nor innovative. She states that the controversies swirling around Hai should not stop us from noting just how gutsy it was for her to strike out on her own, and with her unusual prominence as a female spiritual leader, Ching Hai in effect demonstrates her ability to compete in a spiritual arena dominated largely by men. And we should be open to the idea that not all female leaders will remain within the religious mainstream.<ref name=eichman/>\n\n==Quan Yin method==\nHai first demonstrated the \"Immeasurable Light Meditation Center and the Way of Sound Contemplation\" or Quan Yin method of meditation in Miaoli, Taiwan.<ref name=thornton08/> According to Hai \"The method is transmitted without words... In fact, it isn't really a method. It's the [[Adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na|power of the Master]]. If you have it, then you can transmit it. The Method is a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] one that cannot be described by our language. Even if someone describes it to you, you won't receive the Light and the vibration, the inner peace and Wisdom\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the Quan Yin Method? |url=http://www.godsdirectcontact.org.tw/eng/qym/qym-1.htm |website=www.godsdirectcontact.org.tw |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref> Hai stated \"It\u2019s not that I invented the Quan Yin Method; I just know it. This method has existed since the beginning of time, when the universe was first formed. And it will always exist. It is not a method; it is like the way of the universe, a universal law that we must follow if we want to get back to the Origin, back to our [[Original face|true Self]], back to the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] or our [[Buddha-nature|Buddha nature]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quan Yin Method is an Eternal Universal Law |url=http://magazine.godsdirectcontact.net/english/178/mt_0.htm |website=magazine.godsdirectcontact.net |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe method involves meditation on the \"inner light and the inner sound\" of God or the Buddha. Hai claims that the [[Bible]] acknowledged the existence of this method and that it has been repeatedly re-used by most major religions.<ref name=\"young\"/> The Quan Yin Method \"Full Initiation\" involves a life-long commitment to a [[vegan]] diet, adherence to the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Buddhism]] and at least two hours meditation daily. \"Quick initiation\" or \"Convenient Method\", requires a half hour\u2019s meditation daily and abstinence from meat for ten days each month.<ref name=hughes/>\n\n[[Religious studies]] scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] includes Ching Hai in the Indian [[Sant Mat]] tradition, where the method is called [[Surat Shabd Yoga]]. While adhering to formless devotion ([[Para_Brahman#Advaita_Vedanta_-_Nirguna_Brahman|Nirguna Brahman]]), the initiation of the method from a lineage guru or master is paramount.<ref>{{cite book |last1=York |first1=Michael |title=Pagan Mysticism: Paganism as a World Religion |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-5275-2308-1 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CgR_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22ching+hai%22#v=onepage&q=%22ching%20hai%22&f=false |accessdate=3 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  \n\nReligious studies scholar Jennifer Eichman notes that this particular meditation method is not part of the standard Buddhist repertoire. Hai's modified synthesis of the method is primarily in Christian-Buddhist jargon with a sprinkling of Hindu ideas. Ching Hai is more likely to cite the Bible than Hindu texts. Ching Hai claims, following standard [[Zen]] doctrine, that everyone is the Buddha; they simply need to realize this fact.

Accusations of being a [[Cult]] group have been made repeatedly over the years, especially in newspaper articles and by cult watchers. Ching Hai\u2019s response to this accusation is that participants were free to leave at any time.<ref name=eichman/> \n\nIn Eichman's own view, as infuriating as Hai's persona, her materialism and unsystematic religious synthesizing is to the Taiwanese Buddhist community and to others who have called her a cult leader, when we set aside her Buddhist roots and compare her work to that of an ever-changing array of self-made gurus, spiritual guides and newly formed religions that make up the New Age marketplace, it becomes evident that Ching Hai\u2019s work is neither the most radical nor innovative. She states that the controversies swirling around Hai should not stop us from noting just how gutsy it was for her to strike out on her own, and with her unusual prominence as a female spiritual leader, Ching Hai in effect demonstrates her ability to compete in a spiritual arena dominated largely by men. And we should be open to the idea that not all female leaders will remain within the religious mainstream.<ref name=eichman/>\n\n==Quan Yin method==\nHai first demonstrated the \"Immeasurable Light Meditation Center and the Way of Sound Contemplation\" or Quan Yin method of meditation in Miaoli, Taiwan.<ref name=thornton08/> According to Hai \"The method is transmitted without words... In fact, it isn't really a method. It's the [[Adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na|power of the Master]]. If you have it, then you can transmit it. The Method is a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] one that cannot be described by our language. Even if someone describes it to you, you won't receive the Light and the vibration, the inner peace and Wisdom\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the Quan Yin Method? |url=http://www.godsdirectcontact.org.tw/eng/qym/qym-1.htm |website=www.godsdirectcontact.org.tw |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref> Hai stated \"It\u2019s not that I invented the Quan Yin Method; I just know it. This method has existed since the beginning of time, when the universe was first formed. And it will always exist. It is not a method; it is like the way of the universe, a universal law that we must follow if we want to get back to the Origin, back to our [[Original face|true Self]], back to the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] or our [[Buddha-nature|Buddha nature]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quan Yin Method is an Eternal Universal Law |url=http://magazine.godsdirectcontact.net/english/178/mt_0.htm |website=magazine.godsdirectcontact.net |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe method involves meditation on the \"inner light and the inner sound\" of God or the Buddha. Hai claims that the [[Bible]] acknowledged the existence of this method and that it has been repeatedly re-used by most major religions.<ref name=\"young\"/> The Quan Yin Method \"Full Initiation\" involves a life-long commitment to a [[vegan]] diet, adherence to the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Buddhism]] and at least two hours meditation daily. \"Quick initiation\" or \"Convenient Method\", requires a half hour\u2019s meditation daily and abstinence from meat for ten days each month.<ref name=hughes/>\n\n[[Religious studies]] scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] includes Ching Hai in the Indian [[Sant Mat]] tradition, where the method is called [[Surat Shabd Yoga]]. While adhering to formless devotion ([[Para_Brahman#Advaita_Vedanta_-_Nirguna_Brahman|Nirguna Brahman]]), the initiation of the method from a lineage guru or master is paramount.<ref>{{cite book |last1=York |first1=Michael |title=Pagan Mysticism: Paganism as a World Religion |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-5275-2308-1 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CgR_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22ching+hai%22#v=onepage&q=%22ching%20hai%22&f=false |accessdate=3 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  \n\nReligious studies scholar Jennifer Eichman notes that this particular meditation method is not part of the standard Buddhist repertoire. Hai's modified synthesis of the method is primarily in Christian-Buddhist jargon with a sprinkling of Hindu ideas. Ching Hai is more likely to cite the Bible than Hindu texts. Ching Hai claims, following standard [[Zen]] doctrine, that everyone is the Buddha; they simply need to realize this fact. In a departure from Christian doctrine, Ching Hai claims that God is not the creator of humans; rather [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] accumulation is responsible for the repeated transmigration of the soul.<ref name=eichman>{{cite journal |last1=Eichman |first1=Jennifer |title=Prominent Nuns: Influential Taiwanese Voices |journal=[[CrossCurrents]] |date=2011 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=345\u2013373 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1388514 |accessdate=4 February 2020 |language=en |issn=0011-1953|doi=10.1111/j.1939-3881.2011.00187.x }}</ref>\n\nKorean [[Brain & Body|Dahnhak]] [[Qigong]] expert Kim Tae-young, auther of the popular ''Leading Experience'' guidebooks (in Korean) - published in 102 volumes since 1990,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Sung-Man |title=Caring for the Body and Minds (originally in Korean) |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=ko&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fm.skyedaily.com%2Fnews_view.html%3FID%3D8584 |accessdate=7 February 2020 |publisher=SkyeDaily.com |date=24 February 2013}}</ref> has written in ''Leading Experience'' vol 37 (1997) that ''Quan Chi'' (concentrating on [[Qi|Chi]]) and ''Quan Nian'', (observing [[Concept|conceptions]]) are more familiar terms than the term ''Quan Yin'' (observation of the inner vibration).

Besides simplicity this is the main advantage over [[WEB]], which needs different versions to support programming languages other than [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]]. (Thus the necessity of [[CWEB]], which supports [[C (programming language)|C]] and similar languages.)\n\n==Noweb's input==\n\nA Noweb input text contains program source code interleaved with documentation. It consists of so-called ''chunks'' that are either ''documentation chunks'' or ''code chunks''.\n\nA documentation chunk begins\nwith a line that starts with an at sign (@) followed by a space or newline.  \nA documentation chunk has no name.\nDocumentation chunks normally contain LaTeX, but Noweb is also used with HTML, plain TeX, and with troff.\n\nCode chunks are named.\nA code chunk begins with\n\n <<chunk name>>=\n\non a line by itself.

Their comrades buried their bodies on the land on which they had fallen. Shortly afterwards on 3 February, the [[Battle of Montevideo (1807)|Battle of Montevideo]] took place.\n\nOn 24 October 1818 a Portuguese resident of the Cordon area of Montevideo,  Padre don Manuel Salinas took possession of a piece of \u201cunoccupied\u201d land situated in the centre of the city on the site of the present \u201cIntendencia\u201d, that was donated to him, during the occupation of Montevideo by the Portuguese Government, by the then Governor Lecor, Viscount of Laguna.\nOn 30 September 1825 Padre Salinas sold and transferred the land to a British resident, Mr. John Hall for the sum of $400.  On 14 April 1828 the British Consul in Montevideo, Mr Thomas Hood<ref>[[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Uruguay#Early diplomats.2F List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Uruguay.23Early diplomats]]</ref> bought the land from John Hall in the name of the British government, and it is from this date that the British Cemetery became more formally recognised.\n\nThis cemetery initially was a [[Protestant]] Cemetery according to the first entrance books, that being the main reason why so many Germans were buried in the original cemetery. In 1835 a German citizen by the name of Enrique Jakobsen died in San Jose, and was denied burial there on account of being a [[freemason]] and a [[Heresy|heretic]]. His body was brought to Montevideo, and was also initially denied burial for the same reason. At that time all cemeteries were under the sole management and control of the [[Catholic Church]]. After his burial in the [[Central Cemetery of Montevideo|Cementerio Central]] which had been inaugurated earlier the same year the First Bishop of Montevideo, [[Jacinto Vera]] declared that no other burial could take place in that Cemetery until the body was removed. Because of this the Government stepped in, and on 10 October 1835 passed a decree whereby all cemeteries in this country would come under the direct influence of the Jefatura de Policia. Subsequent to this decree, years later, by Government decree of 28 June 1858 the administration of all cemeteries of this country was conferred on the Juntas Economicas Administrativas who depended directly from the Municipios.  On 3 October 1837 the title deeds were issued to Mr. Hood with the provision that the land should be used exclusively for the burial of British subjects. Within a context of religious intolerance the Uruguayan Government requested that Protestants of other nationalities should also be buried there, and as can be seen from the record books this has always been respected. The British Cemetery has no restrictions regarding religion or nationality.\n\nOn 1 January 1879 a decree was passed prohibiting burials within the Cemetery, with a few exceptions due to an outbreak of [[Yellow Fever]].  On 1 October 1884 the President of the Republic, General [[M\u00e1ximo Santos]], had a decree passed to finally close the Old Cemetery and the Government made a [[Compulsory Purchase]] of the land. Anticipating this possibility, in August 1878 a piece of land was bought next to the [[Buceo Cemetery]] (which had been inaugurated on 20 March 1872) for the purpose of opening a Cemetery in this new location.  In 1885 the gardens and paths were designed and constructed inside the walls of the New Cemetery, a house for the caretaker, offices, stables, a shed for the workers, and the Chapel. Any improvements or maintenance that has been done to these installations over the years has respected the original designs, and today all of these buildings still stand as fine examples of late 19th century architecture.  On 14 October a dedication ceremony was carried out in the newly constructed Chapel by the [[Waite Hockin Stirling|Right Reverend Waite Hockin Stirling]] who was the Lord Bishop of the [[Falkland Islands]].\n\nIn 1888 the railings and a water well were constructed.  The first Burial in the New British Cemetery was that of a German citizen by the name of Nicolas Laukant on 9 April 1885. Cristian Schenzer, who was the caretaker of the Cemetery at the time, was contracted to carry out the onerous task of transferring the remains of bodies interred in the old cemetery and their corresponding monuments to the new site. This was done between 13 October 1887 and 4 February 1888.<ref>Diario \"El Plata\", published Montevideo, 05/03/1934, page 7</ref>\n\nIn the year 1897 the British Community decided to build a community hall and as a way of commemorating her [[Diamond Jubilee]] it was named after [[Queen Victoria]]. The Victoria Hall Society was formed, and after obtaining a loan from the British Cemetery Society, a very suitable piece of land in calle Rio Negro was purchased, where the building was finally erected. The drive for funds for its construction was very small, and payments had to be made during the construction of the building, so that continuous loans had to be granted by the Cemetery Society, until such time as the building was finished. The so-called Victoria Hall Society could not even meet the payment of interest on the total loan, so finally an agreement was reached whereby the property was transferred to the British Cemetery Society. In this building, with a private entrance, the Acacia Lodge Temple was constructed, and the Acacia Lodge obtained a loan from the British Cemetery Society to import from the United Kingdom the furniture required for the [[Masonic Temple]]. When all the public utility companies, such as railways, waterworks, tramways etc. passed into the hands of the Government, the general idea was that there would no longer be any British Community. No use was made of the Victoria Hall; it was partly kept by the rent obtained from leasing it for weekend dances and theatre. Expenses, management, repairs, taxes etc. had to be paid by the British Cemetery Society with yearly losses, and as finally the community was no longer using the hall, decision was taken to sell it.\n\nUpon the death of Queen Victoria, on 22 January 1901, the British Community in Uruguay decided to raise funds to build a monument in her honour. F. Pozer & Company constructed an [[obelisk]] with grey granite from the hills near Minas, 8 metres high, with the inscription \"Victoria, Queen and Mother of her People\". The monument was inaugurated at 3pm on Sunday 10 August 1902. The ceremony was led by the Walter Baring \u2013 British Minister & Consul General at Montevideo,<ref>[[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Uruguay#Early diplomats.2F List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Uruguay.23Early diplomats]]</ref> Reverend Basil Cobbett and the President of the British Society W. Galway accompanied by 6 sailors from HMS Basilisk. The monument still stands in its original position within the entrance to the Cemetery.<ref>The Montevideo Times, 8 August 1902</ref>\n\nAt a meeting of the British Cemeteries Society held on 13 February 1908, Mr J.J. Hore then Honorary Treasurer of the Society brought forward a scheme for the establishing of a [[The British Schools of Montevideo|British School]] in Montevideo, for those children whose parents could not afford to send them for their education abroad. The proposal was eventually carried through, and the then Rector of the Anglican Church, Rev. Alpass, who had educational experience, was instructed that whilst in England he should obtain the services of a headmaster and teacher for the projected school. He was also instructed to purchase the required furniture and books for the school. Apart from paying Assisted Education for various children once the School was installed in calle Salsipuedes (now Blanes), the British Cemetery Society made the School a grant of $5,000 for a period of three years, and that it should be continued until such time that the school could pay its own way. When the School moved from calle Blanes to 18 de Julio continued assistance was granted. From there the British School decided to build their own property, and in this respect purchased land in [[Pocitos]],  where the School was built. [[Edward VIII|Edward, the Prince of Wales]] laid the Foundation Stone in 1925. The Cemetery Society guaranteed and paid all the mortgage interest on the property built in Jose B. Lamas, on the condition that on the Board of the British Schools Society there should always be two members of the British Cemetery Society until such time as the final payment of the mortgage on the property had been made.\n\nDuring 1910 the [[British Hospital (Montevideo)|British Hospital]] decided to vacate their old premises on the street [[Juan Lindolfo Cuestas]], and build a new hospital in Avenida Aldea (now Avenida Italia), where it stands today, and known as the [[Edward VII]] Hospital. The total investment for the construction was $60000, and it was made out in debentures. The British Cemetery Society had to guarantee the 6% interest on these debentures. As the British Community could not meet the total $60000, the British Cemetery Society had to absorb one third. Also, some years later, when the extension to the [[Edward VII]] Hospital was made, of what were called the new wings, the British Cemetery Society granted a further loan, which covered 40% of this construction at a low interest rate.\n\nIn the year 1945 when practically all the British public utility works were sold to the Uruguayan Government the then Presidents of the various British Societies together with their committees decided to sell out, as they thought that it could be the end of a British Community in this country. Consequently, the Victoria Hall, the Old English Club and [[Montevideo Cricket Club]] sold out.\n\nIn accordance with the statutes of the Society, at the end of every financial year, if there is a profit in the running of the Society the same is disbursed amongst medical entities.\n\n== Types of crosses ==\nDistinct styles of monuments are to be found within the Cemetery, reflecting the wide variety of nationalities and religious groups which are represented.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:G 261.jpg|Latin Cross\nFile:E 051.jpg|Latin Cross, with lilies\nFile:SC 178.jpg|Stepped Cross, with Anchor\nFile:G 113.jpg|Crucifix\nFile:A 038.jpg|Celtic Cross\nFile:\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e.jpg|Russian Orthodox cross\nFile:G 292.jpg|Bottonee Cross\nFile:WW 039b.jpg\nFile:EW 294.jpg|Wooden Cross\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable burials==\n\n===[[British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors|Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen]]===\n\nThe British Cemetery contains the graves of quite a number of soldiers, sailors and airmen of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent.

Another important Britisher that arrived to Montevideo in 1825 was Mr. Thomas Tomkinson, who came out as an employee of an established British firm, of which he eventually became the proprietor. He was known as \u201cel ingles de los eucalyptus\u201d. He had asked his friend Jorge Hodskin to bring him from a botanical garden seeds of a tree that was big and shady. The same was catalogued as \u201cEucalyptus soleudus\u201d. In his property in Paso de Arena, he planted these seeds, and they developed trees that have become the most useful and commercial tree in the country. Seeds and plants were taken over to the Argentine, and in that vast pampas where there were almost no trees, they flourished, and soon there were [[eucalyptus]] plantations all over the country. In Uruguay it is exactly the same, big plantations of eucalyptus to give protection and shade to the cattle on the [[estancia]]s. Another important function, is that 90% of all the estancia fencing in Uruguay, is made of timber derived from eucalyptus. Today eucalyptus trunks are being exported to Europe. In an article written by Uruguayan historian Juan Carlos Pedemonte he refers to an achievement of Mr. Tomkinson and other Britishers. They formed a Society for Horse racing in the European style, (most probably jumping and hurdles), in 1861. The racetrack was in Punta Carretas, near to the actual Golf Club, and the track was along Julia Maria Sosa (today) to calle Ellauri. In Bulevar Artigas and Garcia Cortinas they built a grandstand, which years later in 1889 was transferred to Maro\u00f1as, when the Britishers discontinued with this racetrack. In the Punta Carretas track a special race took place on 3 April 1861, named \u2018Premio Nacional\u2019, and was won by \u2018Pegaso\u2019, property of Sr. Buxareo, the prize was donated by [[Bernardo Berro|The President, Bernardo Berro]]. Together with other Britishers they started steeplechase in Pueblo Itazaingo, near Moro\u00f1as. In that neighbourhood they had monthly horse racing meetings with the [[Criollo (horse)|criollo horses]]. When Thomas Tomkinson imported thoroughbred racing horses, in a short period of time great changes came about at the horse-racing track. Together with Samuel Lafone he was one of the founders of the Banco Commercial in 1857. In the outskirts of Montevideo he developed a beautiful park, where he spent weekends. This park today is known as Parque Tomkinson, and the road that passes through this park is known as Camino Tomkinson. Plot B 003\n* John J Vander Weyde. (1840\u20131878).

In the year 1843, through the sole effort of [[:es:Samuel Lafone|Samuel Lafone]], the foundation of the [[Cathedral of The Most Holy Trinity, Montevideo|Holy Trinity Church]]<ref>[http://www.niagara.anglican.ca/outreach/docs/Anglican%20Church%20of%20Uruguay%20-%20Diocesan%20Profile.pdf Holy Trinity Church]</ref> was laid. Samuel Lafone exclusively made the finance of this church. This gentleman came over from Buenos Aires, where he underwent serious problems when he married Maria Quevedo Alsina. The wedding ceremony had been performed by a Protestant clergyman, the bride's father complained to the government in Buenos Aires, since in accordance with the ruling at that time, marriages could only be effected by the Catholic Church. Enraged by these proceedings Mr. Lafone, eventually decided to leave Buenos Aires, and come to settle in Uruguay, where he became a very successful businessman. He started salting meat, in the Cerro, expanded to producing jerked beef, and went into other enterprises with great success. In this time of business he was at one time in partnership with the Governor of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre Rios]], [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]], who was running an establishment in Entre Rios of 950000 hectares. The brothers Lafone, together with Admiral S. Santorius in the year 1843 made a proposal to buy [[:es:Isla Gorriti|Isla Gorriti]] for 1500 pesos. The proposal was accepted, but when publications appeared of criticisms from other countries, growing stronger, the Uruguayan government canceled the concession, as the government under abnormal circumstances had made the same. Litigation eventually ended by awarding the three partners \u00a31000 each as compensation. That same year the brothers Lafone revived an enterprise of Francisco Aguilar (who had imported camels to be used in the sand dunes). They proposed the foundation on the peninsula of [[Punta del Este]] of a township of 120 squares. Two thirds to remain state property, and the remaining third to the Lafone brothers. The town council in [[Maldonado, Uruguay|Maldonado]] sought to have the purchase annulled. Eventually some settlement was reached. The Lafone brothers had the seal concession in Lobos Island for years. They also had a concession to farm in the [[Falkland Islands]], in fact there is a peninsula called [[Lafonia]], and were involved in many commercial enterprises that started arising in 1850. On the way to the Cerro, on calle C.M. Ramirez, there is a plaza, just before reaching the bridge, named Plaza Lafone, and a street nearby named Samuel Lafone. In this part of the town the Lafone brothers had the slaughterhouse, where they prepared the salted meat for export. Plot A 204.\n* Richard Lagemann. (1892\u20131899). Plot E 068\n* John Lawes.

Their comrades buried their bodies on the land on which they had fallen. Shortly afterwards on 3 February, the [[Battle of Montevideo (1807)|Battle of Montevideo]] took place.\n\nOn 24 October 1818 a Portuguese resident of the Cordon area of Montevideo,  Padre don Manuel Salinas took possession of a piece of \u201cunoccupied\u201d land situated in the centre of the city on the site of the present \u201cIntendencia\u201d, that was donated to him, during the occupation of Montevideo by the Portuguese Government, by the then Governor Lecor, Viscount of Laguna.\nOn 30 September 1825 Padre Salinas sold and transferred the land to a British resident, Mr. John Hall for the sum of $400.  On 14 April 1828 the British Consul in Montevideo, Mr Thomas Hood<ref>[[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Uruguay#Early diplomats.2F List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Uruguay.23Early diplomats]]</ref> bought the land from John Hall in the name of the British government, and it is from this date that the British Cemetery became more formally recognised.\n\nThis cemetery initially was a [[Protestant]] Cemetery according to the first entrance books, that being the main reason why so many Germans were buried in the original cemetery. In 1835 a German citizen by the name of Enrique Jakobsen died in San Jose, and was denied burial there on account of being a [[freemason]] and a [[Heresy|heretic]]. His body was brought to Montevideo, and was also initially denied burial for the same reason. At that time all cemeteries were under the sole management and control of the [[Catholic Church]]. After his burial in the [[Central Cemetery of Montevideo|Cementerio Central]] which had been inaugurated earlier the same year the First Bishop of Montevideo, [[Jacinto Vera]] declared that no other burial could take place in that Cemetery until the body was removed. Because of this the Government stepped in, and on 10 October 1835 passed a decree whereby all cemeteries in this country would come under the direct influence of the Jefatura de Policia. Subsequent to this decree, years later, by Government decree of 28 June 1858 the administration of all cemeteries of this country was conferred on the Juntas Economicas Administrativas who depended directly from the Municipios.  On 3 October 1837 the title deeds were issued to Mr. Hood with the provision that the land should be used exclusively for the burial of British subjects. Within a context of religious intolerance the Uruguayan Government requested that Protestants of other nationalities should also be buried there, and as can be seen from the record books this has always been respected. The British Cemetery has no restrictions regarding religion or nationality.\n\nOn 1 January 1879 a decree was passed prohibiting burials within the Cemetery, with a few exceptions due to an outbreak of [[Yellow Fever]].  On 1 October 1884 the President of the Republic, General [[M\u00e1ximo Santos]], had a decree passed to finally close the Old Cemetery and the Government made a [[Compulsory Purchase]] of the land. Anticipating this possibility, in August 1878 a piece of land was bought next to the [[Buceo Cemetery]] (which had been inaugurated on 20 March 1872) for the purpose of opening a Cemetery in this new location.  In 1885 the gardens and paths were designed and constructed inside the walls of the New Cemetery, a house for the caretaker, offices, stables, a shed for the workers, and the Chapel. Any improvements or maintenance that has been done to these installations over the years has respected the original designs, and today all of these buildings still stand as fine examples of late 19th century architecture.  On 14 October a dedication ceremony was carried out in the newly constructed Chapel by the [[Waite Hockin Stirling|Right Reverend Waite Hockin Stirling]] who was the Lord Bishop of the [[Falkland Islands]].\n\nIn 1888 the railings and a water well were constructed.  The first Burial in the New British Cemetery was that of a German citizen by the name of Nicolas Laukant on 9 April 1885. Cristian Schenzer, who was the caretaker of the Cemetery at the time, was contracted to carry out the onerous task of transferring the remains of bodies interred in the old cemetery and their corresponding monuments to the new site. This was done between 13 October 1887 and 4 February 1888.<ref>Diario \"El Plata\", published Montevideo, 05/03/1934, page 7</ref>\n\nIn the year 1897 the British Community decided to build a community hall and as a way of commemorating her [[Diamond Jubilee]] it was named after [[Queen Victoria]]. The Victoria Hall Society was formed, and after obtaining a loan from the British Cemetery Society, a very suitable piece of land in calle Rio Negro was purchased, where the building was finally erected. The drive for funds for its construction was very small, and payments had to be made during the construction of the building, so that continuous loans had to be granted by the Cemetery Society, until such time as the building was finished. The so-called Victoria Hall Society could not even meet the payment of interest on the total loan, so finally an agreement was reached whereby the property was transferred to the British Cemetery Society. In this building, with a private entrance, the Acacia Lodge Temple was constructed, and the Acacia Lodge obtained a loan from the British Cemetery Society to import from the United Kingdom the furniture required for the [[Masonic Temple]]. When all the public utility companies, such as railways, waterworks, tramways etc. passed into the hands of the Government, the general idea was that there would no longer be any British Community. No use was made of the Victoria Hall; it was partly kept by the rent obtained from leasing it for weekend dances and theatre. Expenses, management, repairs, taxes etc. had to be paid by the British Cemetery Society with yearly losses, and as finally the community was no longer using the hall, decision was taken to sell it.\n\nUpon the death of Queen Victoria, on 22 January 1901, the British Community in Uruguay decided to raise funds to build a monument in her honour. F. Pozer & Company constructed an [[obelisk]] with grey granite from the hills near Minas, 8 metres high, with the inscription \"Victoria, Queen and Mother of her People\". The monument was inaugurated at 3pm on Sunday 10 August 1902. The ceremony was led by the Walter Baring \u2013 British Minister & Consul General at Montevideo,<ref>[[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Uruguay#Early diplomats.2F List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Uruguay.23Early diplomats]]</ref> Reverend Basil Cobbett and the President of the British Society W. Galway accompanied by 6 sailors from HMS Basilisk. The monument still stands in its original position within the entrance to the Cemetery.<ref>The Montevideo Times, 8 August 1902</ref>\n\nAt a meeting of the British Cemeteries Society held on 13 February 1908, Mr J.J. Hore then Honorary Treasurer of the Society brought forward a scheme for the establishing of a [[The British Schools of Montevideo|British School]] in Montevideo, for those children whose parents could not afford to send them for their education abroad. The proposal was eventually carried through, and the then Rector of the Anglican Church, Rev. Alpass, who had educational experience, was instructed that whilst in England he should obtain the services of a headmaster and teacher for the projected school. He was also instructed to purchase the required furniture and books for the school. Apart from paying Assisted Education for various children once the School was installed in calle Salsipuedes (now Blanes), the British Cemetery Society made the School a grant of $5,000 for a period of three years, and that it should be continued until such time that the school could pay its own way. When the School moved from calle Blanes to 18 de Julio continued assistance was granted. From there the British School decided to build their own property, and in this respect purchased land in [[Pocitos]],  where the School was built. [[Edward VIII|Edward, the Prince of Wales]] laid the Foundation Stone in 1925. The Cemetery Society guaranteed and paid all the mortgage interest on the property built in Jose B. Lamas, on the condition that on the Board of the British Schools Society there should always be two members of the British Cemetery Society until such time as the final payment of the mortgage on the property had been made.\n\nDuring 1910 the [[British Hospital (Montevideo)|British Hospital]] decided to vacate their old premises on the street [[Juan Lindolfo Cuestas]], and build a new hospital in Avenida Aldea (now Avenida Italia), where it stands today, and known as the [[Edward VII]] Hospital. The total investment for the construction was $60000, and it was made out in debentures. The British Cemetery Society had to guarantee the 6% interest on these debentures. As the British Community could not meet the total $60000, the British Cemetery Society had to absorb one third. Also, some years later, when the extension to the [[Edward VII]] Hospital was made, of what were called the new wings, the British Cemetery Society granted a further loan, which covered 40% of this construction at a low interest rate.\n\nIn the year 1945 when practically all the British public utility works were sold to the Uruguayan Government the then Presidents of the various British Societies together with their committees decided to sell out, as they thought that it could be the end of a British Community in this country. Consequently, the Victoria Hall, the Old English Club and [[Montevideo Cricket Club]] sold out.\n\nIn accordance with the statutes of the Society, at the end of every financial year, if there is a profit in the running of the Society the same is disbursed amongst medical entities.\n\n== Types of crosses ==\nDistinct styles of monuments are to be found within the Cemetery, reflecting the wide variety of nationalities and religious groups which are represented.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:G 261.jpg|Latin Cross\nFile:E 051.jpg|Latin Cross, with lilies\nFile:SC 178.jpg|Stepped Cross, with Anchor\nFile:G 113.jpg|Crucifix\nFile:A 038.jpg|Celtic Cross\nFile:\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e.jpg|Russian Orthodox cross\nFile:G 292.jpg|Bottonee Cross\nFile:WW 039b.jpg\nFile:EW 294.jpg|Wooden Cross\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable burials==\n\n===[[British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors|Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen]]===\n\nThe British Cemetery contains the graves of quite a number of soldiers, sailors and airmen of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent.

He was known as \u201cel ingles de los eucalyptus\u201d. He had asked his friend Jorge Hodskin to bring him from a botanical garden seeds of a tree that was big and shady. The same was catalogued as \u201cEucalyptus soleudus\u201d. In his property in Paso de Arena, he planted these seeds, and they developed trees that have become the most useful and commercial tree in the country. Seeds and plants were taken over to the Argentine, and in that vast pampas where there were almost no trees, they flourished, and soon there were [[eucalyptus]] plantations all over the country. In Uruguay it is exactly the same, big plantations of eucalyptus to give protection and shade to the cattle on the [[estancia]]s. Another important function, is that 90% of all the estancia fencing in Uruguay, is made of timber derived from eucalyptus. Today eucalyptus trunks are being exported to Europe. In an article written by Uruguayan historian Juan Carlos Pedemonte he refers to an achievement of Mr. Tomkinson and other Britishers. They formed a Society for Horse racing in the European style, (most probably jumping and hurdles), in 1861. The racetrack was in Punta Carretas, near to the actual Golf Club, and the track was along Julia Maria Sosa (today) to calle Ellauri. In Bulevar Artigas and Garcia Cortinas they built a grandstand, which years later in 1889 was transferred to Maro\u00f1as, when the Britishers discontinued with this racetrack. In the Punta Carretas track a special race took place on 3 April 1861, named \u2018Premio Nacional\u2019, and was won by \u2018Pegaso\u2019, property of Sr. Buxareo, the prize was donated by [[Bernardo Berro|The President, Bernardo Berro]]. Together with other Britishers they started steeplechase in Pueblo Itazaingo, near Moro\u00f1as. In that neighbourhood they had monthly horse racing meetings with the [[Criollo (horse)|criollo horses]]. When Thomas Tomkinson imported thoroughbred racing horses, in a short period of time great changes came about at the horse-racing track. Together with Samuel Lafone he was one of the founders of the Banco Commercial in 1857. In the outskirts of Montevideo he developed a beautiful park, where he spent weekends. This park today is known as Parque Tomkinson, and the road that passes through this park is known as Camino Tomkinson. Plot B 003\n* John J Vander Weyde. (1840\u20131878).

In the year 1843, through the sole effort of [[:es:Samuel Lafone|Samuel Lafone]], the foundation of the [[Cathedral of The Most Holy Trinity, Montevideo|Holy Trinity Church]]<ref>[http://www.niagara.anglican.ca/outreach/docs/Anglican%20Church%20of%20Uruguay%20-%20Diocesan%20Profile.pdf Holy Trinity Church]</ref> was laid. Samuel Lafone exclusively made the finance of this church. This gentleman came over from Buenos Aires, where he underwent serious problems when he married Maria Quevedo Alsina. The wedding ceremony had been performed by a Protestant clergyman, the bride's father complained to the government in Buenos Aires, since in accordance with the ruling at that time, marriages could only be effected by the Catholic Church. Enraged by these proceedings Mr. Lafone, eventually decided to leave Buenos Aires, and come to settle in Uruguay, where he became a very successful businessman. He started salting meat, in the Cerro, expanded to producing jerked beef, and went into other enterprises with great success. In this time of business he was at one time in partnership with the Governor of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre Rios]], [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]], who was running an establishment in Entre Rios of 950000 hectares. The brothers Lafone, together with Admiral S. Santorius in the year 1843 made a proposal to buy [[:es:Isla Gorriti|Isla Gorriti]] for 1500 pesos. The proposal was accepted, but when publications appeared of criticisms from other countries, growing stronger, the Uruguayan government canceled the concession, as the government under abnormal circumstances had made the same. Litigation eventually ended by awarding the three partners \u00a31000 each as compensation. That same year the brothers Lafone revived an enterprise of Francisco Aguilar (who had imported camels to be used in the sand dunes). They proposed the foundation on the peninsula of [[Punta del Este]] of a township of 120 squares. Two thirds to remain state property, and the remaining third to the Lafone brothers. The town council in [[Maldonado, Uruguay|Maldonado]] sought to have the purchase annulled. Eventually some settlement was reached. The Lafone brothers had the seal concession in Lobos Island for years. They also had a concession to farm in the [[Falkland Islands]], in fact there is a peninsula called [[Lafonia]], and were involved in many commercial enterprises that started arising in 1850. On the way to the Cerro, on calle C.M. Ramirez, there is a plaza, just before reaching the bridge, named Plaza Lafone, and a street nearby named Samuel Lafone. In this part of the town the Lafone brothers had the slaughterhouse, where they prepared the salted meat for export. Plot A 204.\n* Richard Lagemann. (1892\u20131899). Plot E 068\n* John Lawes.

Teeth are made of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness.\n\nHumans, like other mammals, are [[diphyodont]], meaning that they develop two sets of teeth. The first set (called the \"baby\", \"milk\", \"primary\", or \"[[deciduous teeth|deciduous]]\" set) normally starts to appear at about six months of age, although some babies are born with one or more visible teeth, known as [[neonatal teeth|natal teeth]]. Normal [[tooth eruption]] at about six months is known as [[teething]] and can be painful.\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:3D Medical Animation Still Showing Types of Teeth.jpg|thumb|350px|right|There are four main types of teeth in humans, shown labelled here.]]\n{{Main|Dental anatomy}}\n[[Dental anatomy]] is a field of [[anatomy]] dedicated to the study of tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though [[occlusion (dentistry)|dental occlusion]], or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.\n\nThe anatomic [[crown (tooth)|crown]] of a tooth is the area covered in enamel above the [[cementoenamel junction]] (CEJ) or \"neck\" of the tooth.<ref>{{cite book | last = Clemente | first = Carmine | title = Anatomy, a regional atlas of the human body | publisher = Urban & Schwarzenberg | location = Baltimore | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-8067-0323-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/anatomyregionala00clem }}</ref><ref name=\"ash6\">{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=6}}</ref> Most of the crown is composed of [[dentin]] (\"dentine\" in British English) with the pulp chamber inside.<ref name=\"Cate3\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=3}}</ref> The crown is within bone before [[tooth eruption|eruption]].<ref name=\"ash9\">{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=9}}</ref> After eruption, it is almost always visible. The anatomic root is found below the CEJ and is covered with [[cementum]]. As with the crown, dentin composes most of the root, which normally has [[root canal|pulp canals]]. Canines and most premolars, except for [[maxillary (disambiguation)|maxillary]] first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and [[mandible|mandibular]] molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. Additional roots are referred to as [[supernumerary roots]].\n\nHumans usually have 20 primary (deciduous, \"baby\" or \"milk\") teeth and 32 permanent (adult) teeth. Teeth are classified as [[incisor]]s, [[Canine tooth|canines]], [[premolar]]s (also called ''bicuspids''), and [[Molar (tooth)|molars]]. Incisors are primarily used for cutting, canines are for tearing, and molars serve for grinding.\n\nMost teeth have identifiable features that distinguish them from others. There are several different [[Dental notation|notation systems]] to refer to a specific tooth. The three most common systems are the [[FDI World Dental Federation notation]], the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal numbering system]], and [[Palmer Notation Method|Palmer notation method]]. The FDI system is used worldwide, and the universal is used widely in the United States.\n\n===Primary teeth===\nAmong [[Deciduous teeth|deciduous (primary) teeth]], ten are found in the maxilla (upper jaw) and ten in the mandible (lower jaw), for a total of 20. The [[Dentition#Dental formula|dental formula]] for primary teeth in humans is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.0.2|lower=2.1.0.2}}.\n\nIn the primary set of teeth, there are two types of incisors \u2013 centrals and laterals\u2014 and two types of molars \u2013 first and second. All primary teeth are normally later replaced with their permanent counterparts.\n\n===Permanent teeth===\n[[File:Universal Numbering System.svg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Universal Numbering System]] for adult human teeth. The view is from a dental practitioner's perspective, meaning tooth 1 is the upper right rear (third) molar.]]\nAmong [[permanent teeth]], 16 are found in the maxilla and 16 in the mandible, for a total of 32. The dental formula is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.2.3|lower=2.1.2.3}}.\n\nThe maxillary teeth are the [[maxillary central incisor]]s (teeth 8 and 9 in the diagram), [[maxillary lateral incisor]]s (7 and 10), [[maxillary canine]]s (6 and 11), [[maxillary first premolar]]s (5 and 12), [[maxillary second premolar]]s (4 and 13), [[maxillary first molar]]s (3 and 14), [[maxillary second molar]]s (2 and 15), and [[maxillary third molar]]s (1 and 16). The mandibular teeth are the [[mandibular central incisor]]s (24 and 25), [[mandibular lateral incisor]]s (23 and 26), [[mandibular canine]]s (22 and 27), [[mandibular first premolar]]s (21 and 28), [[mandibular second premolar]]s (20 and 29), [[mandibular first molar]]s (19 and 30), [[mandibular second molar]]s (18 and 31), and [[mandibular third molar]]s (17 and 32). Third molars are commonly called \"[[wisdom teeth]]\" and may never erupt into the mouth or form at all. When they do form, they often must be [[Dental extraction|removed]]. If any additional teeth form\u2014for example, fourth and fifth molars, which are rare\u2014they are referred to as [[Hyperdontia|supernumerary teeth]] (hyperdontia).{{cn|date=March 2020}} Development of fewer than the usual number of teeth is called [[hypodontia]].\n\nThere are small differences between the teeth of males and females, with male teeth along with the male jaw tending to be larger on average than female teeth and jaw. There are also differences in the internal dental tissue proportions, with male teeth consisting of proportionately more dentine while female teeth have proportionately more enamel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sorenti|first=Mark|last2=Martin\u00f3n\u2010Torres|first2=Mar\u00eda|last3=Mart\u00edn\u2010Franc\u00e9s|first3=Laura|last4=Perea\u2010P\u00e9rez|first4=Bernardo|title=Sexual dimorphism of dental tissues in modern human mandibular molars|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=0|issue=2|pages=332\u2013340|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23822|pmid=30866041|issn=1096-8644|year=2019}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Human tooth diagram-en.svg|480px|thumb]]\n\n===Enamel===\n{{Main|Tooth enamel}}\n\nEnamel is the hardest and most highly [[mineralized tissues|mineralized substance]] of the body. It has its origin from oral ectoderm. It is one of the four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with [[dentin]], [[cementum]], and [[dental pulp]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=441}}</ref> It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=1}}</ref> The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]], up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ.<ref name=\"Cate, A.

It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp.<ref name = \"ross448\"/> The formation of dentin is known as [[dentinogenesis]]. The porous, yellow-hued material is made up of 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight.<ref name = \"Cate150\"/> Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.\n\nDentin is a mineralized [[connective tissue]] with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border.<ref name=\"ross450\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=450}}</ref> The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 \u03bcm near the pulp, to 1.2 \u03bcm in the midportion, and 900&nbsp;nm near the dentino-enamel junction.<ref name=\"Cate152\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=152}}</ref> Although they may have tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other.

Cementum is excreted by [[cementoblast]]s within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the [[periodontal ligament]]s can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cement to enamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least \u2154 of the root.<ref name=\"Cate236\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=236}}</ref> The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about \u2153 of the root apex.<ref name=\"Cate241\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=241}}</ref>\n\n===Dental pulp ===\n{{Main|Pulp (tooth)}}\nThe dental pulp is the central part of the tooth filled with soft connective tissue.<ref name = \"Cate150\"/> This tissue contains blood vessels and nerves that enter the tooth from a hole at the apex of the root.<ref name=\"Ross451\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=451}}</ref> Along the border between the dentin and the pulp are odontoblasts, which initiate the formation of dentin.<ref name=\"Cate150\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=150}}</ref> Other cells in the pulp include fibroblasts, preodontoblasts, [[macrophage]]s and [[T cells|T lymphocytes]].<ref name=\"Walton11thru13\">Walton, Richard E. and Mahmoud Torabinejad.

Although many diverse [[species]] have teeth, their development is largely the same as in humans. For [[human]] teeth to have a healthy [[Human mouth|oral]] environment, [[tooth enamel|enamel]], [[dentin]], [[cementum]], and the [[periodontium]] must all develop during appropriate stages of [[fetal development]]. [[Deciduous teeth|Primary teeth]] start to form in [[human embryogenesis|the development of the embryo]] between the sixth and eighth weeks, and [[permanent teeth]] begin to form in the twentieth week.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=95}}</ref> If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.\n\nA significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first [[pharyngeal arch]] that is necessary for the development of teeth.<ref name = \"cate81\"/>\n\nTooth development is commonly divided into the following stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth development is an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth.<ref name=\"cate81\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=81}}</ref> This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.\n\nThe [[tooth bud]] (sometimes called the tooth germ) is an aggregation of [[cell (biology)|cells]] that eventually forms a tooth. It is organized into three parts: the [[enamel organ]], the [[dental papilla]] and the [[dental follicle]].<ref name = \"utmb\"/> The ''enamel organ'' is composed of the [[outer enamel epithelium]], [[inner enamel epithelium]], [[stellate reticulum]] and [[stratum intermedium]].<ref name = \"utmb\"/> These cells give rise to [[ameloblast]]s, which produce enamel and the [[reduced enamel epithelium]]. The growth of [[cervical loop]] cells into the deeper tissues forms [[Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath]], which determines a tooth's root shape. The ''dental papilla'' contains cells that develop into [[odontoblast]]s, which are dentin-forming cells.<ref name=\"utmb\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070203050136/http://cellbio.utmb.edu/microanatomy/digestive/tooth.htm Lab Exercises: Tooth development].

Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the [[Alveolar process of maxilla|alveolar bone]] around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the [[periodontal ligament]]s which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through cementum.<ref name = \"ross453\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=453}}</ref>\n\n=== Eruption ===\n{{Main|Tooth eruption}}\n\n[[File:ToothLost-2917.jpg|thumb|right|Bottom teeth of a seven-year-old, showing primary teeth ''(left)'', a lost primary tooth ''(middle)'', and a permanent tooth ''(right)'']]\nTooth eruption in humans is a process in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments play an important role in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.\n\nThere have been many theories about the cause of tooth eruption. One theory proposes that the developing root of a tooth pushes it into the mouth. Another, known as the cushioned hammock theory, resulted from microscopic study of teeth, which was thought to show a [[ligament]] around the root. It was later discovered that the \"ligament\" was merely an [[Artifact (observational)|artifact]] created in the process of preparing the slide. Currently, the most widely held belief is that the periodontal ligaments provide the main impetus for the process.\n\nThe onset of primary tooth loss has been found to correlate strongly with somatic and psychological criteria of school readiness.<ref>Kranich, Ernst-Michael (1990) \"Anthropologie\", in F.

Of these, cementum is the only one that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an [[Dental alveolus|alveolus]], or \"socket\". Lying over the bone is the [[gingiva]] or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.\n\n===Periodontal ligaments===\nThe [[periodontal ligament]] is a specialized [[connective tissue]] that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers the root of the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15\u20130.38mm, but this size decreases over time.<ref name=\"Cate256\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=256}}</ref> The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and [[Bone resorption|resorption]] of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption.<ref name = \"ross453\"/> The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and [[epithelial cell rests of Malassez]].<ref name=\"Cate260\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=260}}</ref> Consisting of mostly Type I and III [[collagen]], the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location.

An area of bone receiving [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has a high number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.\n\n===Gingiva===\nThe [[gingiva]] (\"gums\") is the [[mucous membranes|mucosal]] tissue that overlays the jaws. There are three different types of epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium.

Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to [[dental restoration|restore]] teeth to proper form, function, and [[aesthetics]], but there is no known method to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular [[oral hygiene]] and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.<ref name = \"adaoralhealth\"/>\n\n==Tooth care==\n===Oral hygiene===\n[[File:Toothbrush 20050716 004.jpg|right|thumb|[[Toothbrush]]es are commonly used to help clean teeth.]]\n{{Main|Oral hygiene}}\n\nOral hygiene is the practice of keeping the mouth clean and is a means of preventing dental caries, [[gingivitis]], [[periodontal disease]], [[halitosis|bad breath]], and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful [[tooth brushing|brushing]] and [[Dental Floss|flossing]]. Professional cleaning includes [[tooth scaling]], using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.\n\nThe purpose of cleaning teeth is to remove plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria.<ref>[http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html Introduction to Dental Plaque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827094040/http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html |date=2011-08-27 }}. Leeds Dental Institute.</ref> Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) in order to prevent formation of plaque and tartar.<ref name=\"adaoralhealth\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222223237/http://www.ada.org/public/topics/cleaning.asp Oral Health Topics: Cleaning your teeth and gums]. American Dental Association.</ref> A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the [[gum line]], where [[periodontal disease]] often begins and could develop caries.\n\nElectric toothbrushes are a popular aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, and with good motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: \"Electric toothbrushes tend to help people who are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems.\" <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2679175.stm Thumbs down for electric toothbrush], BBC News, January 21, 2003.</ref> The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with [[rheumatoid arthritis]].\n\n===Protective treatments===\n[[Fluoride therapy]] is often recommended to protect against dental caries. [[Water fluoridation]] and [[fluoride]] supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=223}}</ref> The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay.<ref name = \"ross453\"/> Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride [[toothpaste]] or [[mouthwash]], is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.\n\n[[Dental sealant]]s are another preventive therapy often used to provide a barrier to bacteria and decay on the surface of teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in a procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.\n\n==Restorations==\n[[File:dent,tooth,zub.jpg|right|thumb|A restored premolar]]\nAfter a tooth has been damaged or destroyed, [[Dental restoration|restoration]] of the missing structure can be achieved with a variety of treatments. Restorations may be created from a variety of [[Dental restorative materials|materials]], including [[Glass ionomer cement|glass ionomer]], [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[gold]], [[Dental porcelain|porcelain]], and [[Dental composite|composite]].<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090830062420/http://www.ada.org/public/topics/fillings.asp Oral Health Topics: Dental Filling Options]\". ada.org.</ref> Small restorations placed inside a tooth are referred to as \"intracoronal restorations\". These restorations may be formed directly in the mouth or may be cast using the [[lost-wax casting|lost-wax technique]], such as for some [[inlays and onlays]]. When larger portions of a tooth are lost, an \"extracoronal restoration\" may be fabricated, such as an [[crown (dentistry)|artificial crown]] or a [[veneer (dentistry)|veneer]], to restore the involved tooth.\n\nWhen a tooth is lost, [[dentures]], [[Bridge (dentistry)|bridges]], or [[dental implant|implants]] may be used as replacements.<ref name=\"acp\">\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20120615170730/http://www.prosthodontics.org/patients/procedures.asp Prosthodontic Procedures]\", The American College of Prosthodontists.</ref> Dentures are usually the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a [[removable partial denture|partial]] number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants may be used as support.<ref name=\"aaomsimplants\">\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925181506/http://www.aaoms.org/dental_implants.php Dental Implants]\", American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.</ref>\n\n==Abnormalities==\n[[File:Fracturedtooth.jpg|thumb|A broken upper front tooth showing the pink of the pulp]]\nTooth abnormalities may be categorized according to whether they have environmental or developmental causes.<ref name=\"neville50\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=50.}}</ref> While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may not appear to be any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.\n\n===Environmental===\n\n==== Alteration during tooth development ====\nTooth abnormalities caused by environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. [[Enamel hypoplasia]] is a condition in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate.<ref>{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=31}}</ref> This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency than the rest of the tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors,<ref name=KanchanMachado2015>{{cite journal|vauthors= Kanchan T, Machado M, Rao A, Krishan K, Garg AK|title=Enamel hypoplasia and its role in identification of individuals: A review of literature|date=Apr 2015|journal=Indian J Dent|volume=6|issue=2|pages=99\u2013102|doi=10.4103/0975-962X.155887|pmid=26097340|pmc=4455163|type=Revisi\u00f3n}}</ref> an [[exanthem]]atous disease ([[chicken pox]], [[congenital syphilis]]),<ref name=KanchanMachado2015 /><ref name=\"neville51\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page= 51}}</ref> undiagnosed and untreated [[coeliac disease|celiac disease]],<ref name=NIH>[http://celiac.nih.gov/PDF/Dental_Enamel_Defects_508.pdf Dental Enamel Defects and Celiac Disease] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305124250/http://celiac.nih.gov/PDF/Dental_Enamel_Defects_508.pdf |date=2016-03-05 }} National Institute of Health (NIH)</ref><ref name=FerrazCampos2012>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ferraz EG, Campos Ede J, Sarmento VA, Silva LR|title=The oral manifestations of celiac disease: information for the pediatric dentist|date=2012|journal=Pediatr Dent|volume=34|issue=7|pages=485\u20138|pmid=23265166|type=Review}}</ref><ref name=GiucaCei2010>{{cite journal|vauthors=Giuca MR, Cei G, Gigli F, Gandini P|title=Oral signs in the diagnosis of celiac disease: review of the literature|date=2010|journal=Minerva Stomatol|volume=59|issue=1\u20132|pages=33\u201343|pmid=20212408|type=Review}}</ref> [[hypocalcaemia|hypocalcemia]], [[dental fluorosis]], [[birth injury]], [[preterm birth]], [[infection]] or trauma from a [[deciduous teeth|deciduous tooth]].<ref name=KanchanMachado2015 /> Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of [[fluoride]] and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted.

Hypoplasia may also result from [[antineoplastic]] therapy.\n\n====Destruction after development====\nTooth destruction from processes other than [[dental caries]] is considered a normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. [[Attrition (dental)|Attrition]] is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth.<ref>\"[http://www.adha.org/CE_courses/course9/loss_of_structure.htm Loss of Tooth Structure]\", American Dental Hygiene Association.</ref> Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. [[Abrasion (dental)|Abrasion]] is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801114913/http://dentistry.umkc.edu/practition/assets/AbnormalitiesofTeeth.pdf Abnormalities of Teeth]\", University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry.</ref> If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. [[Erosion (dental)|Erosion]] is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.agd.org/library/2003/aug/200308_yip.pdf |pmid=15055615 |year=2003 |last1=Yip |first1=KH |last2=Smales |first2=RJ |last3=Kaidonis |first3=JA |title=The diagnosis and control of extrinsic acid erosion of tooth substance |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=350\u20133; quiz 354 |journal=General Dentistry |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907094153/http://www.agd.org/library/2003/aug/200308_yip.pdf |archivedate=September 7, 2006 }}</ref> Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with [[bulimia]] since [[vomiting]] results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of [[lemon juice]]. [[Abfraction]] is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under [[pressure]], the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]], causes [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] on one side of the tooth and [[compression (physical)|compression]] on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as [[internal resorption]], when caused by cells within the pulp, or [[external resorption]], when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.\n\n====Discoloration====\n{{Main|Tooth discoloration}}\n[[File:Tired teeth.jpg|thumb|Discolored teeth]]\nDiscoloration of teeth may result from bacteria stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods with an abundance of [[chlorophyll]], restorative materials, and medications.<ref name=\"neville63\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page= 63}}</ref> Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of [[chlorhexidine]], a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. [[Congenital erythropoietic porphyria]] causes [[porphyrin]]s to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with [[alkaptonuria]] and rarely with [[Parkinson's disease]]. [[Erythroblastosis fetalis]] and [[biliary atresia]] are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of [[biliverdin]]. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with [[leprosy|lepromatous leprosy]]. Some medications, such as [[tetracycline]] antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.\n\n====Alteration of eruption====\nTooth eruption may be altered by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth is said to be [[Wisdom teeth#Impaction|impacted]]. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth.<ref name=\"neville66\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=66}}</ref> Other causes may be [[tumor]]s, [[cyst]]s, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. [[Tooth ankylosis]] occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.\n\nA technique for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by [[orthodontist]]s who wish to delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches \u2153 of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the roots of the permanent tooth are more than \u2154 complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between \u2153 and \u2154, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.\n\n===Developmental===\n\n==== Abnormality in number ====\n* [[Anodontia]] is the total lack of tooth development.\n* [[Hyperdontia]] is the presence of a higher-than-normal number of teeth.\n* [[Hypodontia]] is the lack of development of one or more teeth.\n** Oligodontia may be used to describe the absence of 6 or more teeth.\nSome systemic disorders which may result in hyperdontia include [[Apert syndrome]], [[cleidocranial dysostosis]], [[Crouzon syndrome]], [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]], [[Gardner's syndrome]], and [[Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome]].<ref name=\"neville70\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=70}}</ref> Some systemic disorders which may result in hypodontia include Crouzon syndrome, [[Ectodermal dysplasia]], Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, and [[Gorlin syndrome]].<ref name=\"neville69\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=69}}</ref>\n\n====Abnormality in size====\n* [[Microdontia]] is a condition where teeth are smaller than the usual size.\n* [[Macrodontia (tooth)|Macrodontia]] is where teeth are larger than the usual size.\n\nMicrodontia of a single tooth is more likely to occur in a [[maxillary lateral incisor]]. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are [[wisdom teeth|third molars]]. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in [[Gigantism|pituitary gigantism]] and [[Pineal gland|pineal]] [[hyperplasia]]. It may also occur on one side of the face in cases of [[hemifacial hyperplasia]].\n\n====Abnormality in shape====\n[[File:Milk.teeth.fusion.jpg|thumb|The fusion of two deciduous teeth]]\n* [[Tooth Gemination|Gemination]] occurs when a developing tooth incompletely splits into the formation of two teeth.\n* [[Tooth fusion|Fusion]] is the union of two adjacent teeth during development.\n* [[Concrescence]] is the fusion of two separate teeth only in their cementum.\n* Accessory [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusps]] are additional cusps on a tooth and may manifest as a [[Talon cusp]], [[Cusp of Carabelli]], or [[Dens evaginatus]].\n* [[Dens invaginatus]], also called Dens in dente, is a deep invagination in a tooth causing the appearance of a tooth within a tooth.\n* [[Ectopic enamel]] is enamel found in an unusual location, such as the root of a tooth.\n* [[Taurodontism]] is a condition where the body of the tooth and pulp chamber is enlarged, and is associated with [[Klinefelter syndrome]], [[Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome]], [[Triple X syndrome]], and [[XYY syndrome]].<ref name = \"neville85\"/>\n* [[Hypercementosis]] is excessive formation of cementum, which may result from trauma, inflammation, [[acromegaly]], [[rheumatic fever]], and [[Paget's disease of bone]].<ref name=\"neville85\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=85}}</ref>\n* A [[dilaceration]] is a bend in the root which may have been caused by trauma to the tooth during formation.\n* [[Supernumerary roots]] is the presence of a greater number of roots on a tooth than expected\n\n==== Cleft lip and palate and association with dental anomalies ====\nThere are many types of dental anomalies seen in cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients. Both sets of dentition may be affected however they are commonly seen in the affected side. Most frequently, missing teeth, supernumerary or discoloured teeth can be seen however enamel dysplasia, discolouration and delayed root development is also common. In children with cleft lip and palate, the lateral incisor in the alveolar cleft region has the highest prevalence of dental developmental disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Tortora C, Meazzini MC, Garattini G, Brusati R|date=March 2008|title=Prevalence of abnormalities in dental structure, position and eruption pattern in population of unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate patients|pmid=18333651|doi=10.1597/06-218.1|journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal|volume=45|issue=2|pages=154\u2013162}}</ref> This is important to consider in order to correctly plan treatment keeping in mind considerations for function and aesthetics.

It is essential to assess the patient both clinically and radiographically in order to correctly treat and prevent progression of any dental problems. It is also useful to note that patients with a cleft lip and palate automatically score a 5 on the IOTN ( index for orthodontic need) and therefore are eligible for orthodontic treatment, liaising with an orthodontist is vital in order coordinate and plan treatment successfully.\n\n====Abnormality in structure====\n* [[Amelogenesis imperfecta]] is a condition in which enamel does not form properly or at all.<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=amelogenesisimperfecta Amelogenesis imperfecta], Genetics Home Reference, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.</ref>\n* [[Dentinogenesis imperfecta]] is a condition in which dentin does not form properly and is sometimes associated with [[osteogenesis imperfecta]].<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=dentinogenesisimperfecta Dentinogenesis imperfecta], Genetics Home Reference, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.</ref>\n* [[Dentin dysplasia]] is a disorder in which the roots and pulp of teeth may be affected.\n* [[Regional odontodysplasia]] is a disorder affecting enamel, dentin, and pulp and causes the teeth to appear \"ghostly\" on radiographs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cho, Shiu-yin|url=http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-72/issue-8/vol72_issue8.pdf |title=Conservative Management of Regional Odontodysplasia: Case Report|volume=72|issue =8|pages=735\u20138|pmid=17049109|year=2006|journal=J Can Dent Assoc}}</ref>\n* [[Diastema]] is a condition in which there is a gap between two teeth caused by the imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of teeth.<ref>''ASDC Journal of Dentistry for Children, Volume 48''.

Humans have four types of [[tooth|teeth]]: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, which each have a specific function. The incisors cut the food, the canines tear the food and the molars and premolars crush the food.  The roots of teeth are embedded in the [[maxilla]] (upper jaw) or the [[Human mandible|mandible]] (lower jaw) and are covered by [[gums]]. Teeth are made of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness.\n\nHumans, like other mammals, are [[diphyodont]], meaning that they develop two sets of teeth. The first set (called the \"baby\", \"milk\", \"primary\", or \"[[deciduous teeth|deciduous]]\" set) normally starts to appear at about six months of age, although some babies are born with one or more visible teeth, known as [[neonatal teeth|natal teeth]]. Normal [[tooth eruption]] at about six months is known as [[teething]] and can be painful.\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:3D Medical Animation Still Showing Types of Teeth.jpg|thumb|350px|right|There are four main types of teeth in humans, shown labelled here.]]\n{{Main|Dental anatomy}}\n[[Dental anatomy]] is a field of [[anatomy]] dedicated to the study of tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though [[occlusion (dentistry)|dental occlusion]], or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.\n\nThe anatomic [[crown (tooth)|crown]] of a tooth is the area covered in enamel above the [[cementoenamel junction]] (CEJ) or \"neck\" of the tooth.<ref>{{cite book | last = Clemente | first = Carmine | title = Anatomy, a regional atlas of the human body | publisher = Urban & Schwarzenberg | location = Baltimore | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-8067-0323-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/anatomyregionala00clem }}</ref><ref name=\"ash6\">{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=6}}</ref> Most of the crown is composed of [[dentin]] (\"dentine\" in British English) with the pulp chamber inside.<ref name=\"Cate3\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=3}}</ref> The crown is within bone before [[tooth eruption|eruption]].<ref name=\"ash9\">{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=9}}</ref> After eruption, it is almost always visible. The anatomic root is found below the CEJ and is covered with [[cementum]]. As with the crown, dentin composes most of the root, which normally has [[root canal|pulp canals]]. Canines and most premolars, except for [[maxillary (disambiguation)|maxillary]] first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and [[mandible|mandibular]] molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. Additional roots are referred to as [[supernumerary roots]].\n\nHumans usually have 20 primary (deciduous, \"baby\" or \"milk\") teeth and 32 permanent (adult) teeth. Teeth are classified as [[incisor]]s, [[Canine tooth|canines]], [[premolar]]s (also called ''bicuspids''), and [[Molar (tooth)|molars]]. Incisors are primarily used for cutting, canines are for tearing, and molars serve for grinding.\n\nMost teeth have identifiable features that distinguish them from others. There are several different [[Dental notation|notation systems]] to refer to a specific tooth. The three most common systems are the [[FDI World Dental Federation notation]], the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal numbering system]], and [[Palmer Notation Method|Palmer notation method]]. The FDI system is used worldwide, and the universal is used widely in the United States.\n\n===Primary teeth===\nAmong [[Deciduous teeth|deciduous (primary) teeth]], ten are found in the maxilla (upper jaw) and ten in the mandible (lower jaw), for a total of 20. The [[Dentition#Dental formula|dental formula]] for primary teeth in humans is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.0.2|lower=2.1.0.2}}.\n\nIn the primary set of teeth, there are two types of incisors \u2013 centrals and laterals\u2014 and two types of molars \u2013 first and second. All primary teeth are normally later replaced with their permanent counterparts.\n\n===Permanent teeth===\n[[File:Universal Numbering System.svg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Universal Numbering System]] for adult human teeth.

The dental formula is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.2.3|lower=2.1.2.3}}.\n\nThe maxillary teeth are the [[maxillary central incisor]]s (teeth 8 and 9 in the diagram), [[maxillary lateral incisor]]s (7 and 10), [[maxillary canine]]s (6 and 11), [[maxillary first premolar]]s (5 and 12), [[maxillary second premolar]]s (4 and 13), [[maxillary first molar]]s (3 and 14), [[maxillary second molar]]s (2 and 15), and [[maxillary third molar]]s (1 and 16). The mandibular teeth are the [[mandibular central incisor]]s (24 and 25), [[mandibular lateral incisor]]s (23 and 26), [[mandibular canine]]s (22 and 27), [[mandibular first premolar]]s (21 and 28), [[mandibular second premolar]]s (20 and 29), [[mandibular first molar]]s (19 and 30), [[mandibular second molar]]s (18 and 31), and [[mandibular third molar]]s (17 and 32). Third molars are commonly called \"[[wisdom teeth]]\" and may never erupt into the mouth or form at all. When they do form, they often must be [[Dental extraction|removed]]. If any additional teeth form\u2014for example, fourth and fifth molars, which are rare\u2014they are referred to as [[Hyperdontia|supernumerary teeth]] (hyperdontia).{{cn|date=March 2020}} Development of fewer than the usual number of teeth is called [[hypodontia]].\n\nThere are small differences between the teeth of males and females, with male teeth along with the male jaw tending to be larger on average than female teeth and jaw. There are also differences in the internal dental tissue proportions, with male teeth consisting of proportionately more dentine while female teeth have proportionately more enamel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sorenti|first=Mark|last2=Martin\u00f3n\u2010Torres|first2=Mar\u00eda|last3=Mart\u00edn\u2010Franc\u00e9s|first3=Laura|last4=Perea\u2010P\u00e9rez|first4=Bernardo|title=Sexual dimorphism of dental tissues in modern human mandibular molars|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=0|issue=2|pages=332\u2013340|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23822|pmid=30866041|issn=1096-8644|year=2019}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Human tooth diagram-en.svg|480px|thumb]]\n\n===Enamel===\n{{Main|Tooth enamel}}\n\nEnamel is the hardest and most highly [[mineralized tissues|mineralized substance]] of the body. It has its origin from oral ectoderm. It is one of the four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with [[dentin]], [[cementum]], and [[dental pulp]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=441}}</ref> It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=1}}</ref> The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]], up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ.<ref name=\"Cate, A.

It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp.<ref name = \"ross448\"/> The formation of dentin is known as [[dentinogenesis]]. The porous, yellow-hued material is made up of 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight.<ref name = \"Cate150\"/> Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.\n\nDentin is a mineralized [[connective tissue]] with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border.<ref name=\"ross450\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=450}}</ref> The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 \u03bcm near the pulp, to 1.2 \u03bcm in the midportion, and 900&nbsp;nm near the dentino-enamel junction.<ref name=\"Cate152\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=152}}</ref> Although they may have tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other.

Cementum is excreted by [[cementoblast]]s within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the [[periodontal ligament]]s can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cement to enamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least \u2154 of the root.<ref name=\"Cate236\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=236}}</ref> The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about \u2153 of the root apex.<ref name=\"Cate241\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=241}}</ref>\n\n===Dental pulp ===\n{{Main|Pulp (tooth)}}\nThe dental pulp is the central part of the tooth filled with soft connective tissue.<ref name = \"Cate150\"/> This tissue contains blood vessels and nerves that enter the tooth from a hole at the apex of the root.<ref name=\"Ross451\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=451}}</ref> Along the border between the dentin and the pulp are odontoblasts, which initiate the formation of dentin.<ref name=\"Cate150\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=150}}</ref> Other cells in the pulp include fibroblasts, preodontoblasts, [[macrophage]]s and [[T cells|T lymphocytes]].<ref name=\"Walton11thru13\">Walton, Richard E. and Mahmoud Torabinejad.

Although many diverse [[species]] have teeth, their development is largely the same as in humans. For [[human]] teeth to have a healthy [[Human mouth|oral]] environment, [[tooth enamel|enamel]], [[dentin]], [[cementum]], and the [[periodontium]] must all develop during appropriate stages of [[fetal development]]. [[Deciduous teeth|Primary teeth]] start to form in [[human embryogenesis|the development of the embryo]] between the sixth and eighth weeks, and [[permanent teeth]] begin to form in the twentieth week.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=95}}</ref> If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.\n\nA significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first [[pharyngeal arch]] that is necessary for the development of teeth.<ref name = \"cate81\"/>\n\nTooth development is commonly divided into the following stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth development is an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth.<ref name=\"cate81\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=81}}</ref> This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.\n\nThe [[tooth bud]] (sometimes called the tooth germ) is an aggregation of [[cell (biology)|cells]] that eventually forms a tooth. It is organized into three parts: the [[enamel organ]], the [[dental papilla]] and the [[dental follicle]].<ref name = \"utmb\"/> The ''enamel organ'' is composed of the [[outer enamel epithelium]], [[inner enamel epithelium]], [[stellate reticulum]] and [[stratum intermedium]].<ref name = \"utmb\"/> These cells give rise to [[ameloblast]]s, which produce enamel and the [[reduced enamel epithelium]]. The growth of [[cervical loop]] cells into the deeper tissues forms [[Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath]], which determines a tooth's root shape. The ''dental papilla'' contains cells that develop into [[odontoblast]]s, which are dentin-forming cells.<ref name=\"utmb\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070203050136/http://cellbio.utmb.edu/microanatomy/digestive/tooth.htm Lab Exercises: Tooth development].

Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the [[Alveolar process of maxilla|alveolar bone]] around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the [[periodontal ligament]]s which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through cementum.<ref name = \"ross453\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=453}}</ref>\n\n=== Eruption ===\n{{Main|Tooth eruption}}\n\n[[File:ToothLost-2917.jpg|thumb|right|Bottom teeth of a seven-year-old, showing primary teeth ''(left)'', a lost primary tooth ''(middle)'', and a permanent tooth ''(right)'']]\nTooth eruption in humans is a process in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments play an important role in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.\n\nThere have been many theories about the cause of tooth eruption. One theory proposes that the developing root of a tooth pushes it into the mouth. Another, known as the cushioned hammock theory, resulted from microscopic study of teeth, which was thought to show a [[ligament]] around the root. It was later discovered that the \"ligament\" was merely an [[Artifact (observational)|artifact]] created in the process of preparing the slide. Currently, the most widely held belief is that the periodontal ligaments provide the main impetus for the process.\n\nThe onset of primary tooth loss has been found to correlate strongly with somatic and psychological criteria of school readiness.<ref>Kranich, Ernst-Michael (1990) \"Anthropologie\", in F.

Of these, cementum is the only one that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an [[Dental alveolus|alveolus]], or \"socket\". Lying over the bone is the [[gingiva]] or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.\n\n===Periodontal ligaments===\nThe [[periodontal ligament]] is a specialized [[connective tissue]] that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers the root of the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15\u20130.38mm, but this size decreases over time.<ref name=\"Cate256\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=256}}</ref> The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and [[Bone resorption|resorption]] of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption.<ref name = \"ross453\"/> The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and [[epithelial cell rests of Malassez]].<ref name=\"Cate260\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=260}}</ref> Consisting of mostly Type I and III [[collagen]], the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location.

An area of bone receiving [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has a high number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.\n\n===Gingiva===\nThe [[gingiva]] (\"gums\") is the [[mucous membranes|mucosal]] tissue that overlays the jaws. There are three different types of epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium.

[[Saliva]] gradually neutralises the [[acid]]s which cause the pH of the tooth surface to rise above the critical pH, typically considered to be 5.5. This causes '[[remineralisation]]', the return of the dissolved minerals to the enamel.

Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular [[oral hygiene]] and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.<ref name = \"adaoralhealth\"/>\n\n==Tooth care==\n===Oral hygiene===\n[[File:Toothbrush 20050716 004.jpg|right|thumb|[[Toothbrush]]es are commonly used to help clean teeth.]]\n{{Main|Oral hygiene}}\n\nOral hygiene is the practice of keeping the mouth clean and is a means of preventing dental caries, [[gingivitis]], [[periodontal disease]], [[halitosis|bad breath]], and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful [[tooth brushing|brushing]] and [[Dental Floss|flossing]]. Professional cleaning includes [[tooth scaling]], using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.\n\nThe purpose of cleaning teeth is to remove plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria.<ref>[http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html Introduction to Dental Plaque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827094040/http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html |date=2011-08-27 }}. Leeds Dental Institute.</ref> Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) in order to prevent formation of plaque and tartar.<ref name=\"adaoralhealth\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222223237/http://www.ada.org/public/topics/cleaning.asp Oral Health Topics: Cleaning your teeth and gums]. American Dental Association.</ref> A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the [[gum line]], where [[periodontal disease]] often begins and could develop caries.\n\nElectric toothbrushes are a popular aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, and with good motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: \"Electric toothbrushes tend to help people who are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems.\" <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2679175.stm Thumbs down for electric toothbrush], BBC News, January 21, 2003.</ref> The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with [[rheumatoid arthritis]].\n\n===Protective treatments===\n[[Fluoride therapy]] is often recommended to protect against dental caries. [[Water fluoridation]] and [[fluoride]] supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=223}}</ref> The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay.<ref name = \"ross453\"/> Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride [[toothpaste]] or [[mouthwash]], is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.\n\n[[Dental sealant]]s are another preventive therapy often used to provide a barrier to bacteria and decay on the surface of teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in a procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.\n\n==Restorations==\n[[File:dent,tooth,zub.jpg|right|thumb|A restored premolar]]\nAfter a tooth has been damaged or destroyed, [[Dental restoration|restoration]] of the missing structure can be achieved with a variety of treatments. Restorations may be created from a variety of [[Dental restorative materials|materials]], including [[Glass ionomer cement|glass ionomer]], [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[gold]], [[Dental porcelain|porcelain]], and [[Dental composite|composite]].<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090830062420/http://www.ada.org/public/topics/fillings.asp Oral Health Topics: Dental Filling Options]\". ada.org.</ref> Small restorations placed inside a tooth are referred to as \"intracoronal restorations\". These restorations may be formed directly in the mouth or may be cast using the [[lost-wax casting|lost-wax technique]], such as for some [[inlays and onlays]]. When larger portions of a tooth are lost, an \"extracoronal restoration\" may be fabricated, such as an [[crown (dentistry)|artificial crown]] or a [[veneer (dentistry)|veneer]], to restore the involved tooth.\n\nWhen a tooth is lost, [[dentures]], [[Bridge (dentistry)|bridges]], or [[dental implant|implants]] may be used as replacements.<ref name=\"acp\">\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20120615170730/http://www.prosthodontics.org/patients/procedures.asp Prosthodontic Procedures]\", The American College of Prosthodontists.</ref> Dentures are usually the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a [[removable partial denture|partial]] number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants may be used as support.<ref name=\"aaomsimplants\">\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925181506/http://www.aaoms.org/dental_implants.php Dental Implants]\", American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.</ref>\n\n==Abnormalities==\n[[File:Fracturedtooth.jpg|thumb|A broken upper front tooth showing the pink of the pulp]]\nTooth abnormalities may be categorized according to whether they have environmental or developmental causes.<ref name=\"neville50\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=50.}}</ref> While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may not appear to be any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.\n\n===Environmental===\n\n==== Alteration during tooth development ====\nTooth abnormalities caused by environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. [[Enamel hypoplasia]] is a condition in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate.<ref>{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=31}}</ref> This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency than the rest of the tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors,<ref name=KanchanMachado2015>{{cite journal|vauthors= Kanchan T, Machado M, Rao A, Krishan K, Garg AK|title=Enamel hypoplasia and its role in identification of individuals: A review of literature|date=Apr 2015|journal=Indian J Dent|volume=6|issue=2|pages=99\u2013102|doi=10.4103/0975-962X.155887|pmid=26097340|pmc=4455163|type=Revisi\u00f3n}}</ref> an [[exanthem]]atous disease ([[chicken pox]], [[congenital syphilis]]),<ref name=KanchanMachado2015 /><ref name=\"neville51\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page= 51}}</ref> undiagnosed and untreated [[coeliac disease|celiac disease]],<ref name=NIH>[http://celiac.nih.gov/PDF/Dental_Enamel_Defects_508.pdf Dental Enamel Defects and Celiac Disease] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305124250/http://celiac.nih.gov/PDF/Dental_Enamel_Defects_508.pdf |date=2016-03-05 }} National Institute of Health (NIH)</ref><ref name=FerrazCampos2012>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ferraz EG, Campos Ede J, Sarmento VA, Silva LR|title=The oral manifestations of celiac disease: information for the pediatric dentist|date=2012|journal=Pediatr Dent|volume=34|issue=7|pages=485\u20138|pmid=23265166|type=Review}}</ref><ref name=GiucaCei2010>{{cite journal|vauthors=Giuca MR, Cei G, Gigli F, Gandini P|title=Oral signs in the diagnosis of celiac disease: review of the literature|date=2010|journal=Minerva Stomatol|volume=59|issue=1\u20132|pages=33\u201343|pmid=20212408|type=Review}}</ref> [[hypocalcaemia|hypocalcemia]], [[dental fluorosis]], [[birth injury]], [[preterm birth]], [[infection]] or trauma from a [[deciduous teeth|deciduous tooth]].<ref name=KanchanMachado2015 /> Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of [[fluoride]] and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis.<ref name=NIH /> Enamel hypoplasia resulting from [[syphilis]] is frequently referred to as [[Hutchinson's teeth]], which is considered one part of [[Hutchinson's triad]].<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/syphilis/DS00374/DSECTION=6 Syphilis: Complications], Mayo Clinic.</ref> [[Turner's hypoplasia]] is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from [[antineoplastic]] therapy.\n\n====Destruction after development====\nTooth destruction from processes other than [[dental caries]] is considered a normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. [[Attrition (dental)|Attrition]] is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth.<ref>\"[http://www.adha.org/CE_courses/course9/loss_of_structure.htm Loss of Tooth Structure]\", American Dental Hygiene Association.</ref> Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. [[Abrasion (dental)|Abrasion]] is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801114913/http://dentistry.umkc.edu/practition/assets/AbnormalitiesofTeeth.pdf Abnormalities of Teeth]\", University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry.</ref> If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. [[Erosion (dental)|Erosion]] is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.agd.org/library/2003/aug/200308_yip.pdf |pmid=15055615 |year=2003 |last1=Yip |first1=KH |last2=Smales |first2=RJ |last3=Kaidonis |first3=JA |title=The diagnosis and control of extrinsic acid erosion of tooth substance |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=350\u20133; quiz 354 |journal=General Dentistry |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907094153/http://www.agd.org/library/2003/aug/200308_yip.pdf |archivedate=September 7, 2006 }}</ref> Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with [[bulimia]] since [[vomiting]] results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of [[lemon juice]]. [[Abfraction]] is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under [[pressure]], the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]], causes [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] on one side of the tooth and [[compression (physical)|compression]] on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as [[internal resorption]], when caused by cells within the pulp, or [[external resorption]], when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.\n\n====Discoloration====\n{{Main|Tooth discoloration}}\n[[File:Tired teeth.jpg|thumb|Discolored teeth]]\nDiscoloration of teeth may result from bacteria stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods with an abundance of [[chlorophyll]], restorative materials, and medications.<ref name=\"neville63\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page= 63}}</ref> Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of [[chlorhexidine]], a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. [[Congenital erythropoietic porphyria]] causes [[porphyrin]]s to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with [[alkaptonuria]] and rarely with [[Parkinson's disease]]. [[Erythroblastosis fetalis]] and [[biliary atresia]] are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of [[biliverdin]]. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with [[leprosy|lepromatous leprosy]]. Some medications, such as [[tetracycline]] antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.\n\n====Alteration of eruption====\nTooth eruption may be altered by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth is said to be [[Wisdom teeth#Impaction|impacted]]. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth.<ref name=\"neville66\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=66}}</ref> Other causes may be [[tumor]]s, [[cyst]]s, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. [[Tooth ankylosis]] occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.\n\nA technique for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by [[orthodontist]]s who wish to delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches \u2153 of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the roots of the permanent tooth are more than \u2154 complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between \u2153 and \u2154, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.\n\n===Developmental===\n\n==== Abnormality in number ====\n* [[Anodontia]] is the total lack of tooth development.\n* [[Hyperdontia]] is the presence of a higher-than-normal number of teeth.\n* [[Hypodontia]] is the lack of development of one or more teeth.\n** Oligodontia may be used to describe the absence of 6 or more teeth.\nSome systemic disorders which may result in hyperdontia include [[Apert syndrome]], [[cleidocranial dysostosis]], [[Crouzon syndrome]], [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]], [[Gardner's syndrome]], and [[Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome]].<ref name=\"neville70\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=70}}</ref> Some systemic disorders which may result in hypodontia include Crouzon syndrome, [[Ectodermal dysplasia]], Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, and [[Gorlin syndrome]].<ref name=\"neville69\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=69}}</ref>\n\n====Abnormality in size====\n* [[Microdontia]] is a condition where teeth are smaller than the usual size.\n* [[Macrodontia (tooth)|Macrodontia]] is where teeth are larger than the usual size.\n\nMicrodontia of a single tooth is more likely to occur in a [[maxillary lateral incisor]]. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are [[wisdom teeth|third molars]]. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in [[Gigantism|pituitary gigantism]] and [[Pineal gland|pineal]] [[hyperplasia]]. It may also occur on one side of the face in cases of [[hemifacial hyperplasia]].\n\n====Abnormality in shape====\n[[File:Milk.teeth.fusion.jpg|thumb|The fusion of two deciduous teeth]]\n* [[Tooth Gemination|Gemination]] occurs when a developing tooth incompletely splits into the formation of two teeth.\n* [[Tooth fusion|Fusion]] is the union of two adjacent teeth during development.\n* [[Concrescence]] is the fusion of two separate teeth only in their cementum.\n* Accessory [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusps]] are additional cusps on a tooth and may manifest as a [[Talon cusp]], [[Cusp of Carabelli]], or [[Dens evaginatus]].\n* [[Dens invaginatus]], also called Dens in dente, is a deep invagination in a tooth causing the appearance of a tooth within a tooth.\n* [[Ectopic enamel]] is enamel found in an unusual location, such as the root of a tooth.\n* [[Taurodontism]] is a condition where the body of the tooth and pulp chamber is enlarged, and is associated with [[Klinefelter syndrome]], [[Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome]], [[Triple X syndrome]], and [[XYY syndrome]].<ref name = \"neville85\"/>\n* [[Hypercementosis]] is excessive formation of cementum, which may result from trauma, inflammation, [[acromegaly]], [[rheumatic fever]], and [[Paget's disease of bone]].<ref name=\"neville85\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=85}}</ref>\n* A [[dilaceration]] is a bend in the root which may have been caused by trauma to the tooth during formation.\n* [[Supernumerary roots]] is the presence of a greater number of roots on a tooth than expected\n\n==== Cleft lip and palate and association with dental anomalies ====\nThere are many types of dental anomalies seen in cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients. Both sets of dentition may be affected however they are commonly seen in the affected side. Most frequently, missing teeth, supernumerary or discoloured teeth can be seen however enamel dysplasia, discolouration and delayed root development is also common. In children with cleft lip and palate, the lateral incisor in the alveolar cleft region has the highest prevalence of dental developmental disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Tortora C, Meazzini MC, Garattini G, Brusati R|date=March 2008|title=Prevalence of abnormalities in dental structure, position and eruption pattern in population of unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate patients|pmid=18333651|doi=10.1597/06-218.1|journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal|volume=45|issue=2|pages=154\u2013162}}</ref> This is important to consider in order to correctly plan treatment keeping in mind considerations for function and aesthetics.

In cases of complete CLP, the left maxillary lateral incisor was the most commonly absent tooth. Supernumerary teeth were typically located distal to the cleft.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Characteristics and distribution of dental anomalies in a Brazilian cleft population|author1=Luciane Macedo de Menezes |author2=Susana Maria Deon Rizzatto |author3=Fabiane Azeredo |author4=Diogo Antunes Vargas|journal=Revista Odonto Ci\u00eancia|volume=25|issue=2|pages=137\u2013141 |year=2010|doi=10.1590/S1980-65232010000200006|doi-access=free}}</ref> In a study of Jordanian subjects, the prevalence of dental anomaly was higher in CLP patients than in normal subjects.

Supernumerary teeth were observed in 16.7% of patients; other findings included microdontia (37%), taurodontism (70.5%), transposition or ectopic teeth (30.8%), dilacerations (19.2%), and hypoplasia (30.8%). The incidence of microdontia, dilaceration, and hypoplasia was significantly higher in bilateral CLP patients than in unilateral CLP patients, and none of the anomalies showed any significant sexual dimorphism.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Al Jamal GA, Hazza'a AM, Rawashdeh MA|year=2010|title=Prevalence of dental anomalies in a population of cleft lip and palate patients|journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal|volume=47|issue=4|pages=413\u2013420|doi=10.1597/08-275.1|pmid=    20590463}}</ref>\n\nIt is therefore evident that patients with cleft lip and palate may present with a variety of dental anomalies. It is essential to assess the patient both clinically and radiographically in order to correctly treat and prevent progression of any dental problems. It is also useful to note that patients with a cleft lip and palate automatically score a 5 on the IOTN ( index for orthodontic need) and therefore are eligible for orthodontic treatment, liaising with an orthodontist is vital in order coordinate and plan treatment successfully.\n\n====Abnormality in structure====\n* [[Amelogenesis imperfecta]] is a condition in which enamel does not form properly or at all.<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=amelogenesisimperfecta Amelogenesis imperfecta], Genetics Home Reference, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.</ref>\n* [[Dentinogenesis imperfecta]] is a condition in which dentin does not form properly and is sometimes associated with [[osteogenesis imperfecta]].<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=dentinogenesisimperfecta Dentinogenesis imperfecta], Genetics Home Reference, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.</ref>\n* [[Dentin dysplasia]] is a disorder in which the roots and pulp of teeth may be affected.\n* [[Regional odontodysplasia]] is a disorder affecting enamel, dentin, and pulp and causes the teeth to appear \"ghostly\" on radiographs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cho, Shiu-yin|url=http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-72/issue-8/vol72_issue8.pdf |title=Conservative Management of Regional Odontodysplasia: Case Report|volume=72|issue =8|pages=735\u20138|pmid=17049109|year=2006|journal=J Can Dent Assoc}}</ref>\n* [[Diastema]] is a condition in which there is a gap between two teeth caused by the imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of teeth.<ref>''ASDC Journal of Dentistry for Children, Volume 48''.

Kruger played [[college basketball]] for [[Kansas State University]].  He has served as the head coach of the [[University of Texas\u2013Pan American]], Kansas State, the [[University of Florida]], the [[University of Illinois]], and the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], as well as the [[Atlanta Hawks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).\n\nKruger is one of only two coaches ever (the other being [[Tubby Smith]]) to lead five programs to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. His teams have participated in 17 NCAA Tournaments, including 2 Final Fours (1994 with Florida; 2016 with Oklahoma).\n\n==Biography==\nKruger was born and raised in [[Silver Lake, Kansas]]. As a [[point guard]], Kruger led the [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State Wildcats]] to back-to-back [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] championships in 1972 and 1973 under coach [[Jack Hartman]].  Kruger was named the Big Eight Player of the Year in 1973 and 1974, after being named the Big Eight Sophomore of the Year in 1972.  He was also a shortstop on the [[Kansas State Wildcats baseball|Kansas State baseball]] team.\n\nHe was a ninth-round pick of the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in the [[1974 NBA Draft]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1974.html</ref> Kruger also tried out with the [[Detroit Pistons]], and played professionally in [[Israel]]. He also played a season of minor league baseball in the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] organization and was invited to training camp with the [[Dallas Cowboys]] as a [[quarterback]].<ref>http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/26292605/ranking-2019-ncaa-tournament-coaches-players-1-68</ref>\n\n==Head coaching history==\n\n===Kansas State===\n\nAs basketball coach of the Wildcats, he led K-State to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] in each of his four seasons as head coach and the Elite Eight in 1988\u2014a team featuring future NBA players [[Mitch Richmond]] and [[Steve Henson]]\u2014before losing to arch-rival [[Kansas Jayhawks]], the eventual national champion.\n\nFrom Kansas State, Kruger moved south to the [[Florida Gators men's basketball|University of Florida]], taking over a Gators program that had limited success not only nationally, but in the Southeastern Conference.\n\n===Florida===\n\nIn his six seasons with Florida, he compiled a 104-80 mark. In the process, he led the [[University of Florida]] to its first-ever [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]] appearance in 1994.\n\nHe was named coach of the year in both 1992 and 1994.\n\n===Illinois===\n\nFrom there, he accepted the vacant position at Illinois. While there, he became the only [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] coach to successfully sign three consecutive [[Illinois Mr. Basketball]] winners, after inking [[Sergio McClain]], [[Frank Williams (basketball)|Frank Williams]], and [[Brian Cook]] between 1997 and 1999.\n\n===UNLV===\n\nKruger accepted the job at [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]] in 2004.\n\nHis son, Kevin, took advantage of a new NCAA rule, called Proposal 2005-54,<ref>[http://ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/story/9548240 \"Kruger transfers to play for father\"], ''Associated Press'', July 10, 2006</ref> before the 2006&ndash;2007 season to transfer from [[Arizona State Sun Devils|Arizona State]] and immediately play for his father at UNLV without sitting out one year.  The controversial rule was repealed for the following season due to what some claimed were the [[unintended consequence]] of allowing players with undergraduate diplomas to immediately begin playing for another school without sitting out for any time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kantowski, Ron|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sports/2007/jan/08/566665682.html|title=Ron Kantowski eulogizes a 'wacko' NCAA rule that, while used innocently enough by UNLV's Lon and Kevin Kruger, left the door open for 'unintended consequences'|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033619/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sports/2007/jan/08/566665682.html|archivedate=September 30, 2007|accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Kruger led the Runnin' Rebels to the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Sweet Sixteen]] of the 2007 NCAA Tournament, which was the team's first trip there since [[Jerry Tarkanian]] led them there in 1991.\n\nOn February 9, 2008, the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV Runnin' Rebels]] beat [[Colorado State Rams|Colorado State]] 68&ndash;51 at home, for Kruger's 400th career win.\n\n===Oklahoma===\n\nOn April 1, 2011, sources confirmed that Kruger had accepted the head coaching position with the [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma Sooners]], replacing the fired [[Jeff Capel]].<ref>Ryan Greene, \"[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/apr/01/sources-lon-kruger-accept-oklahoma-coaching-job/  Lon Kruger changes course, accepts head coaching position at Oklahoma],\" ''Las Vegas Sun'' (April 1, 2011).

American college and professional [[basketball]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] who is currently the men's basketball head coach of the [[University of Oklahoma]].  Kruger played [[college basketball]] for [[Kansas State University]].  He has served as the head coach of the [[University of Texas\u2013Pan American]], Kansas State, the [[University of Florida]], the [[University of Illinois]], and the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], as well as the [[Atlanta Hawks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).\n\nKruger is one of only two coaches ever (the other being [[Tubby Smith]]) to lead five programs to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. His teams have participated in 17 NCAA Tournaments, including 2 Final Fours (1994 with Florida; 2016 with Oklahoma).\n\n==Biography==\nKruger was born and raised in [[Silver Lake, Kansas]]. As a [[point guard]], Kruger led the [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State Wildcats]] to back-to-back [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] championships in 1972 and 1973 under coach [[Jack Hartman]].  Kruger was named the Big Eight Player of the Year in 1973 and 1974, after being named the Big Eight Sophomore of the Year in 1972.  He was also a shortstop on the [[Kansas State Wildcats baseball|Kansas State baseball]] team.\n\nHe was a ninth-round pick of the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in the [[1974 NBA Draft]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1974.html</ref> Kruger also tried out with the [[Detroit Pistons]], and played professionally in [[Israel]]. He also played a season of minor league baseball in the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] organization and was invited to training camp with the [[Dallas Cowboys]] as a [[quarterback]].<ref>http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/26292605/ranking-2019-ncaa-tournament-coaches-players-1-68</ref>\n\n==Head coaching history==\n\n===Kansas State===\n\nAs basketball coach of the Wildcats, he led K-State to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] in each of his four seasons as head coach and the Elite Eight in 1988\u2014a team featuring future NBA players [[Mitch Richmond]] and [[Steve Henson]]\u2014before losing to arch-rival [[Kansas Jayhawks]], the eventual national champion.\n\nFrom Kansas State, Kruger moved south to the [[Florida Gators men's basketball|University of Florida]], taking over a Gators program that had limited success not only nationally, but in the Southeastern Conference.\n\n===Florida===\n\nIn his six seasons with Florida, he compiled a 104-80 mark. In the process, he led the [[University of Florida]] to its first-ever [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]] appearance in 1994.\n\nHe was named coach of the year in both 1992 and 1994.\n\n===Illinois===\n\nFrom there, he accepted the vacant position at Illinois. While there, he became the only [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] coach to successfully sign three consecutive [[Illinois Mr. Basketball]] winners, after inking [[Sergio McClain]], [[Frank Williams (basketball)|Frank Williams]], and [[Brian Cook]] between 1997 and 1999.\n\n===UNLV===\n\nKruger accepted the job at [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]] in 2004.\n\nHis son, Kevin, took advantage of a new NCAA rule, called Proposal 2005-54,<ref>[http://ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/story/9548240 \"Kruger transfers to play for father\"], ''Associated Press'', July 10, 2006</ref> before the 2006&ndash;2007 season to transfer from [[Arizona State Sun Devils|Arizona State]] and immediately play for his father at UNLV without sitting out one year.  The controversial rule was repealed for the following season due to what some claimed were the [[unintended consequence]] of allowing players with undergraduate diplomas to immediately begin playing for another school without sitting out for any time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kantowski, Ron|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sports/2007/jan/08/566665682.html|title=Ron Kantowski eulogizes a 'wacko' NCAA rule that, while used innocently enough by UNLV's Lon and Kevin Kruger, left the door open for 'unintended consequences'|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033619/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sports/2007/jan/08/566665682.html|archivedate=September 30, 2007|accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Kruger led the Runnin' Rebels to the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Sweet Sixteen]] of the 2007 NCAA Tournament, which was the team's first trip there since [[Jerry Tarkanian]] led them there in 1991.\n\nOn February 9, 2008, the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV Runnin' Rebels]] beat [[Colorado State Rams|Colorado State]] 68&ndash;51 at home, for Kruger's 400th career win.\n\n===Oklahoma===\n\nOn April 1, 2011, sources confirmed that Kruger had accepted the head coaching position with the [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma Sooners]], replacing the fired [[Jeff Capel]].<ref>Ryan Greene, \"[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/apr/01/sources-lon-kruger-accept-oklahoma-coaching-job/  Lon Kruger changes course, accepts head coaching position at Oklahoma],\" ''Las Vegas Sun'' (April 1, 2011).

At some universities, students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects make up the degree.\n\nUnlike in other countries, students do not receive an overall grade for their Bachelor of Arts degree with varying levels of honours (\"honours\" is a distinction but not part of the degree itself). Qualified students may be admitted, after they have achieved their (general) bachelor's program with a high overall grade point average, to a further one-year bachelor (with) Honours degree program (''(with) Honours'' is part of the degree itself). Thus, to achieve a Bachelor (with) honours degree (e.g. BA (Hons.) or BA hons.), an extra \"[[postgraduate]]\" year and a high research honour's thesis must be completed; see [[honours degree]]s. A student who holds a (with) honours degree is eligible for direct entry to either a doctorate (PhD) or a very high research master's degree program.\n\nEducation in [[Canada]] is controlled by the provinces and can be very different depending on the province. Canadian universities typically offer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees. In many universities and colleges, Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as BA or as honours BA degrees. The term \"honours\" is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their BA degrees with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs.\n\nThe honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of '(Hon(s))'. It should not be confused with the consecutive [[honours degree|BA degree \"with Honours\"]], Latin ''baccalaureatus in artibus cum honore\", 'BA hon.' ''de jure'' without brackets and with a dot. It is a \"postgraduate\" degree. Going back in history, a three-year BA degree (also known e.g. in Qu\u00e9bec as ''grade de bachelier \u00e8s arts'') was also called a pass degree or general degree.\n\nA student who first achieves a general BA degree with a sufficiently high overall average may be admitted to a \"postgraduate\" ''baccalaureatus cum honore'' degree in the same field; it requires a minimum of one year, but may also take longer; it typically does not exceed two years. Students may be required to undertake a long high-quality research empirical thesis (honours seminar thesis) combined with a selection of courses from the relevant field of studies. The consecutive ''B. cum Honore'' degree is essential if students' ultimate goals are to study towards a two- or three-year very high research master's degree qualification. A student holding a ''B. cum Honore'' degree also may choose to complete a doctor of philosophy (PhD) program without the requirement to first complete a master's degree. Over the years in some universities, certain ''B. cum Honore'' programs have been changed to corresponding master's degrees.\n\nIn general, in all four countries, the BA degree is the standard required for entry into  a [[Master of Arts|master's]] programme. In science, a BA hons degree is generally a prerequisite for entrance to a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] program or a very high research activity master's programme. As such, for example, the UK awarded ''honours'' are designed and should not be confused with Canadian-, Australian-, New Zealand-, and South African-awarded BA hons/BA (Hons) degrees.\n\nFor further clarification, in other countries, the so-called \"honours\" bachelor may not be an actual degree, but the name of a (vocational) programme that can be completed through specified course work, a high grade average, and the completion of possibly a short paper or project; students who completed such an honours BA programme sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' after the degree abbreviation without a space, in parentheses, and after the 'Hon(s)' without a dot, for example 'BA (Hon)'. The three- and four-year BA.degree is also accepted for entry into graduate professional programmes such as [[LLB#Structure of LL.B. programmes|law]] or a [[M.B.A.|master of business administration]] program.\n\n==Netherlands==\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the BA and master of arts (MA) degrees were introduced in 2002. Until then, a single program led to the ''[[doctorandus]]'' degree. This comprised the same course load as the bachelor's and master's programs combined. The title ''doctorandus'' was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (''meester'', Dutch for master, abbreviated ''Mr.'') and engineering (''[[ingenieur]]''). Those who had already started the ''doctorandus'' program could, on completing it, opt for the ''doctorandus'' degree (entitling them to use \"Drs.\" in front of their name), or could use the master's degree (postnominal letters) in accordance with the new standard.\n\n==Germany==\nIn Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a ''Universit\u00e4t'' (plural: ''Universit\u00e4ten'') or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (plural: ''Fachhochschulen''); both can be referred to as a ''Hochschule'', which is the generic term in Germany for all institutions awarding academic degrees. Fachhochschule is often translated as \"University of Applied Sciences\". Universit\u00e4ten place greater emphasis on fundamental science and theoretical background, while Fachhochschulen are generally designed with a focus on teaching professional skills. Degrees earned at Universit\u00e4ten and Fachhochschulen are legally equivalent.\n\nIn Germany, the B.A. normally lasts between three and three and a half years \u2013 six or seven semesters \u2013 and is awarded after the student earns between 180 and 210 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].\n\n==United Kingdom and Ireland==\n{{Main|British undergraduate degree classification}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] (excluding [[Scotland]]) and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the first degree course normally lasts three years, but nomenclature varies: 19th-century and later universities usually distinguish between arts and sciences subjects by awarding either a B.A. or B.Sc. degree. However, some older or [[ancient universities]], such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] traditionally award B.A.s to undergraduates having completed the final examinations, e.g. Part II [[Tripos]] (Cambridge), Final Honour Schools (Oxford), Moderatorship (Dublin), in most subjects including the sciences. Some new [[plate glass university|plate glass universities]] established in the 1960s, such as [[University of York|York]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] originally followed the practice of Oxford and Cambridge by awarding B.A.s in all subjects, but have since changed to awarding B.Sc. degrees in science subjects. At Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] can be claimed, usually twenty-one terms after [[matriculation]]. For many centuries, the bachelor's degree was an intermediate step and was awarded for much of the work carried out in later times at secondary schools. The names of the final secondary school exams in France and Spain (and increasingly in the UK\u2014the [[International Baccalaureate]]) come from this: le [[Baccalaur\u00e9at]] and el ''Bachillerato'', respectively.\n\nThe [[Ancient Universities of Scotland]] award a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree to humanities or arts graduates, but a B.Sc. to science graduates. This course takes four years for an honours degree and three for an ordinar.  In Scotland, it is possible to opt to take an ordinary degree rather than this simply ranking below a third class honours (for example, B.A. with distinction, merit or pass).\n\nA Bachelor of Arts is entitled to the designation B.A. for an ordinary/pass degree and B.A. (Hons) for an honours degree. Students who completed an honours B.A. sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' or '(Hons)' after the degree abbreviation in parentheses. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, followed by an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An ordinary or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add '(Hons)') may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Typically these degrees lack the final year requirement of a dissertation.\n\n== High School ==\n[[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] in [[Philadelphia, PA]], USA, is the only high school in the United States that is allowed to give this degree to its graduates<ref>{{cite web |title=About Central |url=https://centralhs.philasd.org/about-central-high-school/about-us-2/ |website=Central High School |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Associate of Arts]]\n* [[Lady Literate in Arts]]\n* [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]]\n* [[Bachelor of Science]]\n* [[Master of Arts]]\n* [[Educational attainment in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Academic degrees}}\n\n[[Category:Bachelor's degrees|Arts, Bachelor of]]\n[[Category:Liberal arts education]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the R.

Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous [[psychic]], Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off the negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie, advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact [[Demonology|demonologist]] Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously.\n\nThe camera captures many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and the bedroom door moving. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, soon worsening the situation. During night one, keys are heard jangling. The thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, and the door slams shut. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a [[Ouija board]]. During night fifteen, Katie appears to be in a clear trance as she gets out of bed, and stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.\n\nMicah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the board's pointer piece to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During night seventeen, Micah sprinkles [[baby powder]] in the hallway and outside the bedroom door. The couples are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie. Katie finally calls the demonologist but learns he is out of the country.\n\nThe events of the film have psychologically terrified Katie, which has strengthened the demon's power. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is unnerved by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope. On night twenty, Katie is pulled out of the bedroom and the demon attacks her in the dark. The camera is motionless the entire time, leaving the audience unaware what happened. It is shown that the demon has bitten Katie. Micah discovers the bite mark and decides events are too out of control to remain in the house. He packs for them both to head to a motel. Micah finds that Katie is unresponsive, and notices she is holding a cross so tightly that her hand is bleeding. Micah takes the cross and burns it.  Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they stay, then apparently talks to someone next to her, saying they will be okay now.\n\nOn night twenty-one, Katie gets out of bed again, and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah and he quickly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah screams in pain, Katie stops screaming, and, after another moment of silence, heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, a loud roar is heard as Micah's body is violently hurled at the camera which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway, with blood on her shirt. She slowly walks into the room, and crawls to Micah's body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black, and another growl is heard. Text states that Micah's body was discovered by the police on October 11, 2006, and Katie has vanished.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Katie Featherston]] as Katie\n* [[Micah Sloat]] as Micah\n* Mark Fredrichs as Dr. Fredrichs\n* Amber Armstrong as Amber\n* [[Ashley Palmer (actress)|Ashley Palmer]] as Diane\n* Spencer Marks as Dr. Johann Averies\n\n==Production==\nAttempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In deciding on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and eliminating the need for a camera crew, a \"higher degree of plausibility\" was created for the audience as they were \"more invested in the story and the characters\".<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/slamdancenews.php?id=5123 | title=Exclusive Interview: Oren Peli| first=Ryan |last=Turek | date=2008-03-09 | accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> Peli says that the dialogue was \"natural\" because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as \"[[retroscripting]]\" also used in the making of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''.<ref name=\"interview\" /> In casting the movie, Peli auditioned \"a few hundred people\" before finally meeting Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, \"If you saw the [audition] footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years.\"<ref name=\"interview\" /> During a guest appearance on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting. Featherston noted they were originally paid $500 for their work.\n\nThe film was shot out of sequence due to Peli's self-imposed seven-day shooting schedule,<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-paranormal20-2009sep20,0,843011,full.story | title=The haunted history of 'Paranormal Activity'| first=John |last=Horn | accessdate=2009-09-20 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2009-09-20}}</ref> though Peli would have preferred the story unfold for the actors as he had envisioned it. Sloat, who controlled the camera for a good deal of the film, was a former cameraman at his university's TV station. \"It was a very intense week\", Peli said, stating that the film would be shot day and night, edited at the same time, and would have the visual effects applied to it as the acting footage was being finalized.<ref name=\"interview\" /> Multiple endings were conceived, but not all of them were shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/10/30/paranormal-activity-three-super-scary-alternate-endings-spoiler-alert/|title='Paranormal Activity': Three super-scary alternate endings (SPOILER ALERT!)|last=Schwartz|first=Missy|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2014-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe film was screened at 2007's [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]], where it impressed an assistant at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], Kirill Baru, so much that CAA signed on to represent Peli. Attempting to find a distributor for the film and/or directing work for Peli, the agency sent out DVDs of the movie to as many people in the industry as they could, and it was eventually seen by [[Miramax Films]] Senior Executive Jason Blum, who thought it had potential. He worked with Peli to re-edit the film and submitted it to the [[Sundance Film Festival]], but it was rejected. The DVD also impressed [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] executives Adam Goodman, Stacey Snider, and finally [[Steven Spielberg]], who cut a deal with Blum and Peli.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\nDreamWorks' plan was to remake the film with a bigger budget and with Peli directing, and only to include the original version as an extra when the DVD was eventually released. \"They didn't know what to do with [the original]\", said Blum; they just wanted to be \"in business\" with Peli.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Blum and Peli agreed, but stipulated a test screening of the original film before going ahead with the remake, believing it would be well-received by a theatrical audience.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\nDuring the screening, people began walking out; Goodman thought the film was [[Box office bomb|bombing]], until he learned that the viewers were actually leaving because they were so frightened. He then realized a remake was unwise.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> [[Paramount Pictures]], which acquired DreamWorks in 2005, bought the domestic rights to the film, and worldwide rights to any sequels, for US$350,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/10/paramount-paranormal-activity-sequel.html | title=Paramount may produce 'Paranormal Activity' sequel | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | author=Ben Fritz | date=2009-10-25 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref> When the film was taken in by Paramount, several changes were made.

Her friend Amber calls and leaves a message, saying that she is concerned because she hasn't heard from Katie or Micah. Amber eventually comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, scaring Amber out of the house before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth.\n\nPolice officers arrive at the house about a half hour later and discover Micah's body as well. They call to Katie, who wakes from her catatonic state and seems confused. Katie comes out of the bedroom with the knife still in her hand. The police ask her to drop the knife. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind one of the police officers slams shut, startling one of the officers, which causes him to shoot Katie, killing her. The film ends with the police investigating the area and finding nothing but the camera, still running.\n\n====Studio ending====\nIn this ending, available as an alternate ending in the home releases of the film, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera before cutting her own throat. The screen then fades to black.\n\n====Unfilmed ending====\nA third alternate ending was written in which a possessed Katie would corner Micah and bludgeon him to death with his camera, while viewers watch from the camera's point of view. This version was deemed too complicated and too brutal to shoot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2009/10/30/paranormal-activity-three-super-scary-alternate-endings-spoiler-alert |title='Paranormal Activity': Three super-scary alternate endings (SPOILER ALERT!) |last=Schwartz |first=Missy |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2016-09-01}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Paranormal Activity'' [[premiere]]d at [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] in North America on October 14, 2007, was shown at the [[Slamdance Film Festival]] on January 18, 2008, and screened at the 36th Annual [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 6, 2009.<ref>[http://www.telluridefilmfestival.org/news/2009-09 The 36th Telluride Film Festival Draws to a Close]</ref>\n\nThe version with the new ending, made after Paramount acquired the film, had screenings on September 25, 2009, in twelve [[college town]]s across the United States.

A parallel sequel and prequel, ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]'', was released in 2010. The success of the first two films would spawn additional films in the series: the prequel ''[[Paranormal Activity 3]]'' in 2011, and ''[[Paranormal Activity 4]]'' (the sequel to the second installment) in 2012. The fifth installment, ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones|The Marked Ones]]'', was released in 2014, and the sixth installment, ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension|The Ghost Dimension]]'', was released in 2015.\n\nOn June 19, 2019, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] announced that a seventh installment is in development and will be released in 2022, it was originally scheduled for 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please, only add to this synopsis if you spot a mistake or grammatical error. -->\nIn 2006, Katie and Micah, a young couple, move to a new house in [[San Diego]]. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous [[psychic]], Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off the negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie, advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact [[Demonology|demonologist]] Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously.\n\nThe camera captures many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and the bedroom door moving. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, soon worsening the situation. During night one, keys are heard jangling. The thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, and the door slams shut. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a [[Ouija board]]. During night fifteen, Katie appears to be in a clear trance as she gets out of bed, and stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.\n\nMicah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the board's pointer piece to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During night seventeen, Micah sprinkles [[baby powder]] in the hallway and outside the bedroom door. The couples are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie. Katie finally calls the demonologist but learns he is out of the country.\n\nThe events of the film have psychologically terrified Katie, which has strengthened the demon's power. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is unnerved by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope. On night twenty, Katie is pulled out of the bedroom and the demon attacks her in the dark. The camera is motionless the entire time, leaving the audience unaware what happened. It is shown that the demon has bitten Katie. Micah discovers the bite mark and decides events are too out of control to remain in the house. He packs for them both to head to a motel. Micah finds that Katie is unresponsive, and notices she is holding a cross so tightly that her hand is bleeding. Micah takes the cross and burns it.  Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they stay, then apparently talks to someone next to her, saying they will be okay now.\n\nOn night twenty-one, Katie gets out of bed again, and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah and he quickly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah screams in pain, Katie stops screaming, and, after another moment of silence, heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, a loud roar is heard as Micah's body is violently hurled at the camera which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway, with blood on her shirt. She slowly walks into the room, and crawls to Micah's body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black, and another growl is heard. Text states that Micah's body was discovered by the police on October 11, 2006, and Katie has vanished.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Katie Featherston]] as Katie\n* [[Micah Sloat]] as Micah\n* Mark Fredrichs as Dr. Fredrichs\n* Amber Armstrong as Amber\n* [[Ashley Palmer (actress)|Ashley Palmer]] as Diane\n* Spencer Marks as Dr. Johann Averies\n\n==Production==\nAttempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In deciding on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and eliminating the need for a camera crew, a \"higher degree of plausibility\" was created for the audience as they were \"more invested in the story and the characters\".<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/slamdancenews.php?id=5123 | title=Exclusive Interview: Oren Peli| first=Ryan |last=Turek | date=2008-03-09 | accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> Peli says that the dialogue was \"natural\" because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as \"[[retroscripting]]\" also used in the making of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''.<ref name=\"interview\" /> In casting the movie, Peli auditioned \"a few hundred people\" before finally meeting Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, \"If you saw the [audition] footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years.\"<ref name=\"interview\" /> During a guest appearance on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting. Featherston noted they were originally paid $500 for their work.\n\nThe film was shot out of sequence due to Peli's self-imposed seven-day shooting schedule,<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-paranormal20-2009sep20,0,843011,full.story | title=The haunted history of 'Paranormal Activity'| first=John |last=Horn | accessdate=2009-09-20 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2009-09-20}}</ref> though Peli would have preferred the story unfold for the actors as he had envisioned it. Sloat, who controlled the camera for a good deal of the film, was a former cameraman at his university's TV station. \"It was a very intense week\", Peli said, stating that the film would be shot day and night, edited at the same time, and would have the visual effects applied to it as the acting footage was being finalized.<ref name=\"interview\" /> Multiple endings were conceived, but not all of them were shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/10/30/paranormal-activity-three-super-scary-alternate-endings-spoiler-alert/|title='Paranormal Activity': Three super-scary alternate endings (SPOILER ALERT!)|last=Schwartz|first=Missy|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2014-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe film was screened at 2007's [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]], where it impressed an assistant at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], Kirill Baru, so much that CAA signed on to represent Peli. Attempting to find a distributor for the film and/or directing work for Peli, the agency sent out DVDs of the movie to as many people in the industry as they could, and it was eventually seen by [[Miramax Films]] Senior Executive Jason Blum, who thought it had potential. He worked with Peli to re-edit the film and submitted it to the [[Sundance Film Festival]], but it was rejected. The DVD also impressed [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] executives Adam Goodman, Stacey Snider, and finally [[Steven Spielberg]], who cut a deal with Blum and Peli.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\nDreamWorks' plan was to remake the film with a bigger budget and with Peli directing, and only to include the original version as an extra when the DVD was eventually released. \"They didn't know what to do with [the original]\", said Blum; they just wanted to be \"in business\" with Peli.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Blum and Peli agreed, but stipulated a test screening of the original film before going ahead with the remake, believing it would be well-received by a theatrical audience.<ref name=\"latimes\" />\n\nDuring the screening, people began walking out; Goodman thought the film was [[Box office bomb|bombing]], until he learned that the viewers were actually leaving because they were so frightened. He then realized a remake was unwise.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> [[Paramount Pictures]], which acquired DreamWorks in 2005, bought the domestic rights to the film, and worldwide rights to any sequels, for US$350,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/10/paramount-paranormal-activity-sequel.html | title=Paramount may produce 'Paranormal Activity' sequel | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | author=Ben Fritz | date=2009-10-25 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref> When the film was taken in by Paramount, several changes were made.

Her friend Amber calls and leaves a message, saying that she is concerned because she hasn't heard from Katie or Micah. Amber eventually comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, scaring Amber out of the house before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth.\n\nPolice officers arrive at the house about a half hour later and discover Micah's body as well. They call to Katie, who wakes from her catatonic state and seems confused. Katie comes out of the bedroom with the knife still in her hand. The police ask her to drop the knife. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind one of the police officers slams shut, startling one of the officers, which causes him to shoot Katie, killing her. The film ends with the police investigating the area and finding nothing but the camera, still running.\n\n====Studio ending====\nIn this ending, available as an alternate ending in the home releases of the film, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera before cutting her own throat. The screen then fades to black.\n\n====Unfilmed ending====\nA third alternate ending was written in which a possessed Katie would corner Micah and bludgeon him to death with his camera, while viewers watch from the camera's point of view. This version was deemed too complicated and too brutal to shoot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2009/10/30/paranormal-activity-three-super-scary-alternate-endings-spoiler-alert |title='Paranormal Activity': Three super-scary alternate endings (SPOILER ALERT!) |last=Schwartz |first=Missy |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2016-09-01}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Paranormal Activity'' [[premiere]]d at [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] in North America on October 14, 2007, was shown at the [[Slamdance Film Festival]] on January 18, 2008, and screened at the 36th Annual [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 6, 2009.<ref>[http://www.telluridefilmfestival.org/news/2009-09 The 36th Telluride Film Festival Draws to a Close]</ref>\n\nThe version with the new ending, made after Paramount acquired the film, had screenings on September 25, 2009, in twelve [[college town]]s across the United States.
