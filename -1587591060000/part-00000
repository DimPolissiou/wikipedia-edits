That's something that, I pray to God, if I am able to keep making movies, I can only hope, twenty years down the line maybe, I'll be able to approach.\"<ref>Johnson, Rian. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p17. Print.</ref>\n\nHis debut film, ''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]'', is a crime drama made for just under $500,000. Johnson has often said that he looked to the novels of [[Dashiell Hammett]] as inspiration for the film's unique use of language. While the film is classified as a [[film noir]], Johnson claims that no references were made to film noir during production, so as to focus the production away from reproducing a genre piece. ''Brick'' was released on DVD by [[Focus Features]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Joseph Gordon-Levitt Is a Teenage Bogart at Noir High in 'Brick'|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/movies/31bric.html|accessdate=October 10, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 31, 2006|author=Stephen Holden}}</ref>\n\nJohnson directed the video for [[the Mountain Goats]]' song \"Woke Up New\" in 2006. He is a professed fan{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} of the band and was asked to direct the video when bandleader [[John Darnielle]] noticed a reference to them in the credits for ''Brick''. A song is credited to \"The Hospital Bombers Experience\", which is a reference to the Mountain Goats song titled \"The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton\". Johnson also directed a live performance film of the Mountain Goats' 2009 album ''The Life of the World to Come''. The film consists of a single shot, depicting Darnielle performing the entire album on guitar and piano with minimal accompaniment. This film was screened in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, and Portland, Oregon upon its completion, and was released as a limited edition DVD on [[Record Store Day]] (April 17, 2010).\n\nJohnson's second film, ''[[The Brothers Bloom]]'', is a con-man story released in theaters in May 2009 to moderately positive critical reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brothers_bloom/ |title=The Brothers Bloom reviews |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2010-04-22}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film was assigned a [[weighted average]] score of 55 out of 100 based on 26 reviews from mainstream critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/brothersbloom?q=brothers%20bloom |title=Brothers Bloom, The reviews |work=Metacritic |accessdate=2010-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2009-05-14-bloom-review_N.htm |title='Brothers Bloom' is a con story that doesn't cheat |work=USA Today |author=Puig Claudia |date=May 17, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}{{Rating|3.5|4}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, Johnson announced that he was directing an episode of the TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' for its third season.

He is known for writing and directing the neo-noir film ''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]'' (2005), the comedy-drama  ''[[The Brothers Bloom]]'' (2008), the science-fiction thriller ''[[Looper (film)|Looper]]'' (2012), the space opera ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017), and the murder-mystery ''[[Knives Out]]'' (2019), the last of which was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and earned Johnson a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]].\n\nHe also directed three episodes of the television drama series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' (2008\u20132013), for which he received the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Drama Series]] in 2013.\n\n==Early life==\nJohnson was born on December 17, 1973 in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].<ref name=\"TCM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/1072169%7C0/Rian-Johnson/biography.html|title=BIOGRAPHY|author=Dwyer, Shawn|year=2010|publisher=Turner Classical Movies}}</ref> He grew up in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] until sixth grade,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/1368-rian-johnson-the-brothers-bloom/|title=Rian Johnson, The Brothers Bloom|magazine=Filmmaker Magazine|date=May 15, 2009|author=Dawson, Nick}}</ref> when he moved to [[San Clemente, California]].<ref name=\"TCM\"/> He attended [[San Clemente High School (San Clemente, California)|San Clemente High School]] (graduating in 1992),<ref name=\"TCM\"/> where ''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]'' was predominantly filmed.

That's something that, I pray to God, if I am able to keep making movies, I can only hope, twenty years down the line maybe, I'll be able to approach.\"<ref>Johnson, Rian. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p17. Print.</ref>\n\nHis debut film, ''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]'', is a crime drama made for just under $500,000. Johnson has often said that he looked to the novels of [[Dashiell Hammett]] as inspiration for the film's unique use of language. While the film is classified as a [[film noir]], Johnson claims that no references were made to film noir during production, so as to focus the production away from reproducing a genre piece. ''Brick'' was released on DVD by [[Focus Features]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Joseph Gordon-Levitt Is a Teenage Bogart at Noir High in 'Brick'|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/movies/31bric.html|accessdate=October 10, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 31, 2006|author=Stephen Holden}}</ref>\n\nJohnson directed the video for [[the Mountain Goats]]' song \"Woke Up New\" in 2006. He is a professed fan{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} of the band and was asked to direct the video when bandleader [[John Darnielle]] noticed a reference to them in the credits for ''Brick''. A song is credited to \"The Hospital Bombers Experience\", which is a reference to the Mountain Goats song titled \"The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton\". Johnson also directed a live performance film of the Mountain Goats' 2009 album ''The Life of the World to Come''. The film consists of a single shot, depicting Darnielle performing the entire album on guitar and piano with minimal accompaniment. This film was screened in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, and Portland, Oregon upon its completion, and was released as a limited edition DVD on [[Record Store Day]] (April 17, 2010).\n\nJohnson's second film, ''[[The Brothers Bloom]]'', is a con-man story released in theaters in May 2009 to moderately positive critical reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brothers_bloom/ |title=The Brothers Bloom reviews |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2010-04-22}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film was assigned a [[weighted average]] score of 55 out of 100 based on 26 reviews from mainstream critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/brothersbloom?q=brothers%20bloom |title=Brothers Bloom, The reviews |work=Metacritic |accessdate=2010-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2009-05-14-bloom-review_N.htm |title='Brothers Bloom' is a con story that doesn't cheat |work=USA Today |author=Puig Claudia |date=May 17, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}{{Rating|3.5|4}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, Johnson announced that he was directing an episode of the TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' for its third season.

After their lair is destroyed by Baxter Stockman's mousers, they find a new home elsewhere in the sewers and also gain new allies in the form of April O'Neil and Casey Jones. The Turtles foil the plans of the Shredder, Hun, and Stockman on numerous occasions before Shredder offers Leonardo a peace offering in exchange for their service, citing an unknown evil they must face together. Splinter reveals the Shredder and Hun's hand in murdering his master Hamato Yoshi, and the two sides come to blows in a battle that seemingly ends in the Shredder's defeat. However, unknown to the Turtles, the Shredder survives, and after his ninjas savagely ambush and wound Leonardo, destroys April's home and believes them dead, though the Turtles, Splinter, Casey and April survive and depart for Casey's family's farm house in rural New York. After Leonardo's wounds heal and their resolve is restored, the group returns to New York to face the Foot Clan. However, after their triumph against the Shredder, Splinter vanishes, and after following a lead from a mysterious group known as the \"Guardians\", the Turtles discover the Utroms, an alien race hiding amongst humanity, and are unable to save Splinter from them before being teleported into space.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]]: the eldest and the leader of the Turtles who wields twin katana swords and a blue mask.

The park preserves about half of [[Mount Desert Island]], many adjacent smaller islands, and part of the [[Schoodic Peninsula]] on the coast of Maine. Acadia was initially designated [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Sieur de Monts]] [[National monument (United States)|National Monument]] by proclamation of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916. Sieur de Monts was renamed and redesignated [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] National Park by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1919\u2014the first national park in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]] and the only one in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The park was renamed [[Acadia]] National Park in 1929. More than 3.5 million people visited the park in 2018.\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] nations have inhabited the area called Acadia for at least 12,000 years.{{citation needed}} They [[Fur trade|traded furs]] for European goods when French, English, and Dutch ships began arriving in the early 17th century. The [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] has held an annual Native American Festival in Bar Harbor since 1989. [[Samuel de Champlain]] named the island Isle des Monts Deserts (Island of Barren Mountains) in 1604. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, then ceded to England in 1713. Summer visitors, nicknamed ''rusticators'', arrived in 1855, followed by wealthy families, nicknamed ''cottagers'' as their large houses were quaintly called [[cottage]]s. [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] is credited with the idea for the park. [[George Dorr|George B. Dorr]], the \"Father of Acadia National Park,\" along with Eliot's father [[Charles William Eliot|Charles W. Eliot]], supported the idea through donations of land, and advocacy at the state and federal levels. [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] financed the construction of carriage roads from 1915 to 1940. A wildfire in 1947 burned much of the park and destroyed 237 houses, including 67 of the millionaires\u2019 cottages.\n\nThe park includes mountains, an ocean coastline, coniferous and deciduous woodlands, lakes, ponds, and wetlands encompassing a total of {{convert|49,075|acre|sqmi km2|1}} {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Key sites on Mount Desert Island include [[Cadillac Mountain]]\u2014the tallest mountain on the eastern coastline and one of the first places in the United States where one can watch the sunrise\u2014a rocky coast featuring Thunder Hole where waves crash loudly into a crevasse around high tides, a sandy swimming beach called Sand Beach, and numerous lakes and ponds. [[Jordan Pond]] features the glacially rounded North and South Bubbles ([[r\u00f4che moutonn\u00e9e]]s) at its northern end, while Echo Lake has the only freshwater swimming beach in the park. [[Somes Sound]] is a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on|spell=in}} long [[fjard]] formed during a [[glacial period]] that reshaped the entire island to its present form, including the [[U-shaped valley]]s containing the many ponds and lakes. The [[Bass Harbor Head Light]] is situated above a steep, rocky headland on the southwest coast\u2014the only lighthouse on the island.\n\nThe park protects the habitats of 37 [[mammal]]ian species including [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[eastern moose|moose]] and [[white-tailed deer]], seven [[reptile|reptilian]] species including [[milk snake]]s and [[common snapping turtle|snapping turtles]], eleven [[amphibian]] species including [[wood frog]]s and [[spotted salamander]]s, 33 [[fish]] species including [[rainbow smelt]] and [[brook trout]], and as many as 331 [[bird]]s including various species of [[Bird of prey|raptors]], [[songbird]]s and [[Anseriformes|waterfowl]]. In 1991, [[peregrine falcon]]s had a successful nesting in Acadia for the first time since 1956. Falcon chicks are often banded to study migration, habitat use, and longevity. Some trails may be closed in spring and early summer to avoid disturbance to falcon nesting areas.\n\nRecreational activities from spring through autumn include car and bus touring along the park's paved loop road; hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding on carriage roads (motor vehicles are prohibited); rock climbing; kayaking and canoeing on lakes and ponds; swimming at Sand Beach and Echo Lake; sea kayaking and guided boat tours on the ocean; and various ranger-led programs. Winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and ice fishing. Two campgrounds are located on Mount Desert Island, another campground is on the Schoodic Peninsula, and five [[lean-to]] sites are on Isle au Haut. The main visitor center is at Hulls Cove, northwest of Bar Harbor.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PenobscotBarkWigwamIn AcadiaPark.JPG|thumb|Replica of a [[Penobscot]] [[birch bark]] [[wigwam]]]]\n\n=== Native people ===\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have inhabited the area called [[Acadia]] for at least 12,000 years, including the coastal areas of Maine, Canada, and adjacent islands.

[[Castine, Maine|Castine]] (''Pentagoet'' in the native language) was the grandchief's favored rendezvous site for the Wabanaki tribes. The site is located just west of Mount Desert Island at the mouth of the [[Bagaduce River]] in eastern [[Penobscot Bay]]. From 1615, Castine developed into a major [[Fur trade|fur trading]] post where French, English, and Dutch traders all fought for control. [[Sealskin]]s, [[moose]] [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and furs were traded by the Wabanakis for European commodities. By the early 1620s, warfare and introduced diseases, including [[smallpox]], [[cholera]] and [[influenza]], had decimated the tribes from Mount Desert Island southward to [[Cape Cod]], leaving about 10 percent of the original population.<ref name=Prins>Prins, Harald E.

The colony was destroyed a short time later by an armed vessel from the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first act of overt warfare in the long struggle leading to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, but ceded to England in 1713. [[Massachusetts]] governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet]] assumed control of the island in 1760. In 1790, Massachusetts granted the eastern half of the island to Cadillac's granddaughter, Mme. de Gregoire, while Bernard's son John retained ownership of the western half. The first record of summer visitors vacationing on the island was in 1855, and steamboat service from [[Boston]] was inaugurated in 1868. The [[Green Mountain Cog Railway]] was built from the shore of Eagle Lake to the summit of [[Cadillac Mountain]] in 1888. In 1901, the Maine Legislature granted Hancock County a charter to acquire and hold land on the island in the public interest. The first land was donated by Mrs. Eliza Homans of Boston in 1908, and {{convert|5,000|acres|sqmi km2|1}} had been acquired by 1914.<ref name=Cammerer2>{{cite book|last=Cammerer |first=Arno B. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qeMBAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Acadia+National+Park%22+%22Cammerer%22&q=Eliza+Homans |title=Acadia National Park |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |date=1937 |location=Washington DC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181207123418/https://books.google.com/books?id=qeMBAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Acadia+National+Park%22+%22Cammerer%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Eliza+Homans |archivedate=December 10, 2018 |url-status=live |quote=Search for each year: 1613, 1688, 1713, 1760, 1790, 1855, 1868, 1888, 1901, 1908 and 1914}}</ref>\n\n=== Rusticators ===\nArtists and journalists had revealed and popularized the island in the mid-1800s. Painters came from the [[Hudson River School]], including [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church|Frederic Church]], inspiring patrons and friends to visit. The term ''rusticator'' was used to describe these early visitors who stayed in the homes of local fishermen and farmers for modest fees. Every summer the rusticators returned to renew friendships with local islanders and to enjoy the fresh salt air and relaxed pace. The accommodations soon became insufficient for the increasing amount of summer visitors, and by 1880, thirty hotels were operating on the island. Tourism was becoming the major industry.<ref name=parkhistory>{{NPS|source=[https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/history-of-acadia.htm \"History of Acadia\"] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20180927061414/https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/history-of-acadia.htm archive]).

Mount Desert Island, being remote from the cities of the east, became a summer retreat for families such as the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], [[Morgan family|Morgans]], [[Henry Ford family tree|Fords]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegies]], and [[Astor family|Astors]]. These families had elegant estates constructed, which they called [[cottage]]s. Luxury, refinement, and large gatherings replaced the [[buckboard]] rides, picnics, and day-long hikes of the rusticators. For more than forty years, the wealthy dominated summer activity on Mount Desert Island, but the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] marked the end of the extravagance.<ref name=parkhistory/>\n\n=== Park origins ===\n[[File:Acadia National Park, George B Dorr and Charles W Eliot on the shore of Jordan Pond.jpg|thumb|[[George Dorr|George B.

The collision buried the schist along with accumulations of sand and [[silt]], creating the Bar Harbor Formation which consists of brown and gray [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]] layers. Material from volcanic flows and ash were also deposited on the formation, creating the volcanic rock found on the Cranberry Islands. Further volcanic activity introduced [[Igneous rock|igneous]] rocks into the Bar Harbor Formation. As the igneous [[Intrusive rock|intrusions]] cooled, crystallized minerals formed including a [[gabbro]] composed of dark, iron-rich minerals.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\n[[File:Acadia National Park, black intrusive igneous rock at Schoodic Point.jpg|thumb|[[Schoodic Peninsula|Schoodic Point]] igneous intrusion]]\nMount Desert Island granite was created about 420 Mya, with one of the oldest granite bodies being Cadillac Mountain, the largest on the island. The granite body rose slowly through bedrock, fracturing it into large pieces, some of which melted under intense heat. As the granite cooled, the bedrock fragments were left surrounded by crystallized granite in a shatter zone that is visible on the eastern side of the mountain. A fine-grained, black igneous rock called diabase intruded into the granite during later volcanic activity.

Coastal areas directly facing the [[Wind wave|wind-driven waves]] of the Atlantic Ocean are solely composed of large boulders as all other material has been washed out to sea. Areas partially protected by rocky headlands contain the remains of more eroded rocks, consisting of pebbles, [[Cobble (geology)|cobbles]] and smaller boulders. Sheltered coves, such as at Sand Beach, contain fine-grained particles that are primarily the remains of shells and other hard parts of marine life, including [[mussel]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nGranitic ridges are subjected to [[frost weathering]]. Joints, or fractures, are slowly enlarged as trapped water repeatedly freezes and melts, eventually splitting off a block. Bright pink scars with granitic rubble below are evidence of such weathering; one example can be seen above the [[Tarn (lake)|Tarn]], a pond just south of Bar Harbor.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nAt least twelve sea caves are located in several coastal areas of the park.

The park preserves about half of [[Mount Desert Island]], many adjacent smaller islands, and part of the [[Schoodic Peninsula]] on the coast of Maine. Acadia was initially designated [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Sieur de Monts]] [[National monument (United States)|National Monument]] by proclamation of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916. Sieur de Monts was renamed and redesignated [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] National Park by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1919\u2014the first national park in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]] and the only one in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The park was renamed [[Acadia]] National Park in 1929. More than 3.5 million people visited the park in 2018.\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] nations have inhabited the area called Acadia for at least 12,000 years. They [[Fur trade|traded furs]] for European goods when French, English, and Dutch ships began arriving in the early 17th century. The [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] has held an annual Native American Festival in Bar Harbor since 1989. [[Samuel de Champlain]] named the island Isle des Monts Deserts (Island of Barren Mountains) in 1604. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, then ceded to England in 1713. Summer visitors, nicknamed ''rusticators'', arrived in 1855, followed by wealthy families, nicknamed ''cottagers'' as their large houses were quaintly called [[cottage]]s. [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] is credited with the idea for the park. [[George Dorr|George B. Dorr]], the \"Father of Acadia National Park,\" along with Eliot's father [[Charles William Eliot|Charles W. Eliot]], supported the idea through donations of land, and advocacy at the state and federal levels. [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] financed the construction of carriage roads from 1915 to 1940. A wildfire in 1947 burned much of the park and destroyed 237 houses, including 67 of the millionaires\u2019 cottages.\n\nThe park includes mountains, an ocean coastline, coniferous and deciduous woodlands, lakes, ponds, and wetlands encompassing a total of {{convert|49,075|acre|sqmi km2|1}} {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Key sites on Mount Desert Island include [[Cadillac Mountain]]\u2014the tallest mountain on the eastern coastline and one of the first places in the United States where one can watch the sunrise\u2014a rocky coast featuring Thunder Hole where waves crash loudly into a crevasse around high tides, a sandy swimming beach called Sand Beach, and numerous lakes and ponds. [[Jordan Pond]] features the glacially rounded North and South Bubbles ([[r\u00f4che moutonn\u00e9e]]s) at its northern end, while Echo Lake has the only freshwater swimming beach in the park. [[Somes Sound]] is a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on|spell=in}} long [[fjard]] formed during a [[glacial period]] that reshaped the entire island to its present form, including the [[U-shaped valley]]s containing the many ponds and lakes. The [[Bass Harbor Head Light]] is situated above a steep, rocky headland on the southwest coast\u2014the only lighthouse on the island.\n\nThe park protects the habitats of 37 [[mammal]]ian species including [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[eastern moose|moose]] and [[white-tailed deer]], seven [[reptile|reptilian]] species including [[milk snake]]s and [[common snapping turtle|snapping turtles]], eleven [[amphibian]] species including [[wood frog]]s and [[spotted salamander]]s, 33 [[fish]] species including [[rainbow smelt]] and [[brook trout]], and as many as 331 [[bird]]s including various species of [[Bird of prey|raptors]], [[songbird]]s and [[Anseriformes|waterfowl]]. In 1991, [[peregrine falcon]]s had a successful nesting in Acadia for the first time since 1956. Falcon chicks are often banded to study migration, habitat use, and longevity. Some trails may be closed in spring and early summer to avoid disturbance to falcon nesting areas.\n\nRecreational activities from spring through autumn include car and bus touring along the park's paved loop road; hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding on carriage roads (motor vehicles are prohibited); rock climbing; kayaking and canoeing on lakes and ponds; swimming at Sand Beach and Echo Lake; sea kayaking and guided boat tours on the ocean; and various ranger-led programs. Winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and ice fishing. Two campgrounds are located on Mount Desert Island, another campground is on the Schoodic Peninsula, and five [[lean-to]] sites are on Isle au Haut. The main visitor center is at Hulls Cove, northwest of Bar Harbor.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PenobscotBarkWigwamIn AcadiaPark.JPG|thumb|Replica of a [[Penobscot]] [[birch bark]] [[wigwam]]]]\n\n=== Native people ===\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have inhabited the area called [[Acadia]] for at least 12,000 years, including the coastal areas of Maine, Canada, and adjacent islands.

[[Castine, Maine|Castine]] (''Pentagoet'' in the native language) was the grandchief's favored rendezvous site for the Wabanaki tribes. The site is located just west of Mount Desert Island at the mouth of the [[Bagaduce River]] in eastern [[Penobscot Bay]]. From 1615, Castine developed into a major [[Fur trade|fur trading]] post where French, English, and Dutch traders all fought for control. [[Sealskin]]s, [[moose]] [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and furs were traded by the Wabanakis for European commodities. By the early 1620s, warfare and introduced diseases, including [[smallpox]], [[cholera]] and [[influenza]], had decimated the tribes from Mount Desert Island southward to [[Cape Cod]], leaving about 10 percent of the original population.<ref name=Prins>Prins, Harald E.

The colony was destroyed a short time later by an armed vessel from the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first act of overt warfare in the long struggle leading to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, but ceded to England in 1713. [[Massachusetts]] governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet]] assumed control of the island in 1760. In 1790, Massachusetts granted the eastern half of the island to Cadillac's granddaughter, Mme. de Gregoire, while Bernard's son John retained ownership of the western half. The first record of summer visitors vacationing on the island was in 1855, and steamboat service from [[Boston]] was inaugurated in 1868. The [[Green Mountain Cog Railway]] was built from the shore of Eagle Lake to the summit of [[Cadillac Mountain]] in 1888. In 1901, the Maine Legislature granted Hancock County a charter to acquire and hold land on the island in the public interest. The first land was donated by Mrs. Eliza Homans of Boston in 1908, and {{convert|5,000|acres|sqmi km2|1}} had been acquired by 1914.<ref name=Cammerer2>{{cite book|last=Cammerer |first=Arno B. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qeMBAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Acadia+National+Park%22+%22Cammerer%22&q=Eliza+Homans |title=Acadia National Park |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |date=1937 |location=Washington DC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181207123418/https://books.google.com/books?id=qeMBAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Acadia+National+Park%22+%22Cammerer%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Eliza+Homans |archivedate=December 10, 2018 |url-status=live |quote=Search for each year: 1613, 1688, 1713, 1760, 1790, 1855, 1868, 1888, 1901, 1908 and 1914}}</ref>\n\n=== Rusticators ===\nArtists and journalists had revealed and popularized the island in the mid-1800s. Painters came from the [[Hudson River School]], including [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church|Frederic Church]], inspiring patrons and friends to visit. The term ''rusticator'' was used to describe these early visitors who stayed in the homes of local fishermen and farmers for modest fees.

Mount Desert Island, being remote from the cities of the east, became a summer retreat for families such as the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], [[Morgan family|Morgans]], [[Henry Ford family tree|Fords]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegies]], and [[Astor family|Astors]]. These families had elegant estates constructed, which they called [[cottage]]s.

White and gray [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], and green [[chlorite]] comprise the schist, which is the oldest rock in the Mount Desert Island region. Erosion and shifting of tectonic plates eventually brought the schist to the surface.<ref name=npsgeology>{{NPS|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/written-in-acadias-rocks.htm |title=Written in Acadia's Rocks |publisher=National Park Service |website=nps.gov |date=March 16, 2015 |accessdate=December 3, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203050258/https://www.nps.gov/articles/written-in-acadias-rocks.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAbout 450 Mya, an ancient [[continental fragment]], or micro-[[terrane]], called [[Avalonia]] collided with North America. The collision buried the schist along with accumulations of sand and [[silt]], creating the Bar Harbor Formation which consists of brown and gray [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]] layers. Material from volcanic flows and ash were also deposited on the formation, creating the volcanic rock found on the Cranberry Islands. Further volcanic activity introduced [[Igneous rock|igneous]] rocks into the Bar Harbor Formation. As the igneous [[Intrusive rock|intrusions]] cooled, crystallized minerals formed including a [[gabbro]] composed of dark, iron-rich minerals.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\n[[File:Acadia National Park, black intrusive igneous rock at Schoodic Point.jpg|thumb|[[Schoodic Peninsula|Schoodic Point]] igneous intrusion]]\nMount Desert Island granite was created about 420 Mya, with one of the oldest granite bodies being Cadillac Mountain, the largest on the island. The granite body rose slowly through bedrock, fracturing it into large pieces, some of which melted under intense heat. As the granite cooled, the bedrock fragments were left surrounded by crystallized granite in a shatter zone that is visible on the eastern side of the mountain. A fine-grained, black igneous rock called diabase intruded into the granite during later volcanic activity. Diabase bodies, or dikes, are visible along the Cadillac Mountain road and on the Schoodic Peninsula.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nDuring the next several hundred million years, the rock layers that still covered the large granite bodies, along with softer rock surrounding the granite, were worn away by erosion.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\n===Glaciation===\n[[File:A079, Acadia National Park, Maine, USA, balanced rock, 2002.jpg|thumb|Bubble Rock, a [[glacial erratic]] on South Bubble mountain]]\nDuring the last two to three million years, a series of [[ice sheet]]s flowed and receded across northern North America, eroding mountains and creating U-shaped valleys.<ref name=npsgeology/>\nThe [[glacier]] that covered Mount Desert Range, part of which is now called Mount Desert Island, was {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} thick and moved at the rate of a few yards (meters) per year. The mountain range was heavily eroded by the glacier which rounded off mountaintops, carved [[Saddle (landform)|saddles]], deepened valleys, and created the fjard known as Somes Sound, nearly dividing the current island in half.<ref name=glacierstory>[https://www.nps.gov/acad/upload/StoryOfGlaciers.pdf \"The Story of Glaciers\"] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170708153736/https://www.nps.gov/acad/upload/StoryOfGlaciers.pdf archive]).

As the climate warmed, the glaciers melted and receded, leaving boulders that had been carried {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} or further south from their original locations. These boulders, or glacial erratics, lie in valleys and on mountaintops, including Bubble Rock on the South Bubble.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nThe coastal areas of Maine sank slightly under the extreme weight of the ice sheets, allowing seawater to cover lowlands thus forming the present-day islands. Evidence of [[sea cave]]s and past beaches can be found about {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} above current sea level. As the ice receded and the land stabilized, lakes and ponds formed in valleys dammed by [[Moraine|glacial debris]]. Rivers and streams flowed again through the watershed, continuing the gradual erosion of the drainage paths.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\n===Erosion and weathering===\n[[File:A080, Acadia National Park, Maine, USA, Otter Cove, 2002.jpg|thumb|Otter Cove from Otter Point]]\nAcadia has a coastline composed of rocky [[headland]]s, and more heavily eroded stony or sandy beaches. Coastal areas directly facing the [[Wind wave|wind-driven waves]] of the Atlantic Ocean are solely composed of large boulders as all other material has been washed out to sea. Areas partially protected by rocky headlands contain the remains of more eroded rocks, consisting of pebbles, [[Cobble (geology)|cobbles]] and smaller boulders. Sheltered coves, such as at Sand Beach, contain fine-grained particles that are primarily the remains of shells and other hard parts of marine life, including [[mussel]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nGranitic ridges are subjected to [[frost weathering]]. Joints, or fractures, are slowly enlarged as trapped water repeatedly freezes and melts, eventually splitting off a block. Bright pink scars with granitic rubble below are evidence of such weathering; one example can be seen above the [[Tarn (lake)|Tarn]], a pond just south of Bar Harbor.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nAt least twelve sea caves are located in several coastal areas of the park. Sea caves are formed when waves cause erosion of coastal rock formations. If a sea cave is enlarged enough, it may break through a [[headland]] to form a [[Natural arch#Coastline|sea arch]].<ref name=geodiversity>{{NPS|source=[https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-geodiversity-atlas-acadia-national-park-maine.htm \"NPS Geodiversity Atlas\u2014Acadia National Park, Maine\"] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20181213101622/https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-geodiversity-atlas-acadia-national-park-maine.htm archive]).

[[Anseriformes|Waterfowl]] species include four [[goose|geese]] ([[Canada goose|Canada]], [[Brant (goose)|brant]], [[Snow goose|snow]], and [[Greater white-fronted goose|greater white-fronted geese]]), along with various [[duck]]s including [[mallard]]s, [[wood duck]]s, [[Northern pintail|pintails]], [[American wigeon|wigeons]], [[Blue-winged teal|blue-winged]] and [[green-winged teal]]s, [[canvasback]]s, [[bufflehead]]s, [[common eider|eiders]], [[common goldeneye|goldeneyes]], and [[harlequin duck]]s. [[Seabird]]s include [[common tern|terns]] and four [[gull]] species ([[American herring gull|herring]], [[laughing gull|laughing]], [[ring-billed gull|ring-billed]], and [[great black-backed gull]]s), while [[wader|shorebirds]] include [[avocet]]s, [[sandpiper]]s and [[plover]]s. [[Passerine|Songbirds]] are represented by various species of [[New World blackbird|blackbirds]], [[chickadee]]s, [[finch]]es, [[jay]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[swallow]]s, [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]], [[vireo]]s, [[New World warbler|warblers]], and [[wren]]s.<ref name=species/>\n\nOne of the more unique songbirds is the [[red crossbill]], a finch that uses its crossed mandibles to efficiently extract the seeds from conifer cones, especially those of spruces, hemlocks, and pines. The crossbills feed their young with the same seeds, rather than the insects which other species feed to their chicks. Any given subspecies of the crossbill (as many as ten are known in North America) will have the same bill size, utilize the same calls to communicate, and prefer certain cones, with smaller-billed birds preferring the smaller cones of hemlocks and larger-billed birds preferring the larger cones of white pines.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/articles/species-spotlight-red-crossbill.htm \"Species Spotlight - Red Crossbill\"] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20181221022418/https://www.nps.gov/articles/species-spotlight-red-crossbill.htm archive]).

It was officially formed in [[Francoist Spain]], in Madrid in January 1961, as a response by some French politicians and French military officers to the [[1961 French referendum on Algerian self-determination|8 January 1961 referendum on self-determination]] concerning Algeria, which had been organised by [[Charles de Gaulle|President de Gaulle]].\n\nBy acts of bombings and targeted assassinations in both metropolitan France and French Algerian territories, which are estimated to have resulted in 2,000 deaths between April 1961 and April 1962, the OAS attempted to prevent Algerian independence. This campaign culminated in a wave of attacks that followed the March 1962 [[\u00c9vian Accords]], which granted independence to Algeria and marked the beginning of the exodus of the ''[[Pied-Noir|pieds-noirs]]'', and in [[Jean Bastien-Thiry]]'s 1962 [[Operation Charlotte Corday|assassination attempt]] against president de Gaulle in the Paris suburb of [[Clamart|Le Petit-Clamart]].  Another prominent target was the [[Existensialism|existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who supported the FLN.\n\nThe OAS still has admirers in French nationalist movements. In July 2006, some OAS sympathisers attempted to relight the flame of the [[Arc de Triomphe#Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] to commemorate the [[Oran massacre of 1962|Oran massacre]] on 5 July 1962.<ref>[http://www.lematindz.net/index.php?news=126&ric=405 ''Les nostalgiques de l'Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise ont la dent dure''], in ''Le MatinDZ'', 13 October 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:16.01.62 Manif anti OAS (1962) - 53Fi961.jpg|thumb|Demonstration against the OAS in January 1962.]]\nThe OAS was created in response to the January 1961 [[French referendum on Algerian self-determination, 1961|referendum on self-determination for Algeria]]. It was founded in Spain, on January 1961, by former officers, [[Pierre Lagaillarde]] (who led the [[Algerian War#The week of barricades|1960 Siege of Algiers]]), General [[Raoul Salan]] (who took part in the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] or \"Generals' Uprising\") and [[Jean-Jacques Susini]], along with other members of the [[French Army]], including [[Yves Gu\u00e9rin-S\u00e9rac]], and former members of the [[French Foreign Legion]] from the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954). ''OAS-M\u00e9tro'', the branch in [[metropolitan France]], was led by captain [[Pierre Sergent]]. These officers united earlier anti-FLN networks such as the ''Organisation de R\u00e9sistance de L'Alg\u00e9rie Fran\u00e7aise''. While the movement had a broadly anticommunist and authoritarian base, in common with the political outlook of many ''colons'', it also included many ex-communists and a number of members who saw its struggle in terms of defending fraternal bonds between Algerians and the ''colons'' against the FLN.<ref name=evans306>Evans, M. ''Algeria: France's Undeclared War''. Oxford: OUP, p.306</ref> In France the OAS mainly recruited amongst overtly fascist political groups. In Algeria its makeup was more politically diverse, and included a group of Algerian Jews, led by Jean Guenassia, who began armed resistance after a series of FLN attacks on the Jewish quarter in Oran.<ref name=evans306/> Some Algerian OAS members conceived of the conflict in terms of the [[French Resistance]],<ref name=evans306/> and in contrast to later Gaullist depictions of the movement, it included a number of former Resistance members in addition to [[Vichy France|Vichy]] collaborators.\n\nResistance against Algerian independence commenced in January 1960, with further violence breaking out in 1961 during the General's Uprising. Daniele Ganser of the [[ETH Zurich|ETH]] Parallel History Project claims that [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] [[stay-behind]] networks, directed by [[NATO]], were involved, but no definitive proof has been found.<ref name=\"ETH chronology\">[http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/news/mediadesk/gladio.cfm Chronology from The Parallel History Project on NATO and the Warsaw Pact], [[ETH Zurich|ETH Zurich Institute]].</ref><ref>Daniele Ganser, ''[[Operation Gladio]]. Terrorism in Western Europe'', Franck Cass, London, 2005.</ref> Both of these insurrections were swiftly suppressed and many of the leaders who had created the OAS were imprisoned.\n\nBy acts of [[sabotage]] and [[assassination]] in both metropolitan France and French Algerian territories, the OAS attempted to prevent Algerian independence. The first victim was Pierre Popie, attorney and president of the [[People's Republican Movement]] (''Mouvement R\u00e9publicain Populaire'', MRP), who stated on TV, \"French Algeria is dead\" (''L\u2019Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise est morte''). [[Roger Gavoury]], head of the French police in [[Algiers]], was assassinated at the direction of [[Roger Degueldre]], leader of the OAS [[Commando Delta]], with the actual killing done by [[Claude Piegts]] and [[Albert Dovecar]] on 31 May 1961 (Piegts and Dovecar were executed by a firing-squad on 7 June 1962. Degueldre on 6 July). The OAS became notorious for ''stroungas'', attacks using plastic explosives.\n\nIn October 1961 Pierre Lagaillarde, who had escaped to [[Francoist Spain]] following the 1960 barricades week, was arrested in Madrid, along with the Italian activist [[Guido Giannettini]].<ref>Ren\u00e9 Monzat, ''Enqu\u00eates sur la droite extr\u00eame'', [[Le Monde]]-\u00e9ditions, 1992, p.91.

As a result, the OAS eventually found itself in violent clandestine conflict with not only the FLN but also French secret services and with a Gaullist paramilitary, the ''Mouvement pour la Communaut\u00e9'' (the MPC). Originally a political movement in Algiers, the MPC eventually became a paramilitary force in response to OAS violence. The group obtained valuable information which was routinely passed on to the French secret services, but was eventually destroyed by OAS assassinations{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.\n\n==March 1962 Evian agreements and the struggle of the OAS ==\n{{See also|Battle of Bab El Oued}}\nThe main hope of the OAS was to prove that the FLN was secretly restarting military action after a ceasefire was agreed in the [[Evian agreements]] of 19 March 1962 and the referendum of June 1962; So, during these three months, the OAS unleashed a new terrorist campaign to force the FLN to abandon the ceasefire. Over 100 bombs a day were detonated by the OAS in March in pursuit of this goal. OAS operatives set off an average of 120 bombs per day in March, with targets including hospitals and schools. Dozens of Arab residents were killed at Place du Gouvernement when 24 mortar rounds were fired from the European stronghold of [[Bab el-Oued]].<ref>Harrison, Alexander (1989).

Despite the OAS bombing campaign, the FLN remained resolute in its agreement to the ceasefire and on 17&nbsp;June 1962 the OAS also began a ceasefire. The Algerian authority officially guaranteed the security of the remaining Europeans, but in early July&nbsp;1962 occurred the [[Oran massacre of 1962|Oran Massacre]]: hundreds of armed people came down to European areas of the city, attacking European civilians.

This anti-communist religious organisation was formed of many Algerian war veterans and close to the OAS.

The story deals primarily with a fictional assassination plot against [[de Gaulle]], where the organisation hires a British contract killer (the Jackal) to kill de Gaulle. Bastien-Thiry and the Petit-Clamart plot figure prominently in the early sections of the story.\n\nForsyth also mentions the OAS in ''[[The Dogs of War (novel)|The Dogs of War]]'', with several of its protagonists having joined the movement. The fictional Colonel Rodin from ''Jackal'' is also alluded to.\n\nThe OAS also featured prominently in [[Jack Higgins]]' ''[[Wrath of the Lion]]'', in which the organization fictionally manages to suborn the crew of a French Navy submarine and use it for missions of revenge.\n\n[[Alain Cavalier]]'s 1964 film ''[[L'Insoumis]]'' stars [[Alain Delon]] as a deserter from the French Foreign Legion who joins the OAS on a kidnapping mission.\n\nThe OAS is referenced in the [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', as suspected conspirator [[Clay Shaw]] (played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]) is alleged to have business connections with them.

The character of Guido (played by [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]]) is a member of OAS. Guido mentions OAS multiple times and together with Mesrine he commits assassination of another OAS member, who in his last moments declares: \"De Gaulle killed us\".\n\nThe OAS is referenced in Ian Fleming's ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)]]''.  [[James Bond]]'s future father-in-law Marc-Ange, the head of a Corsican crime faction known as Union Corse, refers to the OAS in chapter 24, due to the OAS having a French military helicopter in their possession.  Because of the OAS indebtedness to Marc-Ange and the Union Corse, the helicopter is loaned to the [[MI-6]] \u2013 Marc-Ange/Union Corse coalition endeavoring to thwart [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]'s plot to unleash biological warfare in the UK's agricultural industry.\n\n\"OAS\" graffiti appears outside a bakery approximately eight minutes into the 1963 film [[The Bakery Girl of Monceau]]. Two minutes later, following the second appearance of the exterior, similar graffiti appears to have been removed from the facade of the bakery.\n\nThe movie Legion of Honor is about an Englishman who joins the Foreign Legion and is set in Algeria shortly before their independence and \"OAS\" is mentioned numerous times as well as shown in graffiti outside a number of structures.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Alfredo Astiz]]<ref name=astiz/>\n*[[Jacques Bompard]], former OAS supporter, member of the FN since its 1972 creation, and member since December 2005 of [[Philippe de Villiers]]' [[Movement for France]] (MPF)\n*[[Jean-Pierre Cherid]], OAS member who then took a central part in the organisation of the Spanish GAL\n*[[Cit\u00e9 catholique]], a Catholic fundamentalist group which included OAS members and had an important role in teaching [[counter-insurgency]] doctrines to the [[Argentine Armed Forces]]\n*[[Front Alg\u00e9rie Fran\u00e7aise]], an earlier pied-noir extremist group\n*[[Yves Gu\u00e9rin-S\u00e9rac]], one of the founders of the OAS\n*[[Roger Holeindre]], former OAS activist and current vice-president of the FN\n*[[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], former head of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] (FN), was [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour|Tixier-Vignancour]]'s campaign director in 1965\n*[[La Main Rouge]], a similar organisation established earlier, sponsored by French intelligence agencies\n*[[Enrico Mattei]], head of the Italian [[Eni]] oil company and supporter of Algerian independence was threatened by the OAS.

It was officially formed in [[Francoist Spain]], in Madrid in January 1961, as a response by some French politicians and French military officers to the [[1961 French referendum on Algerian self-determination|8 January 1961 referendum on self-determination]] concerning Algeria, which had been organised by [[Charles de Gaulle|President de Gaulle]].\n\nBy acts of bombings and targeted assassinations in both metropolitan France and French Algerian territories, which are estimated to have resulted in 2,000 deaths between April 1961 and April 1962, the OAS attempted to prevent Algerian independence. This campaign culminated in a wave of attacks that followed the March 1962 [[\u00c9vian Accords]], which granted independence to Algeria and marked the beginning of the exodus of the ''[[Pied-Noir|pieds-noirs]]'', and in [[Jean Bastien-Thiry]]'s 1962 [[Operation Charlotte Corday|assassination attempt]] against president de Gaulle in the Paris suburb of [[Clamart|Le Petit-Clamart]].  Another prominent target was the [[Existensialism|existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who supported the FLN.\n\nThe OAS still has admirers in French nationalist movements. In July 2006, some OAS sympathisers attempted to relight the flame of the [[Arc de Triomphe#Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] to commemorate the [[Oran massacre of 1962|Oran massacre]] on 5 July 1962.<ref>[http://www.lematindz.net/index.php?news=126&ric=405 ''Les nostalgiques de l'Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise ont la dent dure''], in ''Le MatinDZ'', 13 October 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:16.01.62 Manif anti OAS (1962) - 53Fi961.jpg|thumb|Demonstration against the OAS in January 1962.]]\nThe OAS was created in response to the January 1961 [[French referendum on Algerian self-determination, 1961|referendum on self-determination for Algeria]]. It was founded in Spain, on January 1961, by former officers, [[Pierre Lagaillarde]] (who led the [[Algerian War#The week of barricades|1960 Siege of Algiers]]), General [[Raoul Salan]] (who took part in the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] or \"Generals' Uprising\") and [[Jean-Jacques Susini]], along with other members of the [[French Army]], including [[Yves Gu\u00e9rin-S\u00e9rac]], and former members of the [[French Foreign Legion]] from the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954). ''OAS-M\u00e9tro'', the branch in [[metropolitan France]], was led by captain [[Pierre Sergent]]. These officers united earlier anti-FLN networks such as the ''Organisation de R\u00e9sistance de L'Alg\u00e9rie Fran\u00e7aise''. While the movement had a broadly anticommunist and authoritarian base, in common with the political outlook of many ''colons'', it also included many ex-communists and a number of members who saw its struggle in terms of defending fraternal bonds between Algerians and the ''colons'' against the FLN.<ref name=evans306>Evans, M. ''Algeria: France's Undeclared War''. Oxford: OUP, p.306</ref> In France the OAS mainly recruited amongst overtly fascist political groups. In Algeria its makeup was more politically diverse, and included a group of Algerian Jews, led by Jean Guenassia, who began armed resistance after a series of FLN attacks on the Jewish quarter in Oran.<ref name=evans306/> Some Algerian OAS members conceived of the conflict in terms of the [[French Resistance]],<ref name=evans306/> and in contrast to later Gaullist depictions of the movement, it included a number of former Resistance members in addition to [[Vichy France|Vichy]] collaborators.\n\nResistance against Algerian independence commenced in January 1960, with further violence breaking out in 1961 during the General's Uprising. Daniele Ganser of the [[ETH Zurich|ETH]] Parallel History Project claims that [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] [[stay-behind]] networks, directed by [[NATO]], were involved, but no definitive proof has been found.<ref name=\"ETH chronology\">[http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/news/mediadesk/gladio.cfm Chronology from The Parallel History Project on NATO and the Warsaw Pact], [[ETH Zurich|ETH Zurich Institute]].</ref><ref>Daniele Ganser, ''[[Operation Gladio]]. Terrorism in Western Europe'', Franck Cass, London, 2005.</ref> Both of these insurrections were swiftly suppressed and many of the leaders who had created the OAS were imprisoned.\n\nBy acts of [[sabotage]] and [[assassination]] in both metropolitan France and French Algerian territories, the OAS attempted to prevent Algerian independence. The first victim was Pierre Popie, attorney and president of the [[People's Republican Movement]] (''Mouvement R\u00e9publicain Populaire'', MRP), who stated on TV, \"French Algeria is dead\" (''L\u2019Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise est morte''). [[Roger Gavoury]], head of the French police in [[Algiers]], was assassinated at the direction of [[Roger Degueldre]], leader of the OAS [[Commando Delta]], with the actual killing done by [[Claude Piegts]] and [[Albert Dovecar]] on 31 May 1961 (Piegts and Dovecar were executed by a firing-squad on 7 June 1962. Degueldre on 6 July). The OAS became notorious for ''stroungas'', attacks using plastic explosives.\n\nIn October 1961 Pierre Lagaillarde, who had escaped to [[Francoist Spain]] following the 1960 barricades week, was arrested in Madrid, along with the Italian activist [[Guido Giannettini]].<ref>Ren\u00e9 Monzat, ''Enqu\u00eates sur la droite extr\u00eame'', [[Le Monde]]-\u00e9ditions, 1992, p.91.

As a result, the OAS eventually found itself in violent clandestine conflict with not only the FLN but also French secret services and with a Gaullist paramilitary, the ''Mouvement pour la Communaut\u00e9'' (the MPC). Originally a political movement in Algiers, the MPC eventually became a paramilitary force in response to OAS violence. The group obtained valuable information which was routinely passed on to the French secret services, but was eventually destroyed by OAS assassinations{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.\n\n==March 1962 Evian agreements and the struggle of the OAS ==\n{{See also|Battle of Bab El Oued}}\nThe main hope of the OAS was to prove that the FLN was secretly restarting military action after a ceasefire was agreed in the [[Evian agreements]] of 19 March 1962 and the referendum of June 1962; So, during these three months, the OAS unleashed a new terrorist campaign to force the FLN to abandon the ceasefire. Over 100 bombs a day were detonated by the OAS in March in pursuit of this goal. OAS operatives set off an average of 120 bombs per day in March, with targets including hospitals and schools. Dozens of Arab residents were killed at Place du Gouvernement when 24 mortar rounds were fired from the European stronghold of [[Bab el-Oued]].<ref>Harrison, Alexander (1989).

This anti-communist religious organisation was formed of many Algerian war veterans and close to the OAS. [[Charles Lacheroy]] and [[Roger Trinquier|Colonel Trinquier]], who theorised the systemic use of [[torture]] in [[counter-insurgency]] doctrine in ''Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency'' (1961), were members, along with Colonel [[Jean Gardes]], who had first theorised counter-insurgency tactics during the [[Indochina War]] (1947\u20131954), Jean Ousset developed the concept of \"[[subversion (politics)|subversion]]\" referring to an essential enemy threatening the existence of [[Occident (movement)|Occident]] itself. Gardes arrived in Argentina in 1963, a year after the end of the Algerian War. There, he delivered counter-insurgency courses at the [[Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy|ESMA]], which became infamous during the \"[[Dirty War]]\" in the 1970s for being used as an [[internment camp|internment]] and torture center. Soon after Gardes met [[Federico Lucas Roussillon]], an Argentine naval lieutenant commander, the [[cadet]]s at the ESMA were shown the film ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]'' (1966) by Italian director [[Gillo Pontecorvo]], during which the fictional Lieutenant-Colonel Mathieu and his paratroops make systematic use of [[Torture during the Algerian War|torture]], [[Block warden system|block warden]] system, and [[death flight]]s.<ref name=\"Robin\"/><ref name=\"Verbitsky\"/>\n\nThe Argentine admiral [[Luis Mar\u00eda Mend\u00eda]] testified in January 2007 that a [[French intelligence agent]], [[Bertrand de Perseval]], had participated in the \"disappearance\" of the two French nuns, [[L\u00e9onie Duquet]] and [[Alice Domon]].

[[James Bond]]'s future father-in-law Marc-Ange, the head of a Corsican crime faction known as Union Corse, refers to the OAS in chapter 24, due to the OAS having a French military helicopter in their possession.  Because of the OAS indebtedness to Marc-Ange and the Union Corse, the helicopter is loaned to the [[MI-6]] \u2013 Marc-Ange/Union Corse coalition endeavoring to thwart [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]'s plot to unleash biological warfare in the UK's agricultural industry.\n\n\"OAS\" graffiti appears outside a bakery approximately eight minutes into the 1963 film [[The Bakery Girl of Monceau]].

[[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] in particular carries [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|strong emotional scars]] from the battle, blaming himself for his family having to nearly sacrifice their lives to stop the Shredder. After the Turtles return to New York, they find that Hun has defected from the [[Foot Clan]], instead returning to the [[Purple Dragons]] and transforming them from a street gang to a sophisticated crime organization. A successful raid on an Earth Protection Force train ends up being the final straw for the [[President of the United States]], who threatens to cut the organization's funding for their repeated recent failures. Desperate to keep his organization afloat, Bishop engineers a [[False flag|staged alien invasion]] with man-made \"aliens\", which successfully convinces the President of his organization's value to protect the Earth. Unknown to Bishop, however, the residue from the destroyed alien clones leaks into New York City's sewers, and after coming into contact with local fauna, mutates them, triggering a massive mutant outbreak. During this outbreak, Baxter Stockman finally clones a new human body for himself, but it along with his sanity deteriorates, and he eventually drowns in the [[Hudson River]] while attacking April O'Neil. Nevertheless, Bishop brings him back from the dead in another cyborg body, deeming him too useful to lose.\n\nIn the meantime, Leo's emotional scars drive him to become progressively more hostile and surly to the point of wounding Splinter in an uncontrollable rage during a training session. Splinter sends Leo on a pilgrimage to the Ancient One, [[Hamato Yoshi]]'s own master and father figure. The Ancient One is able to heal Leo's deep self-doubt and psychological scars, and takes the turtle under his wing. Back in New York, Karai takes up the Shredder's mantle, and rebuilds the Foot Clan to become a much more powerful organization, and with the help of the Foot Mystics, find the Turtles' lair and destroy it. [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], Splinter, and Klunk fake their deaths as they go into hiding. The Ancient One, having foreseen the attack, sends Leo back to New York, where he reunites his family and finds them a new home before defeating Karai, vowing that any further conflict between their clans will result in her death.\n\nThe Turtles struggle to fight Bishop's mutant outbreak, but things take a turn for the worse when Donnie is infected with the chemical agent responsible for the outbreak, mutating him once again. Leatherhead reports that Bishop's chemical agent is reacting violently with the Utrom mutagen already in his body, and will kill him in a matter of days. The group heads to [[Area 51]] to ask for Bishop's aid in returning their brother to normal. Bishop agrees, but charges the Turtles with retrieving the Heart of Tengu, a relic possessed by Karai that an unknown entity has promised will grant him centuries of advancement in technology. The Turtles fulfill the agreement, and thanks to Leatherhead and Stockman's joint effort, cure Don and return him to normal. Meanwhile, Bishop inadvertently destroys the Heart of Tengu, having been fooled into doing so by the entity, who is revealed to be the Water Foot Mystic. The Heart of Tengu was an artifact that enabled the leaders of the Foot Clan to keep the Foot Mystics under their control. Now free, the Foot Mystics resolve to revive the \"one, true Shredder\".\n\nIn the season finale, the Turtles find themselves abducted by the mysterious Ninja Tribunal, along with four other warriors from across the globe.

He went so far as to lash out at Splinter, causing him serious injury. This season is known among of fans as the dark season of the 2003 series.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Story==\nIn the wake of their final battle with [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|the Shredder]], the Turtles retreat to the Jones family farmhouse to rest and recuperate, still heavily wounded and scarred. [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] in particular carries [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|strong emotional scars]] from the battle, blaming himself for his family having to nearly sacrifice their lives to stop the Shredder. After the Turtles return to New York, they find that Hun has defected from the [[Foot Clan]], instead returning to the [[Purple Dragons]] and transforming them from a street gang to a sophisticated crime organization. A successful raid on an Earth Protection Force train ends up being the final straw for the [[President of the United States]], who threatens to cut the organization's funding for their repeated recent failures. Desperate to keep his organization afloat, Bishop engineers a [[False flag|staged alien invasion]] with man-made \"aliens\", which successfully convinces the President of his organization's value to protect the Earth. Unknown to Bishop, however, the residue from the destroyed alien clones leaks into New York City's sewers, and after coming into contact with local fauna, mutates them, triggering a massive mutant outbreak. During this outbreak, Baxter Stockman finally clones a new human body for himself, but it along with his sanity deteriorates, and he eventually drowns in the [[Hudson River]] while attacking April O'Neil. Nevertheless, Bishop brings him back from the dead in another cyborg body, deeming him too useful to lose.\n\nIn the meantime, Leo's emotional scars drive him to become progressively more hostile and surly to the point of wounding Splinter in an uncontrollable rage during a training session. Splinter sends Leo on a pilgrimage to the Ancient One, [[Hamato Yoshi]]'s own master and father figure. The Ancient One is able to heal Leo's deep self-doubt and psychological scars, and takes the turtle under his wing. Back in New York, Karai takes up the Shredder's mantle, and rebuilds the Foot Clan to become a much more powerful organization, and with the help of the Foot Mystics, find the Turtles' lair and destroy it. [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], Splinter, and Klunk fake their deaths as they go into hiding. The Ancient One, having foreseen the attack, sends Leo back to New York, where he reunites his family and finds them a new home before defeating Karai, vowing that any further conflict between their clans will result in her death.\n\nThe Turtles struggle to fight Bishop's mutant outbreak, but things take a turn for the worse when Donnie is infected with the chemical agent responsible for the outbreak, mutating him once again. Leatherhead reports that Bishop's chemical agent is reacting violently with the Utrom mutagen already in his body, and will kill him in a matter of days. The group heads to [[Area 51]] to ask for Bishop's aid in returning their brother to normal. Bishop agrees, but charges the Turtles with retrieving the Heart of Tengu, a relic possessed by Karai that an unknown entity has promised will grant him centuries of advancement in technology. The Turtles fulfill the agreement, and thanks to Leatherhead and Stockman's joint effort, cure Don and return him to normal. Meanwhile, Bishop inadvertently destroys the Heart of Tengu, having been fooled into doing so by the entity, who is revealed to be the Water Foot Mystic.

LINX operates IXPs in [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Cardiff]] in the UK, and [[Northern Virginia]] in the [[United States|USA]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/news/telehouse-opens-177-million-london-docklands-data-center/|title=Telehouse opens $177 million London Docklands data center|website=www.datacenterdynamics.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>\n\nLINX was founded in 1994 by a group of ISPs and educational networks and is a founder member of [[Euro-IX]], a Europe-wide alliance of Internet Exchanges. It is currently [[List of Internet exchange points by size|one of the largest]] neutral IXPs in Europe in terms of average throughput.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLINX is a not-for-profit organisation ([[company limited by guarantee]]). Networks join LINX as members and sign a [[memorandum of understanding]]. Members collectively 'own' the company and all members have a single vote at [[annual general meeting|AGMs]] and EGMs in matters relating to finances, constitution, and what activities LINX may carry out. Members also periodically elect the LINX non-executive board of directors. Members meet at regular LINX meetings to discuss technical, corporate governance, and regulatory matters. LINX has a mandate to not actively compete with its members.\n\n==History==\nBack in November 1994, using a donated piece of equipment no bigger than a video recorder and without any written contracts, five UK-based Internet service providers (ISPs) linked their networks to exchange data and avoid paying high transatlantic bandwidth costs.\n\nLINX effectively began when two ISPs ([[PIPEX]] and UKnet) linked their networks via a 64-kilobit serial link to save the cost and time delay involved in routing data across the Atlantic to US Internet exchanges.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhen [[Demon Internet]], [[UKERNA]] \u2013 the UK academic network \u2013 and other ISPs showed interest in establishing similar serial links, Keith Mitchell, then chief technical officer of PIPEX, initiated a meeting with BT to discuss the creation of a London-based Internet exchange.\n\nPIPEX provided the LINX founders with a Cisco Catalyst&nbsp;1200 switch with eight 10-megabit ports. Rack space was leased at a then virtually empty data centre operated by Telehouse International Corporation of Europe Ltd at Coriander Avenue in London's Docklands.\n\nSwitching the first data through the Telehouse hub was a momentous event that was accomplished by primarily technical specialists who were unconcerned about the formalities of legal contracts. However, while PIPEX continued to provide administrative and technical oversight, the need for a formal constitution was eventually recognised.\n\nThe solution was to form a company limited by guarantee. Lawyers produced a draft memorandum and constitution which was extensively modified by members. The company was formed in 1995 and a board of five non-executive directors was elected, with Keith Mitchell as the initial chairman.\n\n===Not for profit organisation===\nFrom the beginning, it was agreed that LINX would be a non-profit organisation run for the benefit of members and governed collectively through regular member meetings, a practice which continues to this day.\n\nWhile PIPEX continued to provide administrative oversight \u2013 charged at cost to LINX \u2013 member meetings were held every two months (now every three months) to decide strategic direction. Eventually, it was accepted that the purely co-operative system of operation at LINX was becoming overly demanding and in late 1996 Keith Mitchell accepted the role of full-time chairman, working with a personal assistant from offices in Peterborough.\n\nIn the summer of 1996 LINX became the first Internet exchange in the world to deploy a 100-megabit switch \u2013 a Cisco Catalyst 5000. In January 1999 it pioneered the implementation of a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) running over gigabit Ethernet connections.\n\nAs the Internet grew in popularity, legislators and law enforcement agencies inevitably decided it must be regulated. LINX increasingly found itself taking on non-core activities, such as providing expert advice on behalf of its members (and, therefore, the whole industry) to a wide range of official agencies.\n\nIn 1999 LINX appointed its first full-time regulation officer in Roland Perry to advise organisations such as the Home Office Internet Task Force, the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, the Department of Trade and Industry and relevant departments of the EU Commission. In 2003 Roland was succeeded by Malcolm Hutty when Roland left to form his own advisory group.\n\nLINX also actively and financially supports the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] which, since 1996, has worked to eradicate child abuse images from the UK Internet. Initial funding from LINX was instrumental in enabling the IWF to launch and the decision to create the IWF and define its charter was taken at a LINX member meeting in Heathrow.\n\n===LINX in the twenty-first century===\n'''2000''' \u2013 a training manager was appointed to introduce an accredited training programme for Internet engineers and technicians.\n\n'''2001''' \u2013 LINX amended its corporate structure to make the post of chairman non-executive and appointed its first chief executive officer, John Souter, previously UK managing director of German-owned Varetis Communications.\n\n'''2002''' \u2013 LINX was the first exchange to introduce 10G Ethernet operation, using equipment from Foundry Networks \u2013 in fact, the second of their worldwide customers to deploy their technology.\n\n'''2003''' \u2013 This year saw the launch of the 'LINX from Anywhere' service, a facility that permits smaller ISPs to piggyback on the networks of existing members to obtain a secure, virtual presence on the LINX exchange without incurring the manpower and rackspace costs of having their own installation in London.\n\n'''2004''' \u2013 LINX considerably expanded its footprint, with four new points of presence (PoPs) \u2013 all in the Docklands area of London.\n\n'''2005''' \u2013 LINX members vote to make public affairs one of the company's \"core functions\", placing it on an equal footing with peering and interconnection.\n\n'''2006''' \u2013 LINX membership reached 200.\n\n'''2008''' \u2013 LINX expanded again opening three new PoPs, this time adding considerably to the geographical diversity by doing so in the City of London, North Acton and Slough. It also heralded new relationships with data centre operators, with the addition of Interxion and Equinix (to the pre-existing ones of Telehouse and Telecity).\n\n'''2011''' \u2013 The LINX primary LAN was redesigned to a VPLS-based infrastructure with a new vendor, Juniper Networks.\n\n'''2012''' \u2013 The ConneXions reseller programme launched. Also this year LINX became the first Internet exchange in the world to install a Juniper PTX5000 in a live network and the exchange opened its first site outside London in Manchester (IXManchester).\n\n'''2013''' \u2013 In the Autumn two further local exchanges were launched. IXScotland in Edinburgh and LINX NoVA in North Virginia, USA, the exchange's first sites outside England.\n\n'''2014''' \u2013 In the Autumn a local exchange was launched, IXCardiff in [[Wales]].\n\n'''2017''' \u2013 Following the passage of the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016|Investigatory Powers Act]], a new constitution was proposed which would ban directors from reporting the installation of surveillance equipment to members.

These restore connectivity within tenths of a second in the event of the loss of a network segment.\n\nIn addition to the main peering infrastructure, LINX provides managed private interconnections (via [[Single-mode optical fiber|Single Mode Fibre]]) between LINX members, and works with a number of fibre carriers to provide rapid connection between LINX members for private circuits. These PI circuits may be used for any purpose but are mainly intended for Private Peering arrangements between members. Private Peering is sometimes more appropriate for managing large flows of traffic between ISPs and/or Content Providers.\n\nTelehouse hosts the vast majority of internet peering traffic from LINX.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Public affairs==\nOne of LINX's core functions is to represent its members in matters of public policy. LINX's Public Affairs department works to obtain advance warning of public policy developments that could affect LINX members, to inform members about important policy developments at a time when it is still possible to influence them, and to educate, inform and influence regulators and legislators.\n\nAt the UK level, LINX liaises directly with policymakers on matters such as content regulation, telecoms regulation, privacy and data protection, e-mail spam, online fraud/phishing, law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and any other topics that affect LINX members.\n\nAt the European level, LINX is an active member of [[EuroISPA]] and works with EuroISPA's other national associations to influence European policy.\n\nLINX also works actively with partner organisations such as the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] (IWF) and the [[Internet Society]] (ISOC). LINX was instrumental in the creation of the Internet Watch Foundation, the UK hotline for reporting and removing [[child sexual abuse material]] from the Internet, and continues to advise the IWF as a member of its Funding Council.\n\nAs a mutual, membership-based organisation, all of LINX's public affairs activity is informed and guided by extensive and ongoing consultation with LINX members.\n\n==Local exchanges==\n\n===LINX Manchester===\nLaunched in April 2012 IXManchester, now known as LINX Manchester was initially a single-site platform based on a stand-alone Brocade BigIron RX-16 switch, repurposed from the primary LAN in London. A new design extends the network to two new sites \u2013 M247's IceColo & Joule House and brings in completely new hardware from Extreme Networks.\n\nThe new network will be configured as an EAPS protected ring, topology currently used for the secondary LINX LAN in London. All sites will use a Summit X670v switch, capable of connecting 48x10 Gb member ports. Telecity Williams will also have a smaller Summit X460 switch for terminating slower ports.\n\nThe links between sites will be provisioned on a dark fibre provided by NTL and lit by LINX with the use of SFP+ DWDM transceivers and passive DWDM MUX units. Initial ISL capacity will be configured at 20 Gbit/s but easily upgradeable to 80 Gbit/s if required.\n\n===LINX Scotland===\nLocated in Pulsant's South Gyle data centre in Edinburgh (formerly Scolocate), IXScotland, now known as LINX Scotland, was officially launched in November 2013. The site will use the latest hardware from Extreme Networks enabling all the advanced features expected from a modern exchange.\n\n===LINX Cardiff===\nLocated in BT's Stadium House data centre in Cardiff. IXCardiff, now known as LINX Cardiff was officially launched on 15 October 2014 in an effort to decentralise UK internet traffic.\n\nAs of July 2018, LINX Cardiff has a typical peak of 0.9976 Gbit/s of network traffic with a maximum peak of 1.03 Gbit/s as of 1 December 2017.\n\n===LINX NoVA===\nFollowing discussions with the US network community, and its own members, LINX decided to launch an open peering exchange in North America in late 2013. Formally to be known as LINX NoVA, the exchange will be closely aligned with, and endorsed by, the newly formed [[Open-IX]], using systems and processes that have proved successful in Europe and the wider world for nearly 20 years.\n\nBased in the North Virginia/Washington DC area LINX NoVA initially spanned three data centres \u2013 EvoSwitch in Manassas, Digital Realty in Ashburn and Coresite in Reston \u2013 and will be connected using dark fibre lit by LINX. An agreement for a fourth colo site, also in Ashburn, is expected shortly.\n\nThe LINX NoVA exchange will use cutting-edge MX960 router equipment from Juniper Networks capable of delivering 100G member ports from launch with the three PoPs all connected by diverse dark fibre lit by LINX.\n\nLINX NoVA will be developed in the same way as the LINX primary LAN in London (VPLS, separated core and edge, etc.) but as a stand-alone site not requiring a connection to the LANs operated in the London, UK.\n\n==Other activities==\nLINX also carries on a number of non-core activities (NCAPs) from time to time, for example the LINX Accredited Internet Technician (LAIT) training programme.\n\nOther services provided include a time service using [[atomic clock]]s, as well as hosting for other \"Good of the Internet\" services including various Internet statistics projects, numerous [[Name server|secondary name servers]] for various [[ccTLD]] domains, and instances of the F, K and I [[root nameserver]]s.\n\nLatest news for 2018/19 sees LINX launch an IXP partner relationship with Japan IX allowing customers to connect to LINX in London and also LINX and Saudi Telecom Company (STC), on December 7, 2018 marked the start of '''JED-IX driven by LINX''', an Internet exchange in Jeddah (JED-IX), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).\n\n==See also==\nSome other Internet exchange points in London:\n* [[London Internet Providers Exchange]] (LIPEX)\n* [[LoNAP|London Network Access Point]] (LONAP)\n* [[Packet Exchange]] (Formerly XchangePoint)\n\nLINX hosts a number of meetings where network operators can exchange information: see [[Internet network operators' group]] for a list of other organisations holding similar meetings.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Internet exchange points]]\n* [[Internet network operators' group]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.linx.net/ Official Website]\n\n{{Telecommunications industry in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[Category:Internet exchange points in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Media and communications in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{redir|LINX|other uses|Linx (disambiguation)}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{primary sources|date=May 2014}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2014}}\n{{tone|date=May 2014}}\n}}\n{{infobox Internet exchange point\n| name         = London Internet Exchange\n| image        =\n| image_width  =\n| full_name    =London Internet Exchange\n| abbreviation = LINX\n| founded      = 1994\n| location     = {{GBR}}, London\n| members      = 787 {{As of|2018|July|lc=1}}\n| ports        = 1,886 {{As of|2018|July|lc=1}}\n| peers        =\n| website      = [https://www.linx.net/ www.linx.net]\n| peak         = [https://stats.linx.net/lans 4.73 Tbit/s] {{As of|2020|March|lc=1}}<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2020-03-18|title=Call of Duty Warzone - LINX Sees Record UK Internet Traffic - ISPreview UK|url=https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2020/03/call-of-duty-warzone-linx-sees-record-uk-internet-traffic.html|website=www.ispreview.co.uk}}</ref>\n| peak_in      =\n| peak_out     =\n| daily_in     =\n| daily_out    =\n|Member ASNs=832 {{As of|2018|July|lc=1}}}}{{coord|51.511453|-0.003418|region:GB_type:landmark_scale:2000_source:Google|display=title}}\n\n[[Image:TelehouseDocklands.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Telehouse Docklands]], home of the '''London Internet Exchange''' since 1994.]]\nThe '''London Internet Exchange (\"LINX\")''' is a [[Mutual organization|mutually governed]] [[Internet exchange point]] (IXP) that provides [[peering]] services and public policy representation to over 820 [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) and other network operators (over 870 different ASNs).

It is currently [[List of Internet exchange points by size|one of the largest]] neutral IXPs in Europe in terms of average throughput.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLINX is a not-for-profit organisation ([[company limited by guarantee]]). Networks join LINX as members and sign a [[memorandum of understanding]]. Members collectively 'own' the company and all members have a single vote at [[annual general meeting|AGMs]] and EGMs in matters relating to finances, constitution, and what activities LINX may carry out. Members also periodically elect the LINX non-executive board of directors. Members meet at regular LINX meetings to discuss technical, corporate governance, and regulatory matters. LINX has a mandate to not actively compete with its members.\n\n==History==\nBack in November 1994, using a donated piece of equipment no bigger than a video recorder and without any written contracts, five UK-based Internet service providers (ISPs) linked their networks to exchange data and avoid paying high transatlantic bandwidth costs.\n\nLINX effectively began when two ISPs ([[PIPEX]] and UKnet) linked their networks via a 64-kilobit serial link to save the cost and time delay involved in routing data across the Atlantic to US Internet exchanges.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhen [[Demon Internet]], [[UKERNA]] \u2013 the UK academic network \u2013 and other ISPs showed interest in establishing similar serial links, Keith Mitchell, then chief technical officer of PIPEX, initiated a meeting with BT to discuss the creation of a London-based Internet exchange.\n\nPIPEX provided the LINX founders with a Cisco Catalyst&nbsp;1200 switch with eight 10-megabit ports. Rack space was leased at a then virtually empty data centre operated by Telehouse International Corporation of Europe Ltd at Coriander Avenue in London's Docklands.\n\nSwitching the first data through the Telehouse hub was a momentous event that was accomplished by primarily technical specialists who were unconcerned about the formalities of legal contracts. However, while PIPEX continued to provide administrative and technical oversight, the need for a formal constitution was eventually recognised.\n\nThe solution was to form a company limited by guarantee. Lawyers produced a draft memorandum and constitution which was extensively modified by members. The company was formed in 1995 and a board of five non-executive directors was elected, with Keith Mitchell as the initial chairman.\n\n===Not for profit organisation===\nFrom the beginning, it was agreed that LINX would be a non-profit organisation run for the benefit of members and governed collectively through regular member meetings, a practice which continues to this day.\n\nWhile PIPEX continued to provide administrative oversight \u2013 charged at cost to LINX \u2013 member meetings were held every two months (now every three months) to decide strategic direction. Eventually, it was accepted that the purely co-operative system of operation at LINX was becoming overly demanding and in late 1996 Keith Mitchell accepted the role of full-time chairman, working with a personal assistant from offices in Peterborough.\n\nIn the summer of 1996 LINX became the first Internet exchange in the world to deploy a 100-megabit switch \u2013 a Cisco Catalyst 5000. In January 1999 it pioneered the implementation of a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) running over gigabit Ethernet connections.\n\nAs the Internet grew in popularity, legislators and law enforcement agencies inevitably decided it must be regulated. LINX increasingly found itself taking on non-core activities, such as providing expert advice on behalf of its members (and, therefore, the whole industry) to a wide range of official agencies.\n\nIn 1999 LINX appointed its first full-time regulation officer in Roland Perry to advise organisations such as the Home Office Internet Task Force, the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, the Department of Trade and Industry and relevant departments of the EU Commission. In 2003 Roland was succeeded by Malcolm Hutty when Roland left to form his own advisory group.\n\nLINX also actively and financially supports the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] which, since 1996, has worked to eradicate child abuse images from the UK Internet. Initial funding from LINX was instrumental in enabling the IWF to launch and the decision to create the IWF and define its charter was taken at a LINX member meeting in Heathrow.\n\n===LINX in the twenty-first century===\n'''2000''' \u2013 a training manager was appointed to introduce an accredited training programme for Internet engineers and technicians.\n\n'''2001''' \u2013 LINX amended its corporate structure to make the post of chairman non-executive and appointed its first chief executive officer, John Souter, previously UK managing director of German-owned Varetis Communications.\n\n'''2002''' \u2013 LINX was the first exchange to introduce 10G Ethernet operation, using equipment from Foundry Networks \u2013 in fact, the second of their worldwide customers to deploy their technology.\n\n'''2003''' \u2013 This year saw the launch of the 'LINX from Anywhere' service, a facility that permits smaller ISPs to piggyback on the networks of existing members to obtain a secure, virtual presence on the LINX exchange without incurring the manpower and rackspace costs of having their own installation in London.\n\n'''2004''' \u2013 LINX considerably expanded its footprint, with four new points of presence (PoPs) \u2013 all in the Docklands area of London.\n\n'''2005''' \u2013 LINX members vote to make public affairs one of the company's \"core functions\", placing it on an equal footing with peering and interconnection.\n\n'''2006''' \u2013 LINX membership reached 200.\n\n'''2008''' \u2013 LINX expanded again opening three new PoPs, this time adding considerably to the geographical diversity by doing so in the City of London, North Acton and Slough.

The list is sorted by film and character, as some of the characters were portrayed by multiple actors.\n\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\nIndicators only apply for characters portrayed within multiple categories. All characters without indicators were introduced within the category they are listed on. The cast is divided in six categories: main saga (M), anthology series (A), animated series and ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film (S), books (B), comic books (C), and the non-canonical ''Legends'' series (L).\n\nList indicators:\n*<small>{{note|cast-M|M}} denotes the character was introduced within the '''main saga'''.</small>\n*<small>{{note|cast-A|A}} denotes the character was introduced within the '''anthology series'''.</small>\n*<small>{{note|cast-S|S}} denotes the character was introduced within an '''animated series or ''The Clone Wars'' film'''.</small>\n**<small>{{note|cast-LS|LS}} denotes the character originated within a '''non-canonical ''[[Star Wars Legends]]'' animated series of film''' before being introduced into the [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]].</small>\n*<small>{{note|cast-B|B}} denotes the character was introduced within a '''novel'''.</small>\n**<small>{{note|cast-LB|LB}} denotes the character originated within a '''non-canonical ''[[Star Wars Legends]]'' novel''' before being introduced into the [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]].</small>\n*<small>{{note|cast-C|C}} denotes the character was introduced within a '''comic book''' or '''graphic novel'''.</small>\n**<small>{{note|cast-LC|LC}} denotes the character originated within a '''non-canonical ''[[Star Wars Legends]]'' comic book''' or '''graphic novel''' before being introduced into the [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]].</small>\n*<small>{{note|cast-+|+}} denotes the character introduced within the current category, but also has an extended plot-line within another category. (Example: {{note|cast-+A|+A}} would denote the character was introduced within the current category but has an extended plot-line in the anthology series, alternatively {{note|cast-+S|+S}} would denote an extended plot-line in the animated series, and {{note|cast-+AS|+AS}} would denote extended plot-lines on both categories.)</small>\n</blockquote>\n\n==''Star Wars'' canon==\n\n===Skywalker saga===\n<!-- Please do NOT count doubles and stunt performers. Doubles are only listed if they perform a significant amount of the character screen time and are thus serving as a cast member rather than a stand-in. E.g. Joonas Suatomo, despite being a double, actually appears as Chewbacca more often than Peter Mayhew in ''TFA''. In this case, it is necessary to list him.

His renown primarily rests upon his brilliant achievements as a painter, the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', being two of the most famous artworks ever created, but also upon his diverse skills as a scientist and inventor. He became so highly valued during his lifetime that the [[Francois I of France|King of France]] bore him home like a trophy of war, supported him in his old age and, according to legend, cradled his head as he died.\n\nLeonardo's portrait was used, within his own lifetime, as the iconic image of [[Plato]] in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]''. His biography was written in superlative terms by [[Vasari]]. He has been repeatedly acclaimed the greatest genius to have lived. His painting of the ''Mona Lisa'' has been the most imitated artwork of all time and his drawing the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' iconically represents the fusion of Art and Science.\n\nLeonardo's biography has appeared in many forms, both scholarly and fictionalized. Every known aspect of his life has been scrutinized and analyzed. His paintings, drawings and notebooks have been studied, reproduced and analyzed for five centuries. The interest in and appreciation of the character of Leonardo and his talents has never waned.\n\nLeonardo has appeared in many fictional works, such as novels, television shows, video games and movies, the first such fiction dating from the 16th century. Various characters have been named after him.\n\n== Artworks after originals by Leonardo ==\n\n=== Copies ===\n[[File:Peter Paul Ruben's copy of the lost Battle of Anghiari.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Peter Paul Rubens]]' copy of the lost ''Battle of Anghiari'']]\n\nLeonardo's pupils and followers copied or closely imitated many of his pictures. Several of his important works exist only as copies by his admirers. These include:\n* His cartoon of ''[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist]]'' copied as an oil painting by Luini\n* [[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|''The Battle of Anghiari'']] was copied several times by unknown Florentine artists as well by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].\n* ''[[Leda and the Swan (Leonardo)|Leda and the Swan]]'' exists only as copies in the [[Louvre]] and [[Galleria Borghese|Villa Borhgese]].\n\nOther much much-copied works include:\n* ''Mona Lisa'' for which Angela della Chiesa cites 14 examples of which 6 are bare-breasted. These include paintings by [[Bernardino Luini]], [[Sala\u00ec]] and [[Joos van Cleve]].\n* ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]'' for which there exist at least five versions by other hands including Salai.\n\n=== Parodies ===\n\n{{Main|Mona Lisa replicas & reinterpretations}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Sapeck-La Joconde fumant la pipe.jpg\n| width1 = 100\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = ''Le rire'' (The laugh) by Eug\u00e8ne Bataille, or [[Sapeck]] (1883)\n| image2 = \n| width2 = 100\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]] (1919)\n| footer = \n}}\nNo painting has been more imitated and satirised than the ''Mona Lisa''.

Because of the painting's overwhelming stature, [[Dada]]ists and [[surrealism|Surrealists]] often produce modifications and [[caricature]]s. Already in 1883, ''Le rire,'' an image of a Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, by [[Sapeck]] (Eug\u00e8ne Bataille), was shown at the \"[[Incoherents]]\" show in Paris. In 1919, [[Marcel Duchamp]], one of the most influential modern artists, created ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'', a ''Mona Lisa'' parody made by adorning a cheap reproduction with a moustache and a goatee, as well as adding the rude inscription, when read out loud in French sounds like \"Elle a chaud au cul\" literally translated: \"she has a hot ass\".

This painting, which was the triumph of the [[Paris salon|Salon of 1781]], included a portrayal of the [[Borghese Gladiator]] (M\u00e9nageot probably having seen it at the [[Villa Borghese]] during his stay at the [[French Academy in Rome]] from 1769 to 1774), although this was an anachronism since Leonardo died in 1519, about ninety years before the statue was discovered.\n\nIn 1818 ''[[The Death of Leonardo da Vinci]]'' by the French painter, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], depicts the scene of Leonardo's death shown taking place in the home [[Clos Luc\u00e9]], which was provided for him at [[Amboise]] by King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. The King is shown supporting Leonardo's head as he dies, as described by [[Vasari]], watched by the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] who is comforted by a cardinal. A distraught young man may represent Leonardo's pupil Melzi.\n\nThe treatment of this subject by Ingres is indicative of Leonardo's iconic status and also specifically that he was of particular significance to the school of French Classicism. A number of his paintings had passed into the Royal collection and certain elements of them were much imitated. Leonardo's manner of soft shading known as [[sfumato]] was particularly adapted by Ingres, [[Jacques-Louis David]] and their followers. An influential painting was ''[[Leda and the Swan#In painting|Leda and the swan]]'', now regarded as by a pupil of Leonardo but then generally accepted as the master's work.\n\n===Statues===\n\n* A monument to Leonardo was erected in 1872 in Piazza del Scala, Milan.

Leonardo helps the assassin decipher encrypted codex pages left behind by legendary master assassin, Altair (the protagonist of the original ''Assassin's Creed'' game). Leonardo's flying machine is successfully built and helps Ezio travel across [[Venice]] in order to assassinate one of his targets. Leonardo makes a brief appearance in ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'' novel. Ezio and his close friend and fellow Assassin, [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] visit him during the week that he died, present at his side while he passes away. Machiavelli recalls a rumour that King Francis cradled his head in his arms as he died, to which Ezio remarked: \"Some people \u2013 even Kings \u2013 will do anything for publicity\".\n\n==== ''The Da Vinci Code'' ====\nThis work of fiction has been the centre of controversy over the accuracy of its depictions of Christianity and of Leonardo.\n\nA bestselling 2003 novel by [[Dan Brown]], adapted and released as a major [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|motion picture]] in 2006, ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' revolves around a conspiracy based on elements of Leonardo's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]'' and other works. A preface to the novel claims that depictions of artworks, secret societies and rites described within the novel are factual. For this reason much of the content of the novel has been widely accepted by readers as authoritative. Because the theme involves a conspiracy within the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] over the life of Jesus and the suggestion that the Church has hidden the facts of his marriage, there has been a strong reaction against the novel and much material published examining and refuting its claims.\n\nWithin the novel it is claimed that from 1510\u20131519, Leonardo was the Grand Master of a secret society, the [[Priory of Sion]].  In reality this society existed only as a 20th-century hoax, but author Dan Brown used as a source the 1982 [[pseudohistory]] book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]''.  The writers of this book had based their research on forged medieval documents that had been created as part of the Priory of Sion fraud. The mix of fact and fiction in the documents made it difficult to discount immediately as a forgery. For example, it was claimed that the Grand Master prior to Leonardo was [[Botticelli]], who had indeed had an association with Leonardo, as they were both students at the Florence workshop of [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].\n\nThe Priory of Sion story and the veracity of ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' was eventually debunked, and many of those involved publicly recanted, although Dan Brown continued to assert that the facts as presented were true.\n\nIn portraying the Priory of Sion as \"fact\" ''The Da Vinci Code'' expanded on the claims in ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'':\n* That there were additional secrets hidden in Leonardo's paintings, such as an \"M\" letter in the painting of [[The Last Supper]], indicating the presence of [[Mary Magdalene]] and that the figure to the left of Jesus traditionally said to represent [[John the Evangelist]] actually represents [[Mary Magdalene]].\n* That the ''Mona Lisa'' was actually a self-portrait.\n* That among the differences in the two versions of the painting of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' which hang in the [[Louvre]] and London's [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], is the fact that in the Louvre painting the baby to the left of the picture depicts Jesus, and to the right [[John the Baptist]], rather than the accepted view, which is the other way round.\n* That Leonardo invented a [[cryptex]] for carrying secret messages.\n\nThe book also used a variation of Leonardo's backwards handwriting to hide a secret message on the American bookjacket.\n\nAmong the many criticisms of Brown's writing is that he uses the name da Vinci (meaning \"from Vinci\") in the manner that surnames are commonly used nowadays. Leonardo would never have been referred to simply as \"da Vinci\" in his lifetime. Such designations were appended to common baptismal names in order to identify individuals.\n\n=== Film ===\nFilms which are about the life of Leonardo or in which he appears as a character:\n* ''Leonardo Da Vinci'' (1919), silent film\n*''[[The Life of Leonardo da Vinci]]'' (1971) starring [[Philippe Leroy (actor)|Philippe Leroy]] as Leonardo da Vinci<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEezdSQA4JMC&pg=PA29 |title=Leonardo.

His renown primarily rests upon his brilliant achievements as a painter, the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', being two of the most famous artworks ever created, but also upon his diverse skills as a scientist and inventor. He became so highly valued during his lifetime that the [[Francois I of France|King of France]] bore him home like a trophy of war, supported him in his old age and, according to legend, cradled his head as he died.\n\nLeonardo's portrait was used, within his own lifetime, as the iconic image of [[Plato]] in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]''. His biography was written in superlative terms by [[Vasari]]. He has been repeatedly acclaimed the greatest genius to have lived. His painting of the ''Mona Lisa'' has been the most imitated artwork of all time and his drawing the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' iconically represents the fusion of Art and Science.\n\nLeonardo's biography has appeared in many forms, both scholarly and fictionalized. Every known aspect of his life has been scrutinized and analyzed. His paintings, drawings and notebooks have been studied, reproduced and analyzed for five centuries. The interest in and appreciation of the character of Leonardo and his talents has never waned.\n\nLeonardo has appeared in many fictional works, such as novels, television shows, video games and movies, the first such fiction dating from the 16th century. Various characters have been named after him.\n\n== Artworks after originals by Leonardo ==\n\n=== Copies ===\n[[File:Peter Paul Ruben's copy of the lost Battle of Anghiari.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Peter Paul Rubens]]' copy of the lost ''Battle of Anghiari'']]\n\nLeonardo's pupils and followers copied or closely imitated many of his pictures. Several of his important works exist only as copies by his admirers. These include:\n* His cartoon of ''[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist]]'' copied as an oil painting by Luini\n* [[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|''The Battle of Anghiari'']] was copied several times by unknown Florentine artists as well by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].\n* ''[[Leda and the Swan (Leonardo)|Leda and the Swan]]'' exists only as copies in the [[Louvre]] and [[Galleria Borghese|Villa Borhgese]].\n\nOther much much-copied works include:\n* ''Mona Lisa'' for which Angela della Chiesa cites 14 examples of which 6 are bare-breasted. These include paintings by [[Bernardino Luini]], [[Sala\u00ec]] and [[Joos van Cleve]].\n* ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]'' for which there exist at least five versions by other hands including Salai.\n\n=== Parodies ===\n\n{{Main|Mona Lisa replicas & reinterpretations}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Sapeck-La Joconde fumant la pipe.jpg\n| width1 = 100\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = ''Le rire'' (The laugh) by Eug\u00e8ne Bataille, or [[Sapeck]] (1883)\n| image2 = \n| width2 = 100\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]] (1919)\n| footer = \n}}\nNo painting has been more imitated and satirised than the ''Mona Lisa''. Beginning possibly with a naked portrait of [[Diane de Poitiers]] by [[Clouet]], the pose and expression have been freely adapted to many female portraits.\nThe [[avant-garde]] art world has made note of the undeniable fact of the ''Mona Lisa's'' popularity. Because of the painting's overwhelming stature, [[Dada]]ists and [[surrealism|Surrealists]] often produce modifications and [[caricature]]s. Already in 1883, ''Le rire,'' an image of a Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, by [[Sapeck]] (Eug\u00e8ne Bataille), was shown at the \"[[Incoherents]]\" show in Paris. In 1919, [[Marcel Duchamp]], one of the most influential modern artists, created ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'', a ''Mona Lisa'' parody made by adorning a cheap reproduction with a moustache and a goatee, as well as adding the rude inscription, when read out loud in French sounds like \"Elle a chaud au cul\" literally translated: \"she has a hot ass\".

This painting, which was the triumph of the [[Paris salon|Salon of 1781]], included a portrayal of the [[Borghese Gladiator]] (M\u00e9nageot probably having seen it at the [[Villa Borghese]] during his stay at the [[French Academy in Rome]] from 1769 to 1774), although this was an anachronism since Leonardo died in 1519, about ninety years before the statue was discovered.\n\nIn 1818 ''[[The Death of Leonardo da Vinci]]'' by the French painter, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], depicts the scene of Leonardo's death shown taking place in the home [[Clos Luc\u00e9]], which was provided for him at [[Amboise]] by King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. The King is shown supporting Leonardo's head as he dies, as described by [[Vasari]], watched by the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] who is comforted by a cardinal. A distraught young man may represent Leonardo's pupil Melzi.\n\nThe treatment of this subject by Ingres is indicative of Leonardo's iconic status and also specifically that he was of particular significance to the school of French Classicism. A number of his paintings had passed into the Royal collection and certain elements of them were much imitated. Leonardo's manner of soft shading known as [[sfumato]] was particularly adapted by Ingres, [[Jacques-Louis David]] and their followers. An influential painting was ''[[Leda and the Swan#In painting|Leda and the swan]]'', now regarded as by a pupil of Leonardo but then generally accepted as the master's work.\n\n===Statues===\n\n* A monument to Leonardo was erected in 1872 in Piazza del Scala, Milan.

Leonardo helps the assassin decipher encrypted codex pages left behind by legendary master assassin, Altair (the protagonist of the original ''Assassin's Creed'' game). Leonardo's flying machine is successfully built and helps Ezio travel across [[Venice]] in order to assassinate one of his targets. Leonardo makes a brief appearance in ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]'' novel. Ezio and his close friend and fellow Assassin, [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] visit him during the week that he died, present at his side while he passes away. Machiavelli recalls a rumour that King Francis cradled his head in his arms as he died, to which Ezio remarked: \"Some people \u2013 even Kings \u2013 will do anything for publicity\".\n\n==== ''The Da Vinci Code'' ====\nThis work of fiction has been the centre of controversy over the accuracy of its depictions of Christianity and of Leonardo.\n\nA bestselling 2003 novel by [[Dan Brown]], adapted and released as a major [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|motion picture]] in 2006, ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' revolves around a conspiracy based on elements of Leonardo's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]'' and other works. A preface to the novel claims that depictions of artworks, secret societies and rites described within the novel are factual. For this reason much of the content of the novel has been widely accepted by readers as authoritative. Because the theme involves a conspiracy within the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] over the life of Jesus and the suggestion that the Church has hidden the facts of his marriage, there has been a strong reaction against the novel and much material published examining and refuting its claims.\n\nWithin the novel it is claimed that from 1510\u20131519, Leonardo was the Grand Master of a secret society, the [[Priory of Sion]].  In reality this society existed only as a 20th-century hoax, but author Dan Brown used as a source the 1982 [[pseudohistory]] book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]''.  The writers of this book had based their research on forged medieval documents that had been created as part of the Priory of Sion fraud. The mix of fact and fiction in the documents made it difficult to discount immediately as a forgery. For example, it was claimed that the Grand Master prior to Leonardo was [[Botticelli]], who had indeed had an association with Leonardo, as they were both students at the Florence workshop of [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].\n\nThe Priory of Sion story and the veracity of ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' was eventually debunked, and many of those involved publicly recanted, although Dan Brown continued to assert that the facts as presented were true.\n\nIn portraying the Priory of Sion as \"fact\" ''The Da Vinci Code'' expanded on the claims in ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'':\n* That there were additional secrets hidden in Leonardo's paintings, such as an \"M\" letter in the painting of [[The Last Supper]], indicating the presence of [[Mary Magdalene]] and that the figure to the left of Jesus traditionally said to represent [[John the Evangelist]] actually represents [[Mary Magdalene]].\n* That the ''Mona Lisa'' was actually a self-portrait.\n* That among the differences in the two versions of the painting of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' which hang in the [[Louvre]] and London's [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], is the fact that in the Louvre painting the baby to the left of the picture depicts Jesus, and to the right [[John the Baptist]], rather than the accepted view, which is the other way round.\n* That Leonardo invented a [[cryptex]] for carrying secret messages.\n\nThe book also used a variation of Leonardo's backwards handwriting to hide a secret message on the American bookjacket.\n\nAmong the many criticisms of Brown's writing is that he uses the name da Vinci (meaning \"from Vinci\") in the manner that surnames are commonly used nowadays. Leonardo would never have been referred to simply as \"da Vinci\" in his lifetime. Such designations were appended to common baptismal names in order to identify individuals.\n\n=== Film ===\nFilms which are about the life of Leonardo or in which he appears as a character:\n* ''Leonardo Da Vinci'' (1919), silent film\n*''[[The Life of Leonardo da Vinci]]'' (1971) starring [[Philippe Leroy (actor)|Philippe Leroy]] as Leonardo da Vinci<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEezdSQA4JMC&pg=PA29 |title=Leonardo.

His notes are stolen by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] after the latter travels back in time, and [[Mario]] travels back in time himself to [[Florence]] to return the notes. In the area, Mario meets several of Leonardo's contemporaries, including [[Michelangelo]] and an apprentice of [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], who talk about Leonardo's past, innovations, and status as a \"[[Polymath|Renaissance man]].\" Some of Leonardo's work is also seen, including his [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci|concept]] of a [[helicopter]] (referred to in-game as a \"drawing of air screw\"), his ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' (referred to in-game as a \"drawing of Ideal Man\"), and the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', which he can only complete once Mario returns his notes to him.\n*In ''[[The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time]]'' a temporal saboteur has tampered with several historical items in the past to pass on technological information to an alien race. One of them is the [[Codex Atlanticus]]. The player is to explore da Vinci's studio while he was working for [[Ludovico Sforza]].\n*In ''[[Rise of Legends]]'' (2006), the [[Vinci (Rise of Legends)|Vinci]] faction uses [[steampunk]] technology inspired by Leonardo.\n*In the [[Rayman (video game)|first Rayman game]], Mona Lisa has loading screen for its fourth world, Picture City.\n*In ''[[Soulcalibur Legends]]'' there is a character that bears a resemblance to Leonardo, and has the same name.\n*In ''[[Scribblenauts]]'' and its sequels, Leonardo Di Vinci is able to be summoned.\n*In ''[[Elite Beat Agents]]'', one mission has the agents go back in time to help Leonardo paint the ''Mona Lisa''. He is only ever referred to as \"Leo\" or \"Leonard\".\n*In ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'', Leonardo's Workshop is one of the most useful \"World Wonders\"; Leonardo also appears as a \"Great Person\".\n*Leonardo is an important supporting character in ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvpFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243 |title=101 Things You

These consist of a shaft at the hub, with an external [[screw thread]], a straight external spline section and a tapered interface at the hub base. The wheel centers have internal splines and a matching taper to align and center them on the hub. The wheels are fastened to the hub by means of a winged, threaded nut, called a \"knock-off\" or \"spinner.\" Usually, this will feature right-hand threads on the left side of the vehicle, and left-hand threads (rotate clockwise to remove) on the vehicle's right side so the screw-on spinner would stay tightened as the auto was in forward motion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mavrigian|first=Mike|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=muyszoZbpNQC&pg=PT253&lpg=PT253&dq=setups+will+feature+right-hand+threads+on+the+vehicle+left+side,+and+left-hand+threads+on+the+vehicle+right+side|title=High Performance Fasteners & Plumbing : A Guide to Nuts, Bolts, Fuel, Brake, Oil & Coolant Lines, Hoses, Clamps, Racinghardware and Plumbing Techniques|publisher=HP Books|year=2008|isbn=9781557885234|accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> This nut is tightened and loosened by means of hammer strikes to the wings, leading to the name \"knock-off.\" A heavy hammer made of a soft metal such as copper or lead was usually used for this purpose. Instructions for proper installation force vary, but overtightening of the mechanism should be avoided as it can distort the matching tapers on hub and wheel, leading to spline damage, excess play in the mechanism and/or difficulty of wheel removal and installation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McComb|first=Wilson|date=January 1992|title=PRINCIPLES OF THE CENTRE-LOCK WIRE WHEEL|url=https://www.tr-register.com.au/Files/technical/wirewheels.htm|journal=Safety Fast|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Following the introduction of safety regulations in the late 1960s which forbade the winged spinner nuts, many manufacturers used the same basic mechanism with a hex nut.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a28133/lost-art-the-smiting-of-the-knockoffs/|title=The Smiting of the Knockoffs|last=Egan|first=Peter|date=2016-03-21|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe visual appearance of the knock-off nut was incorporated as a styling element on [[Spinner (wheel)|spinner hubcaps]], primarily used on American cars.\n\n=== Modern centerlock hubs ===\n[[File:McLaren MP4-14 (exploded view) rear brake Mercedes-Benz Museum.jpg|alt=A modern centerlock hub on a McLaren MP4/14 Formula One car|thumb|A modern centerlock hub on a [[McLaren MP4/14]] Formula One car]]\n\nMost modern centerlock wheels are fastened to the hub by a single large hex nut.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.velospinner.com/blogs/news/what-are-center-lock-wheels|title=What Are Center Lock Wheels?|last=Delgado|first=Jesus|date=2019-01-22|website=VeloSpinner|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> A hollow, tapered shaft centers the wheel on the hub.

These consist of a shaft at the hub, with an external [[screw thread]], a straight external spline section and a tapered interface at the hub base. The wheel centers have internal splines and a matching taper to align and center them on the hub. The wheels are fastened to the hub by means of a winged, threaded nut, called a \"knock-off\" or \"spinner.\" Usually, this will feature right-hand threads on the left side of the vehicle, and left-hand threads (rotate clockwise to remove) on the vehicle's right side so the screw-on spinner would stay tightened as the auto was in forward motion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mavrigian|first=Mike|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=muyszoZbpNQC&pg=PT253&lpg=PT253&dq=setups+will+feature+right-hand+threads+on+the+vehicle+left+side,+and+left-hand+threads+on+the+vehicle+right+side|title=High Performance Fasteners & Plumbing : A Guide to Nuts, Bolts, Fuel, Brake, Oil & Coolant Lines, Hoses, Clamps, Racinghardware and Plumbing Techniques|publisher=HP Books|year=2008|isbn=9781557885234|accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> This nut is tightened and loosened by means of hammer strikes to the wings, leading to the name \"knock-off.\" A heavy hammer made of a soft metal such as copper or lead was usually used for this purpose. Instructions for proper installation force vary, but overtightening of the mechanism should be avoided as it can distort the matching tapers on hub and wheel, leading to spline damage, excess play in the mechanism and/or difficulty of wheel removal and installation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McComb|first=Wilson|date=January 1992|title=PRINCIPLES OF THE CENTRE-LOCK WIRE WHEEL|url=https://www.tr-register.com.au/Files/technical/wirewheels.htm|journal=Safety Fast|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Following the introduction of safety regulations in the late 1960s which forbade the winged spinner nuts, many manufacturers used the same basic mechanism with a hex nut.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a28133/lost-art-the-smiting-of-the-knockoffs/|title=The Smiting of the Knockoffs|last=Egan|first=Peter|date=2016-03-21|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe visual appearance of the knock-off nut was incorporated as a styling element on [[Spinner (wheel)|spinner hubcaps]], primarily used on American cars.\n\n=== Modern centerlock hubs ===\n[[File:McLaren MP4-14 (exploded view) rear brake Mercedes-Benz Museum.jpg|alt=A modern centerlock hub on a McLaren MP4/14 Formula One car|thumb|A modern centerlock hub on a [[McLaren MP4/14]] Formula One car]]\n\nMost modern centerlock wheels are fastened to the hub by a single large hex nut.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.velospinner.com/blogs/news/what-are-center-lock-wheels|title=What Are Center Lock Wheels?|last=Delgado|first=Jesus|date=2019-01-22|website=VeloSpinner|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> A hollow, tapered shaft centers the wheel on the hub. Torque is transmitted by pins and matching holes at the hub-wheel interface. The retaining nut requires a large amount of torque to secure, therefore a long-handled [[torque wrench]] or a powerful [[impact wrench]] is used to tighten it. Wheels of this type are used on many modern racing cars, including [[NASCAR]], [[Formula One]] and [[Sports car racing|racing sports cars]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/03/02/nascar-single-lug-nut-design-wheel-next-gen-car/|title=NASCAR moving to single lug-nut design for Next Gen car {{!}} NASCAR|last=Albert|first=Zack|date=2020-03-02|website=Official Site Of NASCAR|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/nascar-center-locking-wheels-nut/4711048/?nrt=119|title=NASCAR shifts to center-locking wheels for 2021|last=DeGroot|first=Nick|date=2 March 2020|website=us.motorsport.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2009_997_GT3_19-inch_wheel_with_central_locking_device.jpg|alt=A modern centerlock wheel mounted on a 2009 Porsche 997 GT3|thumb|A modern centerlock wheel mounted on a 2009 [[Porsche 997 GT3]], with Porsche-specific fastener]]\n\nSome variation among the design of the centerlock mechanism is seen among manufacturers.
