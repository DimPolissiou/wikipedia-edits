It was released as the sixth and final [[Single (music)|single]] from ''Like a Prayer'' in the North America and Japan on January 30, 1990, by [[Sire Records]]. Written and produced by Madonna and [[Stephen Bray]], the main inspiration behind \"Keep It Together\" was Madonna's relationship with her family, whom she dearly missed after her divorce from actor [[Sean Penn]]. The song was dedicated to American [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. The lyrics deal with the realization of how important Madonna's family has been to her life. A [[funk]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[deep funk]] song consisting of an upbeat [[rhythm]] and [[Groove (music)|groove]], \"Keep It Together\" features instrumentation from [[percussion]], [[banjo]] and a [[conga]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other countries, \"[[Dear Jessie]]\" served as the final single from ''Like a Prayer'', and \"Keep It Together\" was not released there. Some critics compared \"Keep It Together\" to the work of [[Sister Sledge]], especially their 1979 hit \"[[We Are Family (song)|We Are Family]]\". \"Keep It Together\" was a commercial success, reaching a peak of number eight in the United States and Canada, while topping the US [[Dance Club Songs]] chart. In Australia, it reached the top of the charts as a [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]] single with \"[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]\". \"Keep It Together\" has been performed as the closing song of the [[Blond Ambition World Tour]]. The performances were inspired by the 1971 [[science fiction]] film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and during the introduction, Madonna sang a verse from \"[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]\" by Sly and the Family Stone.\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Prince at Coachella.jpg|thumb|Musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (''pictured'') played guitar on \"Keep It Together\", though he remained uncredited.]]\nWhen Madonna started work on her fourth studio album, ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'', she was already in an emotional state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband [[Sean Penn]], her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors.<ref name=\"rikk1\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=30}}</ref> She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album.<ref name=\"tara1\">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=168}}</ref> But she understood that as she was growing up, so was her core audience. Feeling the need to try something different, Madonna wanted the sound of her new album to indicate what could be popular in music.<ref name=\"lucy1\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=120}}</ref> However, being raised as a Catholic, Madonna felt guilty about the failure of her marriage.<ref name=\"bego\">{{harvnb|Bego|2000|p=90}}</ref> She said, \"Because in Catholicism you are a born sinner and you are a sinner all your life. ... I could not escape my past, nor could I relax\".<ref name=\"lucy1\"/> Saddened by what was happening with her, Madonna missed her family, her father and her siblings. She confessed to Becky Johnston for ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine:\n{{quote|\nI didn't feel close to anybody in my family when I was growing up. [...] I didn't feel close to my older brothers, they were just typical older brothers who tortured me all the time. And I didn't feel close to my sisters. There was a lot of competition in our family, [...] so, I worked really hard in school. I was a straight-A student, and they all hated me for it because I did it more for the position I was going to have in my father's eyes that for whatever I was going to learn by studying. Then when I got a little older\u2014when I was in high school and started dancing really seriously\u2014I'd say I got closer to my brothers.

It was released on January 30, 1990 by [[Sire Records]] as the sixth and final single from the album in the United States, Canada and Japan. Written and produced by Madonna and [[Stephen Bray]], the main inspiration behind \"Keep It Together\" was Madonna's relationship with her family\u2014whom she dearly missed after her divorce from actor [[Sean Penn]]. The song was dedicated to American [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. The lyrics deal with the realization of how important Madonna's family has been to her life. A [[Pop music|pop]], [[funk]] and [[deep funk]] song consisting of an upbeat [[rhythm]] and [[groove (music)|groove]], \"Keep It Together\" features instrumentation from [[percussion]], [[banjo]] and a [[conga]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other countries, \"[[Dear Jessie]]\" (1989) served as the final single from the album and \"Keep It Together\" was not released there. Some critics compared \"Keep It Together\" to the work of [[Sister Sledge]], especially their song \"[[We Are Family (song)|We Are Family]]\". The song was a commercial success, reaching a peak of number eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Canadian charts, while topping the dance chart in the United States. In Australia it reached the top of the charts as a [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]] single with \"[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]\". \"Keep It Together\" has been performed as the closing song of the 1990 [[Blond Ambition World Tour]]. The performances were inspired by the 1971 [[science fiction]] film, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and during the introduction, Madonna sang a verse from \"[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]\" by Sly and the Family Stone.\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Prince at Coachella.jpg|thumb|Musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (''pictured'') played guitar on \"Keep It Together\", though he remained uncredited.]]\nWhen Madonna started work on her fourth studio album, ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'', she was already in an emotional state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband [[Sean Penn]], her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors.<ref name=\"rikk1\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=30}}</ref> She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album.<ref name=\"tara1\">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=168}}</ref> But she understood that as she was growing up, so was her core audience.

I could not escape my past, nor could I relax\".<ref name=\"lucy1\"/> Saddened by what was happening with her, Madonna missed her family, her father and her siblings. She confessed to Becky Johnston for ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine:\n{{quote|\nI didn't feel close to anybody in my family when I was growing up. [...] I didn't feel close to my older brothers, they were just typical older brothers who tortured me all the time. And I didn't feel close to my sisters. There was a lot of competition in our family, [...] so, I worked really hard in school. I was a straight-A student, and they all hated me for it because I did it more for the position I was going to have in my father's eyes that for whatever I was going to learn by studying. Then when I got a little older\u2014when I was in high school and started dancing really seriously\u2014I'd say I got closer to my brothers.

He is very popular within the villages. He is one of the [[Kaaval Dheivam]]s Of [[Tamil Nadu]], India. He is special among the Kaaval Dheivams, in that he is the son of Goddess [[Ankalamma|Angala Parameswari]]. In most of the temples, he is sitting on the right lap of Goddess Angala Parameswari. He is also said to be her guard.\n\n== Introduction ==\nOnce [[Shakthi]] was reborn as [[Parvati]]. As [[Brahma]] also had five heads, Parvati mistook him for [[Shiva]] and fell at his feet. When Parvati realized the truth, she was very angry and prayed to Shiva that Brahma's fifth head would be destroyed. So Shiva as \"[[Rudra]]\" cut off one of Brahma's heads. This became a [[Brahmahathi Dosha]]. The four headed Brahma cursed Shiva decreeing that the fifth head would become attached to Shiva's hand and that hereafter Shiva would suffer from hunger, and would be unable to sleep. So, Lord Shiva came to earth and roamed everywhere. When he was hungry, he begged and ate, but half of the food he begged was eaten by the fifth head of Brahma: that is, the \"Kabala\" so Shiva roamed in every graveyard and slept in the ashes.\n[[File:Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District..jpg|alt=Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District.|thumb|Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District.]]\n\nShiva, due to Brahma's curse, was begging for food. During this period, Pethandavan was a leader for Kalvikkadu. His job was to do robbery in other places and serve his people. Pethandavan was rich and powerful but he was suffering because he didn't have any children. So Pethandavan and his wife Pethandachi prayed Lord Shiva for child boons. Shiva came to his house for food, and Pethandachi was mesmerized that she couldn't believe that the person who is standing next to her was a beggar. She found a God's thing on his face. By answering her prayers, Lord Shiva in beggar form gave her a Prasadam, asked to eat and said, \"A male child will be born to you and he will bring fame to your family and he will become world famous\" and went.\n[[File:Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai..jpg|alt=Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai.|thumb|Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai.]]\n\n== Pavadairayan's appearance ==\nAs said, Pethandavan and Pethandachi had a male child. They named him \"Kalvikaathaan\" (the protector of Kalvikkadu). With all their joy, they treated the child as a gift of god. At the age of 5, they put him in learning all the arts. He attained high skills in learning arts and skills. As time passed, Pethandavan become old and he ordered his son to take his position and protect his region. But Kalvikaathaan was not interested in taking his father's job as they do robbery, kill lives, and incline residents and serve his people. He decided to tell his father that he was not interested but Pethandavan did not take up his words. So out of anger and no way he started to take a walk away from his region. He walked far away from his town.\n\nAs the time passed, the sun set and the darkness prevailed. Being a child, he was shouting in anger and afraid. The day was Amavasai. He saw the shape of a flame and got afraid. He asked, \"who is this?\" The flame replied, \"My son, I am Goddess Angala Parameswari. I was waiting for you these many years. Don't be afraid. I will be there for you, my son.\"\n\n== Goddess Angalaparameswari's order ==\n\"Only you can do a favour for me. A temple needs to be constructed for me within tomorrow morning i.e., within Amavasai. But for this, you need to do certain things. As per the instructions given by Goddess Angala Parameswari, Kalvikaththaan completed all his difficult tasks and submitted in the foot of Goddess Angala Parameswari.\" She was very happy with his son's dedication to her. She asked him one more thing. She asked him to put his kudal and eeru (tonsils and intestines) on a Paavadai. With no hesitation he took a sword and cut his tonsils and intestines and dedicated on the paavadai.\n[[File:Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!.jpg|alt=Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!|thumb|Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!]]\n\n== Pavadairayan as family deity ==\nGoddess Angala Parameswari was very much happy. She took him up and kissed him so that he got Aangaara Sakthi (the power of a god status). The temple was consecrated successfully with all the proper rituals. The temple was Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple. She gave authority to him that he would be her Mun Kaavalan (the protector from the front). Wherever I have a temple you will be having a sannidhi outside my temple. People offer you goat, hen, pig, etc. By this true dedication of you,\" let you be the Kula Dheivam (family deity) for the laity people.\" Since this time, Goddess Angala Parameswari, Lord Pavadairayan serves as a family deity or Kula Dheivam for most of the people.\n\nIn Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple, Tandavarayan (Lord Siva) was sitting next to Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman inside the temple. And outside the temple, Pavadairayan has a separate sannadhi, facing the Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman along with his two wives Aranatchi Amman and Muthunatchi Amman blessing their devotees.\n\n== Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar ==\nThere is another story on Lord Pavadairayan. Due to the curse of Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva was suffering as a beggar in need of food. At that time, Lord Pavadairayan was ruling Vallam Padugai Village. Lord Shiva in beggar form entered Vallam Padugai in need of food. Being the ruler, Lord Pavadairayan did not recognize Lord Shiva, and instead he thought the man was just a beggar and would be a spy. So he arrested him. On completion of Sabam devas came to search Lord Shiva and found he was under jail. They told everything to Lord Pavadairayan that the beggar was Lord Shiva. Pavadairayan fell in Lord Shiva's foot and felt sorry. So Lord Shiva accepted him and blessed Pavadairayan to become the guard of Lord Shiva with his two wives. As Lord Shiva came in Paradhesi Kola (beggar form), so the temple is called as Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar Temple.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://senthilvayal.com/2010/01/21/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95/comment-page-1/|title=\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0baf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb5\u0b9f\u0bbf!|date=2010-01-20|work=\u0b89\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0b95|access-date=2018-06-07|language=ta-IN}}</ref>\n\n== Vallala Kandan's death ==\nLord Bramma had a lust on Thilothama. Out of lust, 5 children's born in the earth - vallala kandan and 4 sons. They gave trouble to Devas all the day. To solve this, sage Naradar came and confused Vallala Kandan to meditate on Lord Shiva to be the most powerful man in the world. He took his advice and started to meditate on Lord Shiva. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Shiva appeared before him and asked for the boons. He asked Lord Shiva itself to be born as his son on his wife's womb. Once the lord shiva in the womb is born, lord shiva in the Kailash must be dead. Lord shiva accepted his wish and grant him with such boons. Vallala Kandan's wife conceived immediately. The child started to grow in the womb.\n\nGoddess Shakthi, the wife of Lord Shiva, was very much shocked for such boons granted for Vallala Kadan as she will tend to lose his husband. So she immediately ran for a help to her brother Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu advised her that \"you have only one chance that too during the time of birth of the child.\" Goddess Shakthi waited for the moment to destroy the child in the womb itself. Nearing the ten months, Vallala Kandan's wife is shouting out of pain. During this time, Lord Vishnu disappeared all the humans in the earth except Vallala Kandan and his four brothers. So Vallala Kandan was struggling for a women to take care of his wife and to deliver the baby safely. Goddess Angalaparameswari disguised as an old lady and Lord Pavadairayan as a small boy appeared before Vallala Kandan. Vallala Kandan approached the old lady to deliver the baby safely. She accepted that she will help in delivering the baby.\n\nVallala Kandan promised the old lady that he will give whatever she wish. The old lady asked for a knife and somethings. Vallala Kandan had a doubt on giving knife but gave as to deliver the baby. The old lady took Vallala Kandan's wife to a separate place and asked Pavadairayan to stand outside as a protector for her. Goddess Angalaparameswari as an old lady, utilized this opportunity and teared the stomach, womb of Vallala Kandan's wife and killed the baby. Vallala Kandan heard the screaming of his wife and came to witness her. At that time, goddess Angalaparameswari ordered Pavadairayan and Veerabathrar to kill Vallala Kandan and his four brothers. As per her order, Lord Pavadairayan along with Lord Veerabathrar killed Vallala Kandan and his four brothers.\n\n== Speciality ==\nUsually in the system of Kaval Dheivam, the deities will be outside the sannadhi of the main god. But Lord Pavadairayan is the only Kaaval Dheivam or Parivara Moorthy who has been given a status to sit in the lap of Goddess Angala Parameswari.\n\n== Statue at Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History ==\n[[File:Lord Ayyanar - Lord Pavadairayan.jpg|alt=Lord Aiyanar on Horse.

Lord Shiva in beggar form entered Vallam Padugai in need of food. Being the ruler, Lord Pavadairayan did not recognize Lord Shiva, instead he thought the man was just a beggar and would be a spy. So he arrested him. On completion of Sabam devas came to search Lord Shiva and found he was in jail. They told everything to Lord Pavadairayan that the beggar was Lord Shiva. Pavadairayan fell at Lord Shiva's foot and felt sorry. But for being arrested Lord Shiva, it became Profanity. So in order to overcome the profanity, Lord Shiva advised to Pavadairayan, \"In the north, there is a place called Aadhipuri (Now its Thiruvottriyur), nearby there is a place called Palmgrove. In Palmgrove, Goddess Kali Devi, in an apparition form, sitting in the shadow of a palm tree and ruling that place. You must go to her and live as a protector for her, only then your relieve from profanity.\n\nAs obeyed by Pavadairayan on Lord Shiva's words, he went to the Palmgrove where Goddess Kali is ruling. During worship, Pavadairayan was very happy to hear Goddess Kali's gelastic. He worshiped her in the direction of her laughter. Goddess Kali accepted Pavadairayan on his worship. So after that, Pavadairayan brought all his people, forces, troops to the place where Goddess Kali ruled and lived as a protector for her.\n\nThe place where Lord Pavadairayan and his people lived, is called as \"[[Rayampuram|Rayanpuram]]\". After some period, it became \"Royapuram\".

He is very popular within the villages. He is one of the [[Kaaval Dheivam]]s Of [[Tamil Nadu]], India. He is special among the Kaaval Dheivams, in that he is the son of Goddess [[Ankalamma|Angala Parameswari]]. In most of the temples, he is sitting on the right lap of Goddess Angala Parameswari. He is also said to be her guard.\n\n== Introduction ==\nOnce [[Shakthi]] was reborn as [[Parvati]]. As [[Brahma]] also had five heads, Parvati mistook him for [[Shiva]] and fell at his feet. When Parvati realized the truth, she was very angry and prayed to Shiva that Brahma's fifth head would be destroyed. So Shiva as \"[[Rudra]]\" cut off one of Brahma's heads. This became a [[Brahmahathi Dosha]]. The four headed Brahma cursed Shiva decreeing that the fifth head would become attached to Shiva's hand and that hereafter Shiva would suffer from hunger, and would be unable to sleep. So, Lord Shiva came to earth and roamed everywhere. When he was hungry, he begged and ate, but half of the food he begged was eaten by the fifth head of Brahma: that is, the \"Kabala\" so Shiva roamed in every graveyard and slept in the ashes.\n[[File:Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District..jpg|alt=Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District.|thumb|Lord Pavadairayan - Sirgazhi, Nagapattinam District.]]\n\nShiva, due to Brahma's curse, was begging for food. During this period, Pethandavan was a leader for Kalvikkadu. His job was to do robbery in other places and serve his people. Pethandavan was rich and powerful but he was suffering because he didn't have any children. So Pethandavan and his wife Pethandachi prayed Lord Shiva for child boons. Shiva came to his house for food, and Pethandachi was mesmerized that she couldn't believe that the person who is standing next to her was a beggar. She found a God's thing on his face. By answering her prayers, Lord Shiva in beggar form gave her a Prasadam, asked to eat and said, \"A male child will be born to you and he will bring fame to your family and he will become world famous\" and went.\n[[File:Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai..jpg|alt=Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai.|thumb|Lord Pavadairayan at Nagalikeni Angalamman Temple, Chennai.]]\n\n== Pavadairayan's appearance ==\nAs said, Pethandavan and Pethandachi had a male child. They named him \"Kalvikaathaan\" (the protector of Kalvikkadu). With all their joy, they treated the child as a gift of god. At the age of 5, they put him in learning all the arts. He attained high skills in learning arts and skills. As time passed, Pethandavan become old and he ordered his son to take his position and protect his region. But Kalvikaathaan was not interested in taking his father's job as they do robbery, kill lives, and incline residents and serve his people. He decided to tell his father that he was not interested but Pethandavan did not take up his words. So out of anger and no way he started to take a walk away from his region. He walked far away from his town.\n\nAs the time passed, the sun set and the darkness prevailed. Being a child, he was shouting in anger and afraid. The day was Amavasai. He saw the shape of a flame and got afraid. He asked, \"who is this?\" The flame replied, \"My son, I am Goddess Angala Parameswari. I was waiting for you these many years. Don't be afraid. I will be there for you, my son.\"\n\n== Goddess Angalaparameswari's order ==\n\"Only you can do a favour for me. A temple needs to be constructed for me within tomorrow morning i.e., within Amavasai. But for this, you need to do certain things. As per the instructions given by Goddess Angala Parameswari, Kalvikaththaan completed all his difficult tasks and submitted in the foot of Goddess Angala Parameswari.\" She was very happy with his son's dedication to her. She asked him one more thing. She asked him to put his kudal and eeru (tonsils and intestines) on a Paavadai. With no hesitation he took a sword and cut his tonsils and intestines and dedicated on the paavadai.\n[[File:Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!.jpg|alt=Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!|thumb|Om Sri Pavadairayan at Melmalayanur Angalamman Temple!]]\n\n== Pavadairayan as family deity ==\nGoddess Angala Parameswari was very much happy. She took him up and kissed him so that he got Aangaara Sakthi (the power of a god status). The temple was consecrated successfully with all the proper rituals. The temple was Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple. She gave authority to him that he would be her Mun Kaavalan (the protector from the front). Wherever I have a temple you will be having a sannidhi outside my temple. People offer you goat, hen, pig, etc. By this true dedication of you,\" let you be the Kula Dheivam (family deity) for the laity people.\" Since this time, Goddess Angala Parameswari, Lord Pavadairayan serves as a family deity or Kula Dheivam for most of the people.\n\nIn Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple, Tandavarayan (Lord Siva) was sitting next to Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman inside the temple. And outside the temple, Pavadairayan has a separate sannadhi, facing the Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman along with his two wives Aranatchi Amman and Muthunatchi Amman blessing their devotees.\n\n== Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar ==\nThere is another story on Lord Pavadairayan. Due to the curse of Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva was suffering as a beggar in need of food. At that time, Lord Pavadairayan was ruling Vallam Padugai Village. Lord Shiva in beggar form entered Vallam Padugai in need of food. Being the ruler, Lord Pavadairayan did not recognize Lord Shiva, and instead he thought the man was just a beggar and would be a spy. So he arrested him. On completion of Sabam devas came to search Lord Shiva and found he was under jail. They told everything to Lord Pavadairayan that the beggar was Lord Shiva. Pavadairayan fell in Lord Shiva's foot and felt sorry. So Lord Shiva accepted him and blessed Pavadairayan to become the guard of Lord Shiva with his two wives. As Lord Shiva came in Paradhesi Kola (beggar form), so the temple is called as Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar Temple.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://senthilvayal.com/2010/01/21/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95/comment-page-1/|title=\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0baf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb5\u0b9f\u0bbf!|date=2010-01-20|work=\u0b89\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0b95|access-date=2018-06-07|language=ta-IN}}</ref>\n\n== Vallala Kandan's death ==\nLord Bramma had a lust on Thilothama. Out of lust, 5 children's born in the earth - vallala kandan and 4 sons. They gave trouble to Devas all the day. To solve this, sage Naradar came and confused Vallala Kandan to meditate on Lord Shiva to be the most powerful man in the world. He took his advice and started to meditate on Lord Shiva. Pleased on his devotion, Lord Shiva appeared before him and asked for the boons. He asked Lord Shiva itself to be born as his son on his wife's womb. Once the lord shiva in the womb is born, lord shiva in the Kailash must be dead. Lord shiva accepted his wish and grant him with such boons. Vallala Kandan's wife conceived immediately. The child started to grow in the womb.\n\nGoddess Shakthi, the wife of Lord Shiva, was very much shocked for such boons granted for Vallala Kadan as she will tend to lose his husband. So she immediately ran for a help to her brother Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu advised her that \"you have only one chance that too during the time of birth of the child.\" Goddess Shakthi waited for the moment to destroy the child in the womb itself. Nearing the ten months, Vallala Kandan's wife is shouting out of pain. During this time, Lord Vishnu disappeared all the humans in the earth except Vallala Kandan and his four brothers. So Vallala Kandan was struggling for a women to take care of his wife and to deliver the baby safely. Goddess Angalaparameswari disguised as an old lady and Lord Pavadairayan as a small boy appeared before Vallala Kandan. Vallala Kandan approached the old lady to deliver the baby safely. She accepted that she will help in delivering the baby.\n\nVallala Kandan promised the old lady that he will give whatever she wish. The old lady asked for a knife and somethings. Vallala Kandan had a doubt on giving knife but gave as to deliver the baby. The old lady took Vallala Kandan's wife to a separate place and asked Pavadairayan to stand outside as a protector for her. Goddess Angalaparameswari as an old lady, utilized this opportunity and teared the stomach, womb of Vallala Kandan's wife and killed the baby. Vallala Kandan heard the screaming of his wife and came to witness her. At that time, goddess Angalaparameswari ordered Pavadairayan and Veerabathrar to kill Vallala Kandan and his four brothers. As per her order, Lord Pavadairayan along with Lord Veerabathrar killed Vallala Kandan and his four brothers.\n\n== Speciality ==\nUsually in the system of Kaval Dheivam, the deities will be outside the sannadhi of the main god. But Lord Pavadairayan is the only Kaaval Dheivam or Parivara Moorthy who has been given a status to sit in the lap of Goddess Angala Parameswari.\n\n== Statue at Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History ==\n[[File:Lord Ayyanar - Lord Pavadairayan.jpg|alt=Lord Aiyanar on Horse.

Pavadairayan fell at Lord Shiva's foot and felt sorry. But for being arrested Lord Shiva, it became Profanity. So in order to overcome the profanity, Lord Shiva advised to Pavadairayan, \"In the north, there is a place called Aadhipuri (Now its Thiruvottriyur), nearby there is a place called Palmgrove. In Palmgrove, Goddess Kali Devi, in an apparition form, sitting in the shadow of a palm tree and ruling that place. You must go to her and live as a protector for her, only then your relieve from profanity.\n\nAs obeyed by Pavadairayan on Lord Shiva's words, he went to the Palmgrove where Goddess Kali is ruling. During worship, Pavadairayan was very happy to hear Goddess Kali's gelastic. He worshiped her in the direction of her laughter. Goddess Kali accepted Pavadairayan on his worship. So after that, Pavadairayan brought all his people, forces, troops to the place where Goddess Kali ruled and lived as a protector for her.\n\nThe place where Lord Pavadairayan and his people lived, is called as \"[[Rayampuram|Rayanpuram]]\". After some period, it became \"Royapuram\".
