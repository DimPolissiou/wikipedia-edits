Upon the discovery of the oldest known manuscript of the text in Nepal, dated to 1373, and the preparation of a [[critical edition]], scholars generally accept the authority of its two concluding verses. These verses mention [[Narayan Pandit|Narayana]] as the author and a king called Dhavala Chandra as the patron of the text.<ref name=\"Narayana2005pix\"/> But as no other work by this author is known, and since the ruler mentioned has not been traced in other sources, we know almost nothing of either of them. Dating the work is therefore problematic. There are quotations within it from 8th century works and other internal evidence may point to an [[East India]]n origin during the later [[Pala Empire]] (8th-12th century).<ref>''A.N.D.Haksar, ''Hitopadesa'',  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BfgcHCEa3qMC&lpg=PT26&ots=S2mjyBdK6X&dq=hitopadesa&pg=PT26#v=onepage&q=hitopadesa&f=false Penguin, 2006]</ref>\n\nNarayana says that the purpose of creating the work is to encourage proficiency in Sanskrit expression (''samskrita-uktishu'') and knowledge of wise behaviour (''niti-vidyam'').

Both have an identical frame story, although the ''Hitopadesha'' differs by having only four divisions to the ancient text's five. According to Ludwik Sternbach's critical edition of the text, the ''Panchatantra'' is the primary source of some 75% of the ''Hitopadesha'''s content, while a third of its verses can be traced to the ''Panchatantra''. In his own introductory verses, Narayana acknowledges that he is indebted to the ''Panchatantra''  and 'another work'.

Upon the discovery of the oldest known manuscript of the text in Nepal, dated to 1373, and the preparation of a [[critical edition]], scholars generally accept the authority of its two concluding verses. These verses mention [[Narayan Pandit|Narayana]] as the author and a king called Dhavala Chandra as the patron of the text.<ref name=\"Narayana2005pix\"/> But as no other work by this author is known, and since the ruler mentioned has not been traced in other sources, we know almost nothing of either of them. Dating the work is therefore problematic. There are quotations within it from 8th century works and other internal evidence may point to an [[East India]]n origin during the later [[Pala Empire]] (8th-12th century).<ref>''A.N.D.Haksar, ''Hitopadesa'',  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BfgcHCEa3qMC&lpg=PT26&ots=S2mjyBdK6X&dq=hitopadesa&pg=PT26#v=onepage&q=hitopadesa&f=false Penguin, 2006]</ref>\n\nNarayana says that the purpose of creating the work is to encourage proficiency in Sanskrit expression (''samskrita-uktishu'') and knowledge of wise behaviour (''niti-vidyam''). This is done through the telling of moral stories in which birds, beasts and humans interact. Interest is maintained through the device of enclosed narratives in which a story is interrupted by an illustrative tale before resuming. The style is elaborate and there are frequent pithy verse interludes to illustrate the points made by the various speakers.<ref>K. Ayyappa Paniker, ''Indian Narratology'', New Delhi, 2003, pp.78-83</ref> On account of these, which provide by far the greater part of the text, the work has been described as an anthology of (sometimes contradictory) verses from widespread sources relating to statecraft.<ref>Judit T\u00f6rz\u00f6k, ''Friendly Advice'' by N\u0101r\u0101yana and ''King Vikrama's Adventures'', New York University 2007, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KdV9dMQci9sC&lpg=PA46&ots=vFNbCaKRX0&dq=hitopadesa&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q=hitopadesa&f=false pp25ff]</ref>\n\nThe ''Hitopadesha'' is quite similar to the ancient Sanskrit classic, the ''Panchatantra'', another collection of fables with morals. Both have an identical frame story, although the ''Hitopadesha'' differs by having only four divisions to the ancient text's five. According to Ludwik Sternbach's critical edition of the text, the ''Panchatantra'' is the primary source of some 75% of the ''Hitopadesha'''s content, while a third of its verses can be traced to the ''Panchatantra''. In his own introductory verses, Narayana acknowledges that he is indebted to the ''Panchatantra''  and 'another work'. The latter is unknown but may possibly be the [[Dharmasastras]] or some other.<ref>{{cite book|author1=S Narayana|author2=A.N.D.

was first announced, it was immediately compared to American television series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'' and some media accused it of being a mere copy. However, when the pilot episode was screened for critics, they noted both series are different in tone as ''Locked Up'' is mostly a thriller while ''Orange Is the New Black'' is a comedy-drama. Besides the comparisons, the series received favourable reviews.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hern\u00e1ndez|first=Paula|title='Vis a vis', una prueba de fuego para las series

was first announced, it was immediately compared to American television series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'' and some media accused it of being a mere copy. However, when the pilot episode was screened for critics, they noted both series are different in tone as ''Locked Up'' is mostly a thriller while ''Orange Is the New Black'' is a comedy-drama. Besides the comparisons, the series received favourable reviews.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hern\u00e1ndez|first=Paula|title='Vis a vis', una prueba de fuego para las series espa\u00f1olas|url=http://www.vertele.com/todo-series/vis-a-vis-una-prueba-de-fuego-para-las-series-espanolas/|work=VerTele|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Alabadi|first=H\u00e9ctor|title='Vis a vis', la reinvenci\u00f3n de los desayunos de Globomedia|url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/45497/vis-a-vis-reinvencion-desayunos-globomedia/|work=FormulaTV|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jabonero|first=Daniel|title='Vis a Vis', el thriller que Antena 3 necesita para completar su baraja de ases|url=http://bluper.es/noticias/vis-a-vis-thriller-antena-3-necesitaba-completar-baraja-ases|work=Bluper|publisher=El Huffington Post|date=17 April 2015|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== International broadcasts ==\nSeason 1 was broadcast in the United Kingdom from 17 May 2016 on [[Channel 4]]'s [[Walter Presents]] video on demand service.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mayorga |first=Emilio |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/global/miptv-spanish-locked-up-jail-thriller-clinches-u-k-sale-1201746904/ |title=MipTV: Spanish \u2018Locked-Up\u2019 Jail Thriller Clinches U.K. Sale |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=15 May 2016 |access-date=5 April 2016 |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]]}}</ref> In 2017, [[Amazon Video|Prime Video]] acquired the first two seasons for the United States, and in 2018, [[Hulu]] acquired the first four seasons for Japan.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pecino |first=Manuel |url=https://www.formulatv.com/noticias/vis-a-vis-hulu-japon-derechos-emision-cuatro-primeras-temporadas-84912/ |title='Vis a vis': Hulu Jap\u00f3n adquiere los derechos de emisi\u00f3n de las cuatro primeras temporadas |magazine=F\u00f3rmulaTV |date=15 October 2018 |language=Spanish|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref> In Greece, the series premiered on 27 November 2018 on [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://series.ert.gr/vis-a-vis/|title=Vis A Vis \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0395\u03a1\u03a41 |language=Greek}}</ref> [[Netflix]] bought the rights for international distribution in 2017.\n\nThe series is also available for a limited amount of time on the online streaming service 'VTMGO' by the Belgian broadcaster [[VTM (TV channel)]].\n\n== Spin-off ==\nA spin-off series titles ''Vis a vis: El oasis'', which will center on Civantos character Macarena and Nimri's character Zulema teaming up, was announced in May 2019 and is scheduled for release in 2020.<ref name=\"spinoff\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|4524056|Locked Up}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Locked Up}}\n[[Category:2010s Spanish television series]]\n[[Category:2015 Spanish television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2019 Spanish television series endings]]\n[[Category:Antena 3 (Spain) network series]]\n[[Category:Lesbian-related television programs]]\n[[Category:Serial drama television series]]\n[[Category:Spanish crime television series]]\n[[Category:Spanish drama television series]]\n[[Category:Spanish prison television series]]\n[[Category:Suspense television series]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Spain]]\n[[Category:2010s prison television series]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language Netflix original programming]]\n", "name_user": "Franar8", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked_Up_(TV_series)"}
