Vaccine demand is increasing with new target population in emerging markets (partly due to international vaccine funders;<ref name=right_shot/> in 2012, [[UNICEF]] bought half of the world's vaccine doses<ref name=\"market\"/>). Vaccines are becoming the financial driver of the pharmaceutical industry, and new business models may be emerging. Vaccines are newly being marketed like pharmaceuticals. The first decade of the 2000s saw a large number of mergers and acquisitions, and {{as of|lc=yes|2010}}, 80% of the global vaccine market was in the hands of five multinationals: [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Sanofi Pasteur]], [[Pfizer]], [[Merck Group|Merck]], and [[Novartis]].<ref name=\"market\">{{cite web |last1=Kaddar |first1=Miloud |title=Global Vaccine Market Features and Trends |url=https://www.who.int/influenza_vaccines_plan/resources/session_10_kaddar.pdf |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref> \n\nIn the past, the market power of pharmaceutical companies has delayed responses to epidemics. Manufacturers have successfully negotiated favourable terms, including market guarantees and [[indemnification]], from governments, as a condition of manufacturing vaccines. This has delayed responses to some epidemics by months, and prevented responses to other pandemics entirely.<ref name=Big_pharma/> Some intellectual property issues also hinder vaccine development and lifesaving epidemic response, as in [[RVSV-ZEBOV vaccine#History|the case of rVSV-ZEBOV]].<ref name=response>{{cite web |title=MSF's response to CEPI\u2019s policy regarding equitable access |url=https://msfaccess.org/msfs-response-cepis-policy-regarding-equitable-access |website=M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Access Campaign |language=en}}</ref>\n\nVaccine manufacturers engage in [[price discrimination]], and vaccine prices are often two orders of magnitude higher than the manufacturer's stated manufacturing costs, {{as of|lc=yes|2015}}.

The IC included representatives from the governments of Norway, UK, Germany, Japan, Canada, Ethiopia, Australia, Belgium, the EU, and the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.<ref name=CEPI/>\n\n==Publications==\nIn October 2018, CEPI published a study in British healthcare journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', that estimated the costs of developing vaccines for diseases that could escalate into global humanitarian crises.  The study focused on 11 diseases which cause relatively few deaths at present and primarily strike the poor. The authors estimated that it would cost between US$2.8 billion and US$3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of the diseases. This should be set against the potential cost of an outbreak. The 2003 SARS outbreak in East Asia cost US$54 billion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scientists have estimated the cost of stopping 11 diseases that could kill millions in a pandemic |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/22/17999676/vaccine-ebola-pandemic-disease-zika-epidemic-sars?platform=hootsuite |accessdate=2 December 2018 |publisher=Vox |date=22 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30346-2/fulltext | title=Estimating the cost of vaccine development against epidemic infectious diseases: a cost minimisation study | journal=The Lancet | year=2018 | volume=6 | issue=12 | pmid=30342925 | last1=Gouglas | first1=D. | last2=Thanh Le | first2=T. | last3=Henderson | first3=K. | last4=Kaloudis | first4=A. | last5=Danielsen | first5=T. | last6=Hammersland | first6=N.

This has delayed responses to some epidemics by months, and prevented responses to other pandemics entirely.<ref name=Big_pharma/> Some intellectual property issues also hinder vaccine development and lifesaving epidemic response, as in [[RVSV-ZEBOV vaccine#History|the case of rVSV-ZEBOV]].<ref name=response>{{cite web |title=MSF's response to CEPI\u2019s policy regarding equitable access |url=https://msfaccess.org/msfs-response-cepis-policy-regarding-equitable-access |website=M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Access Campaign |language=en}}</ref>\n\nVaccine manufacturers engage in [[price discrimination]], and vaccine prices are often two orders of magnitude higher than the manufacturer's stated manufacturing costs, {{as of|lc=yes|2015}}.

The study focused on 11 diseases which cause relatively few deaths at present and primarily strike the poor. The authors estimated that it would cost between US$2.8 billion and US$3.7 billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of the diseases. This should be set against the potential cost of an outbreak. The 2003 SARS outbreak in East Asia cost US$54 billion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scientists have estimated the cost of stopping 11 diseases that could kill millions in a pandemic |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/22/17999676/vaccine-ebola-pandemic-disease-zika-epidemic-sars?platform=hootsuite |accessdate=2 December 2018 |publisher=Vox |date=22 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30346-2/fulltext | title=Estimating the cost of vaccine development against epidemic infectious diseases: a cost minimisation study | journal=The Lancet | year=2018 | volume=6 | issue=12 | pmid=30342925 | last1=Gouglas | first1=D. | last2=Thanh Le | first2=T. | last3=Henderson | first3=K. | last4=Kaloudis | first4=A. | last5=Danielsen | first5=T. | last6=Hammersland | first6=N.

It was designed to compete with the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]] by being smaller and faster, a niche that failed to create demand. When it was first introduced, some aviation circles claimed that at {{convert|615|mph|kph|abbr=on}}, it was the fastest jet transport in the world.<ref name=\"popmechmar59\">{{cite magazine |title=Here's Convair 880 \u2013 Fastest Jet Transport in the World. |magazine=Popular Mechanics |date=March 1959 |volume=III |number=3 |page= 87 |accessdate=9 May 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87}}</ref> Only 65 Convair 880s were produced over the lifetime of the production run from 1959 to 1962, and General Dynamics eventually withdrew from the airliner market after considering the 880 project a failure. The [[Convair 990 Coronado|Convair 990]] was a stretched and faster variant of the 880.\n\n==Design and development==\nConvair began development of a medium-range commercial jet in April 1956, to compete with announced products from [[Boeing]] and [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]]. Initially the design was called the '''Skylark''', but the name was later changed to the '''Golden Arrow''', then Convair 600 and then finally the 880, both numbers referring to its top speed of 600&nbsp;mph (970&nbsp;km/h) or 880&nbsp;ft/s (268&nbsp;m/s). It was powered by [[General Electric CJ805|General Electric CJ-805-3]] turbojets, a civilian version of the [[General Electric J79|J79]] which powered the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]], [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom]],<ref name=\"Wegg\">{{cite book |last1=Wegg |first1=John |title=General Dynamics aircraft and their predecessors |date=1990 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Md. |isbn=0-87021-233-8 |edition=1st |pages=214\u2013217}}</ref> and [[Convair B-58 Hustler]].\n\nThe first example of the Model 22 initial production version (no prototype was built) made its maiden flight on 27 January 1959.<ref name=\"Wegg\"/> After production started, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] mandated additional instrumentation, which Convair added by placing a \"raceway\" hump on the top of the fuselage, rather than ripping apart the interiors over the wing area.  The final assembly of the 880 and 990 took place at the Convair facilities in San Diego, California.<ref name=\"Pourade\">{{cite web |last1=Pourade |first1=Richard F. |title=City of the Dream, 1940\u20131970 |url=https://sandiegohistory.org/archives/books/citydream/ch8/ |website=San Diego History Center {{!}} San Diego, CA {{!}} Our City, Our Story |accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe airliner never became widely used and the production line shut down after only three years. The 880's five-abreast seating made it unattractive to airlines, while Boeing was able to out-compete it with the [[Boeing 720]], which could be sold at a significantly lower cost, as it was a minimal modification of the existing 707. In addition, the General Electric engines had a higher [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] than the Boeing's [[Pratt & Whitney JT3C]]s.\n\nGeneral Dynamics lost around $185 million over the lifetime of the project, although some sources estimate much higher losses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The aircraft were involved in 17 accidents and five hijackings.\n\nA modified version of the basic 880 was the \"-M\" version which incorporated four leading-edge slats per wing, [[Krueger flap|Krueger leading-edge flaps]] between the fuselage and inboard engines, power-boosted rudder, added engine thrust, increased fuel capacity, stronger landing gear, greater adjustment to seating pitch, and a simpler overhead compartment arrangement.<ref name=Proctor/>\n\nA more major modification to the 880 became the [[Convair 990]], produced in parallel with the 880-M between 1961 and 1963. Swissair named theirs Coronado, after an island off the San Diego coast and where the first 990 landed.<ref name=Proctor/>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Convair 880 N830TW TWA ORD 24.04.71 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Trans World Airlines]] was the major operator of the Convair 880. One of their aircraft departs from [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]] on a scheduled service in April 1971.]]\n\nThe design entered service with [[Delta Air Lines]] in May 1960, slightly modified as the 880-22m, having newer version 805-3B engines. The 880s were flown by [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], [[Japan Airlines|Japan]], [[Northeast Airlines|Northeast]], [[Swissair]], [[TWA]], and [[Viasa|VIASA]].\n\nAs they left commercial service, many 880s were bought by [[American Jet Industries]] for various uses. One example was converted to freighter use in 1974, and flew until 1982 with various companies. Another was used to train FAA flight examiners until it was destroyed by a minor explosion in the cargo hold in 1995. Most of the remaining examples were scrapped by 2000.\n\n[[File:Convair 880 N8802E Delta ATL 15.04.72 edited-2.jpg|thumb|left|Delta Air Lines operated 17 Convair 880s between early 1960 and early 1974]]\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] acquired one 880-M in 1980, modifying it as an in-flight tanker.

It was designed to compete with the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]] by being smaller and faster, a niche that failed to create demand. When it was first introduced, some aviation circles claimed that at {{convert|615|mph|kph|abbr=on}}, it was the fastest jet transport in the world.<ref name=\"popmechmar59\">{{cite magazine |title=Here's Convair 880 \u2013 Fastest Jet Transport in the World. |magazine=Popular Mechanics |date=March 1959 |volume=III |number=3 |page= 87 |accessdate=9 May 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87}}</ref> Only 65 Convair 880s were produced over the lifetime of the production run from 1959 to 1962, and General Dynamics eventually withdrew from the airliner market after considering the 880 project a failure. The [[Convair 990]] was a stretched and faster variant of the 880.\n\n==Design and development==\nConvair began development of a medium-range commercial jet in April 1956, to compete with announced products from [[Boeing]] and [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]]. Initially the design was called the '''Skylark''', but the name was later changed to the '''Golden Arrow''', then Convair 600 and then finally the 880, both numbers referring to its top speed of 600&nbsp;mph (970&nbsp;km/h) or 880&nbsp;ft/s (268&nbsp;m/s). It was powered by [[General Electric CJ805|General Electric CJ-805-3]] turbojets, a civilian version of the [[General Electric J79|J79]] which powered the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]], [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom]],<ref name=\"Wegg\">{{cite book |last1=Wegg |first1=John |title=General Dynamics aircraft and their predecessors |date=1990 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Md. |isbn=0-87021-233-8 |edition=1st |pages=214\u2013217}}</ref> and [[Convair B-58 Hustler]].\n\nThe first example of the Model 22 initial production version (no prototype was built) made its maiden flight on 27 January 1959.<ref name=\"Wegg\"/> After production started, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] mandated additional instrumentation, which Convair added by placing a \"raceway\" hump on the top of the fuselage, rather than ripping apart the interiors over the wing area.  The final assembly of the 880 and 990 took place at the Convair facilities in San Diego, California.<ref name=\"Pourade\">{{cite web |last1=Pourade |first1=Richard F. |title=City of the Dream, 1940\u20131970 |url=https://sandiegohistory.org/archives/books/citydream/ch8/ |website=San Diego History Center {{!}} San Diego, CA {{!}} Our City, Our Story |accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe airliner never became widely used and the production line shut down after only three years. The 880's five-abreast seating made it unattractive to airlines, while Boeing was able to out-compete it with the [[Boeing 720]], which could be sold at a significantly lower cost, as it was a minimal modification of the existing 707. In addition, the General Electric engines had a higher [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] than the Boeing's [[Pratt & Whitney JT3C]]s.\n\nGeneral Dynamics lost around $185 million over the lifetime of the project, although some sources estimate much higher losses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The aircraft were involved in 17 accidents and five hijackings.\n\nA modified version of the basic 880 was the \"-M\" version which incorporated four leading-edge slats per wing, [[Krueger flap|Krueger leading-edge flaps]] between the fuselage and inboard engines, power-boosted rudder, added engine thrust, increased fuel capacity, stronger landing gear, greater adjustment to seating pitch, and a simpler overhead compartment arrangement.<ref name=Proctor/>\n\nA more major modification to the 880 became the [[Convair 990]], produced in parallel with the 880-M between 1961 and 1963. Swissair named theirs Coronado, after an island off the San Diego coast and where the first 990 landed.<ref name=Proctor/>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Convair 880 N830TW TWA ORD 24.04.71 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Trans World Airlines]] was the major operator of the Convair 880. One of their aircraft departs from [[Chicago O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]] on a scheduled service in April 1971.]]\n\nThe design entered service with [[Delta Air Lines]] in May 1960, slightly modified as the 880-22m, having newer version 805-3B engines. The 880s were flown by [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], [[Japan Airlines|Japan]], [[Northeast Airlines|Northeast]], [[Swissair]], [[TWA]], and [[Viasa|VIASA]].\n\nAs they left commercial service, many 880s were bought by [[American Jet Industries]] for various uses. One example was converted to freighter use in 1974, and flew until 1982 with various companies. Another was used to train FAA flight examiners until it was destroyed by a minor explosion in the cargo hold in 1995. Most of the remaining examples were scrapped by 2000.\n\n[[File:Convair 880 N8802E Delta ATL 15.04.72 edited-2.jpg|thumb|left|Delta Air Lines operated 17 Convair 880s between early 1960 and early 1974]]\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] acquired one 880-M in 1980, modifying it as an in-flight tanker.
