Retrieved 20 August 2013.</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival|62nd Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2009 where it won the [[Palme d'Or]], followed by positive reviews and several other major awards, including the [[67th Golden Globe Awards|2010 Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]. The film also received two nominations at the [[82nd Academy Awards]] in 2009: [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] (representing Germany) and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Christian Berger]]).\n\n==Plot==\nThe memories of an unnamed elderly tailor form a [[parable]] from the distant year he worked as a village schoolteacher and met his fianc\u00e9e Eva, a nanny. The setting is the fictitious [[Protestant]] village of Eichwald, Northern [[German Empire|Germany]], from July 1913 to 9 August 1914,<!--\"sunday mess after Beginning of war\"--> where the local pastor, the doctor and the baron rule the roost over the area's women, children and peasant farmers.\n\nThe puritanical pastor leads confirmation classes and gives his pubescent children a guilty conscience over apparently small transgressions. He has them wear white ribbons as a reminder of the innocence and purity from which they have strayed. When under interrogation, his son confesses to 'impure' touching;<!-- For those editors who would like to explicitly state that the son was accused of masturbation, please note that the film doesn't. The discussion on the subject led to a consensus that the plot summary remain consistent with the action of the film. --> the pastor has the boy\u2019s hands tied to his bed frame each night. The doctor, a widower, treats the village children kindly but humiliates his housekeeper (the local [[midwife]], with whom he is having sexual relations) and also sexually abuses his teenage daughter. The baron, who is the [[lord of the manor]], underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. After his young son is abusively injured by unknown assailant(s), he summarily dismisses Eva for no apparent reason, yet defends the integrity of a farmer whose son in a symbolic act has destroyed the baron's field of cabbages.\n\nThe schoolteacher's friendship with Eva leads to a visit to her family home during a Christmas break; asking for her hand in marriage, he receives from her taciturn father a reluctant permission to marry, but only after a one-year test-period delay.\n\nUnexplained harmful events occur. A wire is stretched between two trees causing the doctor a terrible fall from his horse. The farmer's wife dies at the sawmill when rotten floorboards give way; her son was the cabbage-field vandal, and her grieving husband later hangs himself. The baron\u2019s young son Sigi goes missing on the day of the harvest festival and is found the following morning in the sawmill, bound and badly caned. A barn at the manor burns down. The baroness tells her husband that she is in love with another man. Shortly after the pastor has singled-out and mortified his daughter in class, she opens his parakeet's cage with scissors in hand; the pastor finds the bird on his desk, cruelly impaled in the shape of a cross. The daughter of the steward at the baron's estate claims a violent dream-premonition about harm coming to the midwife's handicapped son, then the boy is attacked and almost blinded, found during a night search along with a well-written note quoting [[Ten Commandments|Exodus 20:5]]. The steward thrashes his son for violently stealing a flute from Sigi.\n\nThe midwife urgently commandeers a bicycle from the schoolteacher to go to the police in town, claiming that her son has said he knows who attacked him. She and her son are not seen again. Meanwhile, the doctor and his family have also suddenly disappeared, leaving a note on the door indicating his practice is closed. The schoolteacher's growing suspicions lead to a confrontation in the pastor's [[rectory]], where he suggests that the pastor's children and students had prior knowledge of the local troubles and insinuates that they likely perpetrated them.

He has them wear white ribbons as a reminder of the innocence and purity from which they have strayed. When under interrogation, his son confesses to 'impure' touching;<!-- For those editors who would like to explicitly state that the son was accused of masturbation, please note that the film doesn't.

The doctor, a widower, treats the village children kindly but humiliates his housekeeper (the local [[midwife]], with whom he is having sexual relations) and also sexually abuses his teenage daughter. The baron, who is the [[lord of the manor]], underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. After his young son is abusively injured by unknown assailant(s), he summarily dismisses Eva for no apparent reason, yet defends the integrity of a farmer whose son in a symbolic act has destroyed the baron's field of cabbages.\n\nThe schoolteacher's friendship with Eva leads to a visit to her family home during a Christmas break; asking for her hand in marriage, he receives from her taciturn father a reluctant permission to marry, but only after a one-year test-period delay.\n\nUnexplained harmful events occur. A wire is stretched between two trees causing the doctor a terrible fall from his horse. The farmer's wife dies at the sawmill when rotten floorboards give way; her son was the cabbage-field vandal, and her grieving husband later hangs himself. The baron\u2019s young son Sigi goes missing on the day of the harvest festival and is found the following morning in the sawmill, bound and badly caned. A barn at the manor burns down. The baroness tells her husband that she is in love with another man. Shortly after the pastor has singled-out and mortified his daughter in class, she opens his parakeet's cage with scissors in hand; the pastor finds the bird on his desk, cruelly impaled in the shape of a cross. The daughter of the steward at the baron's estate claims a violent dream-premonition about harm coming to the midwife's handicapped son, then the boy is attacked and almost blinded, found during a night search along with a well-written note quoting [[Ten Commandments|Exodus 20:5]]. The steward thrashes his son for violently stealing a flute from Sigi.\n\nThe midwife urgently commandeers a bicycle from the schoolteacher to go to the police in town, claiming that her son has said he knows who attacked him. She and her son are not seen again. Meanwhile, the doctor and his family have also suddenly disappeared, leaving a note on the door indicating his practice is closed. The schoolteacher's growing suspicions lead to a confrontation in the pastor's [[rectory]], where he suggests that the pastor's children and students had prior knowledge of the local troubles and insinuates that they likely perpetrated them.  Offended, the pastor berates him and threatens to report him to the authorities if he repeats his accusations.\n\nThe film ends a few days after World War I [[World War I|officially begins]], with the final scene occurring in Sunday church on the day of a visit from the narrator's prospective father-in-law. Disquiet remains in the village, with no explanation of the violent events. The narrator is eventually [[Conscription in Germany|drafted]], leaving Eichwald, never to return.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Christian Friedel]] as the school teacher\n* [[Ernst Jacobi]] as narrator (voice only, school teacher many years later)\n* [[Leonie Benesch]] as Eva, nanny to the baron and baroness's twin babies\n* [[Ulrich Tukur]] as the baron\n* [[Ursina Lardi]] as the baroness, Marie-Louise\n* Fion Mutert as Sigmund, their oldest son\n* Michael Kranz as Sigmund's tutor\n* [[Burghart Klau\u00dfner]] as the pastor\n* [[Steffi K\u00fchnert]] as Anna, the pastor's wife\n* [[Maria-Victoria Dragus]] as Klara, their oldest daughter\n* [[Leonard Proxauf]] as Martin, their oldest son\n* Levin Henning as Adolf\n* Johanna Busse as Margarete\n* Thibault S\u00e9ri\u00e9 as Gustav\n* [[Josef Bierbichler]] as the baron's steward\n* Gabriela Maria Schmeide as Emma, his wife\n* Janina Fautz as Erna, their daughter\n* Enno Trebs as Georg\n* [[Theo Trebs]] as Ferdinand\n* [[Rainer Bock]] as the doctor\n* [[Roxane Duran]] as Anna, the doctor's daughter\n* [[Susanne Lothar]] as the midwife\n* Eddy Grahl as Karli, her son\n* Branko Samarovski as a peasant\n* [[Birgit Minichmayr]] as Frieda\n* Aaron Denkel as Kurti\n* [[Detlev Buck]] as Eva's father\n* Carmen-Maja Antoni as the bathing midwife\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Michael Haneke]] has said the project was in development for more than ten years.<ref name=\"cineuropa\">{{cite web |url=http://cineuropa.org/interview.aspx?lang=en&documentID=108748 |title=Interview with Michael Haneke |last=Lemercier |first=Fabien |date=21 May 2009 |website=Cineuropa.org |publisher=Cineuropa |access-date=25 May 2009 |quote=}}</ref> The initial version of the script was written as a television mini-series for the Austrian broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], but when no co-producer who was willing to invest in the project had been found after five years had passed, Haneke decided to put the project on hold.<ref name=\"derstandard\">\nAustria Presse Agentur (23 April 2009) \"[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=1240297981226 Michael Hanekes ist im Wettbewerb]\" (in German).

The primary goal of the program was to acquaint, or re-acquaint, young people of Chinese descent living in other parts of the world with Chinese culture and language. Thus, participants take brief courses in language and arts, attend lectures, and take scenic tours of Taiwan. This however, is the popular perception of the program. The alternate and original purpose for the Taiwan Government's subsidizing of the program was to shore up [[Overseas Chinese]] support for its cross-strait political policies, particularly those of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in regards to its tense relations with China. Accordingly, participants were to attend lectures on cross-strait relations which others might perceive as propaganda. The program was conceived by the Taiwan Government in part because the [[Kuomintang]] for many decades had recognized the historical importance of the [[Overseas Chinese]] community not only for its financing but also for its political support.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23462345?seq=1 Taiwan and Overseas Chinese during the Cold War Era]</ref>  In fact Dr. [[Sun Yat-Sen]],<ref>[http://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=sun_yat-sen.html Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]</ref> the founder of the [[Kuomintang]] as well as the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]], recognized early the importance of [[Overseas Chinese]] support<ref>[https://www.straight.com/blogra/faces-vancouver-kuomintang-building-chinatown Sun Yat-Sen and Overseas Chinese history]</ref> and went as far as to say that \"Overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.<ref>[http://www.heroesofconfederation.com/Sun_Yat_Sen/sun_mission(1).html Sun Yat-Sen acknowledgement of Overseas Chinese]</ref>\"  However, beyond the political origins of the Study Tour, the program is most famous for its historically positive influence on Chinese American identity in addition to its \"[[Loveboat]]\" reputation of spawning many relationships as well hosting a frenetic nightlife scene which many participants indulged in.\n\n==Changes from 1967 to 1999==\n[[File:Lb1969a.jpg|thumb|Official 1969 Certificate of attendance for the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour. Photo permission provided by [[Jan Wong]] and the Chinese Canadian Archive]]The Study Tour has gone through many changes over the years which correspond with Taiwan's changing politics and economy. After an experimental trial run in 1966 of only 5 students from North America<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4271166/_Chinese_American_Transnationalism_Aboard_the_Love_Boat_The_Overseas_Youth_Language_Training_and_Study_Tour_to_the_Republic_of_China_ Chinese American Transnationalism aboard the Loveboat]</ref>, the [[China Youth Corps]] conducted the first official Study Tour in 1967 which hosted 70-100 participants from America and Canada, with an age range of between 14 and 25.  According to journalist [[Jan Wong]], a 1969 Study Tour participant, the first few years of the Study Tour program were held at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. As the popularity of the program grew, the number of participants increased and the headquarters moved to the Chientan Youth Activity Center in the 1970s located in the [[Shilin District]] near modern day [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] station.  During this time, the [[China Youth Corps]] had changed the name of the Study Tour to become \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China,\" to be more in line with their political ideology. By the 1970s and 1980s, the average size of the program slowly grew to 300\u2013500 students up until 1988 and then in 1989 peaked exponentially at 1,200 participants. Due to the overwhelming increase in demand participants had to be placed in two separate campuses in 1990, one remaining at Chientan Campus and the other new one held at Taipei's [[Tam Kang Campus]].  During this time, and due to the increase in student size, the [[China Youth Corps]] came to share sponsoring responsibilities with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which has since been renamed the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]].\n\n[[File:Chientan.jpg|thumb|Chientan Youth Activity Center]]\nThis increase in enrolment coincided with both Taiwan's 1987 lifting of [[martial law]] and also its astronomical economic rise in the technology boom which greatly increased the island's reputation and prosperity. Further, because many originally skeptical participants were returning home with a greater appreciation of Taiwanese culture, improved Chinese language skills and were raving about the quality of the Tour to their family, this consequently led to good word of mouth about the program being spread within the international Chinese community.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/popup.php?x=news3 Direct link to August 3rd, 2004 Toronto Star article \"Finding a Mate Offshore\" by William Lin]</ref> This was especially pertinent in the 1970s and 1980s when Chinese communities were smaller than present day and a clear sense of \"Asian American identity\" for many North American born Chinese was nebulous at best. Many American-born Chinese who initially did not have any Chinese language skills and who refused to date a fellow Asian, returned from the Tour not only expressing a greater appreciation of Chinese language and culture but also a greater willingness to date within the Asian community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011209130536/http://www.geocities.com/jodeman.geo/loveboat.htm 'A More Complete Description of The Love Boat\" (English)]</ref>  There were many reasons for this, but especially for those participants who came from communities without many Chinese, the Study Tour provided a unique forum to share their common \"Chinese North American Experience\" of growing up and needing to reconcile both North American and Asian Cultures in a predominantly Caucasian society. This bonding not only produced several relationships but it also created many lifelong friendships. In addition, it did not hurt that during the trip, students were treated as \"little diplomats.\" This was witnessed during their police escorted bus trips to local Taipei landmarks where local traffic was essentially stopped for the convenience of their journey and to the relative chagrin of local Taiwanese commuters. This same sense of diplomacy was bestowed upon them at various military installations and cultural performances that students attended and were attempts by the program to ingratiate students with the people and culture of Taiwan. These various aspects of the Study Tour combined with the fact that 6 weeks of room and board (excluding airfare) only cost the participant $400 US dollars, due to Taiwan government subsidization, also led to increased popularity for the trip, as most agreed it was an excellent deal. \n[[File:224273 9461070452 3021 n.jpg|thumb|Students sneaking out of Chientan Campus at night to party]]\nHowever, a by-product of the Study Tour's increased popularity was increased competition by parents to register their children especially at large urban centers in New York and California. In fact, there were often waiting lists to get on the program and for some parents getting their child on the program became a symbol of status and often pertinent or high-ranking connections facilitated the application process for their child.  Some parents desiring their children to find a \"suitable Chinese spouse\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113166784230094239 The Loveboat Wall Street Journal Article]</ref> sent their unsuspecting children on the trip while telling them it was chiefly a Language Study Tour.  Conversely, some students who were interested in attending would often neglect to inform their parents about the Study Tour's [[Love Boat]] reputation for fear of not being allowed to go.  These concerns by some parents came from rumours that a few participants engaged in sexually promiscuous activity. On the other side of the spectrum, several Study Tour attendees did happen to fall in love and end up marrying each other. All these instances led to the Study Tour gaining its [[Love Boat]] nickname and reputation.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/index.php?y=inthenews ''Toronto Star'' 3 August 2004 article on the Study Tour re-published by Click2Asia.  Click2Asia indicates date and source of material (Toronto Star) in this link]</ref> Several unplanned pregnancies were however documented on the 1996 Study Tour which resulted in more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly administered curfews. \n\n[[File:Loveboatclub.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students of the Love Boat enjoying an evening at a Taipei Dance Club]]\nThe job of implementing these many rules has traditionally been overseen by many local college-aged Taiwan counselors whose responsibilities, from early morning to late at night, consisted of organizing all the various logistics of the students' itinerary. This included organizing language/cultural classes, trips outings, speech contests, meals, medical care, guest speakers, and enforcing discipline which included trying to prevent (in vain) the students from sneaking out of the campus in the evening to enjoy the Taipei nightlife. Due to the sheer volume of minor misdeeds many counselors had to turn a blind eye and instead focused their energies on ensuring the safety and well being of the students. Becoming a Study Tour counselor for local Taiwanese was considered by many a badge of honour, as throughout the 1960s to the 1990s, the [[China Youth Corps]] only accepted local Taiwan applicants from the best Taiwan universities and degree programs in a rigorous selection process. For many counselors, the Study Tour was their very first contact with Chinese from abroad and many found the cultural exchange as life-changing as did the students who attended.\n\nAnother prerequisite of the Study Tour by the 1980s had become mandatory [[university]] enrolment, with a preference for students in [[Ivy League]] universities and students in their final year of university and thus near the age limit. Students with high academic achievements such as Presidential Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, or Truman Scholars were also given higher priority and were able to attend the Study Tour without charge.  Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year so as to avoiding hoarding of spots by families. Exceptions were made however to twins and siblings from Europe. Participation had gradually increased from Europe, especially countries such as France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK. Countries such as Australia and those from South America and Africa also began sending small numbers of Study Tour participants. This contributed greatly to the sense of international community among [[Overseas Chinese]] worldwide.\n[[File:222318 9461130452 2683 n.jpg|thumb|CYC President Dr. Jeanne Li giving her final speech during the 2000 Study Tour Closing Ceremony]]\nBy the 1990s, the Study Tour had become a 6 week long program with an enrolment of 1200 participants aged from 18\u201323 with a management staff of over 80 Counselors.  As the size of the program expanded, more cultural classes were added to the existing language class education schedule. These classes now included calligraphy, cooking, Chinese medicine, Chinese yo-yo, fan dancing, flute, kung-fu, painting, paper cutting, stick-fighting, southern fiddle, sword-fighting, Taiwanese aboriginal dance, ribbon dancing, zither, and several others.  After 4 weeks of training, some students would perform what they learned during the \"Closing Ceremony\" in front of an audience of Study Tour participants and several high-level government officials at the Chientan Youth Activity Center auditorium.  This Closing Ceremony preceded the famous \"9 day trip down South\" which took all 1,200 study tour participants, in 4 separate groups, on a bus tour around the entire island of Taiwan to see the major scenic areas. These scenic attractions included [[Taroko National Park]], [[Sun Moon Lake]], [[Kenting National Park]], and [[Sanxiantai]], among others.  The end of the 9 day trip down South coincided with the end of the Study Tour and with all the students shortly returning (sometimes tearfully) to their countries of origin.\n\n==Addition of Ocean Campus in 1992==\n[[File:Ocean2.jpg|thumb|National Taiwan Ocean University Campus]]Starting in 1992, another memorable change occurred in the Study Tour in that Tam Kang Campus was replaced in use by [[Ocean Campus]] in [[Keelung]].  Many recall with fondness or revulsion the facilities of Ocean Campus.<ref>[http://www.explode.com/passport/taiwan.shtml Explode.com Study Tour Article \"Fear and Loathing in Taiwan\" (English)]</ref>  But by popular opinion, those students who were placed in Chientan Campus had the more comfortable facilities and the convenience to the nearby Shilin night market in Taipei.  In comparison, those students at Ocean Campus experienced slightly less convenient facilities albeit theirs did include more athletic and outdoor activities but unfortunately were a good cab ride away from the Taipei nightlife.  Without such amenities as Chientan campus, students at Ocean Campus often had no choice but to use their greater opportunities and free time at Ocean campus to communicate and bond.  Unfortunately, the idea and logistics behind a Campus switch between Chientan and Ocean would not come to fruition until the Study tour of 1996. During this switch, participants at Ocean and Chientan would switch campuses half-way during the Tour.  This type of switch would continue until the 2001 Study Tour.\n\n==Death of student in 1993 and subsequent lawsuit==\n[[File:Kenting.jpg|thumb|Bay of [[Kenting]], one of the scenic sites during \"The 9 day trip down South\"]]\nOne other reason for stricter rules involved the death of a student.  According to Valerie Soe's 2019 documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan<ref>[https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/about Loveboat Taiwan documentary Official Website ]</ref>\", in August 1993 during that year's \"9 day trip down south\", a participant went against the wishes of the counselors to swim in the bay of [[Kenting]].  The student was caught in an undertow and subsequently drowned while others were attempting to rescue him.  His body was not found until it washed up several days later.  This embroiled the Study tour in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which lasted many years and ended in a settlement.  Thus, stricter rules were created for the Study Tour overall not only for legal purposes but also for the protection of the students.  Although complete enforcement is extremely difficult for the counselors of the Tour,<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html Article detailing Studytour in Mid 1990s (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408160336/http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html |date=2007-04-08 }}</ref> students caught breaking major rules such as fighting, stealing, or sexual harassment are immediately sent home.\n\n==Changes from 2000 to 2012==\n[[File:Ktvtpe.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students enjoying a night at a Taipei KTV]]\nThe program maintained its number of participants and its program structure throughout the 1990s but this changed after the [[1999 Jiji earthquake]]. As a result, many parents were hesitant of sending their children to Taiwan. As a result, the number of participants in the year 2000 tour dropped to 800 as anyone who applied was accepted.  Further problems for the Study tour continued.  The Study Tour had historically been funded and supported by Taiwan's [[Kuomintang]] party since its inception in 1967.  After the 2000 Taiwan election, the incoming change of administration of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) did not fully support the aims or goals of the Study Tour.  As a result, funding was drastically cut and enrolment for the tour of 2001 was limited to 800 students.<ref>[http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html Article detailing study tour history (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116232224/http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html |date=2006-11-16 }}</ref> To cut costs, most students of that year were removed from the traditional Chientan building and moved to a smaller adjacent one that historically hosted the \"Baby Boat\", a much younger Study Tour, where participants were aged between 12\u201318. The cuts did not end there.  In 2002, due to lack of government support, the [[China Youth Corps]] which usually ran the program announced that it could no longer support a sizable number of students at Chientan for its 2002 Study Tour and that other organizations would have to pick up the slack.\n[[File:Militarytpe.jpg|thumb|Love Boat participants at a Taiwan military base in [[Kaoshiung]].  To meet its ideological aims, the Study Tour required students to attend demonstrations at various military bases and to attend lectures. ]]\nAs a result, in 2002 the Chientan campus hosted  about 100 students with other tour participants going to three other different campuses; including one campus near the Taipei Zoo and another in [[Taichung]].  The fourth group was the most unusual as they did not have a specific or permanent home base and spent most of their trip traveling around the island by bus.  This fourth group therefore, did not get nor require a \"Trip down South.\" There was no campus switch for this 2002 Study tour and each group hosted approximately 100 members.\n\nIn the over 50 year history of the Taiwan Study Tour, the students have survived through many travails such as earthquakes, typhoons, localized disease outbreaks, and even \nmissile threats/military posturing from China.  However, no Study Tour year was ever canceled due to these incidents except the 2003 year.  In 2003, the worldwide SARS outbreak caused the only ever cancellation of a Study Tour before it even began.  Parents were hesitant to send their children to Taiwan at the time and Tour organizers recognized the logistical nightmare due to widespread quarantine conditions.\n\nThe Study Tour resumed in 2004 with two groups and a new official name of \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Study Tour.\"  One group remained at Chientan Campus which on this year included more strictly enforced 11pm bed checks.  Another group was located at Taichung.  The enrolment slowly increased with Chientan campus eventually housing up to 200 Study tour students with the potential for greater expansion. Due to the insistence by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] between 2005-2007 there was increased pressure on the Study Tour to offer language classes in the Taiwanese dialect.  These changes did not last when the [[Kuomintang]] party returned to power in 2008 and the traditional classes in Mandarin were again re-established.\n\n==Changes to Chientan Campus==\n[[File:Shilinloveboat.jpg|thumb|Students enjoying the famous [[Shilin Night Market]] near Chientan Campus]]\nThe Chientan Youth Activity Center has been a fixture in the [[Shilin District]] for decades since the [[China Youth Corps]] first acquired property rights to 65% of the land it sits on prior to 1988 with the remaining 35% being state owned in a relationship that was complex.  In 2015, there were calls by Taipei City politicians to demolish and remove the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/03/2003617375Remove China Youth Corps\u2019 center: Taipei councilor]</ref> and to replace it with an arts center and park<ref>[https://www.eco-business.com/news/taipei-city-mulls-shilin-district-urban-renewal-plan/ Taipei City mulls Shilin District urban renewal plan</ref>.  Complicated negotiations between the [[China Youth Corps]] and the [[Taipei City Government]] continued into September 2016 until finally coming to a compromise.<ref>[https://english.geo.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=73D3E2CB30F6953F&sms=DFFA119D1FD5602C&s=127DCA87C2E42784] Taipei City Government has agreed on land resumption of Chientan Youth Activity Center and will continue the lease according to law</ref> Their agreement stipulated that by the end of 2024, all property rights to the Chientan Youth Activity Center would be transferred without compensation from the [[China Youth Corps]] to the [[Taipei City Government]].  What fate may lie for the Chientan Youth Activity Center after the beginning of 2025, whether it be renewal or demolition, remains unknown.\n\n==Changes from 2013 to current program==\n[[File:Loveboatclass.jpg|thumb|A typical Study Tour mandarin language class]]\nThe documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan\" further goes on to describe the dwindling number of students attending the Study Tour during the late 2000s up to the last larger-scale Study Tour year in 2013 which numbered at about 350 participants.  The number of Study Tour attendees dropped drastically after that year and currently sits at around 70-100 students accepted each summer.  Ironically, the current Study Tour being organized annually is similar in size to the very first Study Tour held in 1967 and is currently named \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour.<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=2169&pid=35039 \"Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour Official Website\"]</ref>\"  It is now solely run by the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]](OCAC) of Taiwan and according to its Official website<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/ Overseas Community Affairs Council Official Website]</ref> the Study Tour is now only a 3 week long program with an age group of between 18 and 25 years old.  It is also just one of the OCAC's many \"expatriate\" programs it runs for visiting international students in the summer and throughout the year.   Due to the shorter period of time, language training is less stressed than in previous years and with comparatively less emphasis on cross-straight relations.  With far fewer cultural classes offered as in past Study Tours due to the much smaller number of students, the current Tour focuses on introducing participants to Taiwan history, culture, landmarks, and also includes \"participation in earth environmental activities and charitable activities\" as described in the OCAC's application form. Participants also get the unique opportunity to visit the Office of the President of Taiwan, re-establishing the important historical link between Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese to Taiwan's goal of establishing greater international support and recognition.\n\nEven though Chinese communities in North America now enjoy greater mainstream acceptance than they did over 50 years ago, and despite the fact modern Chinese North Americans youths may take associating with each other for granted as well as an unquestioned way of life, the goals and endeavours of the Taiwan Study Tour remain the same.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe documentary [https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/ ''Loveboat Taiwan''] by Valerie Soe was released in 2019 to film festivals internationally and to public acclaim receiving several awards.<ref>[ http://urbannomad.tw/2019urbannomadawards/?lang=en Audience choice award for Loveboat Taiwan]</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2020 Harper Collins published Abigail Hing Wen's debut novel, [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23559994-loveboat-taipei ''Loveboat, Taipei''],<ref>[https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062957276/loveboat-taipei/ Loveboat, Taipei Novel]</ref> which made the New York Times best Top Ten best seller's list for Young Adult fiction.

The primary goal of the program was to acquaint, or re-acquaint, young people of Chinese descent living in other parts of the world with Chinese culture and language. Thus, participants take brief courses in language and arts, attend lectures, and take scenic tours of Taiwan. This however, is the popular perception of the program. The alternate and original purpose for the Taiwan Government's subsidizing of the program was to shore up [[Overseas Chinese]] support for its cross-strait political policies, particularly those of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in regards to its tense relations with China. Accordingly, participants were to attend lectures on cross-strait relations which others might perceive as propaganda. The program was conceived by the Taiwan Government in part because the [[Kuomintang]] for many decades had recognized the historical importance of the [[Overseas Chinese]] community not only for its financing but also for its political support.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23462345?seq=1 Taiwan and Overseas Chinese during the Cold War Era]</ref>  In fact Dr. [[Sun Yat-Sen]],<ref>[http://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=sun_yat-sen.html Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]</ref> the founder of the [[Kuomintang]] as well as the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]], recognized early the importance of [[Overseas Chinese]] support<ref>[https://www.straight.com/blogra/faces-vancouver-kuomintang-building-chinatown Sun Yat-Sen and Overseas Chinese history]</ref> and went as far as to say that \"Overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.<ref>[http://www.heroesofconfederation.com/Sun_Yat_Sen/sun_mission(1).html Sun Yat-Sen acknowledgement of Overseas Chinese]</ref>\"  However, beyond the political origins of the Study Tour, the program is most famous for its historically positive influence on Chinese American identity in addition to its \"[[Loveboat]]\" reputation of spawning many relationships as well hosting a frenetic nightlife scene which many participants indulged in.\n\n==Changes from 1967 to 1999==\n[[File:Lb1969a.jpg|thumb|Official 1969 Certificate of attendance for the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour.

After an experimental trial run in 1966 of only 5 students from North America<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4271166/_Chinese_American_Transnationalism_Aboard_the_Love_Boat_The_Overseas_Youth_Language_Training_and_Study_Tour_to_the_Republic_of_China_ Chinese American Transnationalism aboard the Loveboat]</ref>, the [[China Youth Corps]] conducted the first official Study Tour in 1967 which hosted 70-100 participants from America and Canada, with an age range of between 14 and 25.  According to journalist [[Jan Wong]], a 1969 Study Tour participant, the first few years of the Study Tour program were held at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. As the popularity of the program grew, the number of participants increased and the headquarters moved to the Chientan Youth Activity Center in the 1970s located in the [[Shilin District]] near modern day [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] station.  During this time, the [[China Youth Corps]] had changed the name of the Study Tour to become \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China,\" to be more in line with their political ideology. By the 1970s and 1980s, the average size of the program slowly grew to 300\u2013500 students up until 1988 and then in 1989 peaked exponentially at 1,200 participants. Due to the overwhelming increase in demand participants had to be placed in two separate campuses in 1990, one remaining at Chientan Campus and the other new one held at Taipei's [[Tam Kang Campus]].  During this time, and due to the increase in student size, the [[China Youth Corps]] came to share sponsoring responsibilities with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which has since been renamed the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]].\n\n[[File:Chientan.jpg|thumb|Chientan Youth Activity Center]]\nThis increase in enrolment coincided with both Taiwan's 1987 lifting of [[martial law]] and also its astronomical economic rise in the technology boom which greatly increased the island's reputation and prosperity. Further, because many originally skeptical participants were returning home with a greater appreciation of Taiwanese culture, improved Chinese language skills and were raving about the quality of the Tour to their family, this consequently led to good word of mouth about the program being spread within the international Chinese community.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/popup.php?x=news3 Direct link to August 3rd, 2004 Toronto Star article \"Finding a Mate Offshore\" by William Lin]</ref> This was especially pertinent in the 1970s and 1980s when Chinese communities were smaller than present day and a clear sense of \"Asian American identity\" for many North American born Chinese was nebulous at best. Many American-born Chinese who initially did not have any Chinese language skills and who refused to date a fellow Asian, returned from the Tour not only expressing a greater appreciation of Chinese language and culture but also a greater willingness to date within the Asian community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011209130536/http://www.geocities.com/jodeman.geo/loveboat.htm 'A More Complete Description of The Love Boat\" (English)]</ref>  There were many reasons for this, but especially for those participants who came from communities without many Chinese, the Study Tour provided a unique forum to share their common \"Chinese North American Experience\" of growing up and needing to reconcile both North American and Asian Cultures in a predominantly Caucasian society. This bonding not only produced several relationships but it also created many lifelong friendships. In addition, it did not hurt that during the trip, students were treated as \"little diplomats.\" This was witnessed during their police escorted bus trips to local Taipei landmarks where local traffic was essentially stopped for the convenience of their journey and to the relative chagrin of local Taiwanese commuters. This same sense of diplomacy was bestowed upon them at various military installations and cultural performances that students attended and were attempts by the program to ingratiate students with the people and culture of Taiwan. These various aspects of the Study Tour combined with the fact that 6 weeks of room and board (excluding airfare) only cost the participant $400 US dollars, due to Taiwan government subsidization, also led to increased popularity for the trip, as most agreed it was an excellent deal. \n[[File:224273 9461070452 3021 n.jpg|thumb|Students sneaking out of Chientan Campus at night to party]]\nHowever, a by-product of the Study Tour's increased popularity was increased competition by parents to register their children especially at large urban centers in New York and California. In fact, there were often waiting lists to get on the program and for some parents getting their child on the program became a symbol of status and often pertinent or high-ranking connections facilitated the application process for their child.  Some parents desiring their children to find a \"suitable Chinese spouse\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113166784230094239 The Loveboat Wall Street Journal Article]</ref> sent their unsuspecting children on the trip while telling them it was chiefly a Language Study Tour.  Conversely, some students who were interested in attending would often neglect to inform their parents about the Study Tour's [[Love Boat]] reputation for fear of not being allowed to go.  These concerns by some parents came from rumours that a few participants engaged in sexually promiscuous activity. On the other side of the spectrum, several Study Tour attendees did happen to fall in love and end up marrying each other. All these instances led to the Study Tour gaining its [[Love Boat]] nickname and reputation.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/index.php?y=inthenews ''Toronto Star'' 3 August 2004 article on the Study Tour re-published by Click2Asia.  Click2Asia indicates date and source of material (Toronto Star) in this link]</ref> Several unplanned pregnancies were however documented on the 1996 Study Tour which resulted in more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly administered curfews. \n\n[[File:Loveboatclub.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students of the Love Boat enjoying an evening at a Taipei Dance Club]]\nThe job of implementing these many rules has traditionally been overseen by many local college-aged Taiwan counselors whose responsibilities, from early morning to late at night, consisted of organizing all the various logistics of the students' itinerary. This included organizing language/cultural classes, trips outings, speech contests, meals, medical care, guest speakers, and enforcing discipline which included trying to prevent (in vain) the students from sneaking out of the campus in the evening to enjoy the Taipei nightlife. Due to the sheer volume of minor misdeeds many counselors had to turn a blind eye and instead focused their energies on ensuring the safety and well being of the students. Becoming a Study Tour counselor for local Taiwanese was considered by many a badge of honour, as throughout the 1960s to the 1990s, the [[China Youth Corps]] only accepted local Taiwan applicants from the best Taiwan universities and degree programs in a rigorous selection process. For many counselors, the Study Tour was their very first contact with Chinese from abroad and many found the cultural exchange as life-changing as did the students who attended.\n\nAnother prerequisite of the Study Tour by the 1980s had become mandatory [[university]] enrolment, with a preference for students in [[Ivy League]] universities and students in their final year of university and thus near the age limit. Students with high academic achievements such as Presidential Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, or Truman Scholars were also given higher priority and were able to attend the Study Tour without charge.  Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year so as to avoiding hoarding of spots by families. Exceptions were made however to twins and siblings from Europe. Participation had gradually increased from Europe, especially countries such as France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK. Countries such as Australia and those from South America and Africa also began sending small numbers of Study Tour participants. This contributed greatly to the sense of international community among [[Overseas Chinese]] worldwide.\n[[File:222318 9461130452 2683 n.jpg|thumb|CYC President Dr. Jeanne Li giving her final speech during the 2000 Study Tour Closing Ceremony]]\nBy the 1990s, the Study Tour had become a 6 week long program with an enrolment of 1200 participants aged from 18\u201323 with a management staff of over 80 Counselors.  As the size of the program expanded, more cultural classes were added to the existing language class education schedule. These classes now included calligraphy, cooking, Chinese medicine, Chinese yo-yo, fan dancing, flute, kung-fu, painting, paper cutting, stick-fighting, southern fiddle, sword-fighting, Taiwanese aboriginal dance, ribbon dancing, zither, and several others.  After 4 weeks of training, some students would perform what they learned during the \"Closing Ceremony\" in front of an audience of Study Tour participants and several high-level government officials at the Chientan Youth Activity Center auditorium.  This Closing Ceremony preceded the famous \"9 day trip down South\" which took all 1,200 study tour participants, in 4 separate groups, on a bus tour around the entire island of Taiwan to see the major scenic areas. These scenic attractions included [[Taroko National Park]], [[Sun Moon Lake]], [[Kenting National Park]], and [[Sanxiantai]], among others.  The end of the 9 day trip down South coincided with the end of the Study Tour and with all the students shortly returning (sometimes tearfully) to their countries of origin.\n\n==Addition of Ocean Campus in 1992==\n[[File:Ocean2.jpg|thumb|National Taiwan Ocean University Campus]]Starting in 1992, another memorable change occurred in the Study Tour in that Tam Kang Campus was replaced in use by [[Ocean Campus]] in [[Keelung]].  Many recall with fondness or revulsion the facilities of Ocean Campus.<ref>[http://www.explode.com/passport/taiwan.shtml Explode.com Study Tour Article \"Fear and Loathing in Taiwan\" (English)]</ref>  But by popular opinion, those students who were placed in Chientan Campus had the more comfortable facilities and the convenience to the nearby Shilin night market in Taipei.  In comparison, those students at Ocean Campus experienced slightly less convenient facilities albeit theirs did include more athletic and outdoor activities but unfortunately were a good cab ride away from the Taipei nightlife.  Without such amenities as Chientan campus, students at Ocean Campus often had no choice but to use their greater opportunities and free time at Ocean campus to communicate and bond.  Unfortunately, the idea and logistics behind a Campus switch between Chientan and Ocean would not come to fruition until the Study tour of 1996. During this switch, participants at Ocean and Chientan would switch campuses half-way during the Tour.  This type of switch would continue until the 2001 Study Tour.\n\n==Death of student in 1993 and subsequent lawsuit==\n[[File:Kenting.jpg|thumb|Bay of [[Kenting]], one of the scenic sites during \"The 9 day trip down South\"]]\nOne other reason for stricter rules involved the death of a student.  According to Valerie Soe's 2019 documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan<ref>[https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/about Loveboat Taiwan documentary Official Website ]</ref>\", in August 1993 during that year's \"9 day trip down south\", a participant went against the wishes of the counselors to swim in the bay of [[Kenting]].  The student was caught in an undertow and subsequently drowned while others were attempting to rescue him.  His body was not found until it washed up several days later.  This embroiled the Study tour in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which lasted many years and ended in a settlement.  Thus, stricter rules were created for the Study Tour overall not only for legal purposes but also for the protection of the students.  Although complete enforcement is extremely difficult for the counselors of the Tour,<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html Article detailing Studytour in Mid 1990s (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408160336/http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html |date=2007-04-08 }}</ref> students caught breaking major rules such as fighting, stealing, or sexual harassment are immediately sent home.\n\n==Changes from 2000 to 2012==\n[[File:Ktvtpe.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students enjoying a night at a Taipei KTV]]\nThe program maintained its number of participants and its program structure throughout the 1990s but this changed after the [[1999 Jiji earthquake]]. As a result, many parents were hesitant of sending their children to Taiwan. As a result, the number of participants in the year 2000 tour dropped to 800 as anyone who applied was accepted.  Further problems for the Study tour continued.  The Study Tour had historically been funded and supported by Taiwan's [[Kuomintang]] party since its inception in 1967.  After the 2000 Taiwan election, the incoming change of administration of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) did not fully support the aims or goals of the Study Tour.  As a result, funding was drastically cut and enrolment for the tour of 2001 was limited to 800 students.<ref>[http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html Article detailing study tour history (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116232224/http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html |date=2006-11-16 }}</ref> To cut costs, most students of that year were removed from the traditional Chientan building and moved to a smaller adjacent one that historically hosted the \"Baby Boat\", a much younger Study Tour, where participants were aged between 12\u201318. The cuts did not end there.  In 2002, due to lack of government support, the [[China Youth Corps]] which usually ran the program announced that it could no longer support a sizable number of students at Chientan for its 2002 Study Tour and that other organizations would have to pick up the slack.\n[[File:Militarytpe.jpg|thumb|Love Boat participants at a Taiwan military base in [[Kaoshiung]].  To meet its ideological aims, the Study Tour required students to attend demonstrations at various military bases and to attend lectures. ]]\nAs a result, in 2002 the Chientan campus hosted  about 100 students with other tour participants going to three other different campuses; including one campus near the Taipei Zoo and another in [[Taichung]].  The fourth group was the most unusual as they did not have a specific or permanent home base and spent most of their trip traveling around the island by bus.  This fourth group therefore, did not get nor require a \"Trip down South.\" There was no campus switch for this 2002 Study tour and each group hosted approximately 100 members.\n\nIn the over 50 year history of the Taiwan Study Tour, the students have survived through many travails such as earthquakes, typhoons, localized disease outbreaks, and even \nmissile threats/military posturing from China.  However, no Study Tour year was ever canceled due to these incidents except the 2003 year.  In 2003, the worldwide SARS outbreak caused the only ever cancellation of a Study Tour before it even began.  Parents were hesitant to send their children to Taiwan at the time and Tour organizers recognized the logistical nightmare due to widespread quarantine conditions.\n\nThe Study Tour resumed in 2004 with two groups and a new official name of \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Study Tour.\"  One group remained at Chientan Campus which on this year included more strictly enforced 11pm bed checks.  Another group was located at Taichung.  The enrolment slowly increased with Chientan campus eventually housing up to 200 Study tour students with the potential for greater expansion. Due to the insistence by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] between 2005-2007 there was increased pressure on the Study Tour to offer language classes in the Taiwanese dialect.  These changes did not last when the [[Kuomintang]] party returned to power in 2008 and the traditional classes in mandarin were again re-established.\n\n==Changes to Chientan Campus==\n[[File:Shilinloveboat.jpg|thumb|Students enjoying the famous [[Shilin Night Market]] near Chientan Campus]]\nThe Chientan Youth Activity Center has been a fixture in the [[Shilin District]] for decades since the [[China Youth Corps]] first acquired property rights to 65% of the land it sits on prior to 1988 with the remaining 35% being state owned in a relationship that was complex.  In 2015, there were calls by Taipei City politicians to demolish and remove the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/03/2003617375Remove China Youth Corps\u2019 center: Taipei councilor]</ref> and to replace it with an arts center and park<ref>[https://www.eco-business.com/news/taipei-city-mulls-shilin-district-urban-renewal-plan/ Taipei City mulls Shilin District urban renewal plan</ref>.  Complicated negotiations between the [[China Youth Corps]] and the [[Taipei City Government]] continued into September 2016 until finally coming to a compromise.<ref>[https://english.geo.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=73D3E2CB30F6953F&sms=DFFA119D1FD5602C&s=127DCA87C2E42784] Taipei City Government has agreed on land resumption of Chientan Youth Activity Center and will continue the lease according to law</ref> Their agreement stipulated that by the end of 2024, all property rights to the Chientan Youth Activity Center would be transferred without compensation from the [[China Youth Corps]] to the [[Taipei City Government]].  What fate may lie for the Chientan Youth Activity Center after the beginning of 2025, whether it be renewal or demolition, remains unknown.\n\n==Changes from 2013 to current program==\n[[File:Loveboatclass.jpg|thumb|A typical Study Tour mandarin language class]]\nThe documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan\" further goes on to describe the dwindling number of students attending the Study Tour during the late 2000s up to the last larger-scale Study Tour year in 2013 which numbered at about 350 participants.  The number of Study Tour attendees dropped drastically after that year and currently sits at around 70-100 students accepted each summer.  Ironically, the current Study Tour being organized annually is similar in size to the very first Study Tour held in 1967 and is currently named \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour.<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=2169&pid=35039 \"Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour Official Website\"]</ref>\"  It is now solely run by the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]](OCAC) of Taiwan and according to its Official website<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/ Overseas Community Affairs Council Official Website]</ref> the Study Tour is now only a 3 week long program with an age group of between 18 and 25 years old.  It is also just one of the OCAC's many \"expatriate\" programs it runs for visiting international students in the summer and throughout the year.   Due to the shorter period of time, language training is less stressed than in previous years and with comparatively less emphasis on cross-straight relations.  With far fewer cultural classes offered as in past Study Tours due to the much smaller number of students, the current Tour focuses on introducing participants to Taiwan history, culture, landmarks, and also includes \"participation in earth environmental activities and charitable activities\" as described in the OCAC's application form. Participants also get the unique opportunity to visit the Office of the President of Taiwan, re-establishing the important historical link between Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese to Taiwan's goal of establishing greater international support and recognition.\n\nEven though Chinese communities in North America now enjoy greater mainstream acceptance than they did over 50 years ago, and despite the fact modern Chinese North Americans youths may take associating with each other for granted as well as an unquestioned way of life, the goals and endeavours of the Taiwan Study Tour remain the same.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe documentary [https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/ ''Loveboat Taiwan''] by Valerie Soe was released in 2019 to film festivals internationally and to public acclaim receiving several awards.<ref>[ http://urbannomad.tw/2019urbannomadawards/?lang=en Audience choice award for Loveboat Taiwan]</ref>\n\nOn January 7, 2020 Harper Collins published Abigail Hing Wen's debut novel, [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23559994-loveboat-taipei ''Loveboat, Taipei''],<ref>[https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062957276/loveboat-taipei/ Loveboat, Taipei Novel]</ref> which made the New York Times best Top Ten best seller's list for Young Adult fiction.

{"title_page": "Software framework", "text_new": "{{short description|Type of library that helps structure other software}}\n{{Redirect|Framework (computer science)||Framework (disambiguation)}}\nIn [[computer programming]], a '''software framework''' is an [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] in which [[software]] providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable [[software environment (disambiguation)|software environment]] that provides particular functionality as part of a larger [[software platform]] to facilitate development of [[software application]]s, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and [[application programming interface|application programming interfaces (APIs)]] that bring together all the different [[Software component|components]] to enable development of a [[software project|project]] or [[software system|system]].\n\nFrameworks have key distinguishing features that separate them from normal [[Library (computing)|libraries]]:\n\n* ''[[inversion of control]]'': In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program's [[control flow|flow of control]] is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.<ref>{{citation|url= http://www.riehle.org/computer-science/research/dissertation/diss-a4.pdf|first= Dirk|last= Riehle|title= Framework Design: A Role Modeling Approach|publisher= [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]]|year= 2000|postscript= <!--none-->}}</ref>\n* ''[[extensibility]]'': A user can extend the framework \u2013 usually by selective overriding \u2013 or programmers can add specialized user code to provide specific functionality.\n* ''[[open/closed principle|non-modifiable framework code]]'': The framework code, in general, is not supposed to be modified, while accepting user-implemented extensions. In other words, users can extend the framework, but cannot modify its code.\n\n== Rationale ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2011}}\n{{Summarize section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Weasel|section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Essay-like|section|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\nThe designers of software frameworks aim to facilitate software developments by allowing designers and programmers to devote their time to meeting software requirements rather than  dealing with the more standard low-level details of providing a working system, thereby reducing overall development time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Framework |title=Framework |accessdate=15 December 2008 |work= DocForge}}</ref>  For example, a team using a [[web framework]] to develop a banking website can focus on writing code particular to banking rather than the mechanics of request handling and [[state management]].\n\nFrameworks often add to the size of programs, a phenomenon termed \"[[code bloat]]\". Due to customer-demand driven applications needs, both competing and complementary frameworks sometimes end up in a product.  Further, due to the complexity of their APIs, the intended reduction in overall development time may not be achieved due to the need to spend additional time learning to use the framework; this criticism is clearly valid when a special or new framework is first encountered by development staff.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} If such a framework is not used in subsequent job taskings, the time invested in learning the framework can cost more than purpose-written code familiar to the project's staff; many programmers keep copies of useful boilerplate for common needs.\n\nHowever, once a framework is learned, future projects can be faster and easier to complete; the concept of a framework is to make a one-size-fits-all solution set, and with familiarity, code production should logically rise. There are no such claims made about the size of the code eventually bundled with the output product, nor its relative efficiency and conciseness. Using any library solution necessarily pulls in extras and unused extraneous assets unless the software is a compiler-object linker making a tight (small, wholly controlled, and specified) executable module.\n\nThe issue continues, but a decade-plus of industry experience{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} has shown that the most effective frameworks turn out to be those that evolve from re-factoring the common code of the enterprise, instead of using a generic \"one-size-fits-all\" framework developed by third parties for general purposes. An example of that would be how the user interface in such an application package as an office suite grows to have common look, feel, and data-sharing attributes and methods, as the once disparate bundled applications grow unified into a suite which is tighter and smaller; the newer/evolved suite can be a product that shares integral utility libraries and user interfaces.\n\nThis trend in the controversy brings up an important issue about frameworks. Creating a framework that is elegant, versus one that merely solves a problem, is still rather a craft than a science. \"Software [[elegance]]\" implies clarity, conciseness, and little waste (extra or extraneous functionality, much of which is user defined). For those frameworks that generate code, for example, \"elegance\" would imply the creation of code that is clean and comprehensible to a reasonably knowledgeable programmer (and which is therefore readily modifiable), versus one that merely generates correct code. The elegance issue is why relatively few software frameworks have stood the test of time: the best frameworks have been able to evolve gracefully as the underlying technology on which they were built advanced. Even there, having evolved, many such packages will retain legacy capabilities bloating the final software as otherwise replaced methods have been retained in parallel with the newer methods.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nSoftware frameworks typically contain considerable housekeeping and utility code in order to help bootstrap user applications, but generally focus on specific problem domains, such as:\n* Artistic drawing, music composition, and mechanical [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]<ref>{{citation|doi = 10.1145/98188.98197|last1 = Vlissides|first1 = J M|last2 = Linton|first2 = M A|year = 1990|title = Unidraw: a framework for building domain-specific graphical editors|journal = ACM Transactions on Information Systems|volume = 8|issue = 3|pages =237\u2013268|postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last = Johnson|first = R E|year = 1992|title = Documenting frameworks using patterns|publisher = ACM Press|journal = Proceedings of the Conference on Object Oriented Programming Systems Languages and Applications|pages = 63\u201376|postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref>\n* Financial modeling applications<ref>{{citation|last1 = Birrer|first1 = A|first2 = T|last2 = Eggenschwiler|year = 1993|work = Frameworks in the financial engineering domain: an experience report|publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]|title = Proceedings of the European conference on object-oriented programming|pages = 21\u201335}}</ref>\n* Earth system modeling applications<ref>{{citation|last1 = Hill|first1 = C|first2 = C|last2 = DeLuca|first3 = V|last3 = Balaji|first4 = M|last4 = Suarez|first5 = A|last5 = da Silva|title = Architecture of the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)|journal = Computing in Science and Engineering|volume = 6|year = 2004|pages = 18\u201328|postscript = <!--none-->|title-link = ESMF|doi = 10.1109/MCISE.2004.1255817}}</ref>\n* [[Decision support systems]]<ref>{{citation|last = Gachet|first = A|year = 2003|title = Software Frameworks for Developing Decision Support Systems \u2013 A New Component in the Classification of DSS Development Tools|journal = Journal of Decision Systems|volume = 12|issue = 3|pages = 271\u2013281|postscript = <!--none-->|doi = 10.3166/jds.12.271-280}}</ref>\n* Media playback and authoring\n* [[Ajax framework]] / [[JavaScript framework]]\n* [[Web framework]]\n* [[Middleware]]\n* [[Cactus Framework]] - High performance scientific computing.\n* [[Application framework]] - General GUI applications.\n* [[Enterprise Architecture framework]]\n* [[Oracle Application Development Framework]]\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nAccording to Pree,<ref>{{citation|title = Meta Patterns: A Means for Capturing the Essentials of Reusable Object-Oriented Design |author = Pree, W |journal = Proceedings of the 8th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming |volume = 821 |pages = 150\u2013162 |year = 1994 |publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]|doi = 10.1007/BFb0052181 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.74.7935 |series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn = 978-3-540-58202-1 }}</ref> software frameworks consist of ''frozen spots'' and ''hot spots''.

It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable [[software environment (disambiguation)|software environment]] that provides particular functionality as part of a larger [[software platform]] to facilitate development of [[software application]]s, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and [[application programming interface|application programming interfaces (APIs)]] that bring together all the different [[Software component|components]] to enable development of a [[software project|project]] or [[software system|system]].\n\nFrameworks have key distinguishing features that separate them from normal [[Library (computing)|libraries]]:\n\n* ''[[inversion of control]]'': In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program's [[control flow|flow of control]] is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.<ref>{{citation|url= http://www.riehle.org/computer-science/research/dissertation/diss-a4.pdf|first= Dirk|last= Riehle|title= Framework Design: A Role Modeling Approach|publisher= [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]]|year= 2000|postscript= <!--none-->}}</ref>\n* ''[[extensibility]]'': A user can extend the framework \u2013 usually by selective overriding \u2013 or programmers can add specialized user code to provide specific functionality.\n* ''[[open/closed principle|non-modifiable framework code]]'': The framework code, in general, is not supposed to be modified, while accepting user-implemented extensions. In other words, users can extend the framework, but cannot modify its code.\n\n== Rationale ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2011}}\n{{Summarize section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Weasel|section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Essay-like|section|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\nThe designers of software frameworks aim to facilitate software developments by allowing designers and programmers to devote their time to meeting software requirements rather than  dealing with the more standard low-level details of providing a working system, thereby reducing overall development time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Framework |title=Framework |accessdate=15 December 2008 |work= DocForge}}</ref>  For example, a team using a [[web framework]] to develop a banking website can focus on writing code particular to banking rather than the mechanics of request handling and [[state management]].\n\nFrameworks often add to the size of programs, a phenomenon termed \"[[code bloat]]\". Due to customer-demand driven applications needs, both competing and complementary frameworks sometimes end up in a product.  Further, due to the complexity of their APIs, the intended reduction in overall development time may not be achieved due to the need to spend additional time learning to use the framework; this criticism is clearly valid when a special or new framework is first encountered by development staff.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} If such a framework is not used in subsequent job taskings, the time invested in learning the framework can cost more than purpose-written code familiar to the project's staff; many programmers keep copies of useful boilerplate for common needs.\n\nHowever, once a framework is learned, future projects can be faster and easier to complete; the concept of a framework is to make a one-size-fits-all solution set, and with familiarity, code production should logically rise. There are no such claims made about the size of the code eventually bundled with the output product, nor its relative efficiency and conciseness. Using any library solution necessarily pulls in extras and unused extraneous assets unless the software is a compiler-object linker making a tight (small, wholly controlled, and specified) executable module.\n\nThe issue continues, but a decade-plus of industry experience{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} has shown that the most effective frameworks turn out to be those that evolve from re-factoring the common code of the enterprise, instead of using a generic \"one-size-fits-all\" framework developed by third parties for general purposes. An example of that would be how the user interface in such an application package as an office suite grows to have common look, feel, and data-sharing attributes and methods, as the once disparate bundled applications grow unified into a suite which is tighter and smaller; the newer/evolved suite can be a product that shares integral utility libraries and user interfaces.\n\nThis trend in the controversy brings up an important issue about frameworks. Creating a framework that is elegant, versus one that merely solves a problem, is still rather a craft than a science. \"Software [[elegance]]\" implies clarity, conciseness, and little waste (extra or extraneous functionality, much of which is user defined). For those frameworks that generate code, for example, \"elegance\" would imply the creation of code that is clean and comprehensible to a reasonably knowledgeable programmer (and which is therefore readily modifiable), versus one that merely generates correct code. The elegance issue is why relatively few software frameworks have stood the test of time: the best frameworks have been able to evolve gracefully as the underlying technology on which they were built advanced. Even there, having evolved, many such packages will retain legacy capabilities bloating the final software as otherwise replaced methods have been retained in parallel with the newer methods.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nSoftware frameworks typically contain considerable housekeeping and utility code in order to help bootstrap user applications, but generally focus on specific problem domains, such as:\n* Artistic drawing, music composition, and mechanical [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]<ref>{{citation|doi = 10.1145/98188.98197|last1 = Vlissides|first1 = J M|last2 = Linton|first2 = M A|year = 1990|title = Unidraw: a framework for building domain-specific graphical editors|journal = ACM Transactions on Information Systems|volume = 8|issue = 3|pages =237\u2013268|postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last = Johnson|first = R E|year = 1992|title = Documenting frameworks using patterns|publisher = ACM Press|journal = Proceedings of the Conference on Object Oriented Programming Systems Languages and Applications|pages = 63\u201376|postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref>\n* Financial modeling applications<ref>{{citation|last1 = Birrer|first1 = A|first2 = T|last2 = Eggenschwiler|year = 1993|work = Frameworks in the financial engineering domain: an experience report|publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]|title = Proceedings of the European conference on object-oriented programming|pages = 21\u201335}}</ref>\n* Earth system modeling applications<ref>{{citation|last1 = Hill|first1 = C|first2 = C|last2 = DeLuca|first3 = V|last3 = Balaji|first4 = M|last4 = Suarez|first5 = A|last5 = da Silva|title = Architecture of the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)|journal = Computing in Science and Engineering|volume = 6|year = 2004|pages = 18\u201328|postscript = <!--none-->|title-link = ESMF|doi = 10.1109/MCISE.2004.1255817}}</ref>\n* [[Decision support systems]]<ref>{{citation|last = Gachet|first = A|year = 2003|title = Software Frameworks for Developing Decision Support Systems \u2013 A New Component in the Classification of DSS Development Tools|journal = Journal of Decision Systems|volume = 12|issue = 3|pages = 271\u2013281|postscript = <!--none-->|doi = 10.3166/jds.12.271-280}}</ref>\n* Media playback and authoring\n* [[Ajax framework]] / [[JavaScript framework]]\n* [[Web framework]]\n* [[Middleware]]\n* [[Cactus Framework]] - High performance scientific computing.\n* [[Application framework]] - General GUI applications.\n* [[Enterprise Architecture framework]]\n* [[Oracle Application Development Framework]]\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nAccording to Pree,<ref>{{citation|title = Meta Patterns: A Means for Capturing the Essentials of Reusable Object-Oriented Design |author = Pree, W |journal = Proceedings of the 8th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming |volume = 821 |pages = 150\u2013162 |year = 1994 |publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]|doi = 10.1007/BFb0052181 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.74.7935 |series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn = 978-3-540-58202-1 }}</ref> software frameworks consist of ''frozen spots'' and ''hot spots''.

Since Bailey's death in 1983, the book has been updated by historians [[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David M. Kennedy]] and [[Lizabeth Cohen]], and it is now in its seventeenth edition.\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Twelfth edition===\nFour different versions of the 12th edition were printed. All are divided into six parts, from \"Founding the New Nation\" (with an initial chapter on prehistory, natives, and European exploration) through \"Making Modern America.\"  The six parts are subdivided into a total of 42 chapters spanning 1034 pages. The book's chronology officially ends in the year 2001, though later printings include an additional three paragraphs detailing the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 US election]] as well as [[September 11 attacks|September 11]]. Since then, the incumbent edition of ''the American Pageant'' included information regarding the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 Presidential Election]].\n\nThe four versions of the Twelfth Edition are the Complete Edition, the version \"For Advanced High School Courses,\" published by [[Houghton Mifflin]]. There are also two editions that split the textbook into two volumes: Volume I, which covers American history up to 1877, and Volume II, which covers the American history since 1865.\n\n===Thirteenth edition===\nThe thirteenth edition, released in 2006, contains 42 chapters in six sections. The book's chronology is updated, briefly covering the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States' invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. Chapters 27 and 28 from the 12th Edition were combined in the 13th edition.\n\n===Fourteenth edition===\nThe fourteenth edition, released in 2010, contains 42 chapters in six parts. This edition adds twelve new \"Thinking Globally\" essays and many new box-quotes adding more international voices to the events chronicled in the book's historical narrative. The \"Varying Viewpoints\" essays were updated reflecting new interpretations of significant trends and events, as well as concern for their global context. The text's global focus is renewed and strengthened. Also the edition has new and revised primary source features called \"Examining the Evidence\".\n\n===Fifteenth edition===\nThe fifteenth edition, released in 2013, contains 42 chapters in six parts. This edition includes markedly deeper cultural innovations, artistic movements, and intellectual doctrines that have engaged and inspired Americans and shaped the course of history of the United States, new \"Thinking Globally\" essay on twentieth-century [[modernism]] in Chapter 31, new \"Makers of America\" feature on [[Beat Generation]] of the 1950s in Chapter 37. The book's tables, graphs, Key Terms, People to Know, and To Learn More sections are also updated. This is the first edition in which Bailey is not credited as an author on the cover and the title page.<ref name=DeadandForgotten/>\n\n===Sixteenth edition===\nThe sixteenth edition, released in 2015, contains 41 chapters in six parts. This edition's Part Six, which covers post-1945 period is revised. Chapters 29 and 30 from the 15th Edition were combined in the sixteenth edition. Each chapter has a new feature called \u201cContending Voices\u201d, which offers paired quotes from original historical sources, accompanied by questions which prompt students to think about conflicting perspectives on controversial subjects.\n\n== Evaluation==\nHistorian [[Emil Pocock]], evaluating the 10th edition of 1994, argues that the publisher has made a special effort to be more approachable for beginning students by using a more basic vocabulary, simpler concepts, and features designed to aid learning. This textbook, he says, therefore uses easy syntax, unsophisticated interpretations, and gives only limited coverage to complex and controversial topics. The typeface is large, and the page layout is generous with many color illustrations. It gives a basic political narrative emphasizing great men and famous events, although it does include new topics regarding diversity of race and gender.\nPocock states:\n:It is at heart a patriotic work that celebrates American progress and the free enterprise system, while largely ignoring dissenting political viewpoints outside the mainstream. Sidebars present broader historiographic interpretations, but the context seems clearly intended to convey the notion that these other views are mistaken in some way.<ref>Peter J. Parish, ed.

The region has numerous remains from the [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], such as [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]]. In the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], all of Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]], was inhabited by the [[Celts|Celtic]] people known as the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]], including some [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribes (e.g. the [[Atrebates]], the [[Catuvellauni]], the [[Trinovantes]], etc.) in the south east.  In AD 43 the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] began; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] maintained control of their [[Roman Britain|province of Britannia]] until the early 5th century.\n\nThe [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] facilitated the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], which historians often regard as the origin of England and of the [[English people]].  The [[Anglo-Saxons]], a collection of various [[Germanic peoples]], established several kingdoms that became the primary powers in present-day England and parts of southern [[Scotland]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/saxons.shtml The Anglo-Saxons], BBC \u2013 History</ref> They introduced the [[Old English]] language, which largely displaced the previous [[Common Brittonic|British language]].  The Anglo-Saxons warred with British successor states in western Britain and the ''[[Hen Ogledd]]'' (Old North; the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-speaking parts of northern Britain), as well as with each other.  Raids by [[Vikings]] became frequent after about AD 800, and the [[Norsemen]] settled in large parts of what is now England.  During this period, several rulers attempted to unite the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, an effort that led to the emergence of the [[Kingdom of England]] by the 10th century.\n\nIn 1066, a [[Norman conquest of England|Norman expedition invaded and conquered England]].  The [[House of Normandy|Norman dynasty]] established by [[William the Conqueror]] ruled England for over half a century before the period of succession crisis known as [[the Anarchy]] (1135\u20131154).  Following the Anarchy, England came under the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet]], a dynasty which later inherited claims to the [[Kingdom of France]]. During this period, ''[[Magna Carta]]'' was signed. A succession crisis in France led to the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453), a series of conflicts involving the peoples of both nations.  Following the Hundred Years' Wars, England became embroiled in its own succession wars. The [[Wars of the Roses]] pitted two branches of the House of Plantagenet against one another, the [[House of York]] and the [[House of Lancaster]]. The Lancastrian [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] ended the War of the Roses and established the [[Tudor dynasty]] in 1485.\n\nUnder the Tudors and the later [[Stuart dynasty]], England became a colonial power. During the rule of the Stuarts, the [[English Civil War]] took place between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists, which resulted in [[Execution of Charles I|the execution]] of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] (1649) and the establishment of a series of republican governments \u2014 first, a Parliamentary republic known as the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653), then a military dictatorship under [[Oliver Cromwell]] known as [[The Protectorate]] (1653\u20131659).  The Stuarts returned to the restored throne in 1660, though continued questions over religion and power resulted in the deposition of another Stuart king, [[James II of England|James II]], in the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688). England, which had subsumed Wales in the 16th century under Henry VIII, united with Scotland in 1707 to form a new sovereign state called [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm Uniting the kingdom?] nationalarchives.gov.uk, accessed 2 July 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp The Union of the Parliaments 1707] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102060414/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp |date=2 January 2012 }} [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]], accessed 2 July 2011</ref><ref>Union with England Act 1707, Article II</ref> Following the [[Industrial Revolution]], Great Britain ruled a colonial [[British Empire|Empire]], the largest in recorded history.  Following a process of [[decolonisation]] in the 20th century, mainly caused by the weakening of Great Britain's power in the two World Wars, almost all of the empire's overseas territories became independent countries. However, {{as of|2020|lc=on||df=UK}}, its cultural impact remains widespread and deep in many of them.\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{main|Prehistoric Britain}}\n\n===Stone Age===\n[[File:Stonehenge Closeup.jpg|thumb|[[Stonehenge]], erected in several stages from c.3000-1500BC]]\n\nThe time from Britain's first inhabitation until the [[last glacial maximum]] is known as the Old Stone Age, or [[Palaeolithic|Palaeolithic era]]. Archaeological evidence indicates that what was to become England was colonised by humans long before the rest of the British Isles because of its more hospitable climate between and during the various [[glacial period]]s of the distant past. This earliest evidence, from Happisburgh in Norfolk, includes the oldest human footprints found outside Africa, and points to dates of more than 800,000 [[Before Present|BP]].<ref name=\"alexburg\" /> These earliest inhabitants were [[hunter-gatherers]]. Low sea-levels meant that Britain was attached to the continent for much of this earliest period of history, and varying temperatures over tens of thousands of years meant that it was not always inhabited.<ref name=\"Francis Pryor 2003\">Francis Pryor, ''Britain BC'', 2003.</ref>\n\nEngland has been continually inhabited since the last Ice Age ended around 9,000 BC, the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, or [[Mesolithic|Mesolithic era]]. Rising sea-levels cut off Britain from the continent for the last time around 6500 BC. The population by then was exclusively [[anatomically modern humans]], and the evidence suggests that their societies were increasingly complex and they were manipulating their environment and prey in new ways, possibly selective burning of then omnipresent woodland to create clearings for herds to gather and then hunt them. Hunting was mainly done with simple projectile weapons such as [[javelin]] and possibly [[sling (weapon)|sling]]. Bow and arrow was known in Western Europe since least 9000 BC. The climate continued to warm and the population probably rose.<ref>V Gaffney, S Fitch and D Smith 2009, ''Europe's Lost World: The Rediscovery of Doggerland''.</ref>\n\nThe New Stone Age, or [[Neolithic|Neolithic era]], began with the introduction of farming, ultimately from the Middle East, around 4000 BC. It is not known whether this was caused by a substantial folk movement or native adoption of foreign practices or both. People began to lead a more settled lifestyle. Monumental collective tombs were built for the dead in the form of chambered cairns and long barrows. Towards the end of the period, other kinds of monumental stone alignments begin to appear, such as Stonehenge; their cosmic alignments show a preoccupation with the sky and planets. Flint technology produced a number of highly artistic pieces as well as purely pragmatic. More extensive woodland clearance was done for fields and pastures. The [[Sweet Track]] in the [[Somerset Levels]] is one of the oldest [[timber trackway]]s known in Northern Europe and among the oldest roads in the world, dated by [[dendrochronology]] to the winter of 3807\u20133806 BC; it too is thought to have been a primarily religious structure.<ref name=\"Francis Pryor 2003\"/>\n\n===Later Prehistory===\n[[File:Maiden Castle, Dorchester..jpg|thumb|View of the ramparts of the developed hillfort of [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], as they look today]]\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] began around 2500 BC with the appearance of bronze objects. This coincides with the appearance of the characteristic [[Beaker culture]]; again this might have occurred primarily by folk movement or by cultural assimilation or both. The Bronze Age saw a shift of emphasis from the communal to the individual, and the rise of increasingly powerful elites whose power came from their prowess as hunters and warriors and their controlling the flow of precious resources to manipulate tin and copper into high-status bronze objects such as swords and axes. Settlement became increasingly permanent and intensive. Towards the end of the Bronze Age, many examples of very fine metalwork began to be deposited in rivers, presumably for ritual reasons and perhaps reflecting a progressive change in emphasis from the sky to the earth, as a rising population put increasing pressure on the land. England largely became bound up with the [[Atlantic Bronze Age|Atlantic trade system]], which created a cultural continuum over a large part of Western Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Francis Pryor, ''Britain BC'', 2003</ref> It is possible that the [[Celtic languages]] developed or spread to England as part of this system; by the end of the Iron Age there is much evidence that they were spoken across all England and western parts of Britain.<ref>Barry Cunliffe, ''The Ancient Celts'', 1997</ref>\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] is conventionally said to begin around 800 BC. The Atlantic system had by this time effectively collapsed, although England maintained contacts across the Channel with France, as the [[Hallstatt culture]] became widespread across the country. Its continuity suggests it was not accompanied by substantial movement of population; crucially, only a single Hallstatt burial is known from Britain, and even here the evidence is inconclusive. On the whole, burials largely disappear across England, and the dead were disposed of in a way which is archaeologically invisible: [[excarnation]] is a widely cited possibility. [[Hillfort]]s were known since the Late Bronze Age, but a huge number were constructed during 600\u2013400 BC, particularly in the South, while after about 400 BC new forts were rarely built and many ceased to be regularly inhabited, while a few forts become more and more intensively occupied, suggesting a degree of regional centralisation. Around this time the earliest mentions of Britain appear in the annals of history. The first historical mention of the region is from the [[Massaliote Periplus]], a sailing manual for merchants thought to date to the 6th century BC, and [[Pytheas of Massilia]] wrote of his  voyage of discovery to the island around 325 BC. Both of these texts are now lost; although quoted by later writers, not enough survives to inform the archaeological interpretation to any significant degree.\n\nContact with the continent was less than in the Bronze Age but still significant. Goods continued to move to England, with a possible hiatus around 350 to 150 BC. There were a few armed invasions of hordes of migrating Celts. There are two known invasions. Around 300 BC, a group from the Gaulish [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] tribe apparently took over East Yorkshire, establishing the highly distinctive [[Arras culture]]. And from around 150\u2013100 BC, groups of Belgae began to control significant parts of the South. These invasions constituted movements of a few people who established themselves as a warrior elite atop existing native systems, rather than replacing them. The Belgic invasion was much larger than the Parisian settlement, but the continuity of pottery style shows that the native population remained in place. Yet, it was accompanied by significant socio-economic change. Proto-urban, or even urban settlements, known as [[oppidum|oppida]], begin to eclipse the old hillforts, and an elite whose position is based on battle prowess and the ability to manipulate resources re-appears much more distinctly.<ref>Barry Cunliffe, ''Iron Age Communities in Britain'', 2005</ref>\n\n[[File:Caesar's first invasion of Britain; Caesar's boat is pulled Wellcome V0048276.jpg|thumb|Caesar's first invasion of Britain]]\nIn 55 and 54 BC, [[Julius Caesar]], as part of [[Gallic Wars|his campaigns in Gaul]], [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invaded Britain]] and claimed to have scored a number of victories, but he never penetrated further than Hertfordshire and could not establish a province. However, his invasions mark a turning-point in British history. Control of trade, the flow of resources and prestige goods, became ever more important to the elites of Southern Britain; Rome steadily became the biggest player in all their dealings, as the provider of great wealth and patronage. A full-scale invasion and annexation was inevitable, in retrospect.<ref>Guy de la Bedoyere, ''Roman Britain: A New History'', 2010</ref>\n\n===Genetic history of the English===\n{{main|Genetic history of the British Isles}}\n\nThe Roman historian [[Tacitus]] wrote in his ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', completed in AD 98,<ref>Mattingly, H. & Handford, S.A. (trans.), ''The Agricola and the Germania'' (Revised edition), Penguin Classics, 1970, p.&nbsp;10.</ref> that the various groupings of [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] shared physical characteristics with continental peoples. The [[Caledonians]], inhabitants of what is now [[Scotland]], had red hair and large limbs, indicating a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin; the [[Silures]], of what is now [[South Wales]], were swarthy with curly hair, indicating a link with the [[Iberians]] of the Roman provinces of [[Hispania]], in what is now Portugal and Spain; and the Britons nearest the [[Gauls]] of mainland Europe resembled the Gauls.<ref>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' chapter 11.</ref> This gross oversimplification is somewhat true until today. Some archaeologists and geneticists have challenged the long-held assumption that the invading Anglo-Saxons wiped out the native Britons in England when they invaded, pointing instead to the possibility of a more limited folk movement bringing a new language and culture which the natives gradually assimilated.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDebate continues about the ultimate origins of the people of the British Isles. In 2003 and 2006 respectively, [[Bryan Sykes]] and [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] both argued for continuity since the Mesolithic, with much input from the East during the Neolithic.<ref>Stephen Oppenheimer, ''The Origins of the British, 2006</ref><ref>Bryan Sykes, ''Blood of the Isles'', 2003</ref> However, the [[haplotypes]] which Sykes and Oppenheimer associated with Spain hailed ultimately from [[Asia Minor]], which might be more consistent with some kind of Neolithic wipeout, although it is impossible to date this gene flow.<ref>Myres et al, ''A major Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b Holocene era founder effect in Central and Western Europe'' in ''European Journal of Human Genetics'', 2010</ref> Other theories have proposed an even greater input in the Early Bronze Age than previously thought. Ultimately, the genetics have not yet revealed anything new. Biological differences between the English and the Welsh were confirmed by tests at [[University College London]], in which the native English population's DNA correlated to others in Germanic parts of Northern Europe traceable through their Y chromosome.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2076470.stm</ref>\n\n==Roman Britain==\n{{main|Roman Britain}}\n[[File:Landing of the Romans on the Coast of Kent.jpg|thumb|Landing of the Romans on the Coast of [[Kent]] (Cassell's ''History of England'', Vol. I - anonymous author and artists, 1909).]]\n[[File:Prima tetrarchia Diocletianus.PNG|thumbnail|[[Roman Empire]], 3rd century.]]\nAfter Caesar's expeditions, the Romans began their real attempt to [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquer Britain]] in 43 AD, at the behest of Emperor [[Claudius]]. They landed in Kent and defeated two armies led by the kings of the [[Catuvellauni]] tribe, [[Caratacus]] and [[Togodumnus]], in battles at the Medway and the Thames. Togodumnus was killed, and Caratacus fled to Wales. The Roman force, led by Aulus Plautius, waited for Claudius to come and lead the final march on the Catuvellauni capital at [[Camulodunum]] (modern [[Colchester]]), before he returned to Rome for his triumph. The Catuvellauni held sway over most of the southeastern corner of England; eleven local rulers surrendered, a number of client kingdoms were established, and the rest became a Roman province with Camulodunum as its capital.<ref>Henry Freeman, ''Roman Britain: A History From Beginning to End'' (2016).</ref> Over the next four years, the territory was consolidated and the future emperor [[Vespasian]] led a campaign into the Southwest where he subjugated two more tribes. By 54 AD the border had been pushed back to the Severn and the Trent, and campaigns were underway to subjugate Northern England and Wales.\n\nBut in 60 AD, under the leadership of the warrior-queen [[Boudicca]], the tribes rebelled against the Romans. At first, the rebels had great success. They burned Camulodunum, [[Londinium]] and [[Verulamium]] (modern-day Colchester, London and St. Albans respectively) to the ground. There is some archaeological evidence that the same happened at Winchester. The Second Legion Augusta, stationed at [[Exeter]], refused to move for fear of revolt among the locals. Londinium governor [[Suetonius Paulinus]] evacuated the city before the rebels sacked and burned it; the fire was so hot that a ten-inch layer of melted red clay remains 15 feet below London's streets.<ref>{{cite book |title=Making Europe: The Story of the West, Volume I to 1790 |date=2013 |page=162}}</ref> In the end, the rebels were said to have killed 70,000 Romans and Roman sympathisers. Paulinus gathered what was left of the Roman army. In the [[Battle of Watling Street|decisive battle]], 10,000 Romans faced nearly 100,000 warriors somewhere along the line of [[Watling Street]], at the end of which Boudicca was utterly defeated. It was said that 80,000 rebels were killed, but only 400 Romans.\n\nOver the next 20 years, the borders expanded slightly, but the governor Agricola incorporated into the province the last pockets of independence in Wales and Northern England. He also led a campaign into Scotland which was recalled by Emperor Domitian. The border gradually formed along the [[Stanegate]] road in Northern England, solidified by [[Hadrian's Wall]] built in 138 AD, despite temporary forays into Scotland. The Romans and their culture stayed in charge for 350 years. [[Roman sites in Great Britain|Traces of their presence]] are ubiquitous throughout England.\n\n==The Anglo-Saxon migration==\n{{main |Sub-Roman Britain}}\n{{see | Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain}}\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|Kingdoms and tribes in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], c.600 AD]]\n\nIn the wake of the breakdown of Roman rule in Britain from the middle of the fourth century, present day England was progressively settled by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups. Collectively known as the \"[[Anglo-Saxons]]\", these were [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]] from what is now the Danish/German border area and [[Jutes]] from the Jutland peninsula. The [[Battle of Deorham]] was a critical in establishing Anglo-Saxon rule in 577.<ref>{{cite web  |author=Hamerow, Helena |url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/wessex.html |title=The Origins of Wessex |publisher=University of Oxford |accessdate=18 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702185330/https://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/wessex.html |archivedate=2 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Saxon mercenaries existed in Britain since before the late Roman period, but the main influx of population probably happened after the fifth century. The precise nature of these invasions is not fully known; there are doubts about the legitimacy of historical accounts due to a lack of archaeological finds. [[Gildas]] Sapiens's ''De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae'', composed in the 6th century, states that when the Roman army departed the Isle of Britannia in the 4th century CE, the indigenous Britons were invaded by [[Picts]], their neighbours to the north (now Scotland) and the [[Scoti|Scots]] (now Ireland). Britons invited the [[Saxons]] to the island to repel them but after they vanquished the Scots and Picts, the Saxons turned against the Britons.\n\nSeven Kingdoms are traditionally identified as being established by these Saxon migrants. Three were clustered in the South east: [[Sussex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]]. The Midlands were dominated by the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]]. The [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Monarchs of Mercia]]'s lineage was determined to reach as far back as the early 500's. To the north was [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] which unified two earlier kingdoms, [[Bernicia]] and [[Deira]]. Eventually, the kingdoms were dominated by [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] and [[Mercia]] in the 7th century, [[Mercia]] in the 8th century and then [[Wessex]] in the 9th century. [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] extended its control north into [[Scotland]] and west into [[Wales]]. It also subdued [[Mercia]] whose first powerful King, [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]], was killed by [[Oswiu of Northumbria|Oswy]] in 655. Northumbria's power began to wane after 685 with the defeat and death of its king [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Aegfrith]] at the hands of the [[Picts]]. Mercian power reached its peak under the rule of [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], who from 785 had influence over most of Anglo-Saxon England. Since Offa's death in 796, the supremacy of [[Wessex]] was established under [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]] who extended control west into [[Cornwall]] before defeating the Mercians at the [[Battle of Ellendun]] in 825. Four years later, he received submission and tribute from the Northumbrian king, [[Eanred of Northumbria|Eanred]].<ref>Stenton, Frank. \"Anglo-Saxon England\". OUP, 1971</ref>\n\nThe history of the fifth and sixth centuries is particularly difficult to access, peppered with a mixture of mythology, such as the characters of [[Hengist and Horsa]], and legend, such as St [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]]'s so-called \"Alleluia Victory\" against the Heathens, and half-remembered history, such as the exploits of [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] and [[King Arthur]]. However, the belief that the Saxons wiped or drove out all the native Britons from England has been widely discredited by a number of archaeologists since the 2000s. Anyway Anglo-Saxons and Saxonified Britons spread into England, by a combination of military conquest and cultural assimilation. By the eighth century, a kind of England had emerged, albeit as several separate kingdoms and not united under a single rule.<ref>Francis Pryor, ''Britain AD'', 2004</ref><ref>Geoffrey Hindley, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', 2006</ref>\n\n==Heptarchy and Christianisation==\n{{main|Northumbria|Mercia|Offa of Mercia|Heptarchy|Gregorian mission|Anglo-Saxon Christianity}}\n[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 022 - Gregory and the English Slaves at Rome.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Gregory I]] seeing Anglo-Saxon children in a slave market in [[Rome]]. He sent [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] as a missionary to England in 596.]]\n\nChristianisation of Anglo-Saxon England began around AD 600, influenced by [[Celtic Christianity]] from the northwest and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] from the southeast. [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], took office in 597. In 601, he baptised the first Christian Anglo-Saxon king, [[Aethelbert of Kent]]. The last pagan Anglo-Saxon king, [[Penda of Mercia]], died in 655. The last pagan [[Jutes|Jutish]] king, [[Arwald]] of the [[Isle of Wight]] was killed in 686. The [[Anglo-Saxon mission]] on the continent took off in the 8th century, leading to the Christianisation of practically all of the [[Frankish Empire]] by 800.\n\nThroughout the 7th and 8th century power fluctuated between the larger kingdoms. [[Bede]] records [[\u00c6thelbert of Kent]] as being dominant at the close of the 6th century, but power seems to have shifted northwards to the kingdom of Northumbria, which was formed from the amalgamation of Bernicia and Deira. [[Edwin of Northumbria]] probably held dominance over much of Britain, though Bede's Northumbrian bias should be kept in mind. Due to succession crises, Northumbrian hegemony was not constant, and [[Mercia]] remained a very powerful kingdom, especially under Penda. Two defeats ended Northumbrian dominance: the Battle of the Trent in 679 against Mercia, and Nechtanesmere in 685 against the [[Picts]].<ref>Frank Merry Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (1971).</ref>\n\nThe so-called \"Mercian Supremacy\" dominated the 8th century, though it was not constant. Aethelbald and [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], the two most powerful kings, achieved high status; indeed, Offa was considered the overlord of south Britain by [[Charlemagne]]. His power is illustrated by the fact that he summoned the resources to build [[Offa's Dyke]]. However, a rising Wessex, and challenges from smaller kingdoms, kept Mercian power in check, and by the early 9th century the \"Mercian Supremacy\" was over.\n\nThis period has been described as the [[Heptarchy]], though this term has now fallen out of academic use. The term arose because the seven kingdoms of [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]] were the main polities of south Britain. Other small kingdoms were also politically important across this period: [[Hwicce]], [[Magonsaete]], [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]] and Middle Anglia.<ref>Peter Hayes Sawyer, ''From Roman Britain to Norman England'' (Routledge, 2002).</ref>\n\n==Viking challenge and the rise of Wessex==\n{{main|Danelaw|Viking Age|Alfred the Great}}\n\n[[File:England 878.svg|thumb|England in 878]]\n\nThe first recorded landing of [[Viking]]s took place in 787 in [[Dorset]]shire, on the south-west coast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Rosemary|title=The Vikings|url=https://archive.org/details/vikings0000rees|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=9781403401007|page=[https://archive.org/details/vikings0000rees/page/45 45]}}</ref> The first major attack in Britain was in 793 at [[Lindisfarne]] monastery as given by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. However, by then the Vikings were almost certainly well-established in [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], and many other non-recorded raids probably occurred before this. Records do show the first Viking attack on [[Iona]] taking place in 794. The arrival of the Vikings (in particular the Danish [[Great Heathen Army]]) upset the political and social geography of Britain and Ireland. In 867 [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] fell to the Danes; [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] fell in 869. Though [[Wessex]] managed to contain the Vikings by defeating them at [[Battle of Ashdown|Ashdown]] in 871, a second invading army landed, leaving the Saxons on a defensive footing. At much the same time, [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], king of Wessex died and was succeeded by his younger brother [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]]. Alfred was immediately confronted with the task of defending Wessex against the Danes. He spent the first five years of his reign paying the invaders off. In 878, Alfred's forces were overwhelmed at Chippenham in a surprise attack.<ref>Albany F. Major, ''Early wars of Wessex'' (Hildreth Press, 2008).</ref>\n\nIt was only now, with the independence of Wessex hanging by a thread, that Alfred emerged as a great king. In May 878 he led a force that defeated the Danes at [[Battle of Edington|Edington]]. The victory was so complete that the Danish leader, [[Guthrum]], was forced to accept Christian baptism and withdraw from [[Mercia]]. Alfred then set about strengthening the defences of Wessex, building a new navy\u201460 vessels strong. Alfred's success bought Wessex and Mercia years of peace and sparked economic recovery in previously ravaged areas.<ref>Richard P. Ables, ''Alfred the great: war, kingship and culture I'm Anglo-Saxon England'' (1998).</ref>\n\nAlfred's success was sustained by his son [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], whose decisive victories over the Danes in East Anglia in 910 and 911 were followed by a crushing victory at Tempsford in 917. These military gains allowed Edward to fully incorporate Mercia into his kingdom and add East Anglia to his conquests. Edward then set about reinforcing his northern borders against the Danish [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Edward's rapid conquest of the English kingdoms meant Wessex received homage from those that remained, including [[Gwynedd]] in Wales and Scotland. His dominance was reinforced by his son [[\u00c6thelstan]], who extended the borders of Wessex northward, in 927 conquering the [[Kingdom of York]] and leading a land and naval invasion of [[Scotland]]. These conquests led to his adopting the title 'King of the English' for the first time.\n\nThe dominance and independence of England was maintained by the kings that followed. It was not until 978 and the accession of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] that the Danish threat resurfaced. Two powerful Danish kings ([[Harold Bluetooth]] and later his son [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn]]) both launched devastating invasions of England. Anglo-Saxon forces were resoundingly defeated at [[Battle of Maldon|Maldon]] in 991. More Danish attacks followed, and their victories were frequent. \u00c6thelred's control over his nobles began to falter, and he grew increasingly desperate. His solution was to pay off the Danes: for almost 20 years he paid increasingly large sums to the Danish nobles to keep them from English coasts. These payments, known as [[Danegeld]]s, crippled the English economy.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 569175|title = The Collection of Danegeld and Heregeld in the Reigns of Aethelred II and Cnut|journal = The English Historical Review|volume = 99|issue = 393|pages = 721\u2013738|last1 = Lawson|first1 = M.

Then he made a great error: in 1002 he ordered the massacre of all the Danes in England. In response, Sweyn began a decade of devastating attacks on England. Northern England, with its sizable Danish population, sided with Sweyn. By 1013, London, Oxford, and Winchester had fallen to the Danes. \u00c6thelred fled to [[Normandy]] and Sweyn seized the throne. Sweyn suddenly died in 1014, and \u00c6thelred returned to England, confronted by Sweyn's successor, [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]]. However, in 1016, \u00c6thelred also suddenly died. Cnut swiftly defeated the remaining Saxons, killing \u00c6thelred's son [[Edmund Ironside|Edmund]] in the process. Cnut seized the throne, crowning himself King of England.<ref>Thames Cussans, ''Kings and Queens of the British Isles'' (The Times Books, 2002), pp.32-35.</ref>\n\n==English unification==\n{{main|\u00c6thelstan|Edgar of England}}\n[[File:Edward the Elder coin imitation silver brooch Rome Italy c 920.jpg|thumb|Silver brooch imitating a coin of Edward the Elder, c. 920, found in Rome, Italy. [[British Museum]].]]\n[[Alfred of Wessex]] died in 899 and was succeeded by his son [[Edward the Elder]]. Edward, and his brother-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians|\u00c6thelred]] of (what was left of) Mercia, began a programme of expansion, building forts and towns on an Alfredian model. On \u00c6thelred's death, his wife (Edward's sister) [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] ruled as \"Lady of the Mercians\" and continued expansion. It seems Edward had his son [[\u00c6thelstan]] brought up in the Mercian court, and on Edward's death. \u00c6thelstan succeeded to the Mercian kingdom, and, after some uncertainty, Wessex.\n\n\u00c6thelstan continued the expansion of his father and aunt and was the first king to achieve direct rulership of what we would now consider England. The titles attributed to him in [[Anglo-Saxon Charters|charters]] and on coins suggest a still more widespread dominance. His expansion aroused ill-feeling among the other kingdoms of Britain, and he defeated a combined Scottish-Viking army at the [[Battle of Brunanburh]]. However, the unification of England was not a certainty. Under \u00c6thelstan's successors [[Edmund II of England|Edmund]] and [[Edred of England|Eadred]] the English kings repeatedly lost and regained control of Northumbria. Nevertheless, [[Edgar of England|Edgar]], who ruled the same expanse as Athelstan, consolidated the kingdom, which remained united thereafter.\n\n==England under the Danes and the Norman conquest==\n{{main|Ethelred the Unready|Canute the Great|Eir\u00edkr H\u00e1konarson|Norman conquest of England}}\n[[File:U 344, Orkesta.JPG|right|thumb|The [[England Runestones#U 344|rune stone U 344]] was raised in memory of a Viking who went to England three times.]]\nThere were renewed Scandinavian attacks on England at the end of the 10th century. [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred]] ruled a long reign but ultimately lost his kingdom to [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn of Denmark]], though he recovered it following the latter's death. However, \u00c6thelred's son [[Edmund II Ironside]] died shortly afterwards, allowing [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]], Sweyn's son, to become king of England. Under his rule the kingdom became the centre of government for the [[North Sea Empire|North Sea empire]] which included Denmark and Norway.\n\nCnut was succeeded by his sons, but in 1042 the native dynasty was restored with the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]]. Edward's failure to produce an heir caused a furious conflict over the succession on his death in 1066. His struggles for power against [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], the claims of Cnut's Scandinavian successors, and the ambitions of the [[Normans]] whom Edward introduced to English politics to bolster his own position caused each to vie for control of Edward's reign.\n\n[[Harold Godwinson]] became king, probably appointed by Edward on his deathbed and endorsed by the [[Witan]]. But [[William of Normandy]], [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardr\u00e5de]] (aided by Harold Godwin's estranged brother [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]]) and [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] all asserted claims to the throne. By far the strongest hereditary claim was that of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], but due to his youth and apparent lack of powerful supporters, he did not play a major part in the struggles of 1066, although he was made king for a short time by the Witan after the death of Harold Godwinson.\n\nIn September 1066, [[Harald III of Norway]] and [[Tostig Godwinson|Earl Tostig]] [[Harald III of Norway#Invasion of England|landed in Northern England]] with a force of around 15,000 men and 300 [[longship]]s. [[Harold Godwinson]] defeated the invaders and killed Harald III of Norway and Tostig at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]].\n\nOn 28 September 1066, [[William of Normandy]] [[Norman Conquest#Norman invasion|invaded England]] in a campaign called the [[Norman Conquest]]. After marching from [[Yorkshire]], Harold's exhausted army was defeated and Harold was killed at the [[Battle of Hastings]] on 14 October. Further opposition to William in support of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]] soon collapsed, and William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066. For five years, he faced a series of rebellions in various parts of England and a half-hearted Danish invasion, but he subdued them and established an enduring regime.\n\n==Norman England==\n\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Hastings]] (1066) on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\nThe [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] led to a profound change in the history of the English state. William ordered the compilation of the [[Domesday Book]], a survey of the entire population and their lands and property for tax purposes, which reveals that within 20 years of the conquest the English ruling class had been almost entirely dispossessed and replaced by Norman landholders, who monopolised all senior positions in the government and the Church. William and his nobles spoke and conducted court in [[Norman language|Norman French]], in both Normandy and England. The use of the Anglo-Norman language by the aristocracy endured for centuries and left an indelible mark in the development of modern English.\n\nUpon being crowned, on Christmas Day 1066, William immediately began consolidating his power. By 1067, he faced revolts on all sides and spent four years crushing them. He then imposed his superiority over Scotland and Wales, forcing them to recognise him as overlord.\n\nThe English [[Middle Ages]] were characterised by [[civil war]], international war, occasional insurrection, and widespread political intrigue among the aristocratic and monarchic elite. England was more than self-sufficient in cereals, dairy products, beef and mutton. Its international economy was based on [[Wool#History|wool trade]], in which wool from the [[sheepwalk]]s of northern England was exported to the textile cities of [[Flanders]], where it was worked into cloth. Medieval foreign policy was as much shaped by relations with the Flemish textile industry as it was by dynastic adventures in western France. An English textile industry was established in the 15th century, providing the basis for rapid English capital accumulation.\n\n[[Henry I of England|Henry I]], the fourth son of [[William I the Conqueror]], succeeded his elder brother [[William II of England|William II]] as [[King of England]] in 1100. Henry was also known as \"Henry Beauclerc\" because he received a formal education, unlike his older brother and [[heir apparent]] [[William II of England|William]] who got practical training to be king. Henry worked hard to reform and stabilise the country and smooth the differences between the Anglo-Saxon and [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] societies. The loss of his son, [[William Adelin]], in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]'' in November 1120, undermined his reforms. This problem regarding succession cast a long shadow over English history.\n\nHenry I had required the leading barons, ecclesiastics and officials in Normandy and England, to take an oath to accept [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] (also known as Empress Maud, Henry I's daughter) as his heir. England was far less than enthusiastic to accept an outsider, and a woman, as their ruler.\n\nThere is some evidence that Henry was unsure of his own hopes and the oath to make Matilda his heir. Probably Henry hoped Matilda would have a son and step aside as Queen Mother. Upon Henry's death, the Norman and English barons ignored Matilda's claim to the throne, and thus through a series of decisions, [[Stephen I of England|Stephen]], Henry's favourite nephew, was welcomed by many in England and Normandy as their new king.\n\nOn 22 December 1135, Stephen was anointed king with implicit support by the church and nation. Matilda and her own son waited in France until she sparked the civil war from 1139\u20131153 known as [[the Anarchy]]. In the autumn of 1139, she invaded England with her illegitimate half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]]. Her husband, [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffroy V of Anjou]], conquered Normandy but did not cross the channel to help his wife. During this breakdown of central authority, nobles built [[adulterine castle]]s (i.e. castles erected without government permission), which were hated by the peasants, who were forced to build and maintain them.\n\nStephen was captured, and his government fell. Matilda was proclaimed queen but was soon at odds with her subjects and was expelled from London. The war continued until 1148, when Matilda returned to France. Stephen reigned unopposed until his death in 1154, although his hold on the throne was uneasy. As soon as he regained power, he began to demolish the adulterine castles, but kept a few castles standing, which put him at odds with his heir. His contested reign, [[the Anarchy|civil war]] and lawlessness broke out saw a major swing in power towards [[feudal]] [[baron]]s. In trying to appease Scottish and Welsh raiders, he handed over large tracts of land.\n\n==England under the Plantagenets==\n{{Further|House of Plantagenet}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n\nEmpress Matilda and [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffroy's]] son, Henry, resumed the invasion; he was already Count of Anjou, Duke of Normandy and Duke of Aquitaine when he landed in England. When Stephen's son and heir apparent [[Eustace IV|Eustace]] died in 1153, Stephen made an agreement with Henry of [[Anjou]] (who became [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]) to succeed Stephen and guarantee peace between them. The union was retrospectively named the [[Angevin Empire]]. Henry II destroyed the remaining adulterine castles and expanded his power through various means and to different levels into Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Flanders, Nantes, Brittany, Quercy, Toulouse, Bourges and Auvergne.\n\nThe reign of Henry II represents a reversion in power from the barony to the monarchical state in England; it was also to see a similar redistribution of legislative power from the Church, again to the monarchical state. This period also presaged a properly constituted legislation and a radical shift away from [[feudalism]]. In his reign, new [[Anglo-Angevin]] and [[Anglo-Aquitanian]] aristocracies developed, though not to the same degree as the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] once did, and the Norman nobles interacted with their French peers.\n\nHenry's successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] \"the Lion Heart\" (also known as \"The absent king\"), was preoccupied with foreign wars, taking part in the [[Third Crusade]], being captured while returning and pledging fealty to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as part of his ransom, and defending his French territories against Philip II of France. His successor, his younger brother [[John of England|John]], lost much of those territories including Normandy following the disastrous [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, despite having in 1212 made the [[Kingdom of England]] a tribute-paying vassal of the [[Holy See]], which it remained until the 14th century when the Kingdom rejected the overlordship of the [[Holy See]] and re-established its sovereignty.\n\nFrom 1212 onwards, John had a constant policy of maintaining close relations with the Pope, which partially explains how he persuaded the Pope to reject the legitimacy of ''[[Magna Carta]]''.\n\n===Magna Carta===\n{{main|Magna Carta}}\n[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|One of only four surviving [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the 1215 text, ''Cotton MS. Augustus II. 106'', property of the [[British Library]]]]\nOver the course of his reign, a combination of higher taxes, unsuccessful wars and conflict with the Pope made King John unpopular with his barons. In 1215, some of the most important barons rebelled against him. He met their leaders along with their French and Scot allies at [[Runnymede]], near London on 15 June 1215 to seal the [[Magna Carta|Great Charter]] (''Magna Carta'' in [[Latin (language)|Latin]]), which imposed legal limits on the king's personal powers. But as soon as hostilities ceased, John received approval from the Pope to break his word because he had made it under duress. This provoked the [[First Barons' War]] and a French invasion by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]] of France invited by a majority of the English barons to replace John as king in London in May 1216. John travelled around the country to oppose the rebel forces, directing, among other operations, a two-month siege of the rebel-held [[Rochester Castle]].\n\n===Henry III===\n{{main|Henry III of England}}\nJohn's son, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], was only 9 years old when he became king (1216\u20131272). He spent much of his reign fighting the barons over ''Magna Carta''<ref>https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/magna-carta-muse-and-mentor/confirmation-by-kings-and-parliament.html</ref> and the royal rights, and was eventually forced to call the first \"[[Parliament of England|parliament]]\" in 1264. He was also unsuccessful on the Continent, where he endeavoured to re-establish English control over [[Normandy]], [[Anjou]], and [[Aquitaine]].\n\nHis reign was punctuated by many rebellions and civil wars, often provoked by incompetence and mismanagement in government and Henry's perceived over-reliance on French courtiers (thus restricting the influence of the English nobility). One of these rebellions\u2014led by a disaffected courtier, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]\u2014was notable for its assembly of one of the earliest precursors to [[British Parliament|Parliament]]. In addition to fighting the [[Second Barons' War]], Henry III made war against Saint Louis and was defeated during the [[Saintonge War]], yet Louis IX did not capitalise on his victory, respecting his opponent's rights.\n\nHenry III's policies towards Jews began with relative tolerance, but became gradually more restrictive. In 1253 the [[Statute of Jewry]], reinforced physical segregation and demanded a previously notional requirement to wear square white badges.<ref>{{harvnb|Hillaby|2013|p=104}}</ref> Henry III also backed an accusation of child murder in Lincoln, ordering a Jew Copin to be executed and 91 Jews to be arrested for trial; 18 were killed. Popular superstitious fears were fuelled, and Catholic theological hostility combined with Baronial abuse of loan arrangements, resulting in [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]'s supporters targeting of Jewish communities in their [[Second Barons' War|revolt]]. This hostility, violence and controversy was the background to the increasingly oppressive measures that followed under Edward I.<ref name=\"Hillaby 2013 104\u2013107\">{{harvnb|Hillaby|2013|pp=104\u2013107}}</ref><ref name=\"Jacobs 1903\">{{harvnb|Jacobs|1903}}</ref>\n\n==14th century==\nThe reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (reigned 1272\u20131307) was rather more successful. Edward enacted numerous laws strengthening the powers of his government, and he summoned the first officially sanctioned [[Parliaments of England]] (such as his [[Model Parliament]]). He [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquered Wales]] and attempted to use a succession dispute to gain control of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], though this developed into a costly and drawn-out military campaign.\n\nEdward I is also known for his policies first persecuting Jews, particularly the 1275 [[Statute of the Jewry]]. This banned Jews from their previous role in making loans, and demanded that they work as merchants, farmers, craftsmen or soldiers. This was unrealistic, and failed.<ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2006|pp=112\u2013139}}</ref> Edward's solution was to [[History of the Jews in England (1066\u20131290)#Edward I and the Expulsion|expel Jews from England]].<ref name=\"Hillaby 2013 104\u2013107\"/><ref name=\"Jacobs 1903\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2006|pp=140\u2013160}}</ref>\n\nHis son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], proved a disaster. A weak man who preferred to engage in activities like thatching and ditch-digging{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} rather than jousting, hunting, or the usual entertainments of kings, he spent most of his reign trying in vain to control the nobility, who in return showed continual hostility to him. Meanwhile, the Scottish leader [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]] began retaking all the territory conquered by Edward I. In 1314, the English army was disastrously defeated by the Scots at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]]. Edward also showered favours on his companion [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], a knight of humble birth. While it has been widely believed that Edward was a homosexual because of his closeness to Gaveston, there is no concrete evidence of this. The king's enemies, including his cousin [[Thomas of Lancaster]], captured and murdered Gaveston in 1312.\n\nEdward's downfall came in 1326 when his wife, [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]], travelled to her native France and, with her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], [[Edward II of England#Invasion by Isabella and Mortimer|invaded England]]. Despite their tiny force, they quickly rallied support for their cause. The king fled London, and his companion since Piers Gaveston's death, [[Hugh Despenser the younger|Hugh Despenser]], was publicly tried and executed. Edward was captured, charged with breaking his coronation oath, [[Edward II of England#Abdication|deposed]] and imprisoned in Gloucestershire until he was murdered some time in the autumn of 1327, presumably by agents of Isabella and Mortimer.\n\nMillions of people in northern Europe died in the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317]].<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R688at3KskQC&pg=PA49&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Story of Ireland]''\".

[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] reigned 1327\u20131377, restored royal authority and went on to transform England into the most efficient military power in Europe. His reign saw vital developments in legislature and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament\u2014as well as the ravages of the [[Black Death]]. After defeating, but not subjugating, the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1338, but his claim was denied due to the [[Salic law]]. This started what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]].<ref>Edward first styled himself \"King of France\" in 1337, though he did not officially assume the title until 1340; Prestwich (2005), pp. 307\u20138.</ref> Following some initial setbacks, the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] led to the highly favourable [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]]. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.\n\nFor many years, trouble had been brewing with [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]\u2014a Spanish kingdom whose navy had taken to raiding English merchant ships in the [[English Channel|Channel]]. Edward won a [[Battle of Winchelsea|major naval victory]] against a Castilian fleet off [[Winchelsea]] in 1350. Although the Castilian crossbowmen killed many of the enemy,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=R. G. |title=1001 Battles That Changed the Course of History |date=2017 |page=195}}</ref> the English gradually got the better of the encounter.

It was suppressed by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], with the death of 1500 rebels.\n\n===Black Death===\n\n{{main|Black Death in England}}\n[[The Black Death]], an epidemic of [[bubonic plague]] that spread all over Europe, arrived in England in 1348 and killed as much as a third to half the population. Military conflicts during this period were usually with domestic neighbours such as the Welsh, Irish and Scots, and included the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the French and their [[Scottish people|Scottish]] allies. Notable English victories in the [[Hundred Years' War]] included [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]]. The final defeat of the uprising led by the Welsh prince, [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], in 1412 by Prince Henry (who later became [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]) represents the last major armed attempt by the Welsh to throw off English rule.\n\n[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] gave land to powerful noble families, including many people of royal lineage. Because land was equivalent to power, these powerful men could try to claim the crown. The autocratic and arrogant methods of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] only served to alienate the nobility more, and his forceful dispossession in 1399 by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] increased the turmoil.\n\nHenry spent much of his reign defending himself against plots, rebellions and assassination attempts.\n{{House of Lancaster|henry4}}\nRebellions continued throughout the first ten years of Henry's reign, including the revolt of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], who declared himself [[Prince of Wales]] in 1400, and the rebellion of [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]]. The king's success in putting down these rebellions was due partly to the military ability of his eldest son, [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]],<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=English History |volume=9 |page=511 |first=Charles |last=Oman |authorlink=Charles Oman}}</ref> who later became king (though the son managed to seize much effective power from his father in 1410).\n\n==15th century \u2013 Henry V and the Wars of the Roses==\n{{further|Lancastrian War|Wars of the Roses|Great Slump (15th century)}}\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] succeeded to the throne in 1413. He renewed hostilities with France and began a set of military campaigns which are considered a new phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]], referred to as the [[Lancastrian War]]. He won several notable victories over the French, including at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. In the [[Treaty of Troyes]], Henry V was given the power to succeed the current ruler of France, [[Charles VI of France]]. The Treaty also provided that he would marry Charles VI's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]]. They married in 1421. Henry died of dysentery in 1422, leaving a number of unfulfilled plans, including his plan to take over as King of France and to lead a crusade to retake Jerusalem from the Muslims.\n\nHenry V's son, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], became king in 1422 as an infant. His reign was marked by constant turmoil due to his political weaknesses. While he was growing up, England was ruled by the [[Regency government, 1422\u20131437|Regency government]].\n\nThe Regency Council tried to install Henry VI as the King of France, as provided by the Treaty of Troyes signed by his father, and led English forces to take over areas of France. It appeared they might succeed due to the poor political position of the son of Charles VI, who had claimed to be the rightful king as [[Charles VII of France]]. However, in 1429, [[Joan of Arc]] began a military effort to prevent the English from gaining control of France. The French forces regained control of French territory.\n\nIn 1437, Henry VI came of age and began to actively rule as king. To forge peace, he married French noblewoman [[Margaret of Anjou]] in 1445, as provided in the [[Treaty of Tours]]. Hostilities with France resumed in 1449. When England lost the [[Hundred Years' War]] in August 1453, Henry fell into mental breakdown until Christmas 1454.\n\nHe could not control the feuding nobles, and civil war began called [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131485). Although fighting was very sporadic and small, there was a general breakdown in the power of the Crown. The royal court and Parliament moved to Coventry, in the Lancastrian heartlands, which thus became the capital of England until 1461. Henry's cousin deposed Henry in 1461 to become [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. He defeated the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]] at the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]]. He was briefly expelled from the throne in 1470\u20131471 when [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], brought Henry back to power. Six months later, Edward defeated and killed Warwick in battle and reclaimed the throne. Henry was imprisoned in the Tower of London and died there. Edward went a little way to restoring the power of the Crown.\n\nEdward died in 1483, only 40 years old. His eldest son and heir [[Edward V]], aged 13, could not succeed him because the king's brother [[Richard III of England|Richard III, Duke of Gloucester]] declared his marriage bigamous, making all his children illegitimate. Richard III declared himself king. Edward V and his 10-year-old brother Richard were imprisoned in the Tower of London and were not seen again. It was widely believed that Richard III had them murdered and he was reviled as a treacherous fiend, which limited his ability to govern during his brief reign. In summer 1485, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], the last Lancastrian male, landed in England from exile in France. He defeated and killed Richard III at [[Bosworth Field]] on 22 August and became king Henry VII.\n\n{{See also|Black Death in England|English historians in the Middle Ages|List of English chronicles|Bayeux Tapestry}}\n\n==Tudor England==\n{{main|Tudor period}}\n{{further|Early Modern Britain|English Renaissance}}\n\n===Henry VII===\nWith [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s accession to the throne in 1485, the Wars of the Roses came to an end, and Tudors would continue to rule England for 118 years. Traditionally, the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] is considered to mark the end of the Middle Ages in England, although Henry did not introduce any new concept of monarchy, and for most of his reign his hold on power was tenuous. He claimed the throne by conquest and God's judgement in battle. Parliament quickly recognized him as king, but the Yorkists were far from defeated. Nonetheless, he married Edward IV's eldest daughter Elizabeth in January 1486, thereby uniting the houses of York and Lancaster.\n\nMost of the European rulers did not believe Henry would survive long, and were thus willing to shelter claimants against him. The first plot against him was the [[Stafford and Lovell Rebellion]] of 1486, which presented no serious threat. But Richard III's nephew [[John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln]], hatched another attempt the following year. Using a peasant boy named [[Lambert Simnel]], who posed as [[Edward, Earl of Warwick]] (the real Warwick was locked up in the Tower of London), he led an army of 2,000 German mercenaries paid for by [[Margaret of York|Margaret of Burgundy]] into England. They were defeated and de la Pole was killed at the difficult [[Battle of Stoke]], where the loyalty of some of the royal troops to Henry was questionable. The king, realizing that Simnel was a dupe, employed him in the royal kitchen.\n\nA more serious threat was [[Perkin Warbeck]], a Flemish youth who posed as Edward IV's son Richard. Again with support from Margaret of Burgundy, he invaded England four times from 1495\u20131497 before he was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Both Warbeck and the Earl of Warwick were dangerous even in captivity, and Henry executed them in 1499 before Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain would allow their daughter Catherine to come to England and marry his son Arthur.\n\nIn 1497, Henry defeated Cornish rebels marching on London. The rest of his reign was relatively peaceful, despite worries about succession after the death of his wife [[Elizabeth of York]] in 1503.\n\nHenry VII's foreign policy was peaceful. He had made an alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], but in 1493, when they went to war with France, England was dragged into the conflict. Impoverished and his hold on power insecure, Henry had no desire for war. He quickly reached an understanding with the French and renounced all claims to their territory except the port of Calais, realizing also that he could not stop them from incorporating the Duchy of Brittany. In return, the French agreed to recognize him as king and stop sheltering pretenders. Shortly afterwards, they became preoccupied with adventures in Italy. Henry also reached an understanding with Scotland, agreeing to marry his daughter Margaret to that country's king [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]].\n\nUpon becoming king, Henry inherited a government severely weakened and degraded by the Wars of the Roses. The treasury was empty, having been drained by Edward IV's Woodville in-laws after his death. Through a tight fiscal policy and sometimes ruthless tax collection and confiscations, Henry refilled the treasury by the time of his death. He also effectively rebuilt the machinery of government.\n\nIn 1501, the king's son [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], having married [[Catherine of Aragon]], died of illness at age 15, leaving his younger brother [[Henry, Duke of York]] as heir. When the king himself died in 1509, the position of the Tudors was secure at last, and his son succeeded him unopposed.\n\n===Henry VIII===\n\n[[File:After Hans Holbein the Younger - Portrait of Henry VIII - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]]]\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] began his reign with much optimism. The handsome, athletic young king stood in sharp contrast to his wary, miserly father. Henry's lavish court quickly drained the treasury of the fortune he inherited. He married the widowed [[Catherine of Aragon]], and they had several children, but none survived infancy except a daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]].\n\nIn 1512, the young king started a [[War of the League of Cambrai|war in France]]. Although England was an ally of Spain, one of France's principal enemies, the war was mostly about Henry's desire for personal glory, despite his sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]] being married to the French king [[Louis XII]]. The war accomplished little. The English army suffered badly from disease, and Henry was not even present at the one notable victory, the [[Battle of the Spurs]]. Meanwhile, [[James IV of Scotland]] (despite being Henry's other brother-in-law), activated his alliance with the French and declared war on England. While Henry was dallying in France, Catherine, who was serving as regent in his absence, and his advisers were left to deal with this threat. At the [[Battle of Flodden]] on 9 September 1513, the Scots were completely defeated. James and most of the Scottish nobles were killed. When Henry returned from France, he was given credit for the victory.\n\nEventually, Catherine was no longer able to have any more children. The king became increasingly nervous about the possibility of his daughter Mary inheriting the throne, as England's one experience with a female sovereign, Matilda in the 12th century, had been a catastrophe. He eventually decided that it was necessary to divorce Catherine and find a new queen. To persuade the Church to allow this, Henry cited the passage in the [[Book of Leviticus]]: \"If a man taketh his brother's wife, he hath committed adultery; they shall be childless\". However, Catherine insisted that she and Arthur never consummated their brief marriage and that the prohibition did not apply here. The timing of Henry's case was very unfortunate; it was 1527 and the Pope had been imprisoned by emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Catherine's nephew and the most powerful man in Europe, for siding with his archenemy [[Francis I of France]]. Because he could not divorce in these circumstances, Henry seceded from the Church, in what became known as the [[English Reformation]].\n\nThe newly established [[Church of England]] amounted to little more than the existing Catholic Church, but led by the king rather than the Pope. It took a number of years for the separation from Rome to be completed, and many were executed for resisting the king's religious policies.\n\nIn 1530, Catherine was banished from court and spent the rest of her life (until her death in 1536) alone in an isolated manor home, barred from contact with Mary. Secret correspondence continued thanks to her ladies-in-waiting. Their marriage was declared invalid, making Mary an illegitimate child. Henry married [[Anne Boleyn]] secretly in January 1533, just as his divorce from Catherine was finalised. They had a second, public wedding. Anne soon became pregnant and may have already been when they wed. But on 7 September 1533, she gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth. The king was devastated at his failure to obtain a son after all the effort it had taken to remarry. Gradually, he came to develop a disliking of his new queen for her strange behaviour. In 1536, when Anne was pregnant again, Henry was badly injured in a jousting accident. Shaken by this, the queen gave birth prematurely to a stillborn boy. By now, the king was convinced that his marriage was hexed, and having already found a new queen, Jane Seymour, he put Anne in the Tower of London on charges of witchcraft. Afterwards, she was beheaded along with five men (her brother included) accused of adultery with her. The marriage was then declared invalid, so that Elizabeth, just like her half sister, became a bastard.\n\nHenry immediately married [[Jane Seymour]], who became pregnant almost as quickly. On 12 October 1537, she gave birth to a healthy boy, Edward, which was greeted with huge celebrations. However, the queen died of [[puerperal sepsis]] ten days later. Henry genuinely mourned her death, and at his own passing nine years later, he was buried next to her.\n\nThe king married a fourth time in 1540, to the German [[Anne of Cleves]] for a political alliance with her Protestant brother, the [[Duke of Cleves]]. He also hoped to obtain another son in case something should happen to Edward. Anne proved a dull, unattractive woman and Henry did not consummate the marriage. He quickly divorced her, and she remained in England as a kind of adopted sister to him. He married again, to a 19-year-old named [[Catherine Howard]]. But when it became known that she was neither a virgin at the wedding, nor a faithful wife afterwards, she ended up on the scaffold and the marriage declared invalid. His sixth and last marriage was to [[Catherine Parr]], who was more his nursemaid than anything else, as his health was failing since his jousting accident in 1536.\n\nIn 1542, the king started a new campaign in France, but unlike in 1512, he only managed with great difficulty. He only conquered the city of Boulogne, which France retook in 1549. Scotland also declared war and at [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]] was again totally defeated.\n\nHenry's paranoia and suspicion worsened in his last years. The number of executions during his 38-year reign numbered tens of thousands. His domestic policies had strengthened royal authority to the detriment of the aristocracy, and led to a safer realm, but his foreign policy adventures did not increase England's prestige abroad and wrecked royal finances and the national economy, and embittered the Irish.<ref name=twsBucholz1> Robert Bucholz, Newton Key, via Google Books, John Wiley & Sons Publishers, 31 December 2019 - History - 472 pages, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6275-3}}, [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Early_Modern_England_1485_1714/KfjYvfVOYwoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=wreck+royal+finances&pg=PA101&printsec=frontcover Early Modern England 1485-1714: A Narrative History], retrieved 27 March 2020, see pages 102, 104, 107, 122-3</ref> He died in January 1547 at age 55 and was succeeded by his son, Edward VI.\n\n===Edward VI and Mary I===\n[[File:Circle of William Scrots Edward VI of England.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Edward VI]], c. 1550]]\n\nAlthough he showed piety and intelligence, [[Edward VI]] was only nine years old when he became king in 1547.<ref name=twsBucholz1/> His uncle, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] tampered with [[Will of Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's will]] and obtained [[letters patent]] giving him much of the power of a monarch by March 1547. He took the title of Protector. While some see him as a high-minded idealist, his stay in power culminated in a crisis in 1549 when many counties of the realm were up in protest. [[Kett's Rebellion]] in Norfolk and the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] simultaneously created a crisis while invasion from Scotland and France were feared. Somerset, disliked by the Regency Council for being autocratic, was removed from power by [[John Dudley, Earl of Warwick|John Dudley]], who is known as [[Lord President Northumberland]]. Northumberland proceeded to adopt the power for himself, but he was more conciliatory and the Council accepted him. During Edward's reign England changed from being a Catholic nation to a Protestant one, in schism from Rome.\n\nEdward showed great promise but fell violently ill of [[tuberculosis]] in 1553 and died that August, two months before his 16th birthday.<ref name=twsBucholz1/>\n\nNorthumberland made plans to place [[Lady Jane Grey]] on the throne and marry her to his son, so that he could remain the power behind the throne. His plot failed in a matter of days, Jane Grey was beheaded, and [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (1516\u20131558) took the throne amidst popular demonstration in her favour in London, which contemporaries described as the largest show of affection for a Tudor monarch. Mary had never been expected to hold the throne, at least not since Edward was born. She was a devoted Catholic who believed that she could reverse the Reformation.<ref>Ann Weikel, \"Mary I (1516\u20131558)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', online edition, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18245, accessed 25 Aug 2011]</ref>\n\nReturning England to Catholicism led to the burnings of 274 Protestants, which are recorded especially in [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Book of Martyrs]]''. Mary then married her cousin [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], son of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], and King of Spain when Charles abdicated in 1556. The union was difficult because Mary was already in her late 30s and Philip was a Catholic and a foreigner, and so not very welcome in England. This wedding also provoked hostility from France, already at war with Spain and now fearing being encircled by the Habsburgs. Calais, the last English outpost on the Continent, was then taken by France. King Philip (1527\u20131598) had very little power, although he did protect Elizabeth. He was not popular in England, and spent little time there.<ref>Glyn Redworth, \"Philip (1527\u20131598)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', online edition, May 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22097, accessed 25 Aug 2011]</ref> Mary eventually became pregnant, or at least believed herself to be. In reality, she may have had [[uterine cancer]]. Her death in November 1558 was greeted with huge celebrations in the streets of London.\n\n===Elizabeth I===\n{{main|Elizabethan era}}\nAfter Mary I died in 1558, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] came to the throne. Her reign restored a sort of order to the realm after the turbulent reigns of Edward VI and Mary I. The religious issue which had divided the country since Henry VIII was in a way put to rest by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], which re-established the [[Church of England]]. Much of Elizabeth's success was in balancing the interests of the [[Puritan]]s and Catholics; historian Robert Bucholz paraphrasing historian Conrad Russell, suggested that the genius of the Church of England was that it \"thinks Protestant but looks Catholic.\"<ref name=twsBucholz1/> She managed to offend neither to a large extent, although she clamped down on Catholics towards the end of her reign as war with Catholic Spain loomed.<ref>J.

This created endless worries over her succession, especially in the 1560s when she nearly died of smallpox. It has been often rumoured that she had a number of lovers (including [[Francis Drake]]), but there is no hard evidence.\n\n[[File:Elizabeth I Rainbow Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]]]\n\nElizabeth maintained relative government stability. Apart from the [[Revolt of the Northern Earls]] in 1569, she was effective in reducing the power of the old nobility and expanding the power of her government. Elizabeth's government did much to consolidate the work begun under [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] in the reign of Henry VIII, that is, expanding the role of the government and effecting common law and administration throughout England. During the reign of Elizabeth and shortly afterwards, the population grew significantly: from three million in 1564 to nearly five million in 1616.<ref>[http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-atoz/population ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523191332/http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-atoz/population |date=23 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe queen ran afoul of her cousin [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was a devoted Catholic and so was forced to abdicate her throne (Scotland had [[Scottish Reformation|recently become Protestant]]). She fled to England, where Elizabeth immediately had her arrested. Mary spent the next 19 years in confinement, but proved too dangerous to keep alive, as the Catholic powers in Europe considered her the legitimate ruler of England. She was eventually tried for treason, sentenced to death, and beheaded in February 1587.\n\n====Elizabethan era====\n[[File:Elizabeth I, Procession Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|The Procession Picture, c. 1600, showing Elizabeth I borne along by her courtiers.]]\n\nThe Elizabethan era was the epoch in English history of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]'s reign (1558\u20131603). Historians often depict it as the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] in English history. The symbol of [[Britannia]] was first used in 1572 and often thereafter to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over the hated Spanish foe. In terms of the entire century, [[John Guy (historian)|the historian John Guy]] (1988) argues that \"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]]\" than at any time in a thousand years.<ref>John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, p. 32 {{ISBN|0192852132}}</ref>\n\nThis \"golden age\"<ref>From the 1944 Clark lectures by [[C. S. Lewis]]; Lewis, ''English Literature in the Sixteenth Century'' (Oxford, 1954) p. 1, {{OCLC|256072}}</ref> represented the apogee of the [[English Renaissance]] and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]], as [[William Shakespeare]] and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the [[Protestant Reformation]] became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the [[Spanish Armada]] was repulsed. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.\n\nThe Elizabethan Age is viewed so highly largely because of the periods before and after. It was a brief period of largely internal peace after the battles between Catholics and Protestants during the [[English Reformation]] and before battles between [[Parliament of England|parliament]] and the monarchy of the 17th century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.\n\nEngland was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. [[Italian Renaissance]] had ended due to foreign domination of the peninsula. France was embroiled in religious battles until the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598. Also, the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent. Due to these reasons, the centuries long conflict with France was largely suspended for most of Elizabeth's reign. England during this period had a centralised, organised and effective government, largely due to the reforms of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] trade.\n\n[[File:Expedici\u00f3n de Francis Drake 1585-1586.jpg|thumb|Sir Francis Drake's voyage 1585\u201386]]\nIn 1585 worsening relations between [[Philip II of Spain]] and Elizabeth erupted into war. Elizabeth signed the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] with the Dutch and permitted [[Francis Drake]] to maraud in response to a Spanish embargo. Drake surprised Vigo, Spain, in October, then proceeded to the Caribbean and sacked Santo Domingo (the capital of Spain's American empire and the present-day capital of the Dominican Republic) and Cartagena (a large and wealthy port on the north coast of Colombia that was the center of the silver trade). Philip II tried to invade England with the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 but was famously defeated.\n\nThe Armada was not just a naval campaign. The build-up of land forces to resist a Spanish invasion has been described as an administrative feat of massive scope. A survey taken in November and December 1587 showed 130,000 men in the militia, of whom 44,000 were members of the trained bands, being drilled and led by experienced captains and sergeants. By May 1588 the London bands were drilling weekly. To give warning of the enemy's approach, beacons were built, manned twenty-four hours a day by four men. Once the beacons were lit, 72,000 men could be mobilised on the south coast, with another 46,000 protecting London. For the many Englishmen caught up in the Armada the experience must have been very profound and frightening. Some shared the intimacy of beacon watching, hoping for the best, but ready to light their warning fires in case of the worst.<ref name=Carlton>{{cite book |last1=Carlton |first1=Charles |title=This Seat of Mars: War and the British Isles, 1485-1746 |date=2011 |page=42}}</ref> [[Deloney]], a London silkweaver, played on their fears in his 'New Ballet [Ballad] on the strange whippes which the Spanyards had prepared to whippe English men' (1588).<ref name=Carlton/> The political philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] recalled that his mother was so frightened that she prematurely gave birth to twins, of whom he was one.<ref name=Carlton/> All were terrified about what might happen if the Spanish invaded.<ref name=Carlton/> Stories of the [[Sack of Antwerp]] in 1576, in which the Spanish led by [[Sancho d'Avila]] raped, tortured and murdered as many as 17,000 civilians, were grist for playwrights and pamphleteers such as [[George Gascoigne]] and [[Shakespeare]].<ref name=Carlton/> The former remembered seeing civilians at [[Antwerp]] drowned, burned, or with guts hanging out as if they had been used for an anatomy lesson.<ref name=Carlton/> Few Englishmen, women and children doubted they faced similar fates had the Armada landed.<ref name=Carlton/>\n\n[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb| left| The Spanish Armada and English ships in August 1588, (unknown, 16th-century, English School)]]\n\n====Foreign affairs====\nIn foreign policy, Elizabeth played against each other the major powers France and Spain, as well as the papacy and Scotland. These were all Catholic and each wanted to end Protestantism in England. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs and only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France and Ireland. She risked war with Spain by supporting the \"[[Sea Dogs]]\", such as [[Walter Raleigh]], [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and Sir [[Francis Drake]], who preyed on Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|major war came with Spain, 1585\u20131603]]. When Spain tried to invade and conquer England it was a fiasco, and the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 associated Elizabeth's name with what is popularly viewed as one of the greatest victories in English history. Her enemies failed to combine and Elizabeth's foreign policy successfully navigated all the dangers.<ref>Charles Beem, ''The Foreign Relations of Elizabeth I'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Foreign-Relations-Elizabeth-Queenship-Power/dp/0230112145/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n===End of Tudor era===\nIn all, the [[Tudor period]] is seen as a decisive one which set up many important questions which would have to be answered in the next century and during the [[English Civil War]]. These were questions of the relative power of the monarch and Parliament and to what extent one should control the other. Some historians think that Thomas Cromwell affected a \"Tudor Revolution\" in government, and it is certain that Parliament became more important during his chancellorship. Other historians argue that the \"Tudor Revolution\" extended to the end of Elizabeth's reign, when the work was all consolidated. Although the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] declined after Elizabeth's death, it was very effective while she was alive.\n\nElizabeth died in 1603 at the age of 69.\n\n==17th century==\n{{main|17th century England}}\n\n=== Union of the Crowns ===\n\n[[File:JamesIEngland.jpg|thumb|[[King James I]] of England]]\n\nWhen Elizabeth died, her closest male Protestant relative was the [[King of Scots]], [[King James VI of Scotland|James VI]], of the [[House of Stuart]], who became [[James I of England|King James I of England]] in a [[Union of the Crowns]], called James I & VI. He was the first monarch to rule the entire island of Britain, but the countries remained separate politically. Upon taking power, James made peace with Spain, and for the first half of the 17th century, England remained largely inactive in European politics. Several assassination attempts were made on James, notably the [[Main Plot]] and [[Bye Plot]]s of 1603, and most famously, on 5 November 1605, the [[Gunpowder Plot]], by a group of Catholic conspirators, led by [[Robert Catesby]], which caused more antipathy in England towards Catholicism.\n\n===Colonies===\n{{further|English overseas possessions}}\n\nIn 1607 England built an [[Jamestown, Virginia|establishment at Jamestown]]. This was the beginning of colonialism by England in North America. Many English settled then in North America for religious or economic reasons. Approximately 70% of English immigrants to North America who came between 1630\u20131660 were [[indentured servant]]s. By 1700, [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] planters transported about 100,000 indentured servants,<ref>\"[https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-03.htm Africans, Slavery, and Race]\".

The defeat of the Royalist army by the [[New Model Army]] of Parliament at the [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645 effectively destroyed the king's forces. Charles surrendered to the Scottish army at Newark. He was eventually handed over to the English Parliament in early 1647. He escaped, and the [[Second English Civil War]] began, but the New Model Army quickly secured the country. The capture and trial of Charles led to the [[execution of Charles I]] in January 1649 at [[Whitehall]] Gate in London, making England a [[republic]]. This shocked the rest of Europe. The king argued to the end that only God could judge him. The trial and execution were a precursor of sorts to the beheading of [[Louis XVI]] 145 years later.\n\nThe New Model Army, commanded by [[Oliver Cromwell]], then scored decisive victories against Royalist armies in Ireland and Scotland. Cromwell was given the title [[Lord Protector]] in 1653, making him 'king in all but name' to his critics. After he died in 1658, his son [[Richard Cromwell]] succeeded him in the office but he was forced to abdicate within a year. For a while it seemed as if a new civil war would begin as the New Model Army split into factions. Troops stationed in Scotland under the command of [[George Monck]] eventually marched on London to restore order.\n\nAccording to [[Derek Hirst]], outside of politics and religion, the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy characterized by growth in manufacturing, the elaboration of financial and credit instruments, and the commercialization Of communication. The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.<ref>[[Derek Hirst]], \"Locating the 1650s in England's seventeenth century\" ''History'' (1996) 81#263 pp 359-83 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24423269 online]</ref>\n\n===Restoration of the monarchy===\n\n[[File:Charles II by John Michael Wright.jpg|thumb| [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] ]]\n[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|The Great Fire London, 1666.]]\n\nThe monarchy was restored in 1660, with King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] returning to London. However, the power of the crown was less than before the Civil War. By the 18th century England rivaled the Netherlands as one of the freest countries in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sandifer |first1=Preston |title=Perspectives on 17th Century West European History |date=2011 |publisher=McNash |location=New York |page=1229}}</ref>\n\nIn 1665, London was swept by the [[Great Plague of London|plague]], and in 1666 by the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] for 5 days which destroyed about 15,000 buildings.\n\n===Glorious Revolution===\nIn 1680, the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion crisis]] consisted of attempts to prevent accession of James, heir to Charles II, because he was Catholic. After Charles II died in 1685 and his [[James II of England|James II & VII]] was crowned, various factions pressed for his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband [[William III of England|Prince William III of Orange]] to replace him in what became known as the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\nIn November 1688, William [[William III of England#Invasion of England|invaded England]] and succeeded in being crowned. James tried to retake the throne in the [[Williamite War]], but was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690.\n\nIn December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], was passed.<ref name=vdk114>Van der Kiste, 114\u2013115</ref> The Bill, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier [[Declaration of Right, 1689|Declaration of Right]], established restrictions on the [[royal prerogative]]. For example, the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive [[bail]] or inflict cruel and unusual punishments.<ref name=\"davies\">[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''The Isles: A History'' (1999) {{ISBN|0-19-513442-7}}, p.614.</ref> William was opposed to such constraints, but chose not conflict with Parliament and agreed to the statute.<ref>Troost, 212\u2013214</ref>\n\nIn parts of Scotland and Ireland, Catholics loyal to James remained determined to see him restored to the throne, and staged a series of bloody uprisings. As a result, any failure to pledge loyalty to the victorious King William was severely dealt with. The most infamous example of this policy was the [[Massacre of Glencoe]] in 1692. [[Jacobite rebellions]] continued into the mid-18th century until the son of the last Catholic claimant to the throne, [[Old Pretender|James III & VIII]], mounted a [[Jacobite rising of 1745|final campaign in 1745]]. The Jacobite forces of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles Edward Stuart]], the \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\" of legend, were defeated at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746.\n\n==Formation of the United Kingdom==\nThe [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] between the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] were a pair of [[Act of Parliament|Parliamentary Acts]] passed by both parliaments in 1707, which dissolved them in order to form a [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] governed by a unified [[Parliament of Great Britain]] according to the [[Treaty of Union]]. The Acts joined the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (previously separate [[sovereign state|state]]s, with separate legislatures but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]], starting with James I of England (also James VI of Scotland)) into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/ Welcome] parliament.uk. Retrieved 7 October 2008.</ref>\n\nThe two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that the idea had the will of both political establishments behind them, albeit for rather different reasons.\n\nThe Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scots Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London, the home of the English Parliament.<ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 3</ref> Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, historian [[Simon Schama]] said \"What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 22 May 2001 |number=10 |minutes=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1714 ended the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], the last monarch of the [[House of Stuart]].

The English capital of London was adopted as the capital of the Union.\n\n==Modern England, 18th\u201319th centuries==\n{{Main|History of the United Kingdom}}\n\n{{further|Social history of England|History of local government in England#The evolution of modern local government (1832\u20131974)}}\n\nFollowing the formation of the United Kingdom, the history of England is no longer the history of a sovereign nation, but rather the history of one of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]].\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n{{main|Economic history of Britain}}\nIn the late 18th century and early 19th centuries, technological advances and mechanization resulted in the [[Industrial Revolution]] which transformed a largely agrarian society and caused considerable social upheaval. Economies of scale and increased output per worker allowed steam-based factories to undercut production of traditional cottage industries. Much of the agricultural workforce was uprooted from the countryside and moved into large urban centres of production. The consequent overcrowding into areas with little supporting infrastructure saw dramatic increases in mortality, crime, and social deprivation. (Many Sunday schools for pre-working age children (5 or 6) had funeral clubs to pay for each other's funeral arrangements.) The process of industrialization threatened many livelihoods, which prompted some to sabotage factories. These saboteurs were known as \"[[Luddism|Luddites]]\".\n\n===Local governance===\n{{further|History of local government in England}}\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 009 - Billingsgate Market (tone).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Billingsgate Fish Market]] in the early 19th century]]\n[[File:Louise Rayner Chester Eastgate Street.jpg|thumb|[[Chester]], c. 1880]]\nThe [[Local Government Act 1888]] was the first systematic attempt to impose a standardised system of local government in England. The system was based on the existing counties (today known as the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], since the major boundary changes of 1974). Later, the [[Local Government Act 1894]] created a second tier of local government. All administrative counties and county boroughs were divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration.\n\nDuring the 1800s, the need for local administration greatly increased, prompting piecemeal adjustments. The sanitary districts and parish councils had legal status, but were not part of the mechanism of government. They were run by volunteers; often no-one could be held responsible for the failure to undertake the required duties. Furthermore, the increased \"county business\" could not be handled by the [[Quarter Sessions]], nor was this appropriate. Finally, there was a desire to see local administration performed by elected officials, as in the reformed municipal boroughs. By 1888, these shortcomings were clear, and the [[Local Government Act 1888|Local Government Act]] was the first systematic attempt to create a standardised system of local government in England.\n\nThe system was based on the existing counties (now known as the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], since the major boundary changes of 1974). The counties themselves had had some boundary changes in the preceding 50 years, mainly to remove [[Historic counties of England#Detached parts|enclaves and exclaves]]. The act called for the creation of statutory counties, based on the ancient/historic counties, but completely corrected for enclaves and exclaves, and adjusted so that each settlement was completely within one county. These statutory counties were to be used for non-administrative functions: ''\"[[high sheriff|sheriff]], [[lord lieutenant|lieutenant]], [[custos rotulorum]], justices, militia, coroner, or other\"''. With the advent of elected councils, the offices of lord lieutenant and sheriff became largely ceremonial.\n\nThe statutory counties formed the basis for the so-called 'administrative counties'. However, it was felt that large cities and primarily rural areas in the same county could not be well administered by the same body. Thus 59 \"counties in themselves\", or 'county boroughs', were created to administer the urban centres of England. These were part of the statutory counties, but not part of the administrative counties.\n\n[[Local Government Act 1894|In 1894, the Local Government Act]] created a second tier of local government. Henceforth, all administrative counties and county boroughs would be divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration. The municipal boroughs reformed after 1835 were brought into this system as special cases of urban districts. The urban and rural districts were based on, and incorporated the [[sanitary district]]s which created in 1875 (with adjustments, so that districts did not overlap two counties).\n\nThe Act also provided for the establishment of [[civil parishes]]. The 1894 Act formed an official system of civil parishes, separated from the ecclesiastical parishes, to carry on some of these responsibilities (others being transferred to the district/county councils). However, the civil parishes were not a complete third-tier of local government. Instead, they were 'community councils' for smaller, rural settlements, which did not have a local government district to themselves. Where urban parish councils had previously existed, they were absorbed into the new urban districts.\n\n==20th and 21st centuries==\n\n{{Main|Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)|Political history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)}}\n\nA prolonged agricultural depression in Britain at the end of the 19th century, together with the introduction in the 20th century of increasingly heavy levels of taxation on inherited wealth, put an end to agricultural land as the primary source of wealth for the upper classes. Many estates were sold or broken up, and this trend was accelerated by the introduction of protection for agricultural tenancies, encouraging outright sales, from the mid-20th century.\n\n=== General history and political issues ===\n[[File:Ve Day Celebrations in London, England, UK, 8 May 1945 D24586.jpg|thumb|[[Victory in Europe Day]] celebrations in London, 8 May 1945]]\nFollowing years of political and military agitation for 'Home Rule' for Ireland, the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 established the [[Irish Free State]] (now the [[Republic of Ireland]]) as a separate state, leaving [[Northern Ireland]] as part of the United Kingdom. The official name of the UK thus became \"The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]\".\n\nEngland, as part of the UK, joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973, which became the [[European Union]] in 1993.\n\nThere is a movement in England to create a [[devolved English Parliament]]. This would give England a local Parliament like those already functioning for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. This issue is referred to as the [[West Lothian question]].\n\n===Political history and local government===\n{{details|History of local government in England}}\n\nA [[Local Government Commission for England (1958\u20131967)|Local Government Commission]] was wound up in 1966, and replaced with a Royal Commission (known as the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report|Redcliffe-Maud commission]]). In 1969 it recommended a system of single-tier [[unitary authorities]] for the whole of England, apart from three metropolitan areas of [[Merseyside]], [[Greater Manchester|Selnec]] (Greater Manchester) and [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] ([[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]]), which were to have both a metropolitan council and district councils. This report was accepted by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of the time despite considerable opposition, but the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|June 1970 general election]], and on a manifesto that committed them to a two-tier structure.\n\nThe reforms arising from the [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Act of 1972]] resulted in the most uniform and simplified system of local government which has been used in England. They effectively wiped away everything that had gone before, and built an administrative system from scratch. All previous administrative districts \u2013 statutory counties, administrative counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs, counties corporate, civil parishes \u2013 were abolished.\n\nThe aim of the act was to establish a uniform two tier system across the country. Onto the blank canvas, new counties were created to cover the entire country; many of these were obviously based on the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], but there were some major changes, especially in the north.\n\nThis uniform two-tier system lasted only 12 years. In 1986, the metropolitan county councils and Greater London were abolished. This restored autonomy (in effect the old county borough status) to the metropolitan and London boroughs. The Local Government Act (1992) established a commission ([[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]]) to examine the issues, and make recommendations on where unitary authorities should be established. It was considered too expensive to make the system entirely unitary, and also there would doubtlessly be cases where the two-tier system functioned well. The commission recommended that many counties be moved to completely unitary systems; that some cities become unitary authorities, but that the remainder of their parent counties remain two-tier; and that in some counties the ''status quo'' should remain.\n\nThe [[rate-capping rebellion]] was a campaign within English local councils in 1985 which aimed to force the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] to withdraw powers to restrict the spending of councils. The campaign's tactic was that councils whose budgets were restricted would refuse to set any budget at all for the financial year 1985\u201386, requiring the Government to intervene directly in providing local services, or to concede. However, all 15 councils which initially refused to set a rate eventually did so, and the campaign failed to change Government policy. Powers to restrict council budgets have remained in place ever since.\n\nIn 1997, the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997|Lieutenancies Act]] was passed. This firmly separated all local authority areas (whether unitary or two-tier), from the geographical concept of a county as high level spatial unit. The lieutenancies it established became known as [[ceremonial counties]], since they were no longer administrative divisions. The counties represent a compromise between the [[historic counties of England|historic counties]] and the counties established in 1974.\n\nWhile the 1997 Labour government devolved power to [[Welsh Assembly|Wales]], [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], it refused to create a devolved Assembly or [[Devolved English Parliament|parliament for England]], planning instead to introduce eight regional assemblies around England to devolve power to the regions. In the event, only a [[London Assembly]] (and directly elected [[Mayor]]) was established. Rejection in a referendum of a proposed North-East Assembly in 2004 effectively scrapped those plans. A pre-condition of having a regional assembly was for the whole area to move to unitary authority status. Since the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] the government has floated the idea of voluntary mergers of local councils, avoiding a costly reorganisation but achieving desired reform. For instance, the guiding principles of the government's \"New Localism\" demand levels of efficiency not present in the current over-duplicated two-tier structure.\n\n===Recent changes===\nIn 2009, [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|new changes to local government]] were made whereby a number of new [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] were created in areas which previously had a 'two-tier' system of [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|counties]] and [[Districts of England|districts]]. In five [[Shire county|shire counties]] the functions of the county and district councils were combined into a single authority; and in two counties the powers of the county council were absorbed into a significantly reduced number of districts.\n\nThe abolition of [[regional development agency|regional development agencies]] and the creation of [[Local enterprise partnership]]s were announced as part of the [[June 2010 United Kingdom budget]].<ref name=\"Budget June 2010\">{{cite book | url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf | date=22 June 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010 | publisher=HM Treasury | author=Mark Hoban | title=Budget 2010 | archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf | archivedate=15 October 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 29 June 2010 a letter was sent from the [[Department of Communities and Local Government]] and the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] to local authority and business leaders, inviting proposals to replace regional development agencies in their areas by 6 September 2010.<ref name=\"DCLG 1626854\">{{cite web | url= http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/local/localenterprisepartnerships/ | title= Local enterprise partnerships | author= | publisher=Department of Communities and Local Government | date=29 June 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\nOn 7 September 2010, details were released of 56 proposals for [[local enterprise partnerships]] that had been received.<ref name=\"NDS 415344\">{{cite news | url=http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=415344&NewsAreaID=2 | title=New Local Enterprise Partnerships criss-cross the country | publisher=News Distribution Service | author=Department for Business, Innovation and Skills | date=7 September 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913050625/http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=415344&NewsAreaID=2 | archivedate=13 September 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/supporting-economic-growth-through-local-enterprise-partnerships-and-enterprise-zones |title=Supporting economic growth through local enterprise partnerships and enterprise zones|publisher= gov.uk| accessdate= 30 April 2013}}</ref> On 6 October 2010, during the Conservative Party Conference, it was revealed that 22 had been given the provisional 'green light' to proceed and others may later be accepted with amendments.<ref name=\"LGC 5020212\">{{cite news | url=http://www.lgcplus.com/leps-22-bald-men-fighting-over-a-comb/5020212.blog | title=LEPs: 22 bald men fighting over a comb?

The region has numerous remains from the [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], such as [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]]. In the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], all of Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]], was inhabited by the [[Celts|Celtic]] people known as the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]], including some [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribes (e.g. the [[Atrebates]], the [[Catuvellauni]], the [[Trinovantes]], etc.) in the south east.  In AD 43 the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] began; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] maintained control of their [[Roman Britain|province of Britannia]] until the early 5th century.\n\nThe [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] facilitated the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], which historians often regard as the origin of England and of the [[English people]].  The [[Anglo-Saxons]], a collection of various [[Germanic peoples]], established several kingdoms that became the primary powers in present-day England and parts of southern [[Scotland]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/saxons.shtml The Anglo-Saxons], BBC \u2013 History</ref> They introduced the [[Old English]] language, which largely displaced the previous [[Common Brittonic|British language]].  The Anglo-Saxons warred with British successor states in western Britain and the ''[[Hen Ogledd]]'' (Old North; the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-speaking parts of northern Britain), as well as with each other.  Raids by [[Vikings]] became frequent after about AD 800, and the [[Norsemen]] settled in large parts of what is now England.  During this period, several rulers attempted to unite the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, an effort that led to the emergence of the [[Kingdom of England]] by the 10th century.\n\nIn 1066, a [[Norman conquest of England|Norman expedition invaded and conquered England]].  The [[House of Normandy|Norman dynasty]] established by [[William the Conqueror]] ruled England for over half a century before the period of succession crisis known as [[the Anarchy]] (1135\u20131154).  Following the Anarchy, England came under the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet]], a dynasty which later inherited claims to the [[Kingdom of France]]. During this period, ''[[Magna Carta]]'' was signed. A succession crisis in France led to the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453), a series of conflicts involving the peoples of both nations.  Following the Hundred Years' Wars, England became embroiled in its own succession wars. The [[Wars of the Roses]] pitted two branches of the House of Plantagenet against one another, the [[House of York]] and the [[House of Lancaster]]. The Lancastrian [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] ended the War of the Roses and established the [[Tudor dynasty]] in 1485.\n\nUnder the Tudors and the later [[Stuart dynasty]], England became a colonial power. During the rule of the Stuarts, the [[English Civil War]] took place between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists, which resulted in [[Execution of Charles I|the execution]] of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] (1649) and the establishment of a series of republican governments \u2014 first, a Parliamentary republic known as the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653), then a military dictatorship under [[Oliver Cromwell]] known as [[The Protectorate]] (1653\u20131659).  The Stuarts returned to the restored throne in 1660, though continued questions over religion and power resulted in the deposition of another Stuart king, [[James II of England|James II]], in the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688). England, which had subsumed Wales in the 16th century under Henry VIII, united with Scotland in 1707 to form a new sovereign state called [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm Uniting the kingdom?] nationalarchives.gov.uk, accessed 2 July 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp The Union of the Parliaments 1707] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102060414/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp |date=2 January 2012 }} [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]], accessed 2 July 2011</ref><ref>Union with England Act 1707, Article II</ref> Following the [[Industrial Revolution]], Great Britain ruled a colonial [[British Empire|Empire]], the largest in recorded history.  Following a process of [[decolonisation]] in the 20th century, mainly caused by the weakening of Great Britain's power in the two World Wars, almost all of the empire's overseas territories became independent countries. However, {{as of|2020|lc=on||df=UK}}, its cultural impact remains widespread and deep in many of them.\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{main|Prehistoric Britain}}\n\n===Stone Age===\n[[File:Stonehenge Closeup.jpg|thumb|[[Stonehenge]], erected in several stages from c.3000-1500BC]]\n\nThe time from Britain's first inhabitation until the [[last glacial maximum]] is known as the Old Stone Age, or [[Palaeolithic|Palaeolithic era]]. Archaeological evidence indicates that what was to become England was colonised by humans long before the rest of the British Isles because of its more hospitable climate between and during the various [[glacial period]]s of the distant past. This earliest evidence, from Happisburgh in Norfolk, includes the oldest human footprints found outside Africa, and points to dates of more than 800,000 [[Before Present|BP]].<ref name=\"alexburg\" /> These earliest inhabitants were [[hunter-gatherers]]. Low sea-levels meant that Britain was attached to the continent for much of this earliest period of history, and varying temperatures over tens of thousands of years meant that it was not always inhabited.<ref name=\"Francis Pryor 2003\">Francis Pryor, ''Britain BC'', 2003.</ref>\n\nEngland has been continually inhabited since the last Ice Age ended around 9,000 BC, the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, or [[Mesolithic|Mesolithic era]]. Rising sea-levels cut off Britain from the continent for the last time around 6500 BC. The population by then was exclusively [[anatomically modern humans]], and the evidence suggests that their societies were increasingly complex and they were manipulating their environment and prey in new ways, possibly selective burning of then omnipresent woodland to create clearings for herds to gather and then hunt them. Hunting was mainly done with simple projectile weapons such as [[javelin]] and possibly [[sling (weapon)|sling]]. Bow and arrow was known in Western Europe since least 9000 BC. The climate continued to warm and the population probably rose.<ref>V Gaffney, S Fitch and D Smith 2009, ''Europe's Lost World: The Rediscovery of Doggerland''.</ref>\n\nThe New Stone Age, or [[Neolithic|Neolithic era]], began with the introduction of farming, ultimately from the Middle East, around 4000 BC. It is not known whether this was caused by a substantial folk movement or native adoption of foreign practices or both. People began to lead a more settled lifestyle. Monumental collective tombs were built for the dead in the form of chambered cairns and long barrows. Towards the end of the period, other kinds of monumental stone alignments begin to appear, such as Stonehenge; their cosmic alignments show a preoccupation with the sky and planets. Flint technology produced a number of highly artistic pieces as well as purely pragmatic. More extensive woodland clearance was done for fields and pastures. The [[Sweet Track]] in the [[Somerset Levels]] is one of the oldest [[timber trackway]]s known in Northern Europe and among the oldest roads in the world, dated by [[dendrochronology]] to the winter of 3807\u20133806 BC; it too is thought to have been a primarily religious structure.<ref name=\"Francis Pryor 2003\"/>\n\n===Later Prehistory===\n[[File:Maiden Castle, Dorchester..jpg|thumb|View of the ramparts of the developed hillfort of [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], as they look today]]\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] began around 2500 BC with the appearance of bronze objects. This coincides with the appearance of the characteristic [[Beaker culture]]; again this might have occurred primarily by folk movement or by cultural assimilation or both. The Bronze Age saw a shift of emphasis from the communal to the individual, and the rise of increasingly powerful elites whose power came from their prowess as hunters and warriors and their controlling the flow of precious resources to manipulate tin and copper into high-status bronze objects such as swords and axes. Settlement became increasingly permanent and intensive. Towards the end of the Bronze Age, many examples of very fine metalwork began to be deposited in rivers, presumably for ritual reasons and perhaps reflecting a progressive change in emphasis from the sky to the earth, as a rising population put increasing pressure on the land. England largely became bound up with the [[Atlantic Bronze Age|Atlantic trade system]], which created a cultural continuum over a large part of Western Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Francis Pryor, ''Britain BC'', 2003</ref> It is possible that the [[Celtic languages]] developed or spread to England as part of this system; by the end of the Iron Age there is much evidence that they were spoken across all England and western parts of Britain.<ref>Barry Cunliffe, ''The Ancient Celts'', 1997</ref>\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] is conventionally said to begin around 800 BC. The Atlantic system had by this time effectively collapsed, although England maintained contacts across the Channel with France, as the [[Hallstatt culture]] became widespread across the country. Its continuity suggests it was not accompanied by substantial movement of population; crucially, only a single Hallstatt burial is known from Britain, and even here the evidence is inconclusive. On the whole, burials largely disappear across England, and the dead were disposed of in a way which is archaeologically invisible: [[excarnation]] is a widely cited possibility. [[Hillfort]]s were known since the Late Bronze Age, but a huge number were constructed during 600\u2013400 BC, particularly in the South, while after about 400 BC new forts were rarely built and many ceased to be regularly inhabited, while a few forts become more and more intensively occupied, suggesting a degree of regional centralisation. Around this time the earliest mentions of Britain appear in the annals of history. The first historical mention of the region is from the [[Massaliote Periplus]], a sailing manual for merchants thought to date to the 6th century BC, and [[Pytheas of Massilia]] wrote of his  voyage of discovery to the island around 325 BC. Both of these texts are now lost; although quoted by later writers, not enough survives to inform the archaeological interpretation to any significant degree.\n\nContact with the continent was less than in the Bronze Age but still significant. Goods continued to move to England, with a possible hiatus around 350 to 150 BC. There were a few armed invasions of hordes of migrating Celts. There are two known invasions. Around 300 BC, a group from the Gaulish [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] tribe apparently took over East Yorkshire, establishing the highly distinctive [[Arras culture]]. And from around 150\u2013100 BC, groups of Belgae began to control significant parts of the South. These invasions constituted movements of a few people who established themselves as a warrior elite atop existing native systems, rather than replacing them. The Belgic invasion was much larger than the Parisian settlement, but the continuity of pottery style shows that the native population remained in place. Yet, it was accompanied by significant socio-economic change. Proto-urban, or even urban settlements, known as [[oppidum|oppida]], begin to eclipse the old hillforts, and an elite whose position is based on battle prowess and the ability to manipulate resources re-appears much more distinctly.<ref>Barry Cunliffe, ''Iron Age Communities in Britain'', 2005</ref>\n\n[[File:Caesar's first invasion of Britain; Caesar's boat is pulled Wellcome V0048276.jpg|thumb|Caesar's first invasion of Britain]]\nIn 55 and 54 BC, [[Julius Caesar]], as part of [[Gallic Wars|his campaigns in Gaul]], [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invaded Britain]] and claimed to have scored a number of victories, but he never penetrated further than Hertfordshire and could not establish a province. However, his invasions mark a turning-point in British history. Control of trade, the flow of resources and prestige goods, became ever more important to the elites of Southern Britain; Rome steadily became the biggest player in all their dealings, as the provider of great wealth and patronage. A full-scale invasion and annexation was inevitable, in retrospect.<ref>Guy de la Bedoyere, ''Roman Britain: A New History'', 2010</ref>\n\n===Genetic history of the English===\n{{main|Genetic history of the British Isles}}\n\nThe Roman historian [[Tacitus]] wrote in his ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', completed in AD 98,<ref>Mattingly, H. & Handford, S.A. (trans.), ''The Agricola and the Germania'' (Revised edition), Penguin Classics, 1970, p.&nbsp;10.</ref> that the various groupings of [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] shared physical characteristics with continental peoples. The [[Caledonians]], inhabitants of what is now [[Scotland]], had red hair and large limbs, indicating a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin; the [[Silures]], of what is now [[South Wales]], were swarthy with curly hair, indicating a link with the [[Iberians]] of the Roman provinces of [[Hispania]], in what is now Portugal and Spain; and the Britons nearest the [[Gauls]] of mainland Europe resembled the Gauls.<ref>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' chapter 11.</ref> This gross oversimplification is somewhat true until today. Some archaeologists and geneticists have challenged the long-held assumption that the invading Anglo-Saxons wiped out the native Britons in England when they invaded, pointing instead to the possibility of a more limited folk movement bringing a new language and culture which the natives gradually assimilated.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDebate continues about the ultimate origins of the people of the British Isles. In 2003 and 2006 respectively, [[Bryan Sykes]] and [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] both argued for continuity since the Mesolithic, with much input from the East during the Neolithic.<ref>Stephen Oppenheimer, ''The Origins of the British, 2006</ref><ref>Bryan Sykes, ''Blood of the Isles'', 2003</ref> However, the [[haplotypes]] which Sykes and Oppenheimer associated with Spain hailed ultimately from [[Asia Minor]], which might be more consistent with some kind of Neolithic wipeout, although it is impossible to date this gene flow.<ref>Myres et al, ''A major Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b Holocene era founder effect in Central and Western Europe'' in ''European Journal of Human Genetics'', 2010</ref> Other theories have proposed an even greater input in the Early Bronze Age than previously thought. Ultimately, the genetics have not yet revealed anything new. Biological differences between the English and the Welsh were confirmed by tests at [[University College London]], in which the native English population's DNA correlated to others in Germanic parts of Northern Europe traceable through their Y chromosome.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2076470.stm</ref>\n\n==Roman Britain==\n{{main|Roman Britain}}\n[[File:Landing of the Romans on the Coast of Kent.jpg|thumb|Landing of the Romans on the Coast of [[Kent]] (Cassell's ''History of England'', Vol. I - anonymous author and artists, 1909).]]\n[[File:Prima tetrarchia Diocletianus.PNG|thumbnail|[[Roman Empire]], 3rd century.]]\nAfter Caesar's expeditions, the Romans began their real attempt to [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquer Britain]] in 43 AD, at the behest of Emperor [[Claudius]]. They landed in Kent and defeated two armies led by the kings of the [[Catuvellauni]] tribe, [[Caratacus]] and [[Togodumnus]], in battles at the Medway and the Thames. Togodumnus was killed, and Caratacus fled to Wales. The Roman force, led by Aulus Plautius, waited for Claudius to come and lead the final march on the Catuvellauni capital at [[Camulodunum]] (modern [[Colchester]]), before he returned to Rome for his triumph. The Catuvellauni held sway over most of the southeastern corner of England; eleven local rulers surrendered, a number of client kingdoms were established, and the rest became a Roman province with Camulodunum as its capital.<ref>Henry Freeman, ''Roman Britain: A History From Beginning to End'' (2016).</ref> Over the next four years, the territory was consolidated and the future emperor [[Vespasian]] led a campaign into the Southwest where he subjugated two more tribes. By 54 AD the border had been pushed back to the Severn and the Trent, and campaigns were underway to subjugate Northern England and Wales.\n\nBut in 60 AD, under the leadership of the warrior-queen [[Boudicca]], the tribes rebelled against the Romans. At first, the rebels had great success. They burned Camulodunum, [[Londinium]] and [[Verulamium]] (modern-day Colchester, London and St. Albans respectively) to the ground. There is some archaeological evidence that the same happened at Winchester. The Second Legion Augusta, stationed at [[Exeter]], refused to move for fear of revolt among the locals. Londinium governor [[Suetonius Paulinus]] evacuated the city before the rebels sacked and burned it; the fire was so hot that a ten-inch layer of melted red clay remains 15 feet below London's streets.<ref>{{cite book |title=Making Europe: The Story of the West, Volume I to 1790 |date=2013 |page=162}}</ref> In the end, the rebels were said to have killed 70,000 Romans and Roman sympathisers. Paulinus gathered what was left of the Roman army. In the [[Battle of Watling Street|decisive battle]], 10,000 Romans faced nearly 100,000 warriors somewhere along the line of [[Watling Street]], at the end of which Boudicca was utterly defeated. It was said that 80,000 rebels were killed, but only 400 Romans.\n\nOver the next 20 years, the borders expanded slightly, but the governor Agricola incorporated into the province the last pockets of independence in Wales and Northern England. He also led a campaign into Scotland which was recalled by Emperor Domitian. The border gradually formed along the [[Stanegate]] road in Northern England, solidified by [[Hadrian's Wall]] built in 138 AD, despite temporary forays into Scotland. The Romans and their culture stayed in charge for 350 years. [[Roman sites in Great Britain|Traces of their presence]] are ubiquitous throughout England.\n\n==The Anglo-Saxon migration==\n{{main |Sub-Roman Britain}}\n{{see | Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain}}\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|Kingdoms and tribes in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], c.600 AD]]\n\nIn the wake of the breakdown of Roman rule in Britain from the middle of the fourth century, present day England was progressively settled by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups. Collectively known as the \"[[Anglo-Saxons]]\", these were [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]] from what is now the Danish/German border area and [[Jutes]] from the Jutland peninsula.

The precise nature of these invasions is not fully known; there are doubts about the legitimacy of historical accounts due to a lack of archaeological finds. [[Gildas]] Sapiens's ''De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae'', composed in the 6th century, states that when the Roman army departed the Isle of Britannia in the 4th century CE, the indigenous Britons were invaded by [[Picts]], their neighbours to the north (now Scotland) and the [[Scoti|Scots]] (now Ireland). Britons invited the [[Saxons]] to the island to repel them but after they vanquished the Scots and Picts, the Saxons turned against the Britons.\n\nSeven Kingdoms are traditionally identified as being established by these Saxon migrants. Three were clustered in the South east: [[Sussex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]]. The Midlands were dominated by the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]]. The [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Monarchs of Mercia]]'s lineage was determined to reach as far back as the early 500's. To the north was [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] which unified two earlier kingdoms, [[Bernicia]] and [[Deira]]. Eventually, the kingdoms were dominated by [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] and [[Mercia]] in the 7th century, [[Mercia]] in the 8th century and then [[Wessex]] in the 9th century. [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] extended its control north into [[Scotland]] and west into [[Wales]]. It also subdued [[Mercia]] whose first powerful King, [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]], was killed by [[Oswiu of Northumbria|Oswy]] in 655. Northumbria's power began to wane after 685 with the defeat and death of its king [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Aegfrith]] at the hands of the [[Picts]]. Mercian power reached its peak under the rule of [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], who from 785 had influence over most of Anglo-Saxon England. Since Offa's death in 796, the supremacy of [[Wessex]] was established under [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]] who extended control west into [[Cornwall]] before defeating the Mercians at the [[Battle of Ellendun]] in 825. Four years later, he received submission and tribute from the Northumbrian king, [[Eanred of Northumbria|Eanred]].<ref>Stenton, Frank. \"Anglo-Saxon England\". OUP, 1971</ref>\n\nThe history of the fifth and sixth centuries is particularly difficult to access, peppered with a mixture of mythology, such as the characters of [[Hengist and Horsa]], and legend, such as St [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]]'s so-called \"Alleluia Victory\" against the Heathens, and half-remembered history, such as the exploits of [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] and [[King Arthur]]. However, the belief that the Saxons wiped or drove out all the native Britons from England has been widely discredited by a number of archaeologists since the 2000s. Anyway Anglo-Saxons and Saxonified Britons spread into England, by a combination of military conquest and cultural assimilation. By the eighth century, a kind of England had emerged, albeit as several separate kingdoms and not united under a single rule.<ref>Francis Pryor, ''Britain AD'', 2004</ref><ref>Geoffrey Hindley, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', 2006</ref>\n\n==Heptarchy and Christianisation==\n{{main|Northumbria|Mercia|Offa of Mercia|Heptarchy|Gregorian mission|Anglo-Saxon Christianity}}\n[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 022 - Gregory and the English Slaves at Rome.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Gregory I]] seeing Anglo-Saxon children in a slave market in [[Rome]]. He sent [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] as a missionary to England in 596.]]\n\nChristianisation of Anglo-Saxon England began around AD 600, influenced by [[Celtic Christianity]] from the northwest and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] from the southeast. [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], took office in 597. In 601, he baptised the first Christian Anglo-Saxon king, [[Aethelbert of Kent]]. The last pagan Anglo-Saxon king, [[Penda of Mercia]], died in 655. The last pagan [[Jutes|Jutish]] king, [[Arwald]] of the [[Isle of Wight]] was killed in 686. The [[Anglo-Saxon mission]] on the continent took off in the 8th century, leading to the Christianisation of practically all of the [[Frankish Empire]] by 800.\n\nThroughout the 7th and 8th century power fluctuated between the larger kingdoms. [[Bede]] records [[\u00c6thelbert of Kent]] as being dominant at the close of the 6th century, but power seems to have shifted northwards to the kingdom of Northumbria, which was formed from the amalgamation of Bernicia and Deira. [[Edwin of Northumbria]] probably held dominance over much of Britain, though Bede's Northumbrian bias should be kept in mind. Due to succession crises, Northumbrian hegemony was not constant, and [[Mercia]] remained a very powerful kingdom, especially under Penda. Two defeats ended Northumbrian dominance: the Battle of the Trent in 679 against Mercia, and Nechtanesmere in 685 against the [[Picts]].<ref>Frank Merry Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (1971).</ref>\n\nThe so-called \"Mercian Supremacy\" dominated the 8th century, though it was not constant. Aethelbald and [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], the two most powerful kings, achieved high status; indeed, Offa was considered the overlord of south Britain by [[Charlemagne]]. His power is illustrated by the fact that he summoned the resources to build [[Offa's Dyke]]. However, a rising Wessex, and challenges from smaller kingdoms, kept Mercian power in check, and by the early 9th century the \"Mercian Supremacy\" was over.\n\nThis period has been described as the [[Heptarchy]], though this term has now fallen out of academic use. The term arose because the seven kingdoms of [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]] were the main polities of south Britain. Other small kingdoms were also politically important across this period: [[Hwicce]], [[Magonsaete]], [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]] and Middle Anglia.<ref>Peter Hayes Sawyer, ''From Roman Britain to Norman England'' (Routledge, 2002).</ref>\n\n==Viking challenge and the rise of Wessex==\n{{main|Danelaw|Viking Age|Alfred the Great}}\n\n[[File:England 878.svg|thumb|England in 878]]\n\nThe first recorded landing of [[Viking]]s took place in 787 in [[Dorset]]shire, on the south-west coast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Rosemary|title=The Vikings|url=https://archive.org/details/vikings0000rees|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=9781403401007|page=[https://archive.org/details/vikings0000rees/page/45 45]}}</ref> The first major attack in Britain was in 793 at [[Lindisfarne]] monastery as given by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. However, by then the Vikings were almost certainly well-established in [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], and many other non-recorded raids probably occurred before this. Records do show the first Viking attack on [[Iona]] taking place in 794. The arrival of the Vikings (in particular the Danish [[Great Heathen Army]]) upset the political and social geography of Britain and Ireland. In 867 [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] fell to the Danes; [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] fell in 869. Though [[Wessex]] managed to contain the Vikings by defeating them at [[Battle of Ashdown|Ashdown]] in 871, a second invading army landed, leaving the Saxons on a defensive footing. At much the same time, [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], king of Wessex died and was succeeded by his younger brother [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]]. Alfred was immediately confronted with the task of defending Wessex against the Danes. He spent the first five years of his reign paying the invaders off. In 878, Alfred's forces were overwhelmed at Chippenham in a surprise attack.<ref>Albany F. Major, ''Early wars of Wessex'' (Hildreth Press, 2008).</ref>\n\nIt was only now, with the independence of Wessex hanging by a thread, that Alfred emerged as a great king. In May 878 he led a force that defeated the Danes at [[Battle of Edington|Edington]]. The victory was so complete that the Danish leader, [[Guthrum]], was forced to accept Christian baptism and withdraw from [[Mercia]]. Alfred then set about strengthening the defences of Wessex, building a new navy\u201460 vessels strong. Alfred's success bought Wessex and Mercia years of peace and sparked economic recovery in previously ravaged areas.<ref>Richard P. Ables, ''Alfred the great: war, kingship and culture I'm Anglo-Saxon England'' (1998).</ref>\n\nAlfred's success was sustained by his son [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], whose decisive victories over the Danes in East Anglia in 910 and 911 were followed by a crushing victory at Tempsford in 917. These military gains allowed Edward to fully incorporate Mercia into his kingdom and add East Anglia to his conquests. Edward then set about reinforcing his northern borders against the Danish [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Edward's rapid conquest of the English kingdoms meant Wessex received homage from those that remained, including [[Gwynedd]] in Wales and Scotland. His dominance was reinforced by his son [[\u00c6thelstan]], who extended the borders of Wessex northward, in 927 conquering the [[Kingdom of York]] and leading a land and naval invasion of [[Scotland]]. These conquests led to his adopting the title 'King of the English' for the first time.\n\nThe dominance and independence of England was maintained by the kings that followed. It was not until 978 and the accession of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] that the Danish threat resurfaced. Two powerful Danish kings ([[Harold Bluetooth]] and later his son [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn]]) both launched devastating invasions of England. Anglo-Saxon forces were resoundingly defeated at [[Battle of Maldon|Maldon]] in 991. More Danish attacks followed, and their victories were frequent. \u00c6thelred's control over his nobles began to falter, and he grew increasingly desperate. His solution was to pay off the Danes: for almost 20 years he paid increasingly large sums to the Danish nobles to keep them from English coasts. These payments, known as [[Danegeld]]s, crippled the English economy.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 569175|title = The Collection of Danegeld and Heregeld in the Reigns of Aethelred II and Cnut|journal = The English Historical Review|volume = 99|issue = 393|pages = 721\u2013738|last1 = Lawson|first1 = M.

Then he made a great error: in 1002 he ordered the massacre of all the Danes in England. In response, Sweyn began a decade of devastating attacks on England. Northern England, with its sizable Danish population, sided with Sweyn. By 1013, London, Oxford, and Winchester had fallen to the Danes. \u00c6thelred fled to [[Normandy]] and Sweyn seized the throne. Sweyn suddenly died in 1014, and \u00c6thelred returned to England, confronted by Sweyn's successor, [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]]. However, in 1016, \u00c6thelred also suddenly died. Cnut swiftly defeated the remaining Saxons, killing \u00c6thelred's son [[Edmund Ironside|Edmund]] in the process. Cnut seized the throne, crowning himself King of England.<ref>Thames Cussans, ''Kings and Queens of the British Isles'' (The Times Books, 2002), pp.32-35.</ref>\n\n==English unification==\n{{main|\u00c6thelstan|Edgar of England}}\n[[File:Edward the Elder coin imitation silver brooch Rome Italy c 920.jpg|thumb|Silver brooch imitating a coin of Edward the Elder, c. 920, found in Rome, Italy. [[British Museum]].]]\n[[Alfred of Wessex]] died in 899 and was succeeded by his son [[Edward the Elder]]. Edward, and his brother-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians|\u00c6thelred]] of (what was left of) Mercia, began a programme of expansion, building forts and towns on an Alfredian model. On \u00c6thelred's death, his wife (Edward's sister) [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] ruled as \"Lady of the Mercians\" and continued expansion. It seems Edward had his son [[\u00c6thelstan]] brought up in the Mercian court, and on Edward's death. \u00c6thelstan succeeded to the Mercian kingdom, and, after some uncertainty, Wessex.\n\n\u00c6thelstan continued the expansion of his father and aunt and was the first king to achieve direct rulership of what we would now consider England. The titles attributed to him in [[Anglo-Saxon Charters|charters]] and on coins suggest a still more widespread dominance. His expansion aroused ill-feeling among the other kingdoms of Britain, and he defeated a combined Scottish-Viking army at the [[Battle of Brunanburh]]. However, the unification of England was not a certainty. Under \u00c6thelstan's successors [[Edmund II of England|Edmund]] and [[Edred of England|Eadred]] the English kings repeatedly lost and regained control of Northumbria. Nevertheless, [[Edgar of England|Edgar]], who ruled the same expanse as Athelstan, consolidated the kingdom, which remained united thereafter.\n\n==England under the Danes and the Norman conquest==\n{{main|Ethelred the Unready|Canute the Great|Eir\u00edkr H\u00e1konarson|Norman conquest of England}}\n[[File:U 344, Orkesta.JPG|right|thumb|The [[England Runestones#U 344|rune stone U 344]] was raised in memory of a Viking who went to England three times.]]\nThere were renewed Scandinavian attacks on England at the end of the 10th century. [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred]] ruled a long reign but ultimately lost his kingdom to [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn of Denmark]], though he recovered it following the latter's death. However, \u00c6thelred's son [[Edmund II Ironside]] died shortly afterwards, allowing [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]], Sweyn's son, to become king of England. Under his rule the kingdom became the centre of government for the [[North Sea Empire|North Sea empire]] which included Denmark and Norway.\n\nCnut was succeeded by his sons, but in 1042 the native dynasty was restored with the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]]. Edward's failure to produce an heir caused a furious conflict over the succession on his death in 1066. His struggles for power against [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], the claims of Cnut's Scandinavian successors, and the ambitions of the [[Normans]] whom Edward introduced to English politics to bolster his own position caused each to vie for control of Edward's reign.\n\n[[Harold Godwinson]] became king, probably appointed by Edward on his deathbed and endorsed by the [[Witan]]. But [[William of Normandy]], [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardr\u00e5de]] (aided by Harold Godwin's estranged brother [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]]) and [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] all asserted claims to the throne. By far the strongest hereditary claim was that of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], but due to his youth and apparent lack of powerful supporters, he did not play a major part in the struggles of 1066, although he was made king for a short time by the Witan after the death of Harold Godwinson.\n\nIn September 1066, [[Harald III of Norway]] and [[Tostig Godwinson|Earl Tostig]] [[Harald III of Norway#Invasion of England|landed in Northern England]] with a force of around 15,000 men and 300 [[longship]]s. [[Harold Godwinson]] defeated the invaders and killed Harald III of Norway and Tostig at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]].\n\nOn 28 September 1066, [[William of Normandy]] [[Norman Conquest#Norman invasion|invaded England]] in a campaign called the [[Norman Conquest]]. After marching from [[Yorkshire]], Harold's exhausted army was defeated and Harold was killed at the [[Battle of Hastings]] on 14 October. Further opposition to William in support of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]] soon collapsed, and William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066. For five years, he faced a series of rebellions in various parts of England and a half-hearted Danish invasion, but he subdued them and established an enduring regime.\n\n==Norman England==\n\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Hastings]] (1066) on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\nThe [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] led to a profound change in the history of the English state. William ordered the compilation of the [[Domesday Book]], a survey of the entire population and their lands and property for tax purposes, which reveals that within 20 years of the conquest the English ruling class had been almost entirely dispossessed and replaced by Norman landholders, who monopolised all senior positions in the government and the Church. William and his nobles spoke and conducted court in [[Norman language|Norman French]], in both Normandy and England. The use of the Anglo-Norman language by the aristocracy endured for centuries and left an indelible mark in the development of modern English.\n\nUpon being crowned, on Christmas Day 1066, William immediately began consolidating his power. By 1067, he faced revolts on all sides and spent four years crushing them. He then imposed his superiority over Scotland and Wales, forcing them to recognise him as overlord.\n\nThe English [[Middle Ages]] were characterised by [[civil war]], international war, occasional insurrection, and widespread political intrigue among the aristocratic and monarchic elite. England was more than self-sufficient in cereals, dairy products, beef and mutton. Its international economy was based on [[Wool#History|wool trade]], in which wool from the [[sheepwalk]]s of northern England was exported to the textile cities of [[Flanders]], where it was worked into cloth. Medieval foreign policy was as much shaped by relations with the Flemish textile industry as it was by dynastic adventures in western France. An English textile industry was established in the 15th century, providing the basis for rapid English capital accumulation.\n\n[[Henry I of England|Henry I]], the fourth son of [[William I the Conqueror]], succeeded his elder brother [[William II of England|William II]] as [[King of England]] in 1100. Henry was also known as \"Henry Beauclerc\" because he received a formal education, unlike his older brother and [[heir apparent]] [[William II of England|William]] who got practical training to be king. Henry worked hard to reform and stabilise the country and smooth the differences between the Anglo-Saxon and [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] societies. The loss of his son, [[William Adelin]], in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]'' in November 1120, undermined his reforms. This problem regarding succession cast a long shadow over English history.\n\nHenry I had required the leading barons, ecclesiastics and officials in Normandy and England, to take an oath to accept [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] (also known as Empress Maud, Henry I's daughter) as his heir. England was far less than enthusiastic to accept an outsider, and a woman, as their ruler.\n\nThere is some evidence that Henry was unsure of his own hopes and the oath to make Matilda his heir. Probably Henry hoped Matilda would have a son and step aside as Queen Mother. Upon Henry's death, the Norman and English barons ignored Matilda's claim to the throne, and thus through a series of decisions, [[Stephen I of England|Stephen]], Henry's favourite nephew, was welcomed by many in England and Normandy as their new king.\n\nOn 22 December 1135, Stephen was anointed king with implicit support by the church and nation. Matilda and her own son waited in France until she sparked the civil war from 1139\u20131153 known as [[the Anarchy]]. In the autumn of 1139, she invaded England with her illegitimate half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]]. Her husband, [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffroy V of Anjou]], conquered Normandy but did not cross the channel to help his wife. During this breakdown of central authority, nobles built [[adulterine castle]]s (i.e. castles erected without government permission), which were hated by the peasants, who were forced to build and maintain them.\n\nStephen was captured, and his government fell. Matilda was proclaimed queen but was soon at odds with her subjects and was expelled from London. The war continued until 1148, when Matilda returned to France. Stephen reigned unopposed until his death in 1154, although his hold on the throne was uneasy. As soon as he regained power, he began to demolish the adulterine castles, but kept a few castles standing, which put him at odds with his heir. His contested reign, [[the Anarchy|civil war]] and lawlessness broke out saw a major swing in power towards [[feudal]] [[baron]]s. In trying to appease Scottish and Welsh raiders, he handed over large tracts of land.\n\n==England under the Plantagenets==\n{{Further|House of Plantagenet}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n\nEmpress Matilda and [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffroy's]] son, Henry, resumed the invasion; he was already Count of Anjou, Duke of Normandy and Duke of Aquitaine when he landed in England. When Stephen's son and heir apparent [[Eustace IV|Eustace]] died in 1153, Stephen made an agreement with Henry of [[Anjou]] (who became [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]) to succeed Stephen and guarantee peace between them. The union was retrospectively named the [[Angevin Empire]]. Henry II destroyed the remaining adulterine castles and expanded his power through various means and to different levels into Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Flanders, Nantes, Brittany, Quercy, Toulouse, Bourges and Auvergne.\n\nThe reign of Henry II represents a reversion in power from the barony to the monarchical state in England; it was also to see a similar redistribution of legislative power from the Church, again to the monarchical state. This period also presaged a properly constituted legislation and a radical shift away from [[feudalism]]. In his reign, new [[Anglo-Angevin]] and [[Anglo-Aquitanian]] aristocracies developed, though not to the same degree as the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] once did, and the Norman nobles interacted with their French peers.\n\nHenry's successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] \"the Lion Heart\" (also known as \"The absent king\"), was preoccupied with foreign wars, taking part in the [[Third Crusade]], being captured while returning and pledging fealty to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as part of his ransom, and defending his French territories against Philip II of France. His successor, his younger brother [[John of England|John]], lost much of those territories including Normandy following the disastrous [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, despite having in 1212 made the [[Kingdom of England]] a tribute-paying vassal of the [[Holy See]], which it remained until the 14th century when the Kingdom rejected the overlordship of the [[Holy See]] and re-established its sovereignty.\n\nFrom 1212 onwards, John had a constant policy of maintaining close relations with the Pope, which partially explains how he persuaded the Pope to reject the legitimacy of ''[[Magna Carta]]''.\n\n===Magna Carta===\n{{main|Magna Carta}}\n[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|One of only four surviving [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the 1215 text, ''Cotton MS. Augustus II. 106'', property of the [[British Library]]]]\nOver the course of his reign, a combination of higher taxes, unsuccessful wars and conflict with the Pope made King John unpopular with his barons. In 1215, some of the most important barons rebelled against him. He met their leaders along with their French and Scot allies at [[Runnymede]], near London on 15 June 1215 to seal the [[Magna Carta|Great Charter]] (''Magna Carta'' in [[Latin (language)|Latin]]), which imposed legal limits on the king's personal powers. But as soon as hostilities ceased, John received approval from the Pope to break his word because he had made it under duress. This provoked the [[First Barons' War]] and a French invasion by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]] of France invited by a majority of the English barons to replace John as king in London in May 1216. John travelled around the country to oppose the rebel forces, directing, among other operations, a two-month siege of the rebel-held [[Rochester Castle]].\n\n===Henry III===\n{{main|Henry III of England}}\nJohn's son, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], was only 9 years old when he became king (1216\u20131272). He spent much of his reign fighting the barons over ''Magna Carta''<ref>https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/magna-carta-muse-and-mentor/confirmation-by-kings-and-parliament.html</ref> and the royal rights, and was eventually forced to call the first \"[[Parliament of England|parliament]]\" in 1264. He was also unsuccessful on the Continent, where he endeavoured to re-establish English control over [[Normandy]], [[Anjou]], and [[Aquitaine]].\n\nHis reign was punctuated by many rebellions and civil wars, often provoked by incompetence and mismanagement in government and Henry's perceived over-reliance on French courtiers (thus restricting the influence of the English nobility). One of these rebellions\u2014led by a disaffected courtier, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]\u2014was notable for its assembly of one of the earliest precursors to [[British Parliament|Parliament]]. In addition to fighting the [[Second Barons' War]], Henry III made war against Saint Louis and was defeated during the [[Saintonge War]], yet Louis IX did not capitalise on his victory, respecting his opponent's rights.\n\nHenry III's policies towards Jews began with relative tolerance, but became gradually more restrictive. In 1253 the [[Statute of Jewry]], reinforced physical segregation and demanded a previously notional requirement to wear square white badges.<ref>{{harvnb|Hillaby|2013|p=104}}</ref> Henry III also backed an accusation of child murder in Lincoln, ordering a Jew Copin to be executed and 91 Jews to be arrested for trial; 18 were killed. Popular superstitious fears were fuelled, and Catholic theological hostility combined with Baronial abuse of loan arrangements, resulting in [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]'s supporters targeting of Jewish communities in their [[Second Barons' War|revolt]]. This hostility, violence and controversy was the background to the increasingly oppressive measures that followed under Edward I.<ref name=\"Hillaby 2013 104\u2013107\">{{harvnb|Hillaby|2013|pp=104\u2013107}}</ref><ref name=\"Jacobs 1903\">{{harvnb|Jacobs|1903}}</ref>\n\n==14th century==\nThe reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (reigned 1272\u20131307) was rather more successful. Edward enacted numerous laws strengthening the powers of his government, and he summoned the first officially sanctioned [[Parliaments of England]] (such as his [[Model Parliament]]). He [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquered Wales]] and attempted to use a succession dispute to gain control of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], though this developed into a costly and drawn-out military campaign.\n\nEdward I is also known for his policies first persecuting Jews, particularly the 1275 [[Statute of the Jewry]]. This banned Jews from their previous role in making loans, and demanded that they work as merchants, farmers, craftsmen or soldiers. This was unrealistic, and failed.<ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2006|pp=112\u2013139}}</ref> Edward's solution was to [[History of the Jews in England (1066\u20131290)#Edward I and the Expulsion|expel Jews from England]].<ref name=\"Hillaby 2013 104\u2013107\"/><ref name=\"Jacobs 1903\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2006|pp=140\u2013160}}</ref>\n\nHis son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], proved a disaster. A weak man who preferred to engage in activities like thatching and ditch-digging{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} rather than jousting, hunting, or the usual entertainments of kings, he spent most of his reign trying in vain to control the nobility, who in return showed continual hostility to him. Meanwhile, the Scottish leader [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]] began retaking all the territory conquered by Edward I. In 1314, the English army was disastrously defeated by the Scots at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]]. Edward also showered favours on his companion [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], a knight of humble birth. While it has been widely believed that Edward was a homosexual because of his closeness to Gaveston, there is no concrete evidence of this. The king's enemies, including his cousin [[Thomas of Lancaster]], captured and murdered Gaveston in 1312.\n\nEdward's downfall came in 1326 when his wife, [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]], travelled to her native France and, with her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], [[Edward II of England#Invasion by Isabella and Mortimer|invaded England]]. Despite their tiny force, they quickly rallied support for their cause. The king fled London, and his companion since Piers Gaveston's death, [[Hugh Despenser the younger|Hugh Despenser]], was publicly tried and executed. Edward was captured, charged with breaking his coronation oath, [[Edward II of England#Abdication|deposed]] and imprisoned in Gloucestershire until he was murdered some time in the autumn of 1327, presumably by agents of Isabella and Mortimer.\n\nMillions of people in northern Europe died in the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317]].<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R688at3KskQC&pg=PA49&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Story of Ireland]''\".

At age 17, he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the ''de facto'' ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] reigned 1327\u20131377, restored royal authority and went on to transform England into the most efficient military power in Europe. His reign saw vital developments in legislature and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament\u2014as well as the ravages of the [[Black Death]]. After defeating, but not subjugating, the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1338, but his claim was denied due to the [[Salic law]]. This started what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]].<ref>Edward first styled himself \"King of France\" in 1337, though he did not officially assume the title until 1340; Prestwich (2005), pp. 307\u20138.</ref> Following some initial setbacks, the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] led to the highly favourable [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]]. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.\n\nFor many years, trouble had been brewing with [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]\u2014a Spanish kingdom whose navy had taken to raiding English merchant ships in the [[English Channel|Channel]]. Edward won a [[Battle of Winchelsea|major naval victory]] against a Castilian fleet off [[Winchelsea]] in 1350. Although the Castilian crossbowmen killed many of the enemy,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=R. G. |title=1001 Battles That Changed the Course of History |date=2017 |page=195}}</ref> the English gradually got the better of the encounter. In spite of Edward's success, however, Winchelsea was only a flash in a conflict that raged between the English and the Spanish for over 200 years,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lavery |first1=Brian |title=The Conquest of the Ocean |date=2013 |page=61}}</ref> coming to a head with the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=English History |volume=9 |page=535 |first=Samuel Rawson |last=Gardiner |authorlink=Samuel Rawson Gardiner}}</ref>\n\nIn 1373, England signed an [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance with the Kingdom of Portugal]], which is claimed to be the oldest alliance in the world still in force.\n\nIn 1381, a [[Peasants' Revolt]] led by [[Wat Tyler]] spread across large parts of England. It was suppressed by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], with the death of 1500 rebels.\n\n===Black Death===\n\n{{main|Black Death in England}}\n[[The Black Death]], an epidemic of [[bubonic plague]] that spread all over Europe, arrived in England in 1348 and killed as much as a third to half the population. Military conflicts during this period were usually with domestic neighbours such as the Welsh, Irish and Scots, and included the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the French and their [[Scottish people|Scottish]] allies. Notable English victories in the [[Hundred Years' War]] included [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]]. The final defeat of the uprising led by the Welsh prince, [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], in 1412 by Prince Henry (who later became [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]) represents the last major armed attempt by the Welsh to throw off English rule.\n\n[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] gave land to powerful noble families, including many people of royal lineage. Because land was equivalent to power, these powerful men could try to claim the crown. The autocratic and arrogant methods of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] only served to alienate the nobility more, and his forceful dispossession in 1399 by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] increased the turmoil.\n\nHenry spent much of his reign defending himself against plots, rebellions and assassination attempts.\n{{House of Lancaster|henry4}}\nRebellions continued throughout the first ten years of Henry's reign, including the revolt of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], who declared himself [[Prince of Wales]] in 1400, and the rebellion of [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]]. The king's success in putting down these rebellions was due partly to the military ability of his eldest son, [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]],<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=English History |volume=9 |page=511 |first=Charles |last=Oman |authorlink=Charles Oman}}</ref> who later became king (though the son managed to seize much effective power from his father in 1410).\n\n==15th century \u2013 Henry V and the Wars of the Roses==\n{{further|Lancastrian War|Wars of the Roses|Great Slump (15th century)}}\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] succeeded to the throne in 1413. He renewed hostilities with France and began a set of military campaigns which are considered a new phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]], referred to as the [[Lancastrian War]]. He won several notable victories over the French, including at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. In the [[Treaty of Troyes]], Henry V was given the power to succeed the current ruler of France, [[Charles VI of France]]. The Treaty also provided that he would marry Charles VI's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]]. They married in 1421. Henry died of dysentery in 1422, leaving a number of unfulfilled plans, including his plan to take over as King of France and to lead a crusade to retake Jerusalem from the Muslims.\n\nHenry V's son, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], became king in 1422 as an infant. His reign was marked by constant turmoil due to his political weaknesses. While he was growing up, England was ruled by the [[Regency government, 1422\u20131437|Regency government]].\n\nThe Regency Council tried to install Henry VI as the King of France, as provided by the Treaty of Troyes signed by his father, and led English forces to take over areas of France. It appeared they might succeed due to the poor political position of the son of Charles VI, who had claimed to be the rightful king as [[Charles VII of France]]. However, in 1429, [[Joan of Arc]] began a military effort to prevent the English from gaining control of France. The French forces regained control of French territory.\n\nIn 1437, Henry VI came of age and began to actively rule as king. To forge peace, he married French noblewoman [[Margaret of Anjou]] in 1445, as provided in the [[Treaty of Tours]]. Hostilities with France resumed in 1449. When England lost the [[Hundred Years' War]] in August 1453, Henry fell into mental breakdown until Christmas 1454.\n\nHe could not control the feuding nobles, and civil war began called [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131485). Although fighting was very sporadic and small, there was a general breakdown in the power of the Crown. The royal court and Parliament moved to Coventry, in the Lancastrian heartlands, which thus became the capital of England until 1461. Henry's cousin deposed Henry in 1461 to become [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. He defeated the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]] at the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]]. He was briefly expelled from the throne in 1470\u20131471 when [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], brought Henry back to power. Six months later, Edward defeated and killed Warwick in battle and reclaimed the throne. Henry was imprisoned in the Tower of London and died there. Edward went a little way to restoring the power of the Crown.\n\nEdward died in 1483, only 40 years old. His eldest son and heir [[Edward V]], aged 13, could not succeed him because the king's brother [[Richard III of England|Richard III, Duke of Gloucester]] declared his marriage bigamous, making all his children illegitimate. Richard III declared himself king. Edward V and his 10-year-old brother Richard were imprisoned in the Tower of London and were not seen again. It was widely believed that Richard III had them murdered and he was reviled as a treacherous fiend, which limited his ability to govern during his brief reign. In summer 1485, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], the last Lancastrian male, landed in England from exile in France. He defeated and killed Richard III at [[Bosworth Field]] on 22 August and became king Henry VII.\n\n{{See also|Black Death in England|English historians in the Middle Ages|List of English chronicles|Bayeux Tapestry}}\n\n==Tudor England==\n{{main|Tudor period}}\n{{further|Early Modern Britain|English Renaissance}}\n\n===Henry VII===\nWith [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s accession to the throne in 1485, the Wars of the Roses came to an end, and Tudors would continue to rule England for 118 years. Traditionally, the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] is considered to mark the end of the Middle Ages in England, although Henry did not introduce any new concept of monarchy, and for most of his reign his hold on power was tenuous. He claimed the throne by conquest and God's judgement in battle. Parliament quickly recognized him as king, but the Yorkists were far from defeated. Nonetheless, he married Edward IV's eldest daughter Elizabeth in January 1486, thereby uniting the houses of York and Lancaster.\n\nMost of the European rulers did not believe Henry would survive long, and were thus willing to shelter claimants against him. The first plot against him was the [[Stafford and Lovell Rebellion]] of 1486, which presented no serious threat. But Richard III's nephew [[John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln]], hatched another attempt the following year. Using a peasant boy named [[Lambert Simnel]], who posed as [[Edward, Earl of Warwick]] (the real Warwick was locked up in the Tower of London), he led an army of 2,000 German mercenaries paid for by [[Margaret of York|Margaret of Burgundy]] into England. They were defeated and de la Pole was killed at the difficult [[Battle of Stoke]], where the loyalty of some of the royal troops to Henry was questionable. The king, realizing that Simnel was a dupe, employed him in the royal kitchen.\n\nA more serious threat was [[Perkin Warbeck]], a Flemish youth who posed as Edward IV's son Richard. Again with support from Margaret of Burgundy, he invaded England four times from 1495\u20131497 before he was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Both Warbeck and the Earl of Warwick were dangerous even in captivity, and Henry executed them in 1499 before Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain would allow their daughter Catherine to come to England and marry his son Arthur.\n\nIn 1497, Henry defeated Cornish rebels marching on London. The rest of his reign was relatively peaceful, despite worries about succession after the death of his wife [[Elizabeth of York]] in 1503.\n\nHenry VII's foreign policy was peaceful. He had made an alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], but in 1493, when they went to war with France, England was dragged into the conflict. Impoverished and his hold on power insecure, Henry had no desire for war. He quickly reached an understanding with the French and renounced all claims to their territory except the port of Calais, realizing also that he could not stop them from incorporating the Duchy of Brittany. In return, the French agreed to recognize him as king and stop sheltering pretenders. Shortly afterwards, they became preoccupied with adventures in Italy. Henry also reached an understanding with Scotland, agreeing to marry his daughter Margaret to that country's king [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]].\n\nUpon becoming king, Henry inherited a government severely weakened and degraded by the Wars of the Roses. The treasury was empty, having been drained by Edward IV's Woodville in-laws after his death. Through a tight fiscal policy and sometimes ruthless tax collection and confiscations, Henry refilled the treasury by the time of his death. He also effectively rebuilt the machinery of government.\n\nIn 1501, the king's son [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], having married [[Catherine of Aragon]], died of illness at age 15, leaving his younger brother [[Henry, Duke of York]] as heir. When the king himself died in 1509, the position of the Tudors was secure at last, and his son succeeded him unopposed.\n\n===Henry VIII===\n\n[[File:After Hans Holbein the Younger - Portrait of Henry VIII - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]]]\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] began his reign with much optimism. The handsome, athletic young king stood in sharp contrast to his wary, miserly father. Henry's lavish court quickly drained the treasury of the fortune he inherited. He married the widowed [[Catherine of Aragon]], and they had several children, but none survived infancy except a daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]].\n\nIn 1512, the young king started a [[War of the League of Cambrai|war in France]]. Although England was an ally of Spain, one of France's principal enemies, the war was mostly about Henry's desire for personal glory, despite his sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]] being married to the French king [[Louis XII]]. The war accomplished little. The English army suffered badly from disease, and Henry was not even present at the one notable victory, the [[Battle of the Spurs]]. Meanwhile, [[James IV of Scotland]] (despite being Henry's other brother-in-law), activated his alliance with the French and declared war on England. While Henry was dallying in France, Catherine, who was serving as regent in his absence, and his advisers were left to deal with this threat. At the [[Battle of Flodden]] on 9 September 1513, the Scots were completely defeated. James and most of the Scottish nobles were killed. When Henry returned from France, he was given credit for the victory.\n\nEventually, Catherine was no longer able to have any more children. The king became increasingly nervous about the possibility of his daughter Mary inheriting the throne, as England's one experience with a female sovereign, Matilda in the 12th century, had been a catastrophe. He eventually decided that it was necessary to divorce Catherine and find a new queen. To persuade the Church to allow this, Henry cited the passage in the [[Book of Leviticus]]: \"If a man taketh his brother's wife, he hath committed adultery; they shall be childless\". However, Catherine insisted that she and Arthur never consummated their brief marriage and that the prohibition did not apply here. The timing of Henry's case was very unfortunate; it was 1527 and the Pope had been imprisoned by emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Catherine's nephew and the most powerful man in Europe, for siding with his archenemy [[Francis I of France]]. Because he could not divorce in these circumstances, Henry seceded from the Church, in what became known as the [[English Reformation]].\n\nThe newly established [[Church of England]] amounted to little more than the existing Catholic Church, but led by the king rather than the Pope. It took a number of years for the separation from Rome to be completed, and many were executed for resisting the king's religious policies.\n\nIn 1530, Catherine was banished from court and spent the rest of her life (until her death in 1536) alone in an isolated manor home, barred from contact with Mary. Secret correspondence continued thanks to her ladies-in-waiting. Their marriage was declared invalid, making Mary an illegitimate child. Henry married [[Anne Boleyn]] secretly in January 1533, just as his divorce from Catherine was finalised. They had a second, public wedding. Anne soon became pregnant and may have already been when they wed. But on 7 September 1533, she gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth. The king was devastated at his failure to obtain a son after all the effort it had taken to remarry. Gradually, he came to develop a disliking of his new queen for her strange behaviour. In 1536, when Anne was pregnant again, Henry was badly injured in a jousting accident. Shaken by this, the queen gave birth prematurely to a stillborn boy. By now, the king was convinced that his marriage was hexed, and having already found a new queen, Jane Seymour, he put Anne in the Tower of London on charges of witchcraft. Afterwards, she was beheaded along with five men (her brother included) accused of adultery with her. The marriage was then declared invalid, so that Elizabeth, just like her half sister, became a bastard.\n\nHenry immediately married [[Jane Seymour]], who became pregnant almost as quickly. On 12 October 1537, she gave birth to a healthy boy, Edward, which was greeted with huge celebrations. However, the queen died of [[puerperal sepsis]] ten days later. Henry genuinely mourned her death, and at his own passing nine years later, he was buried next to her.\n\nThe king married a fourth time in 1540, to the German [[Anne of Cleves]] for a political alliance with her Protestant brother, the [[Duke of Cleves]]. He also hoped to obtain another son in case something should happen to Edward. Anne proved a dull, unattractive woman and Henry did not consummate the marriage. He quickly divorced her, and she remained in England as a kind of adopted sister to him. He married again, to a 19-year-old named [[Catherine Howard]]. But when it became known that she was neither a virgin at the wedding, nor a faithful wife afterwards, she ended up on the scaffold and the marriage declared invalid. His sixth and last marriage was to [[Catherine Parr]], who was more his nursemaid than anything else, as his health was failing since his jousting accident in 1536.\n\nIn 1542, the king started a new campaign in France, but unlike in 1512, he only managed with great difficulty. He only conquered the city of Boulogne, which France retook in 1549. Scotland also declared war and at [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]] was again totally defeated.\n\nHenry's paranoia and suspicion worsened in his last years. The number of executions during his 38-year reign numbered tens of thousands. His domestic policies had strengthened royal authority to the detriment of the aristocracy, and led to a safer realm, but his foreign policy adventures did not increase England's prestige abroad and wrecked royal finances and the national economy, and embittered the Irish.<ref name=twsBucholz1> Robert Bucholz, Newton Key, via Google Books, John Wiley & Sons Publishers, 31 December 2019 - History - 472 pages, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6275-3}}, [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Early_Modern_England_1485_1714/KfjYvfVOYwoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=wreck+royal+finances&pg=PA101&printsec=frontcover Early Modern England 1485-1714: A Narrative History], retrieved 27 March 2020, see pages 102, 104, 107, 122-3</ref> He died in January 1547 at age 55 and was succeeded by his son, Edward VI.\n\n===Edward VI and Mary I===\n[[File:Circle of William Scrots Edward VI of England.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Edward VI]], c. 1550]]\n\nAlthough he showed piety and intelligence, [[Edward VI]] was only nine years old when he became king in 1547.<ref name=twsBucholz1/> His uncle, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] tampered with [[Will of Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's will]] and obtained [[letters patent]] giving him much of the power of a monarch by March 1547. He took the title of Protector. While some see him as a high-minded idealist, his stay in power culminated in a crisis in 1549 when many counties of the realm were up in protest. [[Kett's Rebellion]] in Norfolk and the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] simultaneously created a crisis while invasion from Scotland and France were feared. Somerset, disliked by the Regency Council for being autocratic, was removed from power by [[John Dudley, Earl of Warwick|John Dudley]], who is known as [[Lord President Northumberland]]. Northumberland proceeded to adopt the power for himself, but he was more conciliatory and the Council accepted him. During Edward's reign England changed from being a Catholic nation to a Protestant one, in schism from Rome.\n\nEdward showed great promise but fell violently ill of [[tuberculosis]] in 1553 and died that August, two months before his 16th birthday.<ref name=twsBucholz1/>\n\nNorthumberland made plans to place [[Lady Jane Grey]] on the throne and marry her to his son, so that he could remain the power behind the throne. His plot failed in a matter of days, Jane Grey was beheaded, and [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (1516\u20131558) took the throne amidst popular demonstration in her favour in London, which contemporaries described as the largest show of affection for a Tudor monarch. Mary had never been expected to hold the throne, at least not since Edward was born. She was a devoted Catholic who believed that she could reverse the Reformation.<ref>Ann Weikel, \"Mary I (1516\u20131558)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', online edition, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18245, accessed 25 Aug 2011]</ref>\n\nReturning England to Catholicism led to the burnings of 274 Protestants, which are recorded especially in [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Book of Martyrs]]''. Mary then married her cousin [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], son of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], and King of Spain when Charles abdicated in 1556. The union was difficult because Mary was already in her late 30s and Philip was a Catholic and a foreigner, and so not very welcome in England. This wedding also provoked hostility from France, already at war with Spain and now fearing being encircled by the Habsburgs. Calais, the last English outpost on the Continent, was then taken by France. King Philip (1527\u20131598) had very little power, although he did protect Elizabeth. He was not popular in England, and spent little time there.<ref>Glyn Redworth, \"Philip (1527\u20131598)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', online edition, May 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22097, accessed 25 Aug 2011]</ref> Mary eventually became pregnant, or at least believed herself to be. In reality, she may have had [[uterine cancer]]. Her death in November 1558 was greeted with huge celebrations in the streets of London.\n\n===Elizabeth I===\n{{main|Elizabethan era}}\nAfter Mary I died in 1558, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] came to the throne. Her reign restored a sort of order to the realm after the turbulent reigns of Edward VI and Mary I. The religious issue which had divided the country since Henry VIII was in a way put to rest by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], which re-established the [[Church of England]]. Much of Elizabeth's success was in balancing the interests of the [[Puritan]]s and Catholics; historian Robert Bucholz paraphrasing historian Conrad Russell, suggested that the genius of the Church of England was that it \"thinks Protestant but looks Catholic.\"<ref name=twsBucholz1/> She managed to offend neither to a large extent, although she clamped down on Catholics towards the end of her reign as war with Catholic Spain loomed.<ref>J.

Guy, ''Tudor England'' (1990) [https://www.amazon.com/Tudor-England-John-Guy/dp/0192852132/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\nDespite the need for an heir, Elizabeth declined to marry, despite offers from a number of suitors across Europe, including the Swedish king [[Erik XIV]]. This created endless worries over her succession, especially in the 1560s when she nearly died of smallpox. It has been often rumoured that she had a number of lovers (including [[Francis Drake]]), but there is no hard evidence.\n\n[[File:Elizabeth I Rainbow Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]]]\n\nElizabeth maintained relative government stability. Apart from the [[Revolt of the Northern Earls]] in 1569, she was effective in reducing the power of the old nobility and expanding the power of her government. Elizabeth's government did much to consolidate the work begun under [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] in the reign of Henry VIII, that is, expanding the role of the government and effecting common law and administration throughout England. During the reign of Elizabeth and shortly afterwards, the population grew significantly: from three million in 1564 to nearly five million in 1616.<ref>[http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-atoz/population ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523191332/http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-atoz/population |date=23 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe queen ran afoul of her cousin [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was a devoted Catholic and so was forced to abdicate her throne (Scotland had [[Scottish Reformation|recently become Protestant]]). She fled to England, where Elizabeth immediately had her arrested. Mary spent the next 19 years in confinement, but proved too dangerous to keep alive, as the Catholic powers in Europe considered her the legitimate ruler of England. She was eventually tried for treason, sentenced to death, and beheaded in February 1587.\n\n====Elizabethan era====\n[[File:Elizabeth I, Procession Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|The Procession Picture, c. 1600, showing Elizabeth I borne along by her courtiers.]]\n\nThe Elizabethan era was the epoch in English history of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]'s reign (1558\u20131603). Historians often depict it as the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] in English history. The symbol of [[Britannia]] was first used in 1572 and often thereafter to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over the hated Spanish foe. In terms of the entire century, [[John Guy (historian)|the historian John Guy]] (1988) argues that \"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]]\" than at any time in a thousand years.<ref>John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, p. 32 {{ISBN|0192852132}}</ref>\n\nThis \"golden age\"<ref>From the 1944 Clark lectures by [[C. S. Lewis]]; Lewis, ''English Literature in the Sixteenth Century'' (Oxford, 1954) p. 1, {{OCLC|256072}}</ref> represented the apogee of the [[English Renaissance]] and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]], as [[William Shakespeare]] and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the [[Protestant Reformation]] became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the [[Spanish Armada]] was repulsed. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.\n\nThe Elizabethan Age is viewed so highly largely because of the periods before and after. It was a brief period of largely internal peace after the battles between Catholics and Protestants during the [[English Reformation]] and before battles between [[Parliament of England|parliament]] and the monarchy of the 17th century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.\n\nEngland was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. [[Italian Renaissance]] had ended due to foreign domination of the peninsula. France was embroiled in religious battles until the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598. Also, the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent. Due to these reasons, the centuries long conflict with France was largely suspended for most of Elizabeth's reign. England during this period had a centralised, organised and effective government, largely due to the reforms of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] trade.\n\n[[File:Expedici\u00f3n de Francis Drake 1585-1586.jpg|thumb|Sir Francis Drake's voyage 1585\u201386]]\nIn 1585 worsening relations between [[Philip II of Spain]] and Elizabeth erupted into war. Elizabeth signed the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] with the Dutch and permitted [[Francis Drake]] to maraud in response to a Spanish embargo. Drake surprised Vigo, Spain, in October, then proceeded to the Caribbean and sacked Santo Domingo (the capital of Spain's American empire and the present-day capital of the Dominican Republic) and Cartagena (a large and wealthy port on the north coast of Colombia that was the center of the silver trade). Philip II tried to invade England with the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 but was famously defeated.\n\nThe Armada was not just a naval campaign. The build-up of land forces to resist a Spanish invasion has been described as an administrative feat of massive scope. A survey taken in November and December 1587 showed 130,000 men in the militia, of whom 44,000 were members of the trained bands, being drilled and led by experienced captains and sergeants. By May 1588 the London bands were drilling weekly. To give warning of the enemy's approach, beacons were built, manned twenty-four hours a day by four men. Once the beacons were lit, 72,000 men could be mobilised on the south coast, with another 46,000 protecting London. For the many Englishmen caught up in the Armada the experience must have been very profound and frightening.

Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs and only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France and Ireland. She risked war with Spain by supporting the \"[[Sea Dogs]]\", such as [[Walter Raleigh]], [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and Sir [[Francis Drake]], who preyed on Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|major war came with Spain, 1585\u20131603]]. When Spain tried to invade and conquer England it was a fiasco, and the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 associated Elizabeth's name with what is popularly viewed as one of the greatest victories in English history. Her enemies failed to combine and Elizabeth's foreign policy successfully navigated all the dangers.<ref>Charles Beem, ''The Foreign Relations of Elizabeth I'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Foreign-Relations-Elizabeth-Queenship-Power/dp/0230112145/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n===End of Tudor era===\nIn all, the [[Tudor period]] is seen as a decisive one which set up many important questions which would have to be answered in the next century and during the [[English Civil War]]. These were questions of the relative power of the monarch and Parliament and to what extent one should control the other. Some historians think that Thomas Cromwell affected a \"Tudor Revolution\" in government, and it is certain that Parliament became more important during his chancellorship. Other historians argue that the \"Tudor Revolution\" extended to the end of Elizabeth's reign, when the work was all consolidated. Although the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] declined after Elizabeth's death, it was very effective while she was alive.\n\nElizabeth died in 1603 at the age of 69.\n\n==17th century==\n{{main|17th century England}}\n\n=== Union of the Crowns ===\n\n[[File:JamesIEngland.jpg|thumb|[[King James I]] of England]]\n\nWhen Elizabeth died, her closest male Protestant relative was the [[King of Scots]], [[King James VI of Scotland|James VI]], of the [[House of Stuart]], who became [[James I of England|King James I of England]] in a [[Union of the Crowns]], called James I & VI. He was the first monarch to rule the entire island of Britain, but the countries remained separate politically. Upon taking power, James made peace with Spain, and for the first half of the 17th century, England remained largely inactive in European politics. Several assassination attempts were made on James, notably the [[Main Plot]] and [[Bye Plot]]s of 1603, and most famously, on 5 November 1605, the [[Gunpowder Plot]], by a group of Catholic conspirators, led by [[Robert Catesby]], which caused more antipathy in England towards Catholicism.\n\n===Colonies===\n{{further|English overseas possessions}}\n\nIn 1607 England built an [[Jamestown, Virginia|establishment at Jamestown]]. This was the beginning of colonialism by England in North America. Many English settled then in North America for religious or economic reasons. Approximately 70% of English immigrants to North America who came between 1630\u20131660 were [[indentured servant]]s. By 1700, [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] planters transported about 100,000 indentured servants,<ref>\"[https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-03.htm Africans, Slavery, and Race]\".

The defeat of the Royalist army by the [[New Model Army]] of Parliament at the [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645 effectively destroyed the king's forces. Charles surrendered to the Scottish army at Newark. He was eventually handed over to the English Parliament in early 1647. He escaped, and the [[Second English Civil War]] began, but the New Model Army quickly secured the country. The capture and trial of Charles led to the [[execution of Charles I]] in January 1649 at [[Whitehall]] Gate in London, making England a [[republic]]. This shocked the rest of Europe. The king argued to the end that only God could judge him. The trial and execution were a precursor of sorts to the beheading of [[Louis XVI]] 145 years later.\n\nThe New Model Army, commanded by [[Oliver Cromwell]], then scored decisive victories against Royalist armies in Ireland and Scotland. Cromwell was given the title [[Lord Protector]] in 1653, making him 'king in all but name' to his critics. After he died in 1658, his son [[Richard Cromwell]] succeeded him in the office but he was forced to abdicate within a year. For a while it seemed as if a new civil war would begin as the New Model Army split into factions. Troops stationed in Scotland under the command of [[George Monck]] eventually marched on London to restore order.\n\nAccording to [[Derek Hirst]], outside of politics and religion, the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy characterized by growth in manufacturing, the elaboration of financial and credit instruments, and the commercialization Of communication. The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.<ref>[[Derek Hirst]], \"Locating the 1650s in England's seventeenth century\" ''History'' (1996) 81#263 pp 359-83 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24423269 online]</ref>\n\n===Restoration of the monarchy===\n\n[[File:Charles II by John Michael Wright.jpg|thumb| [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] ]]\n[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|The Great Fire London, 1666.]]\n\nThe monarchy was restored in 1660, with King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] returning to London. However, the power of the crown was less than before the Civil War. By the 18th century England rivaled the Netherlands as one of the freest countries in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sandifer |first1=Preston |title=Perspectives on 17th Century West European History |date=2011 |publisher=McNash |location=New York |page=1229}}</ref>\n\nIn 1665, London was swept by the [[Great Plague of London|plague]], and in 1666 by the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] for 5 days which destroyed about 15,000 buildings.\n\n===Glorious Revolution===\nIn 1680, the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion crisis]] consisted of attempts to prevent accession of James, heir to Charles II, because he was Catholic. After Charles II died in 1685 and his [[James II of England|James II & VII]] was crowned, various factions pressed for his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband [[William III of England|Prince William III of Orange]] to replace him in what became known as the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\nIn November 1688, William [[William III of England#Invasion of England|invaded England]] and succeeded in being crowned. James tried to retake the throne in the [[Williamite War]], but was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690.\n\nIn December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], was passed.<ref name=vdk114>Van der Kiste, 114\u2013115</ref> The Bill, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier [[Declaration of Right, 1689|Declaration of Right]], established restrictions on the [[royal prerogative]]. For example, the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive [[bail]] or inflict cruel and unusual punishments.<ref name=\"davies\">[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''The Isles: A History'' (1999) {{ISBN|0-19-513442-7}}, p.614.</ref> William was opposed to such constraints, but chose not conflict with Parliament and agreed to the statute.<ref>Troost, 212\u2013214</ref>\n\nIn parts of Scotland and Ireland, Catholics loyal to James remained determined to see him restored to the throne, and staged a series of bloody uprisings. As a result, any failure to pledge loyalty to the victorious King William was severely dealt with. The most infamous example of this policy was the [[Massacre of Glencoe]] in 1692. [[Jacobite rebellions]] continued into the mid-18th century until the son of the last Catholic claimant to the throne, [[Old Pretender|James III & VIII]], mounted a [[Jacobite rising of 1745|final campaign in 1745]]. The Jacobite forces of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles Edward Stuart]], the \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\" of legend, were defeated at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746.\n\n==Formation of the United Kingdom==\nThe [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] between the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] were a pair of [[Act of Parliament|Parliamentary Acts]] passed by both parliaments in 1707, which dissolved them in order to form a [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] governed by a unified [[Parliament of Great Britain]] according to the [[Treaty of Union]]. The Acts joined the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (previously separate [[sovereign state|state]]s, with separate legislatures but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]], starting with James I of England (also James VI of Scotland)) into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/ Welcome] parliament.uk. Retrieved 7 October 2008.</ref>\n\nThe two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that the idea had the will of both political establishments behind them, albeit for rather different reasons.\n\nThe Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scots Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London, the home of the English Parliament.<ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 3</ref> Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, historian [[Simon Schama]] said \"What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 22 May 2001 |number=10 |minutes=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1714 ended the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], the last monarch of the [[House of Stuart]].

Economies of scale and increased output per worker allowed steam-based factories to undercut production of traditional cottage industries. Much of the agricultural workforce was uprooted from the countryside and moved into large urban centres of production. The consequent overcrowding into areas with little supporting infrastructure saw dramatic increases in mortality, crime, and social deprivation. (Many Sunday schools for pre-working age children (5 or 6) had funeral clubs to pay for each other's funeral arrangements.) The process of industrialization threatened many livelihoods, which prompted some to sabotage factories. These saboteurs were known as \"[[Luddism|Luddites]]\".\n\n===Local governance===\n{{further|History of local government in England}}\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 009 - Billingsgate Market (tone).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Billingsgate Fish Market]] in the early 19th century]]\n[[File:Louise Rayner Chester Eastgate Street.jpg|thumb|[[Chester]], c. 1880]]\nThe [[Local Government Act 1888]] was the first systematic attempt to impose a standardised system of local government in England. The system was based on the existing counties (today known as the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], since the major boundary changes of 1974). Later, the [[Local Government Act 1894]] created a second tier of local government. All administrative counties and county boroughs were divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration.\n\nDuring the 1800s, the need for local administration greatly increased, prompting piecemeal adjustments. The sanitary districts and parish councils had legal status, but were not part of the mechanism of government. They were run by volunteers; often no-one could be held responsible for the failure to undertake the required duties. Furthermore, the increased \"county business\" could not be handled by the [[Quarter Sessions]], nor was this appropriate. Finally, there was a desire to see local administration performed by elected officials, as in the reformed municipal boroughs. By 1888, these shortcomings were clear, and the [[Local Government Act 1888|Local Government Act]] was the first systematic attempt to create a standardised system of local government in England.\n\nThe system was based on the existing counties (now known as the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], since the major boundary changes of 1974). The counties themselves had had some boundary changes in the preceding 50 years, mainly to remove [[Historic counties of England#Detached parts|enclaves and exclaves]]. The act called for the creation of statutory counties, based on the ancient/historic counties, but completely corrected for enclaves and exclaves, and adjusted so that each settlement was completely within one county. These statutory counties were to be used for non-administrative functions: ''\"[[high sheriff|sheriff]], [[lord lieutenant|lieutenant]], [[custos rotulorum]], justices, militia, coroner, or other\"''. With the advent of elected councils, the offices of lord lieutenant and sheriff became largely ceremonial.\n\nThe statutory counties formed the basis for the so-called 'administrative counties'. However, it was felt that large cities and primarily rural areas in the same county could not be well administered by the same body. Thus 59 \"counties in themselves\", or 'county boroughs', were created to administer the urban centres of England. These were part of the statutory counties, but not part of the administrative counties.\n\n[[Local Government Act 1894|In 1894, the Local Government Act]] created a second tier of local government. Henceforth, all administrative counties and county boroughs would be divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration. The municipal boroughs reformed after 1835 were brought into this system as special cases of urban districts. The urban and rural districts were based on, and incorporated the [[sanitary district]]s which created in 1875 (with adjustments, so that districts did not overlap two counties).\n\nThe Act also provided for the establishment of [[civil parishes]]. The 1894 Act formed an official system of civil parishes, separated from the ecclesiastical parishes, to carry on some of these responsibilities (others being transferred to the district/county councils). However, the civil parishes were not a complete third-tier of local government. Instead, they were 'community councils' for smaller, rural settlements, which did not have a local government district to themselves. Where urban parish councils had previously existed, they were absorbed into the new urban districts.\n\n==20th and 21st centuries==\n\n{{Main|Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)|Political history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)}}\n\nA prolonged agricultural depression in Britain at the end of the 19th century, together with the introduction in the 20th century of increasingly heavy levels of taxation on inherited wealth, put an end to agricultural land as the primary source of wealth for the upper classes. Many estates were sold or broken up, and this trend was accelerated by the introduction of protection for agricultural tenancies, encouraging outright sales, from the mid-20th century.\n\n=== General history and political issues ===\n[[File:Ve Day Celebrations in London, England, UK, 8 May 1945 D24586.jpg|thumb|[[Victory in Europe Day]] celebrations in London, 8 May 1945]]\nFollowing years of political and military agitation for 'Home Rule' for Ireland, the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 established the [[Irish Free State]] (now the [[Republic of Ireland]]) as a separate state, leaving [[Northern Ireland]] as part of the United Kingdom. The official name of the UK thus became \"The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]\".\n\nEngland, as part of the UK, joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973, which became the [[European Union]] in 1993.\n\nThere is a movement in England to create a [[devolved English Parliament]]. This would give England a local Parliament like those already functioning for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. This issue is referred to as the [[West Lothian question]].\n\n===Political history and local government===\n{{details|History of local government in England}}\n\nA [[Local Government Commission for England (1958\u20131967)|Local Government Commission]] was wound up in 1966, and replaced with a Royal Commission (known as the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report|Redcliffe-Maud commission]]). In 1969 it recommended a system of single-tier [[unitary authorities]] for the whole of England, apart from three metropolitan areas of [[Merseyside]], [[Greater Manchester|Selnec]] (Greater Manchester) and [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] ([[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]]), which were to have both a metropolitan council and district councils. This report was accepted by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of the time despite considerable opposition, but the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|June 1970 general election]], and on a manifesto that committed them to a two-tier structure.\n\nThe reforms arising from the [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Act of 1972]] resulted in the most uniform and simplified system of local government which has been used in England. They effectively wiped away everything that had gone before, and built an administrative system from scratch. All previous administrative districts \u2013 statutory counties, administrative counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs, counties corporate, civil parishes \u2013 were abolished.\n\nThe aim of the act was to establish a uniform two tier system across the country. Onto the blank canvas, new counties were created to cover the entire country; many of these were obviously based on the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], but there were some major changes, especially in the north.\n\nThis uniform two-tier system lasted only 12 years. In 1986, the metropolitan county councils and Greater London were abolished. This restored autonomy (in effect the old county borough status) to the metropolitan and London boroughs. The Local Government Act (1992) established a commission ([[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]]) to examine the issues, and make recommendations on where unitary authorities should be established. It was considered too expensive to make the system entirely unitary, and also there would doubtlessly be cases where the two-tier system functioned well. The commission recommended that many counties be moved to completely unitary systems; that some cities become unitary authorities, but that the remainder of their parent counties remain two-tier; and that in some counties the ''status quo'' should remain.\n\nThe [[rate-capping rebellion]] was a campaign within English local councils in 1985 which aimed to force the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] to withdraw powers to restrict the spending of councils. The campaign's tactic was that councils whose budgets were restricted would refuse to set any budget at all for the financial year 1985\u201386, requiring the Government to intervene directly in providing local services, or to concede. However, all 15 councils which initially refused to set a rate eventually did so, and the campaign failed to change Government policy. Powers to restrict council budgets have remained in place ever since.\n\nIn 1997, the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997|Lieutenancies Act]] was passed. This firmly separated all local authority areas (whether unitary or two-tier), from the geographical concept of a county as high level spatial unit. The lieutenancies it established became known as [[ceremonial counties]], since they were no longer administrative divisions. The counties represent a compromise between the [[historic counties of England|historic counties]] and the counties established in 1974.\n\nWhile the 1997 Labour government devolved power to [[Welsh Assembly|Wales]], [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], it refused to create a devolved Assembly or [[Devolved English Parliament|parliament for England]], planning instead to introduce eight regional assemblies around England to devolve power to the regions. In the event, only a [[London Assembly]] (and directly elected [[Mayor]]) was established. Rejection in a referendum of a proposed North-East Assembly in 2004 effectively scrapped those plans. A pre-condition of having a regional assembly was for the whole area to move to unitary authority status. Since the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] the government has floated the idea of voluntary mergers of local councils, avoiding a costly reorganisation but achieving desired reform.

The Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is one of the most passionate rivalries, especially in men's [[college basketball]]. It is considered one of the most intense rivalries in the NCAA. The intensity of the rivalry is captivated by the proximity of the two schools and the state of Kentucky's interest in college sports (no pro-affiliated sports teams play in the state of Kentucky).\n\n==Men's basketball==\n{{Main|Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals men's basketball}}\n{{Infobox sports rivalry\n| wide                  = yes\n| name                  = Kentucky\u2013Louisville men's basketball rivalry\n| image                 = \n| image_size            = \n| caption               = \n| team1                 = Kentucky Wildcats\n| team1logo             = Kentucky Wildcats logo.svg\n| team2                 = Louisville Cardinals\n| team2logo             = Louisville Cardinals wordmark.svg\n| sport                 = Basketball\n| firstmeeting          = February 15, 1913<br />Kentucky 34, Louisville 10\n| mostrecent            = December 28, 2019<br />Kentucky 78, Louisville 70\n| nextmeeting           = 2020-21 Season - Louisville, KY<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://watchstadium.com/future-college-basketball-non-conference-schedules-for-2020-and-beyond-11-20-2019/|title=Future College Basketball Non-Conference Schedules for 2020 and Beyond|last=Wittry|first=Andy|website=Watch Stadium|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n| total                 = 52\n| series                = Kentucky leads, 37\u201316 Regular season and 2 NCAA\n| largestvictory        = Kentucky: 34 points (1948)<br />Louisville: 22 points (1988)\n| longeststreak         = \n| longestunbeatenstreak = \n| currentstreak         = Kentucky, 3 (2017\u2013present)\n| currentunbeatenstreak = \n| trophy                = \n| trophy series         = \n| stadiums              =  \n}}\n\nThe Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry has been ranked the 2nd best rivalry in college basketball by Bleacher Report and 3rd best rivalry in all of college sports by [[List of members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]] contributor [[Dick Vitale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/dickvitale/story/_/id/7561633/dick-vitale-picks-best-rivalries-college-sports|title=Dick Vitale picks the best rivalries in college sports|publisher=ESPN}}</ref> Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983. The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 NCAA Tournament]].  Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\n\nMuch like the [[Iron Bowl]], the Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years.  Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in [[NCAA]] men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|winningest program]]s in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Men's Basketball and Louisville #26.  Kentucky has eight national championships and Louisville three, although one was later vacated by the NCAA.  Both schools also sit in the top ten of men's basketball teams that have had athletes to be picked in the first round of the NBA draft. Kentucky has had 46 players selected in the first round, while Louisville has had 24.\n\n===History===\nThe rivalry was fueled when [[Rick Pitino]] was hired as Louisville's head men's basketball coach in 2001. He served in that same role with Kentucky from 1989 to 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/22/sports/college-basketball-louisville-hires-pitino-to-spice-a-rivalry.html|title=Louisville Hires Pitino To Spice A Rivalry|date=March 22, 2001|work=The New York Times}}</ref> In the time that Rick Pitino was the head coach at Louisville from 2001 to 2017, Kentucky has won 12 of its contests and Louisville has won 6 of its contests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2018/12/27/louisville-kentucky-rivalry-every-basketball-game-score/2416024002/|title=See the scores of every Louisville-Kentucky basketball game in history|last=Lerner|first=Danielle|website=The Courier-Journal|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> Kentucky leads the all-time series with Louisville 37-16, and Kentucky leads the modern series 28-13.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/Statistics/Louisville.html|title = Kentucky's Record versus Louisville|publisher=Big Blue History|accessdate = September 16, 2007}}</ref>  In six tournament meetings as of 2014, Kentucky leads the series four games to two with their most recent win coming in the 2014 sweet sixteen 74-69.

Kentucky and Louisville first played each other in football in 1912. Kentucky dominated six meetings between the teams from 1912 until 1924, holding Louisville scoreless in all six games, after which the teams stopped playing. In 1994, with former Kentucky player Howard Schnellenberger coaching Louisville, the series was revived after a 70-year dormancy.  Kentucky leads the series currently 17\u201315 but Louisville leads the Governors Cup series 15-11.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2006 the annual matchup was the first game of the season for Kentucky and was the first game for all but two of those years for Louisville.  In 2007 the game was moved to the third game of the season when played in Lexington but remained the first game when played in Louisville. Starting in 2014, which marked Louisville's inaugural season in the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Governor's Cup became the last game of the regular season for both teams to coincide with several other ACC-SEC same-state rivalries.\n\nThe 2019 game was won by Kentucky 45-13.  Kentucky wide receiver Lynn Bowden Jr. was named MVP of the showdown.\n\n== Other sports ==\n\n* '''Women's basketball''': Kentucky leads the series 34\u201320 as of the 2017\u201318 season.

The intensity of the rivalry is captivated by the proximity of the two schools and the state of Kentucky's interest in college sports (no pro-affiliated sports teams play in the state of Kentucky).\n\n==Men's basketball==\n{{Main|Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals men's basketball}}\n{{Infobox sports rivalry\n| wide                  = yes\n| name                  = Kentucky\u2013Louisville men's basketball rivalry\n| image                 = \n| image_size            = \n| caption               = \n| team1                 = Kentucky Wildcats\n| team1logo             = Kentucky Wildcats logo.svg\n| team2                 = Louisville Cardinals\n| team2logo             = Louisville Cardinals wordmark.svg\n| sport                 = Basketball\n| firstmeeting          = February 15, 1913<br />Kentucky 34, Louisville 10\n| mostrecent            = December 28, 2019<br />Kentucky 78, Louisville 70\n| nextmeeting           = 2020-21 Season - Louisville, KY<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://watchstadium.com/future-college-basketball-non-conference-schedules-for-2020-and-beyond-11-20-2019/|title=Future College Basketball Non-Conference Schedules for 2020 and Beyond|last=Wittry|first=Andy|website=Watch Stadium|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n| total                 = 52\n| series                = Kentucky leads, 37\u201316 Regular season and 2 NCAA\n| largestvictory        = Kentucky: 34 points (1948)<br />Louisville: 22 points (1988)\n| longeststreak         = \n| longestunbeatenstreak = \n| currentstreak         = Kentucky, 3 (2017\u2013present)\n| currentunbeatenstreak = \n| trophy                = \n| trophy series         = \n| stadiums              =  \n}}\n\nThe Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry has been ranked the 2nd best rivalry in college basketball by Bleacher Report and 3rd best rivalry in all of college sports by [[List of members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]] contributor [[Dick Vitale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/dickvitale/story/_/id/7561633/dick-vitale-picks-best-rivalries-college-sports|title=Dick Vitale picks the best rivalries in college sports|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983. The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 NCAA Tournament]].  Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\n\nMuch like the [[Iron Bowl]], the Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years.  Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in [[NCAA]] men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|winningest program]]s in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Men's Basketball and Louisville #26.  Kentucky has eight national championships and Louisville three, although one was later vacated by the NCAA.  Both schools also sit in the top ten of men's basketball teams that have had athletes to be picked in the first round of the NBA draft. Kentucky has had 46 players selected in the first round, while Louisville has had 24.\n\n===History===\nThe rivalry was fueled when [[Rick Pitino]] was hired as Louisville's head men's basketball coach in 2001. He served in that same role with Kentucky from 1989 to 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/22/sports/college-basketball-louisville-hires-pitino-to-spice-a-rivalry.html|title=Louisville Hires Pitino To Spice A Rivalry|date=March 22, 2001|work=The New York Times}}</ref> In the time that Rick Pitino was the head coach at Louisville from 2001 to 2017, Kentucky has won 12 of its contests and Louisville has won 6 of its contests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2018/12/27/louisville-kentucky-rivalry-every-basketball-game-score/2416024002/|title=See the scores of every Louisville-Kentucky basketball game in history|last=Lerner|first=Danielle|website=The Courier-Journal|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> Kentucky leads the all-time series with Louisville 37-16, and Kentucky leads the modern series 28-13.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/Statistics/Louisville.html|title = Kentucky's Record versus Louisville|publisher=Big Blue History|accessdate = September 16, 2007}}</ref>  In six tournament meetings as of 2014, Kentucky leads the series four games to two with their most recent win coming in the 2014 sweet sixteen 74-69. The teams met in the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2012 Final Four]], and Kentucky defeated Louisville with a score of 69-61 en route to the national title.

Kentucky and Louisville first played each other in football in 1912. Kentucky dominated six meetings between the teams from 1912 until 1924, holding Louisville scoreless in all six games, after which the teams stopped playing. In 1994, with former Kentucky player Howard Schnellenberger coaching Louisville, the series was revived after a 70-year dormancy.  Kentucky leads the series currently 17\u201315 but Louisville leads the Governors Cup series 15-11.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2006 the annual matchup was the first game of the season for Kentucky and was the first game for all but two of those years for Louisville.  In 2007 the game was moved to the third game of the season when played in Lexington but remained the first game when played in Louisville.
