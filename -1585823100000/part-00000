The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642\u20131646) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648\u20131649) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649\u20131651) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.\n\nThe outcome of the war was threefold: [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653) and then [[the Protectorate]] under the personal rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653\u20131658) and briefly his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] (1658\u20131659). This was particularly notable given that an English king had never been executed before. In England, the monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on Christian worship was ended, while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s consent, although the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was only legally established as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.{{sfn |EB staff |2016a}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"English Civil War\" appears most often in the singular, although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. These were not restricted to [[England]], as [[Wales]] was part of the Kingdom of England and affected accordingly. The conflicts also involved wars with Scotland and Ireland, and civil wars within them.\n\nThe wars spanning all three countries are known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the early 19th century, [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] referred to it as \"the Great Civil War\".<ref>Walter Scott, ''Waverley; or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since'' (1814), Chap. 2.</ref>\n\nUnlike other [[List of English civil wars|civil wars in England]], which focused on who should rule, these conflicts were more concerned with the manner in which the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland were governed. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']] called the series of conflicts the \"Great Rebellion\",{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}} while some historians \u2013 notably [[Marxist]]s such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] (1912\u20132003) \u2013 long favoured the term \"[[English Revolution]]\".<ref>{{harvnb |Hill |1972 |loc=for example}}.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nEach side had a geographical stronghold, such that minority elements were silenced or fled. The royalty's included the countryside, the shires, the cathedral city of Oxford, and the less economically developed areas of northern and western England. Parliament's spanned the industrial centres, ports, and economically advanced regions of southern and eastern England, including the remaining cathedral cities (except York, Chester, Worcester). Lacey Baldwin Smith says, \"the words ''populous, rich, and rebellious'' seemed to go hand in hand\".{{sfn |Smith|1983 |p=251}}{{sfn |Hughes |1985 |pp=236\u201363}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nMany officers and veteran soldiers had fought in European wars, notably the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Spanish and the Dutch, which began in 1568.{{sfn |Baker |1986|p=}}\n\nThe main battle tactic came to be known as [[pike and shot]] infantry. The two sides would line up opposite one another, with infantry brigades of [[musketeer]]s in the centre. These carried matchlock muskets, an inaccurate weapon which nevertheless could be lethal at a range of up to 300 yards. Musketeers would assemble three rows deep, the first kneeling, second crouching, and third standing, allowing all to fire a volley simultaneously.<ref name=\"Simkin\">{{cite web |author=John Simkin |title=The English Civil War \u2013 Tactics |orig-year=originally September 1997 |date= August 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015 |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/STUcivilwarMT.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational}}{{better source|date=April 2015}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2015}} At times, troops divided into two groups, allowing one to reload while the other fired.{{sfn |Burne |Young |1998 |p=}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}} Among the musketeers were pike men, carrying [[pike (weapon)|pikes]] of {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|18|ft|m|0}} long, whose main purpose was to protect the musketeers from cavalry charges.

Elizabeth had been succeeded by her [[Cousin chart|first cousin twice-removed]], [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]], as James I of England, creating the first [[Union of the Crowns|personal union of the Scottish and English kingdoms]].{{efn|Although the early 17th-century Stuart monarchs styled themselves King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, with the exception of the constitutional arrangements during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (see the [[Tender of Union]]), full union of the Scottish and English realms into a new realm of Great Britain did not occur until the passing of the [[Act of Union 1707]].}} As King of Scots, James had become accustomed to Scotland's weak parliamentary tradition since assuming control of the Scottish government in 1583, so that upon assuming power south of the border, the new King of England was affronted by the constraints the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] attempted to place on him in exchange for money. In spite of this, James's personal extravagance meant he was perennially short of money and had to resort to extra-parliamentary sources of income.\n\nThis extravagance was tempered by James's peaceful disposition, so that by the succession of his son Charles I in 1625 the two kingdoms had both experienced relative peace, internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles followed his father's dream in hoping to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a single kingdom.<ref>{{Harvnb |Croft |2003 |p=63}}.</ref> Many English Parliamentarians were suspicious of such a move, fearing that such a new kingdom might destroy old English traditions that had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as \"little gods on Earth\", chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the \"[[Divine Right of Kings]]\"), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification.<ref>{{Harvnb |McClelland |1996 |p=224}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charles I, painted by Van Dyck]]\n\n===Parliament in an English constitutional framework===\nAt the time, the Parliament of England did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government. Instead, it functioned as a temporary advisory committee and was summoned only if and when the monarch saw fit. Once summoned, a Parliament's continued existence was at the king's pleasure since it was subject to dissolution by him at any time.\n\nYet in spite of this limited role, Parliament had acquired over the centuries ''de facto'' powers of enough significance that monarchs could not simply ignore them indefinitely. For a monarch, Parliament's most indispensable power was its ability to raise tax revenues far in excess of all other sources of revenue at the Crown's disposal. By the 17th century, Parliament's tax-raising powers had come to be derived from the fact that the [[gentry]] was the only stratum of society with the ability and authority to collect and remit the most meaningful forms of taxation then available at the local level. So if the king wanted to ensure smooth revenue collection, he needed gentry co-operation. For all of the Crown's legal authority, its resources were limited by any modern standard to an extent that if the gentry refused to collect the king's taxes on a national scale, the Crown lacked a practical means of compelling them.\n\nFrom the thirteenth century, monarchs ordered the election of representatives to sit in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with most voters being the owners of property, although in some [[potwalloper]] boroughs every male householder could vote. When assembled along with the [[House of Lords]], these elected representatives formed a Parliament. So the concept of Parliaments allowed representatives of the property-owning class to meet, primarily, at least from the point of view of the monarch, to sanction whatever taxes the monarch wished to collect. In the process, the representatives could debate  and enact [[statute]]s, or [[act of parliament|acts]]. However, Parliament lacked the power to force its will upon the monarch; its only leverage was the threat of withholding the financial means required to implement his plans.{{sfn |Johnston |1901 |pp=83\u201386}}\n\n===Parliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right===\n[[File:Sir Peter Lely 001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], painted by [[Peter Lely]], 1660]]\nMany concerns were raised over Charles's marriage in 1625 to a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] French princess: [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]]. Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |pp=129\u201330}}.</ref>\n\nCharles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French [[Huguenots]], whom French royal troops held [[Siege of La Rochelle|besieged in La Rochelle]]. Such military support for Protestants on the Continent potentially alleviated concerns about the King's marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles's insistence on giving command of the English force to his unpopular royal favourite [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham]], undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the relief expedition proved a fiasco (1627),<ref>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |p=166}}.</ref> and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on [[Patronage|royal patronage]], opened [[impeachment]] proceedings against him.<ref name=Gregg-175>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |p=175}}.</ref> Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This saved Buckingham but confirmed the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.<ref name=Gregg-175/>\n\nHaving dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Hampden]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> and [[Edward Coke]].) The new Parliament drew up a [[Petition of Right]], which Charles accepted as a concession to obtain his subsidy.<ref name=\"Purkiss 2007 93\">{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=93}}.</ref> The Petition made reference to [[Magna Carta]],<ref>[[Petition of Right]] at III, VII.</ref> but did not grant him the right of [[tonnage and poundage]], which Charles had been collecting without Parliamentary authorisation since 1625.{{sfn |Sommerville |1992 |pp=65, 71, 80}} Several more active members of the opposition were imprisoned, which caused outrage;{{sfn |Sommerville |1992 |pp=65, 71, 80}} one, [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], subsequently died in prison and came to be seen as a martyr for the rights of Parliament.{{sfn |Russell |1998 |p=417}}\n\n===Personal rule===\nCharles I avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the \"[[personal rule of Charles I]]\", or the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\".<ref>{{Harvnb |Rosner |Theibault |2000 |p=103}}.</ref> During this period, Charles's policies were determined by his lack of money. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament, the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England's involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. However, that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown's finances.\n\nUnable to raise revenue without Parliament and unwilling to convene it, Charles resorted to other means. One was to revive conventions, often outdated. For example, a failure to attend and receive [[knighthood]] at Charles's coronation became a finable offence with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through [[ship money]], demanding in 1634\u20131636 that the inland English counties pay a tax for the [[Royal Navy]] to counter the threat of privateers and pirates in the English Channel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> Established law supported the policy of coastal counties and inland ports such as London paying ship money in times of need, but it had not been applied to inland counties before.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> Authorities had ignored it for centuries, and many saw it as yet another extra-Parliamentary, illegal tax,<ref name=Pipes-143>{{Harvnb |Pipes |1999 |p=143}}.</ref> which prompted some prominent men to refuse to pay it. Charles issued a writ against John Hampden for his failure to pay, and although five judges including Sir George Croke supported Hampden, seven judges found in favour of the King in 1638.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594\u20131643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> The fines imposed on people who refused to pay ship money and standing out against its illegality aroused widespread indignation.<ref name=Pipes-143/>\n\nDuring his \"Personal Rule\", Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures. He believed in [[High church|High Anglicanism]], a sacramental version of the [[Church of England]], theologically based upon [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]], a creed shared with his main political adviser, Archbishop [[William Laud]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=48}}.</ref> In 1633, Charles appointed Laud [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] tables with stone altars.<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=96}}.</ref> Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism; when they complained, he had them arrested. In 1637, [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]], and [[William Prynne]] had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud's views \u2014 a rare penalty for [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and one that aroused anger.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=201}}.</ref> Moreover, the Church authorities revived statutes from the time of Elizabeth I about church attendance and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican services.<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=173}}.</ref>\n\n===Rebellion in Scotland===\n{{Main|Bishops' War}}\nThe end of Charles's independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The [[Church of Scotland]], reluctantly [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] in structure, had independent traditions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=74}}.</ref> Charles wanted one uniform Church throughout Britain<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=83}}.</ref> and introduced a new, High Anglican version of the English [[Book of Common Prayer]] to Scotland in the middle of 1637. This was violently resisted. A riot broke out in Edinburgh,<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=75}}.</ref> which may have been started in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], according to legend, by [[Jenny Geddes]]. In February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the [[National Covenant]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=77}}.</ref> This document took the form of a \"loyal protest\", rejecting all innovations not first tested by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church.\n\nIn the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border to end the rebellion known as the [[Bishops' War]],<ref name=Purkiss-96>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=96}}.</ref> but after an inconclusive campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce: the [[Pacification of Berwick]]. This truce proved temporary, and a second war followed in mid-1640. A Scots army defeated Charles's forces in the north, then captured [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=97}}.</ref> Charles eventually agreed not to interfere in Scotland's religion and paid the Scots' war expenses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Recall of the English Parliament===\nCharles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland, but had insufficient funds to do so. He needed to seek money from a newly elected [[Short Parliament|English Parliament]] in 1640.<ref name=Coward-180>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=180}}.</ref> Its majority faction, led by [[John Pym]], used this appeal for money as a chance to discuss grievances against the Crown and oppose the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this ''[[lese majesty|l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]]'' (offense against the ruler) and dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence its name, \"the [[Short Parliament]]\".<ref name=Coward-180/>\n\nWithout Parliament's support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered comprehensive defeat. The Scots went on to invade England, occupying [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]].<ref name=Coward-180/> Meanwhile, another of Charles's chief advisers, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth]], had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632,<ref name=Purkiss-89>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=89}}.</ref> and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Coward |2003 |p=172}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1639, Charles had recalled Wentworth to England and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him achieve similar results in Scotland.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> This time he proved less successful and the English forces fled the field at their second encounter with the Scots in 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> Almost the whole of Northern England was occupied and Charles forced to pay \u00a3850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. Had he not done so they would have pillaged and burnt the cities and towns of Northern England.<ref>{{Harvnb |Sharp |2000 |p=13}}.</ref>\n\nAll this put Charles in a desperate financial state. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, he had to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this.<ref name=\" Purkiss 2007 93\"/> Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the [[Magnum Concilium]] (the [[House of Lords]], but without the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]], so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-96/>\n\n===The Long Parliament===\n{{Main|Long Parliament}}\n[[File:LongParliament.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Session of the Long Parliament]]\nThe new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against him and his government, with Pym and [[John Hampden|Hampden]] (of [[ship money]] fame) in the lead. They took the opportunity presented by the King's troubles to force various reforming measures \u2014 including many with strong \"anti-Papist\" themes \u2014 upon him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |pp=104\u2013105}}.</ref> The members passed a law stating that a new Parliament would convene at least once every three years \u2014 without the King's summons if need be. Other laws passed making it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent and later gave Parliament control over the king's ministers. Finally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. Ever since this Parliament has been known as the Long Parliament. However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], an oath of allegiance to Charles.{{efn |See {{Harvnb |Walter |1999 |p=294}}, for some of the complexities of how the Protestation was interpreted by different political actors.}}\n\nEarly in the Long Parliament, the house overwhelmingly accused [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]] of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n[[Henry Vane the Younger]] supplied evidence of Strafford's claimed improper use of the army in Ireland, alleging that he had encouraged the King to use his Ireland-raised forces to threaten England into compliance. This evidence was obtained from Vane's father, [[Henry Vane the Elder]], a member of the King's Privy council, who refused to confirm it in Parliament out of loyalty to Charles. On 10 April 1641, Pym's case collapsed, but Pym made a direct appeal to [[Henry Vane the Younger]] to produce a copy of the notes from the King's Privy council, discovered by the younger Vane and secretly turned over to Pym, to the great anguish of the Elder Vane.<ref>{{harvnb |Upham |1842 |p=187}}</ref> These notes contained evidence that Strafford had told the King, \"Sir, you have done your duty, and your subjects have failed in theirs; and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government, and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways; you have an army in Ireland, with which you may reduce the kingdom.\"{{sfn |Upham |1842 |p=187}}{{sfn |Hibbert |1968 |p=154}}{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=224}}\n\nPym immediately launched a [[Bill of attainder|Bill of Attainder]] stating Strafford's guilt and demanding that he be put to death.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=224}} Unlike a guilty verdict in a court case, attainder did not require a [[legal burden of proof]], but it did require the king's approval. Charles, however, guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=225}} Furthermore, the Lords opposed the severity of a death sentence on Strafford. Yet increased tensions and [[First Army Plot|a plot]] in the army to support Strafford began to sway the issue.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=225}} On 21 April, the Commons passed the Bill (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained),{{sfn |Smith |1999 |p=123}} and the Lords acquiesced. Charles, still incensed over the Commons' handling of Buckingham, refused his assent. Strafford himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider.{{sfn |Abbott |2020}} Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May.{{sfn |Smith |1999 |p=123}} Strafford was beheaded two days later.{{sfn |Coward |1994 |p=191}} In the meantime both Parliament and the King agreed to an independent investigation into the king's involvement in Strafford's plot.\n\nThe Long Parliament then passed the [[Triennial Act]], also known as the [[Dissolution Act]] in May 1641, to which the Royal Assent was readily granted.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=222}}{{sfn |Kenyon |1978 |p=127}} The Triennial Act required Parliament to be summoned at least once in three years. When the King failed to issue a proper summons, the members could assemble on their own. This act also forbade ship money without Parliament's consent, fines in distraint of knighthood, and forced loans. Monopolies were cut back sharply, the Courts of the [[Star Chamber]] and [[Court of High Commission|High Commission]] abolished by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]], and the Triennial Act respectively.{{sfn |Gregg |1981 |p=335}} All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=129}} On 3 May, Parliament decreed [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles's government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', Parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and Episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.{{sfn |Kenyon |1978 |p=130}}{{sfn |Abbott |2020|nopp=y}}\n\nCharles and his Parliament hoped that the execution of Strafford and the Protestation would end the drift towards war, but in fact, they encouraged it. Charles and his supporters continued to resent Parliament's demands, and Parliamentarians continued to suspect Charles of wanting to impose episcopalianism and unfettered royal rule by military force. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|struck first]], and all Ireland soon descended into chaos.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |pp=109\u2013113}}.</ref> Rumors circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all.<ref>See {{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=113}} for concerns of a similar English Catholic rising.</ref>\n\nIn early January 1642, Charles, accompanied by 400 soldiers, attempted to arrest [[five members]] of the House of Commons on a charge of treason.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41>{{Harvnb |Sherwood |1997 |p=41}}.</ref> This attempt failed. When the troops marched into Parliament, Charles enquired of [[William Lenthall]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]], as to the whereabouts of the five. Lenthall replied, \"May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\"<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/> So the Speaker proclaimed himself a servant of Parliament, rather than the King.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/>\n\n===Local grievances===\nIn the summer of 1642, these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose from many local grievances. For example, imposed drainage schemes in [[The Fens]] disrupted the livelihood of thousands after the King awarded a number of drainage contracts.<ref>{{Harvnb |Hughes |1991 |p=127}}.</ref> Many saw the King as indifferent to public welfare, and this played a role in bringing much of eastern England into the Parliamentarian camp. This sentiment brought with it such people as the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]], each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], was to die fighting for the King at the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=180}}.</ref>\n\n==First English Civil War (1642\u20131646)==\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n[[File:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (yellow-green), 1642\u20131645]]\nIn early January 1642, a few days after failing to capture five members of the House of Commons, Charles feared for the safety of his family and retinue and left the London area for the north country.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=57}}.</ref> Further frequent negotiations by letter between the King and the Long Parliament, through to early summer, proved fruitless. As the summer progressed, cities and towns declared their sympathies for one faction or the other: for example, the garrison of Portsmouth commanded by Sir [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] declared for the King,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=107}}.</ref> but when Charles tried to acquire arms from [[Kingston upon Hull]], the weaponry depository used in the previous Scottish campaigns, Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the military governor appointed by Parliament in January, refused to let Charles enter the town,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=82}}.</ref> and when Charles returned with more men later, [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Hotham drove them off]].<ref name=\"Wedgwood 1970 100\">{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=100}}.</ref> Charles issued a warrant for Hotham's arrest as a traitor but was powerless to enforce it.

Historians estimate that both sides had only about 15,000 men between them,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. Many areas attempted to remain neutral. Some formed bands of [[Clubmen]] to protect their localities from the worst excesses of the armies of both sides,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |pp=403\u201304}}.</ref> but most found it impossible to withstand both King and Parliament. On one side, the King and his supporters fought for traditional government in church and state, while on the other, most Parliamentarians initially took up arms to defend what they saw as a traditional balance of government in church and state, which the bad advice the King received from his advisers had undermined before and during the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\". The views of the members of Parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King \u2014 at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King's [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]] than at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] \u2014 through to radicals who sought major reforms in [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|religious independence]] and redistribution of power at a national level. However, even the most radical Parliamentarian supporters still favoured keeping Charles on the throne.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For all information since the last citation}}\n\nAfter the debacle at Hull, Charles moved on to [[Nottingham]], raising the royal standard there on 22 August 1642.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=111}}.</ref> At the time, Charles had with him about 2,000 cavalries and a small number of Yorkshire infantrymen, and using the archaic system of a [[Commission of Array]],<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=96}}.</ref> his supporters started to build a larger army around the standard. Charles moved in a westerly direction, first to [[Stafford]], then on to [[Shrewsbury]], as support for his cause seemed particularly strong in the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley area and in North Wales.<ref>{{Harvnb |Royle |2006 |pp=170, 183}}.</ref> While passing through [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], he declared in what became known as the \"[[Wellington Declaration]]\" that he would uphold the \"Protestant religion, the laws of England, and the liberty of Parliament\".<ref>{{harvnb |Sherwood |1992 |p=6}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell by Samuel Cooper.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oliver Cromwell]]]]\n\nThe Parliamentarians who opposed the King did not remain passive in this pre-war period. As in Hull, they took measures to secure strategic towns and cities by appointing to office men sympathetic to their cause. On 9 June they voted to raise an army of 10,000 volunteers and appointed [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] its commander three days later.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |pp=108\u201309}}.</ref> He received orders \"to rescue His Majesty's person, and the persons of the Prince [of Wales] and the Duke of York [James II] out of the hands of those desperate persons who were about them.\"<ref>{{Harvnb |Hibbert |1993 |p=65}}.</ref> The [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenant]] whom Parliament appointed used the [[Militia Ordinance]] to order the militia to join Essex's army.<ref>{{Harvnb |Royle |2006 |pp=161, 165}}.</ref>\n\nTwo weeks after the King had raised his standard at Nottingham, Essex led his army north towards [[Northampton]],<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=113}}.</ref> picking up support along the way (including a detachment of [[Huntingdonshire]] cavalry raised and commanded by Oliver Cromwell).{{efn|Cromwell had already secured Cambridge and the supplies of college silver {{Harv |Wedgwood |1970 |p=106}}.}} By mid-September Essex's forces had grown to 21,000 infantry and 4,200 cavalries and [[dragoon]]s.

Armed political [[Cavalier|Royalism]] was at an end, but despite being a prisoner, Charles I was considered by himself and his opponents (almost to the last) as necessary to ensure the success of whichever group could come to terms with him. Thus he passed successively into the hands of the Scots, the Parliament and the Army. The King attempted to reverse the verdict of arms by \"[[Flirting|coquetting]]\" with each in turn. On 3 June 1647, Cornet [[George Joyce]] of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax's]] horse seized the King for the Army, after which the English Presbyterians and the Scots began to prepare for a fresh civil war, less than two years after the conclusion of the first, this time against \"Independency\", as embodied in the Army. After making use of the Army's sword, its opponents attempted to disband it, to send it on foreign service and to cut off its arrears of pay. The result was that the Army leadership was exasperated beyond control, and, remembering not merely their grievances but also the principle for which the Army had fought, it soon became the most powerful political force in the realm. From 1646 to 1648 the breach between Army and Parliament widened day by day until finally the Presbyterian party, combined with the Scots and the remaining Royalists, felt itself strong enough to begin a Second Civil War.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=45.

[[John Calvin]] formulated a doctrine of [[Presbyterianism]], which held that the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' in the New Testament were identical; he rejected the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]]. Calvin's follower [[John Knox]] brought Presbyterianism to Scotland when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling hierarchy.\n\nThis vision of at least partial democracy in [[ecclesiology]] paralleled the struggles between Parliament and the King. A body within the Puritan movement in the Church of England sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The [[Martin Marprelate]] tracts (1588\u20131589), applying the [[pejorative]] name of ''[[prelate|prelacy]]'' to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and her [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]]. The [[vestments controversy]] also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as \"unedifying\" and even [[idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]].\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]], reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted \"No Bishop, no King\" as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as King, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his authority. Matters came to a head when Charles I appointed [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The controversy eventually led to Laud's [[impeachment]] for [[treason]] by a [[bill of attainder]] in 1645 and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639\u20131640.\n\nDuring the height of Puritan power under [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]], episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646.{{sfn |King |1968 |p=523\u201337}} The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy under Charles II in 1660.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==English overseas possessions==\n{{details|English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}\nDuring the English Civil War, the English overseas possessions became highly involved. In the Channel Islands, the island of Jersey and [[Castle Cornet]] in Guernsey supported the King until a surrender with honour in December 1651.\n\nAlthough the newer, Puritan settlements in North America, notably [[Massachusetts]], were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies sided with the Crown. Friction between Royalists and Puritans in Maryland came to a head in the [[Battle of the Severn]]. The [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company's]] settlements, [[Bermuda]] and [[Virginia]], as well as [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]] were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown. Bermuda's Independent Puritans were expelled, settling the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Parliament passed [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650, which stated that\n{{quote|due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any manner of Commerce or Traffic with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all manner of persons, Foreigners, and others, all manner of Commerce, Traffic and Correspondence whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbados, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.}}\n\nThe Act also authorised Parliamentary [[privateer]]s to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies:\n{{quote|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized.

Far to the North, Bermuda's regiment of Militia and its coastal batteries prepared to resist an invasion that never came. Built-up inside the natural defence of a nearly impassable barrier reef, to fend of the might of Spain, these defences were too powerful for the Parliamentary fleet sent in 1651 under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]], which was forced instead to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a separate peace that respected the internal status quo. The [[Parliament of Bermuda]] avoided the Parliament of England's fate during [[The Protectorate]], becoming one of the oldest continuous legislatures in the world.\n\nVirginia's population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the English Civil War. Even so, Virginia Puritan [[Richard Bennett (Governor)|Richard Bennett]] was made Governor answering to Cromwell in 1652, followed by two more nominal \"Commonwealth Governors\". The loyalty of Virginia's [[Virginia Cavaliers (historical)|Cavaliers]] to the Crown was rewarded after the 1660 Restoration of the Monarchy when Charles II dubbed it the ''Old Dominion''.\n\n==Casualties==\nFigures for casualties during this period are unreliable, but some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates.<ref name=Carlton-211-214>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA211,M1 pp. 211\u201314]}}.</ref>\n\nIn England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars. Historical records count 84,830 dead from the wars themselves. Counting in accidents and the two Bishops' wars, an estimate of 190,000 dead is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-211>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA211,M1 p. 211]}}.</ref> out of a total population of about five million.<ref name=James-187>{{Harvnb |James |2003 |p=187}}, cites: {{Harvnb |Carlton |1995a |p=212}}.</ref>\n\nFigures for Scotland are less reliable and should be treated with caution. Casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths, with estimates of 10,000 prisoners not surviving or not returning home (8,000 captured during and immediately after the [[Battle of Worcester]] were deported to [[New England]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[West Indies]] to work for landowners as [[indentured labour]]ers<ref>{{Harvnb |Royle |2006 |p=602}}.</ref>). There are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases, but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from English figures is applied to the Scottish figures, a not unreasonable estimate of 60,000 people is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-212>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA212,M1 p. 212]}}.</ref> from a population of about one million.<ref name=James-187/>\n\nFigures for Ireland are described as \"miracles of conjecture\". Certainly the devastation inflicted on Ireland was massive, with the best estimate provided by Sir [[William Petty]], the father of English demography. Petty estimated that 112,000 Protestants and 504,000 Catholics were killed through [[Black Death|plague]], war and [[famine]], giving an estimated total of 616,000 dead,<ref name=Carlton-213>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA213,M1 p. 213]}}.</ref> out of a pre-war population of about one and a half million.<ref name=James-187/> Although Petty's figures are the best available, they are still acknowledged as tentative; they do not include an estimated 40,000 driven into exile, some of whom served as soldiers in European continental armies, while others were sold as indentured servants to New England and the West Indies. Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death.\n\nThese estimates indicate that England suffered a 4 percent loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6 percent, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41 percent of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation of Ireland in particular. The [[Great Hunger]] of 1845\u20131852 resulted in a loss of 16 percent of the population, while during the Second World War the population of the Soviet Union fell by 16 percent.<ref name=Carlton-214>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA214,M1 p. 214]}}.</ref>\n\n==Popular gains==\nOrdinary people took advantage of the dislocation of civil society in the 1640s to gain personal advantages. The contemporary guild democracy movement won its greatest successes among London's transport workers, notably the Thames [[watermen]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Rural communities seized timber and other resources on the sequestrated estates of Royalists and Catholics, and on the estates of the royal family and church hierarchy.

The democratic element introduced into the watermen's company in 1642, for example, survived with vicissitudes until 1827.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lindley |1997 |p=160}}.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe wars left England, Scotland, and Ireland among the few countries in Europe without a monarch. In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many idealists) became sidelined. The republican government of the [[Commonwealth of England]] ruled England (and later all of Scotland and Ireland) from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660. Between the two periods, and due to in-fighting among various factions in Parliament, [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled over [[the Protectorate]] as [[Lord Protector]] (effectively a military dictator) until his death in 1658.{{efn |For a longer analysis of the relationship between Cromwell's position, the former monarchy and the military, see {{Harvnb |Sherwood |1997 |pp=7\u201311}}.}}\n\nOn Oliver Cromwell's death, his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=6}}.</ref> After seven months the Army removed Richard, and in May 1659 it re-installed the Rump.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=9}}.</ref> However, since the Rump Parliament acted as though nothing had changed since 1653 and as though it could treat the Army as it liked, military force shortly afterward dissolved this as well.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=12}}.</ref> After the second dissolution of the Rump, in October 1659, the prospect of a total descent into anarchy loomed as the Army's pretense of unity finally dissolved into factions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=34}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Musket volley by Sealed Knot.JPG|thumb|left|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nInto this atmosphere General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], Governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland.

On 29 May 1660, the populace in London acclaimed him as king.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |pp=5\u20136}}.</ref> His coronation took place at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 23 April 1661. These events became known as the ''[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough the monarchy was restored, it was still only with the consent of Parliament. So the civil wars effectively set England and Scotland on course towards a [[parliamentary monarchy]] form of government.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |p=8}}.</ref> The outcome of this system was that the future [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], formed in 1707 under the [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], managed to forestall the kind of often-bloody revolution typical of European republican movements, as seen after the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] revolution in 18th-century France and the later success of [[Napoleon]], which generally resulted in total abolition of monarchy. Thus the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the [[Glorious Revolution]] and in the 1701 [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n==Historiography and explanations==\n{{Puritans}}\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, the [[Whig history|Whig school]] was the dominant theoretical view. It explained the Civil War as resulting from centuries of struggle between Parliament (notably the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to dictate law arbitrarily. The major Whig historian, [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|S. R. Gardiner]],{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} popularised the idea that the English Civil War was a \"Puritan Revolution\", which challenged the repressive Stuart Church and prepared the way for [[religious toleration]]. So Puritanism was seen as the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power.\n\nThe Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] school, which became popular in the 1940s, and saw the English Civil War as a [[bourgeois]] revolution. According to Marxist historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]:\n\n{{quote|The Civil War was a class war, in which the despotism of Charles I was defended by the reactionary forces of the established Church and conservative landlords, Parliament beat the King because it could appeal to the enthusiastic support of the trading and industrial classes in town and countryside, to the yeomen and progressive gentry, and to wider masses of the population whenever they were able by free discussion to understand what the struggle was really about.<ref>{{Harvnb |Kaye |1995 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6xVLvqihBoC&pg=PA106#v=onepage p. 106]}} quoting from the pamphlet ''The English Revolution 1640''</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1970s, [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories,<ref name=Burgess>{{harvnb |Burgess |1990 |pp=609\u201327}}.</ref> notably in the 1973 anthology ''The Origins of the English Civil War'' ([[Conrad Russell]] ed.).{{sfn |Russell |1973 |p={{Page needed |date=April 2017}}}} These historians focused on the minutiae of the years immediately before the civil war, so returning to the contingency-based historiography of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon's]] famous ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |p=60}}</ref> This, it was claimed, demonstrated that factional war-allegiance patterns did not fit either Whig or Marxist history.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |p=60}}.</ref> Parliament was not inherently progressive, nor the events of 1640 a precursor for the [[Glorious Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |pp=60\u201361}}.</ref> Furthermore, Puritans did not necessarily ally themselves with Parliamentarians.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament.<ref name=Burgess/>{{Failed verification|date=June 2008}}\n\nFrom the 1990s, a number of historians discarded and replaced the historical title \"English Civil War\" with the titles the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the \"British Civil Wars\", positing that the civil war in England cannot be understood in isolation from events in other parts of Britain and Ireland; King Charles I remains crucial, not just as King of England, but through his relationship with the peoples of his other realms. For example, the wars began when King Charles I tried imposing an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the [[Covenanter]]s, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this forced him to call an English Parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. The English Parliaments were not willing to grant Charles the revenue he needed to pay for the Scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. By the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near-permanent crisis management, often unwilling to concede enough ground to any faction to neutralise the threat, and in some cases doing so would only to antagonise another faction. For example, Charles finally agreed-upon terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion.{{sfn |Ohlmeyer |2002}}\n\n[[Thomas Hobbes]] gives a much earlier historical account of the English Civil War in his ''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'', written in 1668 and published in 1681. He reports that the causes of the war were the doctrines of politics and conflicts that arose from science that disputed those political doctrines.{{sfn|Hobbes|1839|p=220}} ''Behemoth'' offered a uniquely historical and philosophical approach to naming the catalysts for the war. It also served as a statement to explain why Charles I could not hold his place of power and maintain peace in his kingdom.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=33}}\nSpecifically, Hobbes analyses the following aspects of English thought during the war (listed in order of his discussions in ''Behemoth''): the opinions of divinity and politics that spurred rebellion; rhetoric and doctrine used by the rebels against the king; and how opinions about \"taxation, the conscription of soldiers, and military strategy\" affected the outcomes of battles and shifts of sovereignty.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=33}}\n\nHobbes offered a unique contribution to historical interpretation of the civil war through his ''Behemoth'' by connecting the civil war to the motivations of intellectuals who Hobbes reports caused it by trying to spread certain ideas throughout the nation, largely for the sake of displaying their own wisdom and learning.{{sfn |Goldsmith |1966 |pp=x\u2013xiii}} He held the belief that clerical pretensions had contributed significantly to the trouble during the civil war \u2014 \"whether those of puritan fundamentalists, papal supremacists or divine right Episcopalians\".{{sfn |Sommerville |2012}} Hobbes wanted to revoke all of independent power of the clergy and to change the civil system such that they were controlled by the state.\n\nSome scholars suggest that ''Behemoth'' has not received due respect as an academic work, being comparatively overlooked and under-rated in the shadow of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}{{sfn|Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} One factor that may have distracted attention from it as a historical work is that it takes the form of a dialogue. While philosophical dialogues are common, historical ones are not. Other factors that hindered its success include Charles II's refusing its publication and Hobbes' chiefly interpretive approach to the historical narrative.{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}}\n\nMuch can be gleaned about Hobbes as a person from looking at the difficulties he faced while seeking an audience for ''Behemoth''. The essay illuminates a flaw shared by most of Hobbes's political philosophy as well, which is his lack of ability or willingness to empathise with perspectives that largely differed from his own. As his perspective was so much at odds with other views, Hobbes struggled to understand the thinking of most of his potential audience and people in general.{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} For instance, he credits the Presbyterians and Parliamentarians with \"improbably long-planned and wicked ambitions\".{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} What is more \"he hardly understands the orthodox Royalists (he was himself a highly unorthodox Royalist) any better, and he makes only limited concessions of sincerity to the religious feelings of the various parties\".{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}}\n\n==Re-enactments==\n[[File:Civil war reeanactment.JPG|thumb|right|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nTwo large historical societies exist, [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]] and [[The English Civil War Society]], which regularly [[English Civil War reenactment|re-enact]] events and battles of the Civil War in full period costume.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the English Civil War]], showing events leading up to, culminating in, and resulting from the English Civil Wars.\n* [[First English Civil War, 1642]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1643]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1644]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1645]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1646]]\n* [[Cromwell's Soldiers' Pocket Bible]], booklet Cromwell issued to his army in 1643.\n* [[English Dissenters]]\n* [[William Hiseland]], the last Royalist veteran of the Civil War\n* [[Thirty Years' War]], a defining event in European history during the reign of Charles I\n* The [[Levellers]], a movement for political reform.\n* [[Diggers]]\n<!-- *[[Tyne-Wear rivalry#Origins of the rivalry]] --Needs a source that the Tyne-Wear rivalry is partially based on the Civil War and not just on FTM -->\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite web |ref ={{harvid|Abbott|2020}}\n|last=Abbott |first=Jacob |title=Charles I: Downfall of Strafford and Laud |url = http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=downfall |accessdate=18 February 2020 |year=2020}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden the Patriot 1594\u20131643 |year=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}\n* {{Citation |last=Atkin |first=Malcolm |title=Worcester 1651 |publisher=Pen and Sword |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84415-080-9 |location = Barnsley |pages = }}\n* {{Citation |last=Aylmer |first=G.

The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642\u20131646) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648\u20131649) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649\u20131651) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.\n\nThe outcome of the war was threefold: [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653) and then [[the Protectorate]] under the personal rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653\u20131658) and briefly his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] (1658\u20131659). This was particularly notable given that an English king had never been executed before. In England, the monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on Christian worship was ended, while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s consent, although the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was only legally established as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.{{sfn |EB staff |2016a}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"English Civil War\" appears most often in the singular, although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. These were not restricted to [[England]], as [[Wales]] was part of the Kingdom of England and affected accordingly. The conflicts also involved wars with Scotland and Ireland, and civil wars within them.\n\nThe wars spanning all three countries are known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the early 19th century, [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] referred to it as \"the Great Civil War\".<ref>Walter Scott, ''Waverley; or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since'' (1814), Chap. 2.</ref>\n\nUnlike other [[List of English civil wars|civil wars in England]], which focused on who should rule, these conflicts were more concerned with the manner in which the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland were governed. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']] called the series of conflicts the \"Great Rebellion\",{{sfn |Chisholm |1911}} while some historians \u2013 notably [[Marxist]]s such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] (1912\u20132003) \u2013 long favoured the term \"[[English Revolution]]\".<ref>{{harvnb |Hill |1972 |loc=for example}}.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nEach side had a geographical stronghold, such that minority elements were silenced or fled. The royalty's included the countryside, the shires, the cathedral city of Oxford, and the less economically developed areas of northern and western England. Parliament's spanned the industrial centres, ports, and economically advanced regions of southern and eastern England, including the remaining cathedral cities (except York, Chester, Worcester). Lacey Baldwin Smith says, \"the words ''populous, rich, and rebellious'' seemed to go hand in hand\".{{sfn |Smith|1983 |p=251}}{{sfn |Hughes |1985 |pp=236\u201363}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nMany officers and veteran soldiers had fought in European wars, notably the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Spanish and the Dutch, which began in 1568.{{sfn |Baker |1986|p=}}\n\nThe main battle tactic came to be known as [[pike and shot]] infantry. The two sides would line up opposite one another, with infantry brigades of [[musketeer]]s in the centre. These carried matchlock muskets, an inaccurate weapon which nevertheless could be lethal at a range of up to 300 yards.

Elizabeth had been succeeded by her [[Cousin chart|first cousin twice-removed]], [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]], as James I of England, creating the first [[Union of the Crowns|personal union of the Scottish and English kingdoms]].{{efn|Although the early 17th-century Stuart monarchs styled themselves King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, with the exception of the constitutional arrangements during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (see the [[Tender of Union]]), full union of the Scottish and English realms into a new realm of Great Britain did not occur until the passing of the [[Act of Union 1707]].}} As King of Scots, James had become accustomed to Scotland's weak parliamentary tradition since assuming control of the Scottish government in 1583, so that upon assuming power south of the border, the new King of England was affronted by the constraints the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] attempted to place on him in exchange for money. In spite of this, James's personal extravagance meant he was perennially short of money and had to resort to extra-parliamentary sources of income.\n\nThis extravagance was tempered by James's peaceful disposition, so that by the succession of his son Charles I in 1625 the two kingdoms had both experienced relative peace, internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles followed his father's dream in hoping to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a single kingdom.<ref>{{Harvnb |Croft |2003 |p=63}}.</ref> Many English Parliamentarians were suspicious of such a move, fearing that such a new kingdom might destroy old English traditions that had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as \"little gods on Earth\", chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the \"[[Divine Right of Kings]]\"), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification.<ref>{{Harvnb |McClelland |1996 |p=224}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charles I, painted by Van Dyck]]\n\n===Parliament in an English constitutional framework===\nAt the time, the Parliament of England did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government. Instead, it functioned as a temporary advisory committee and was summoned only if and when the monarch saw fit. Once summoned, a Parliament's continued existence was at the king's pleasure since it was subject to dissolution by him at any time.\n\nYet in spite of this limited role, Parliament had acquired over the centuries ''de facto'' powers of enough significance that monarchs could not simply ignore them indefinitely. For a monarch, Parliament's most indispensable power was its ability to raise tax revenues far in excess of all other sources of revenue at the Crown's disposal. By the 17th century, Parliament's tax-raising powers had come to be derived from the fact that the [[gentry]] was the only stratum of society with the ability and authority to collect and remit the most meaningful forms of taxation then available at the local level. So if the king wanted to ensure smooth revenue collection, he needed gentry co-operation. For all of the Crown's legal authority, its resources were limited by any modern standard to an extent that if the gentry refused to collect the king's taxes on a national scale, the Crown lacked a practical means of compelling them.\n\nFrom the thirteenth century, monarchs ordered the election of representatives to sit in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with most voters being the owners of property, although in some [[potwalloper]] boroughs every male householder could vote. When assembled along with the [[House of Lords]], these elected representatives formed a Parliament. So the concept of Parliaments allowed representatives of the property-owning class to meet, primarily, at least from the point of view of the monarch, to sanction whatever taxes the monarch wished to collect. In the process, the representatives could debate  and enact [[statute]]s, or [[act of parliament|acts]]. However, Parliament lacked the power to force its will upon the monarch; its only leverage was the threat of withholding the financial means required to implement his plans.{{sfn |Johnston |1901 |pp=83\u201386}}\n\n===Parliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right===\n[[File:Sir Peter Lely 001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], painted by [[Peter Lely]], 1660]]\nMany concerns were raised over Charles's marriage in 1625 to a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] French princess: [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]]. Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |pp=129\u201330}}.</ref>\n\nCharles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French [[Huguenots]], whom French royal troops held [[Siege of La Rochelle|besieged in La Rochelle]]. Such military support for Protestants on the Continent potentially alleviated concerns about the King's marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles's insistence on giving command of the English force to his unpopular royal favourite [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham]], undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the relief expedition proved a fiasco (1627),<ref>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |p=166}}.</ref> and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on [[Patronage|royal patronage]], opened [[impeachment]] proceedings against him.<ref name=Gregg-175>{{Harvnb |Gregg |1984 |p=175}}.</ref> Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This saved Buckingham but confirmed the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.<ref name=Gregg-175/>\n\nHaving dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[John Hampden]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> and [[Edward Coke]].) The new Parliament drew up a [[Petition of Right]], which Charles accepted as a concession to obtain his subsidy.<ref name=\"Purkiss 2007 93\">{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=93}}.</ref> The Petition made reference to [[Magna Carta]],<ref>[[Petition of Right]] at III, VII.</ref> but did not grant him the right of [[tonnage and poundage]], which Charles had been collecting without Parliamentary authorisation since 1625.{{sfn |Sommerville |1992 |pp=65, 71, 80}} Several more active members of the opposition were imprisoned, which caused outrage;{{sfn |Sommerville |1992 |pp=65, 71, 80}} one, [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], subsequently died in prison and came to be seen as a martyr for the rights of Parliament.{{sfn |Russell |1998 |p=417}}\n\n===Personal rule===\nCharles I avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the \"[[personal rule of Charles I]]\", or the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\".<ref>{{Harvnb |Rosner |Theibault |2000 |p=103}}.</ref> During this period, Charles's policies were determined by his lack of money. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament, the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England's involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. However, that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown's finances.\n\nUnable to raise revenue without Parliament and unwilling to convene it, Charles resorted to other means. One was to revive conventions, often outdated. For example, a failure to attend and receive [[knighthood]] at Charles's coronation became a finable offence with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through [[ship money]], demanding in 1634\u20131636 that the inland English counties pay a tax for the [[Royal Navy]] to counter the threat of privateers and pirates in the English Channel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> Established law supported the policy of coastal counties and inland ports such as London paying ship money in times of need, but it had not been applied to inland counties before.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594-1643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> Authorities had ignored it for centuries, and many saw it as yet another extra-Parliamentary, illegal tax,<ref name=Pipes-143>{{Harvnb |Pipes |1999 |p=143}}.</ref> which prompted some prominent men to refuse to pay it. Charles issued a writ against John Hampden for his failure to pay, and although five judges including Sir George Croke supported Hampden, seven judges found in favour of the King in 1638.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden The Patriot 1594\u20131643 |date=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}</ref> The fines imposed on people who refused to pay ship money and standing out against its illegality aroused widespread indignation.<ref name=Pipes-143/>\n\nDuring his \"Personal Rule\", Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures. He believed in [[High church|High Anglicanism]], a sacramental version of the [[Church of England]], theologically based upon [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]], a creed shared with his main political adviser, Archbishop [[William Laud]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=48}}.</ref> In 1633, Charles appointed Laud [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] tables with stone altars.<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=96}}.</ref> Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism; when they complained, he had them arrested. In 1637, [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]], and [[William Prynne]] had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud's views \u2014 a rare penalty for [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and one that aroused anger.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=201}}.</ref> Moreover, the Church authorities revived statutes from the time of Elizabeth I about church attendance and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican services.<ref>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1987 |p=173}}.</ref>\n\n===Rebellion in Scotland===\n{{Main|Bishops' War}}\nThe end of Charles's independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The [[Church of Scotland]], reluctantly [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] in structure, had independent traditions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=74}}.</ref> Charles wanted one uniform Church throughout Britain<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=83}}.</ref> and introduced a new, High Anglican version of the English [[Book of Common Prayer]] to Scotland in the middle of 1637. This was violently resisted. A riot broke out in Edinburgh,<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=75}}.</ref> which may have been started in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], according to legend, by [[Jenny Geddes]]. In February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the [[National Covenant]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=77}}.</ref> This document took the form of a \"loyal protest\", rejecting all innovations not first tested by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church.\n\nIn the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border to end the rebellion known as the [[Bishops' War]],<ref name=Purkiss-96>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=96}}.</ref> but after an inconclusive campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce: the [[Pacification of Berwick]]. This truce proved temporary, and a second war followed in mid-1640. A Scots army defeated Charles's forces in the north, then captured [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=97}}.</ref> Charles eventually agreed not to interfere in Scotland's religion and paid the Scots' war expenses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Recall of the English Parliament===\nCharles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland, but had insufficient funds to do so. He needed to seek money from a newly elected [[Short Parliament|English Parliament]] in 1640.<ref name=Coward-180>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=180}}.</ref> Its majority faction, led by [[John Pym]], used this appeal for money as a chance to discuss grievances against the Crown and oppose the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this ''[[lese majesty|l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]]'' (offense against the ruler) and dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence its name, \"the [[Short Parliament]]\".<ref name=Coward-180/>\n\nWithout Parliament's support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered comprehensive defeat. The Scots went on to invade England, occupying [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]].<ref name=Coward-180/> Meanwhile, another of Charles's chief advisers, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth]], had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632,<ref name=Purkiss-89>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=89}}.</ref> and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Coward |2003 |p=172}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1639, Charles had recalled Wentworth to England and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him achieve similar results in Scotland.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> This time he proved less successful and the English forces fled the field at their second encounter with the Scots in 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> Almost the whole of Northern England was occupied and Charles forced to pay \u00a3850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. Had he not done so they would have pillaged and burnt the cities and towns of Northern England.<ref>{{Harvnb |Sharp |2000 |p=13}}.</ref>\n\nAll this put Charles in a desperate financial state. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, he had to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this.<ref name=\" Purkiss 2007 93\"/> Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the [[Magnum Concilium]] (the [[House of Lords]], but without the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]], so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-96/>\n\n===The Long Parliament===\n{{Main|Long Parliament}}\n[[File:LongParliament.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Session of the Long Parliament]]\nThe new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against him and his government, with Pym and [[John Hampden|Hampden]] (of [[ship money]] fame) in the lead. They took the opportunity presented by the King's troubles to force various reforming measures \u2014 including many with strong \"anti-Papist\" themes \u2014 upon him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |pp=104\u2013105}}.</ref> The members passed a law stating that a new Parliament would convene at least once every three years \u2014 without the King's summons if need be. Other laws passed making it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent and later gave Parliament control over the king's ministers. Finally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. Ever since this Parliament has been known as the Long Parliament. However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], an oath of allegiance to Charles.{{efn |See {{Harvnb |Walter |1999 |p=294}}, for some of the complexities of how the Protestation was interpreted by different political actors.}}\n\nEarly in the Long Parliament, the house overwhelmingly accused [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]] of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n[[Henry Vane the Younger]] supplied evidence of Strafford's claimed improper use of the army in Ireland, alleging that he had encouraged the King to use his Ireland-raised forces to threaten England into compliance. This evidence was obtained from Vane's father, [[Henry Vane the Elder]], a member of the King's Privy council, who refused to confirm it in Parliament out of loyalty to Charles. On 10 April 1641, Pym's case collapsed, but Pym made a direct appeal to [[Henry Vane the Younger]] to produce a copy of the notes from the King's Privy council, discovered by the younger Vane and secretly turned over to Pym, to the great anguish of the Elder Vane.<ref>{{harvnb |Upham |1842 |p=187}}</ref> These notes contained evidence that Strafford had told the King, \"Sir, you have done your duty, and your subjects have failed in theirs; and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government, and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways; you have an army in Ireland, with which you may reduce the kingdom.\"{{sfn |Upham |1842 |p=187}}{{sfn |Hibbert |1968 |p=154}}{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=224}}\n\nPym immediately launched a [[Bill of attainder|Bill of Attainder]] stating Strafford's guilt and demanding that he be put to death.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=224}} Unlike a guilty verdict in a court case, attainder did not require a [[legal burden of proof]], but it did require the king's approval. Charles, however, guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=225}} Furthermore, the Lords opposed the severity of a death sentence on Strafford. Yet increased tensions and [[First Army Plot|a plot]] in the army to support Strafford began to sway the issue.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=225}} On 21 April, the Commons passed the Bill (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained),{{sfn |Smith |1999 |p=123}} and the Lords acquiesced. Charles, still incensed over the Commons' handling of Buckingham, refused his assent. Strafford himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider.{{sfn |Abbott |2020}} Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May.{{sfn |Smith |1999 |p=123}} Strafford was beheaded two days later.{{sfn |Coward |1994 |p=191}} In the meantime both Parliament and the King agreed to an independent investigation into the king's involvement in Strafford's plot.\n\nThe Long Parliament then passed the [[Triennial Act]], also known as the [[Dissolution Act]] in May 1641, to which the Royal Assent was readily granted.{{sfn |Carlton |1995 |p=222}}{{sfn |Kenyon |1978 |p=127}} The Triennial Act required Parliament to be summoned at least once in three years. When the King failed to issue a proper summons, the members could assemble on their own. This act also forbade ship money without Parliament's consent, fines in distraint of knighthood, and forced loans. Monopolies were cut back sharply, the Courts of the [[Star Chamber]] and [[Court of High Commission|High Commission]] abolished by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]], and the Triennial Act respectively.{{sfn |Gregg |1981 |p=335}} All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=129}} On 3 May, Parliament decreed [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles's government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', Parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and Episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.{{sfn |Kenyon |1978 |p=130}}{{sfn |Abbott |2020|nopp=y}}\n\nCharles and his Parliament hoped that the execution of Strafford and the Protestation would end the drift towards war, but in fact, they encouraged it. Charles and his supporters continued to resent Parliament's demands, and Parliamentarians continued to suspect Charles of wanting to impose episcopalianism and unfettered royal rule by military force. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|struck first]], and all Ireland soon descended into chaos.<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |pp=109\u2013113}}.</ref> Rumors circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all.<ref>See {{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=113}} for concerns of a similar English Catholic rising.</ref>\n\nIn early January 1642, Charles, accompanied by 400 soldiers, attempted to arrest [[five members]] of the House of Commons on a charge of treason.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41>{{Harvnb |Sherwood |1997 |p=41}}.</ref> This attempt failed. When the troops marched into Parliament, Charles enquired of [[William Lenthall]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]], as to the whereabouts of the five. Lenthall replied, \"May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\"<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/> So the Speaker proclaimed himself a servant of Parliament, rather than the King.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/>\n\n===Local grievances===\nIn the summer of 1642, these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose from many local grievances. For example, imposed drainage schemes in [[The Fens]] disrupted the livelihood of thousands after the King awarded a number of drainage contracts.<ref>{{Harvnb |Hughes |1991 |p=127}}.</ref> Many saw the King as indifferent to public welfare, and this played a role in bringing much of eastern England into the Parliamentarian camp. This sentiment brought with it such people as the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]], each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], was to die fighting for the King at the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Purkiss |2007 |p=180}}.</ref>\n\n==First English Civil War (1642\u20131646)==\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n[[File:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (yellow-green), 1642\u20131645]]\nIn early January 1642, a few days after failing to capture five members of the House of Commons, Charles feared for the safety of his family and retinue and left the London area for the north country.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=57}}.</ref> Further frequent negotiations by letter between the King and the Long Parliament, through to early summer, proved fruitless. As the summer progressed, cities and towns declared their sympathies for one faction or the other: for example, the garrison of Portsmouth commanded by Sir [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] declared for the King,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=107}}.</ref> but when Charles tried to acquire arms from [[Kingston upon Hull]], the weaponry depository used in the previous Scottish campaigns, Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the military governor appointed by Parliament in January, refused to let Charles enter the town,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=82}}.</ref> and when Charles returned with more men later, [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Hotham drove them off]].<ref name=\"Wedgwood 1970 100\">{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=100}}.</ref> Charles issued a warrant for Hotham's arrest as a traitor but was powerless to enforce it.

Historians estimate that both sides had only about 15,000 men between them,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} but the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. Many areas attempted to remain neutral. Some formed bands of [[Clubmen]] to protect their localities from the worst excesses of the armies of both sides,<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |pp=403\u201304}}.</ref> but most found it impossible to withstand both King and Parliament. On one side, the King and his supporters fought for traditional government in church and state, while on the other, most Parliamentarians initially took up arms to defend what they saw as a traditional balance of government in church and state, which the bad advice the King received from his advisers had undermined before and during the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\". The views of the members of Parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King \u2014 at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King's [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]] than at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] \u2014 through to radicals who sought major reforms in [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|religious independence]] and redistribution of power at a national level. However, even the most radical Parliamentarian supporters still favoured keeping Charles on the throne.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For all information since the last citation}}\n\nAfter the debacle at Hull, Charles moved on to [[Nottingham]], raising the royal standard there on 22 August 1642.<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=111}}.</ref> At the time, Charles had with him about 2,000 cavalries and a small number of Yorkshire infantrymen, and using the archaic system of a [[Commission of Array]],<ref>{{Harvnb |Wedgwood |1970 |p=96}}.</ref> his supporters started to build a larger army around the standard.

Armed political [[Cavalier|Royalism]] was at an end, but despite being a prisoner, Charles I was considered by himself and his opponents (almost to the last) as necessary to ensure the success of whichever group could come to terms with him. Thus he passed successively into the hands of the Scots, the Parliament and the Army. The King attempted to reverse the verdict of arms by \"[[Flirting|coquetting]]\" with each in turn. On 3 June 1647, Cornet [[George Joyce]] of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax's]] horse seized the King for the Army, after which the English Presbyterians and the Scots began to prepare for a fresh civil war, less than two years after the conclusion of the first, this time against \"Independency\", as embodied in the Army. After making use of the Army's sword, its opponents attempted to disband it, to send it on foreign service and to cut off its arrears of pay. The result was that the Army leadership was exasperated beyond control, and, remembering not merely their grievances but also the principle for which the Army had fought, it soon became the most powerful political force in the realm. From 1646 to 1648 the breach between Army and Parliament widened day by day until finally the Presbyterian party, combined with the Scots and the remaining Royalists, felt itself strong enough to begin a Second Civil War.{{sfn|Atkinson|1911|loc=45.

[[John Calvin]] formulated a doctrine of [[Presbyterianism]], which held that the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' in the New Testament were identical; he rejected the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]]. Calvin's follower [[John Knox]] brought Presbyterianism to Scotland when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling hierarchy.\n\nThis vision of at least partial democracy in [[ecclesiology]] paralleled the struggles between Parliament and the King. A body within the Puritan movement in the Church of England sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The [[Martin Marprelate]] tracts (1588\u20131589), applying the [[pejorative]] name of ''[[prelate|prelacy]]'' to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and her [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]]. The [[vestments controversy]] also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as \"unedifying\" and even [[idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]].\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]], reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted \"No Bishop, no King\" as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as King, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his authority. Matters came to a head when Charles I appointed [[William Laud]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The controversy eventually led to Laud's [[impeachment]] for [[treason]] by a [[bill of attainder]] in 1645 and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639\u20131640.\n\nDuring the height of Puritan power under [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]], episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646.{{sfn |King |1968 |p=523\u201337}} The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy under Charles II in 1660.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==English overseas possessions==\n{{details|English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}\nDuring the English Civil War, the English overseas possessions became highly involved. In the Channel Islands, the island of Jersey and [[Castle Cornet]] in Guernsey supported the King until a surrender with honour in December 1651.\n\nAlthough the newer, Puritan settlements in North America, notably [[Massachusetts]], were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies sided with the Crown. Friction between Royalists and Puritans in Maryland came to a head in the [[Battle of the Severn]]. The [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company's]] settlements, [[Bermuda]] and [[Virginia]], as well as [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]] were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown. Bermuda's Independent Puritans were expelled, settling the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Parliament passed [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650, which stated that\n{{quote|due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any manner of Commerce or Traffic with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all manner of persons, Foreigners, and others, all manner of Commerce, Traffic and Correspondence whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbados, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.}}\n\nThe Act also authorised Parliamentary [[privateer]]s to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies:\n{{quote|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}\n\nThe Parliament began assembling a fleet to invade the Royalist colonies, but many of the English islands in the Caribbean were captured by the Dutch and French in 1651 during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. Far to the North, Bermuda's regiment of Militia and its coastal batteries prepared to resist an invasion that never came. Built-up inside the natural defence of a nearly impassable barrier reef, to fend of the might of Spain, these defences were too powerful for the Parliamentary fleet sent in 1651 under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]], which was forced instead to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a separate peace that respected the internal status quo. The [[Parliament of Bermuda]] avoided the Parliament of England's fate during [[The Protectorate]], becoming one of the oldest continuous legislatures in the world.\n\nVirginia's population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the English Civil War. Even so, Virginia Puritan [[Richard Bennett (Governor)|Richard Bennett]] was made Governor answering to Cromwell in 1652, followed by two more nominal \"Commonwealth Governors\". The loyalty of Virginia's [[Virginia Cavaliers (historical)|Cavaliers]] to the Crown was rewarded after the 1660 Restoration of the Monarchy when Charles II dubbed it the ''Old Dominion''.\n\n==Casualties==\nFigures for casualties during this period are unreliable, but some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates.<ref name=Carlton-211-214>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA211,M1 pp. 211\u201314]}}.</ref>\n\nIn England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars. Historical records count 84,830 dead from the wars themselves. Counting in accidents and the two Bishops' wars, an estimate of 190,000 dead is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-211>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA211,M1 p. 211]}}.</ref> out of a total population of about five million.<ref name=James-187>{{Harvnb |James |2003 |p=187}}, cites: {{Harvnb |Carlton |1995a |p=212}}.</ref>\n\nFigures for Scotland are less reliable and should be treated with caution. Casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths, with estimates of 10,000 prisoners not surviving or not returning home (8,000 captured during and immediately after the [[Battle of Worcester]] were deported to [[New England]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[West Indies]] to work for landowners as [[indentured labour]]ers<ref>{{Harvnb |Royle |2006 |p=602}}.</ref>). There are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases, but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from English figures is applied to the Scottish figures, a not unreasonable estimate of 60,000 people is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-212>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA212,M1 p. 212]}}.</ref> from a population of about one million.<ref name=James-187/>\n\nFigures for Ireland are described as \"miracles of conjecture\". Certainly the devastation inflicted on Ireland was massive, with the best estimate provided by Sir [[William Petty]], the father of English demography. Petty estimated that 112,000 Protestants and 504,000 Catholics were killed through [[Black Death|plague]], war and [[famine]], giving an estimated total of 616,000 dead,<ref name=Carlton-213>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA213,M1 p. 213]}}.</ref> out of a pre-war population of about one and a half million.<ref name=James-187/> Although Petty's figures are the best available, they are still acknowledged as tentative; they do not include an estimated 40,000 driven into exile, some of whom served as soldiers in European continental armies, while others were sold as indentured servants to New England and the West Indies. Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death.\n\nThese estimates indicate that England suffered a 4 percent loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6 percent, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41 percent of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation of Ireland in particular. The [[Great Hunger]] of 1845\u20131852 resulted in a loss of 16 percent of the population, while during the Second World War the population of the Soviet Union fell by 16 percent.<ref name=Carlton-214>{{Harvnb |Carlton |1992 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA214,M1 p. 214]}}.</ref>\n\n==Popular gains==\nOrdinary people took advantage of the dislocation of civil society in the 1640s to gain personal advantages. The contemporary guild democracy movement won its greatest successes among London's transport workers, notably the Thames [[watermen]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Rural communities seized timber and other resources on the sequestrated estates of Royalists and Catholics, and on the estates of the royal family and church hierarchy. Some communities improved their conditions of tenure on such estates.{{sfn|O'Riordan |1993 |pp=184\u2013200}} The old ''status quo'' began a retrenchment after the end of the First Civil War in 1646, and more especially after the Restoration in 1660, but some gains were long-term. The democratic element introduced into the watermen's company in 1642, for example, survived with vicissitudes until 1827.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lindley |1997 |p=160}}.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe wars left England, Scotland, and Ireland among the few countries in Europe without a monarch. In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many idealists) became sidelined. The republican government of the [[Commonwealth of England]] ruled England (and later all of Scotland and Ireland) from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660. Between the two periods, and due to in-fighting among various factions in Parliament, [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled over [[the Protectorate]] as [[Lord Protector]] (effectively a military dictator) until his death in 1658.{{efn |For a longer analysis of the relationship between Cromwell's position, the former monarchy and the military, see {{Harvnb |Sherwood |1997 |pp=7\u201311}}.}}\n\nOn Oliver Cromwell's death, his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=6}}.</ref> After seven months the Army removed Richard, and in May 1659 it re-installed the Rump.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=9}}.</ref> However, since the Rump Parliament acted as though nothing had changed since 1653 and as though it could treat the Army as it liked, military force shortly afterward dissolved this as well.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=12}}.</ref> After the second dissolution of the Rump, in October 1659, the prospect of a total descent into anarchy loomed as the Army's pretense of unity finally dissolved into factions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=34}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Musket volley by Sealed Knot.JPG|thumb|left|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nInto this atmosphere General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], Governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland. On 4 April 1660, in the [[Declaration of Breda]], Charles II made known the conditions of his acceptance of the Crown of England.<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=31}}.</ref> Monck organised the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]],<ref>{{Harvnb |Keeble |2002 |p=48}}.</ref> which met for the first time on 25 April 1660. On 8 May 1660, it declared that Charles II had reigned as the lawful monarch since the execution of Charles I in January 1649. Charles returned from exile on 23 May 1660. On 29 May 1660, the populace in London acclaimed him as king.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |pp=5\u20136}}.</ref> His coronation took place at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 23 April 1661. These events became known as the ''[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough the monarchy was restored, it was still only with the consent of Parliament. So the civil wars effectively set England and Scotland on course towards a [[parliamentary monarchy]] form of government.<ref>{{Harvnb |Lodge |2007 |p=8}}.</ref> The outcome of this system was that the future [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], formed in 1707 under the [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], managed to forestall the kind of often-bloody revolution typical of European republican movements, as seen after the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] revolution in 18th-century France and the later success of [[Napoleon]], which generally resulted in total abolition of monarchy. Thus the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the [[Glorious Revolution]] and in the 1701 [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n==Historiography and explanations==\n{{Puritans}}\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, the [[Whig history|Whig school]] was the dominant theoretical view. It explained the Civil War as resulting from centuries of struggle between Parliament (notably the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to dictate law arbitrarily. The major Whig historian, [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|S. R. Gardiner]],{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} popularised the idea that the English Civil War was a \"Puritan Revolution\", which challenged the repressive Stuart Church and prepared the way for [[religious toleration]]. So Puritanism was seen as the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power.\n\nThe Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] school, which became popular in the 1940s, and saw the English Civil War as a [[bourgeois]] revolution. According to Marxist historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]:\n\n{{quote|The Civil War was a class war, in which the despotism of Charles I was defended by the reactionary forces of the established Church and conservative landlords, Parliament beat the King because it could appeal to the enthusiastic support of the trading and industrial classes in town and countryside, to the yeomen and progressive gentry, and to wider masses of the population whenever they were able by free discussion to understand what the struggle was really about.<ref>{{Harvnb |Kaye |1995 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6xVLvqihBoC&pg=PA106#v=onepage p. 106]}} quoting from the pamphlet ''The English Revolution 1640''</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1970s, [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories,<ref name=Burgess>{{harvnb |Burgess |1990 |pp=609\u201327}}.</ref> notably in the 1973 anthology ''The Origins of the English Civil War'' ([[Conrad Russell]] ed.).{{sfn |Russell |1973 |p={{Page needed |date=April 2017}}}} These historians focused on the minutiae of the years immediately before the civil war, so returning to the contingency-based historiography of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon's]] famous ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |p=60}}</ref> This, it was claimed, demonstrated that factional war-allegiance patterns did not fit either Whig or Marxist history.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |p=60}}.</ref> Parliament was not inherently progressive, nor the events of 1640 a precursor for the [[Glorious Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Gaunt |2000 |pp=60\u201361}}.</ref> Furthermore, Puritans did not necessarily ally themselves with Parliamentarians.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament.<ref name=Burgess/>{{Failed verification|date=June 2008}}\n\nFrom the 1990s, a number of historians discarded and replaced the historical title \"English Civil War\" with the titles the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the \"British Civil Wars\", positing that the civil war in England cannot be understood in isolation from events in other parts of Britain and Ireland; King Charles I remains crucial, not just as King of England, but through his relationship with the peoples of his other realms. For example, the wars began when King Charles I tried imposing an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the [[Covenanter]]s, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this forced him to call an English Parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. The English Parliaments were not willing to grant Charles the revenue he needed to pay for the Scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. By the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near-permanent crisis management, often unwilling to concede enough ground to any faction to neutralise the threat, and in some cases doing so would only to antagonise another faction. For example, Charles finally agreed-upon terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion.{{sfn |Ohlmeyer |2002}}\n\n[[Thomas Hobbes]] gives a much earlier historical account of the English Civil War in his ''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'', written in 1668 and published in 1681. He reports that the causes of the war were the doctrines of politics and conflicts that arose from science that disputed those political doctrines.{{sfn|Hobbes|1839|p=220}} ''Behemoth'' offered a uniquely historical and philosophical approach to naming the catalysts for the war. It also served as a statement to explain why Charles I could not hold his place of power and maintain peace in his kingdom.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=33}}\nSpecifically, Hobbes analyses the following aspects of English thought during the war (listed in order of his discussions in ''Behemoth''): the opinions of divinity and politics that spurred rebellion; rhetoric and doctrine used by the rebels against the king; and how opinions about \"taxation, the conscription of soldiers, and military strategy\" affected the outcomes of battles and shifts of sovereignty.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=33}}\n\nHobbes offered a unique contribution to historical interpretation of the civil war through his ''Behemoth'' by connecting the civil war to the motivations of intellectuals who Hobbes reports caused it by trying to spread certain ideas throughout the nation, largely for the sake of displaying their own wisdom and learning.{{sfn |Goldsmith |1966 |pp=x\u2013xiii}} He held the belief that clerical pretensions had contributed significantly to the trouble during the civil war \u2014 \"whether those of puritan fundamentalists, papal supremacists or divine right Episcopalians\".{{sfn |Sommerville |2012}} Hobbes wanted to revoke all of independent power of the clergy and to change the civil system such that they were controlled by the state.\n\nSome scholars suggest that ''Behemoth'' has not received due respect as an academic work, being comparatively overlooked and under-rated in the shadow of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.{{sfn |Kraynak |1990 |p=}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}{{sfn|Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} One factor that may have distracted attention from it as a historical work is that it takes the form of a dialogue. While philosophical dialogues are common, historical ones are not. Other factors that hindered its success include Charles II's refusing its publication and Hobbes' chiefly interpretive approach to the historical narrative.{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}}\n\nMuch can be gleaned about Hobbes as a person from looking at the difficulties he faced while seeking an audience for ''Behemoth''. The essay illuminates a flaw shared by most of Hobbes's political philosophy as well, which is his lack of ability or willingness to empathise with perspectives that largely differed from his own. As his perspective was so much at odds with other views, Hobbes struggled to understand the thinking of most of his potential audience and people in general.{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} For instance, he credits the Presbyterians and Parliamentarians with \"improbably long-planned and wicked ambitions\".{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}} What is more \"he hardly understands the orthodox Royalists (he was himself a highly unorthodox Royalist) any better, and he makes only limited concessions of sincerity to the religious feelings of the various parties\".{{sfn |Macgillivray |1970 |p=179}}\n\n==Re-enactments==\n[[File:Civil war reeanactment.JPG|thumb|right|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nTwo large historical societies exist, [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]] and [[The English Civil War Society]], which regularly [[English Civil War reenactment|re-enact]] events and battles of the Civil War in full period costume.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the English Civil War]], showing events leading up to, culminating in, and resulting from the English Civil Wars.\n* [[First English Civil War, 1642]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1643]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1644]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1645]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1646]]\n* [[Cromwell's Soldiers' Pocket Bible]], booklet Cromwell issued to his army in 1643.\n* [[English Dissenters]]\n* [[William Hiseland]], the last Royalist veteran of the Civil War\n* [[Thirty Years' War]], a defining event in European history during the reign of Charles I\n* The [[Levellers]], a movement for political reform.\n* [[Diggers]]\n<!-- *[[Tyne-Wear rivalry#Origins of the rivalry]] --Needs a source that the Tyne-Wear rivalry is partially based on the Civil War and not just on FTM -->\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite web |ref ={{harvid|Abbott|2020}}\n|last=Abbott |first=Jacob |title=Charles I: Downfall of Strafford and Laud |url = http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=downfall |accessdate=18 February 2020 |year=2020}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=A Life of John Hampden the Patriot 1594\u20131643 |year=1976 |publisher=Macdonald and Jane's Publishers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-354-04014-6}}\n* {{Citation |last=Atkin |first=Malcolm |title=Worcester 1651 |publisher=Pen and Sword |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84415-080-9 |location = Barnsley |pages = }}\n* {{Citation |last=Aylmer |first=G.

It is an industrial chemical that is mainly used in the desalination of brackish water or used as a chemical intermediate and acid neutralizer. ''N'',''N''-Diethylmethylamine is a clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid at room temperature.\n\nDiethylmethylamine is a dangerous and toxic chemical which will cause serious injuries to the human body. There is evidence showing that skin contact with diethylmethylamine will cause a sensitization reaction in some people and chronic exposure may lead to organ damage. Diethylmethylamine can be converted to [[nitrosamine]] through nitrosating agents. In general Nitrosamines are considered to be [[carcinogen|carcinogenic]]. However, it occurs during production in certain foods, cosmetic, and hygeine products as an unwanted byproduct. Not only from the production, nitrosamine can also form during the preparation of production, even at room temperature. The use of [[vitamin C]] and vitamin E can inhibit the formation of nitrosamine. For consumers' safety, commercial goods with a significant amount of nitrosamine are not allowed. Due to those reasons, it must be carefully stored in approved plastic containers and avoid contact with acid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-236115.pdf|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine|last=|first=|date=|website=Santa Cruz Biotechnology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nDiethylmethylamine can be produced by the reaction between [[Methyl p-toluate|methyl toluate]] and [[diethylamine]]:\n\nCH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + HN(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n\nThis reaction required a temperature between 200<sup>o</sup>C to 250<sup>o</sup>C and a pressure between atmospheric and 1000 [[Pounds per square inch|p.s.i]]. The diethylmethylamine produced by the reaction is a typical organic tertiary amine which have the same characteristic as other amine. This was obtained from the experiment results. Since in this reaction, diethylmethylamine is an additional product which only have a little amount, the industrial production may use other reaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Class|first=J.B.|title=Production of diethylemthylamine|publisher=United States Patent Office|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nBasic properties like density and melting point are shown in the information box. The properties also contained part that need be discussed in micro level. Since diethylmethylamine is a polymer, it can have several isomers, the structural of the molecular is always focused.\n\n===Molecular structure and conformation===\nDue to the rotation of a single bond, [[Conformational isomerism|conformational isomers]] are formed. Conformational isomers have the same structural formula but different characteristic. This has always been interested by the scientist. In 1978, Crocker and Goggin had experimented on determined the conformation of diethylmethylamine. They used [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectra]] on diethylmethylamine in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Results showed two conformers exist in the solid phase and can be determined as tt (trans-trans conformer) and g<sup>+</sup>t (gauche<sup>+</sup>-trans conformer). Because of the complexity of the vapor spectrum, they can only infer there are two or more conformers that exist in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Christopher|last2=Goggin|first2=Peter L.|date=1978|title=Infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of conformations in liquid and solid triethyl-, diethyl(methyl)- and ethyldimethyl-amines, -phosphines, and -arsines|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions|issue=5|pages=388|doi=10.1039/dt9780000388|issn=0300-9246}}</ref>\n\nPresent studies used gas-phase IR spectra and FT-Raman spectra of the liquid to get more detailed results. The results of the regular coordinate analysis indicated there were four conformers, and the [[diffraction]] data showed the conformation of diethylmethylamine is 35 (14)% tt + 27 (14)% g<sup>+</sup>t + 20 (17)% g<sup>-</sup>t (gauche<sup>-</sup>-trans conformer) + 18 (23)% g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup>(gauche<sup>+</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer). To confirm the result, a [[Vibrational analysis with scanning probe microscopy|vibrational analysis]] of hydrocarbon analog in the liquid phase was done, and it identified the conformers were the same as diffraction data showed. Moreover, tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers were found more stable than the other two. The conformational stability of diethylmethylamine can be explained by the numbers of trans CNCC fragment that two fragments of tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers trans conformation and one fragment of g<sup>-</sup>t and g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup> conformers trans conformation. Further study showed the reason why diethylmethylamine did't have a g<sup>-</sup>g<sup>+</sup> (gauche<sup>-</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer) conformer that is the steric repulsion between terminal methyl groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Hiroshi|last2=Ito|first2=Masaki|last3=Egawa|first3=Toru|date=2007-09-17|title=Molecular structure and conformation of diethylmethylamine determined by gas electron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|volume=840|issue=1\u20133|pages=107\u2013113|doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2006.11.027|bibcode=2007JMoSt.840..107T|hdl=2115/28245|issn=0022-2860}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereodynamics (dynamics of stereochemical reaction) of N,N-diethylmethylamine ===\ndiethylmethylamine is the simplest trialkylamine that can be tested with two processes about the nitrogen atom in it. The first one is indeed pyramidal inversion, and the second is the isolated rotation of nitrogen carbon bond. From these two processes, the <sup>1</sup>H dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy obtained clear evidence for nitrogen [[pyramidal inversion]]. Also, the result indicates there were several \" familiars\" of [[rotamer]]s exist in diethylmethylamine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bushweller|first=C.H.|last2=Fleischman|first2=S.P.|last3=Grady|first3=G.L.|last4=McGoff|first4=P.|last5=Rithner|first5=C.D.|last6=Whalon|first6=M.R.|last7=Brennan|first7=J.G.|last8=Marcantonio|first8=R.P.|last9=Dominigue|first9=R.P.|date=1982-11-01|title=Stereodynamics of diethylmethylamine and triethylamine|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=104|issue=23|pages=6224\u20136236|doi=10.1021/ja00387a012}}</ref>\n\n=== Rotation inversion ===\nRotation is part of the conformational isomer, so study the rotational isomer help the scientists to understand the chemical better. Rotation study of diethylmethylamine was done by Bushweller and Laurenzi. From the research image of <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine at 200 K, ethyl group shows a A<sub>2</sub> X<sub>3</sub> spectrum and N-methyl protons shows a [[singlet]]. Two resonances can be tested in temperature range 140 K to 200 K---N-methyl and C-methyl resonances and they are independent. The result of DNMR also indicated, the slow nitrogen inversion in diethylmethylamine was caused by the coalescence phenomenon connected with CH<sub>2</sub> resonance. The nitrogen inversion process in diethylmethylamine contained not only the inversion of nitrogen but also rotation about the C-N bond, which can be named as inversion rotation. Inversion rotation means nitrogen inversion always occur with rotation about the C-N bond. Other studies found out that at low temperature (99 K), the <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine has more change. At 99 K, N-methyl and C-methyl resonance separate into more peaks. Two important things need to be mentioned. First, peaks of the N-methyl in diethylmethylamine can be assumed as broad singlets. Second, the C-methyl resonance can be assumed as equivalent for all three methyl protons.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bushweller|first=C.

In research, it can be the lineshape standard of the NMR test. In industry, it always play a role in extraction reaction due to its characteristic.\n\n=== Lineshape standard of nuclear magnetic resonance experiment ===\nFor an [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiment, the most important thing is to make sure the existence of narrow peak and maximum sensitivity, which can be achieved by adjusting shimming field to enhance the [[magnetic field]] homogeneity. A typically used sample is not very useful during low temperature (150 K) experiments, because the peak showed will broaden. Since no available samples can use in low temperature experiments, many tests were done under the condition that the researchers assume the field condition was the same for both low-temperature terms and room temperature conditions. This will influence the NMR result since the change in inhomogeneity is hard to notice. There were research shows in some instrument, re-shimming the field after changing temperature could improve the homogeneity. So, something is a liquid at standard temperature, and pressure has a low melting point is needed.\n\nN, N-diethylmethylamine was used to experiment. As the experimental results show, diethylmethylamine is useful in shimming magnetic field around 140 K. With other research, diethylmethylamine can be used in shimming the magnetic field at room temperature in NMR experiments and low temperature in dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. diethylmethylamine was very useful around 140 K; however, many low-temperature experiments need to proceed below 140 K. Future research need to focus on finding efficiency substitute of diethylmethylamine to work in experiments below 140 K. For now, diethylmethylamine is the best choice among all substances for low-temperature NMR experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritzsching|first=Keith J.|last2=Itin|first2=Boris|last3=McDermott|first3=Ann E.|date=2018-02-21|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine as lineshape standard for NMR above 130\u202fK|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=287|pages=110\u2013112|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.021|pmid=29335163|pmc=5821130|bibcode=2018JMagR.287..110F|issn=1090-7807}}</ref>\n\n=== Extraction of oil sand with microemulsions===\n[[Oil sands|Tar sand]] is an important source of petroleum, which contain 60 percent of the petroleum around the world. Extracting oil from tar sand has become an important part for nowadays industry. One way to extract oil is by using [[microemulsion]]s which are a mixture of oil, water and [[surfactant]]. Extracting oil sand with microemulsions, an important step is to decentralize the light hydrocarbons in the aqueous medium. Usually, alcohols are used as cosurfactants in the microemulsions. A good cosurfactants has two conditions which are strong acid-base type interaction with water and good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. However, some studies showed that diethylmethylamine is a more effective cosurfactants in water than commonly used alcohol. Experimental results indicated that a system based on diethylmethylamine and system based on simple alcohols have a similar feature in microemulsions. The result also pointed out diethylmethylamine reacts as medium chain length alcohols, which has both good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance and high solubility in water and many types of oil. However, this property causes diethylmethylamine has high efficiency and low specificity on nature and temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desnoyers|first=Jacques E.|last2=Quirion|first2=Fran\u00e7ois|last3=H\u00c9Tu|first3=Daniel|last4=Perron|first4=G\u00c9Rald|date=1983|title=Tar sand extractions with microemulsions: I-the dissolution of light hydrocarbons by microemulsions using 2-butoxyethanol and diethylmethylamine as cosurfactants|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=61|issue=5|pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1002/cjce.5450610509|issn=0008-4034}}</ref>\n\n=== Extractive crystallization ===\nExtractive crystallization is a way to obtain crystal besides using boiling. In the past, researchers used [[Diisopropylamine|di-isopropylamine]] (DIPA) to extract water; however, to get the crystal, it need to wait for the solution cool down. To reduce the energy used in refrigeration, diethylmethylamine is decided to use in extractive crystallization since it has similar properties as DIPA and higher [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical solution temperature]]. Critical solution temperature is the boundary that the mixture will mix. If the temperature is under the critical solution temperature, the mixture will remain the state of not mixed. So, a higher critical solution temperature means no refrigeration was needed. From the experiment, first, at low temperature (10<sup>o</sup>C to -0.5<sup>o</sup>C), diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium chloride; however, the percentage of sodium chloride in the organic phase increases. The best temperature range is 5<sup>o</sup>C to 10<sup>o</sup>C. In this range, the solubility of sodium chloride is relatively insensitive to temperature. For the diethylmethylamine/sodium chloride system, the lowest critical solution temperature is -0.6<sup>o</sup>C. Second, diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium sulfate at room temperature (21<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C). In this range, sodium sulfate solubility in diethylmethylamine is relatively insensitive to temperature. Further, for the diethylmethylamine/sodium sulfate system, the lowest critical solution temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ting|first=Andrew M.|last2=Lynn|first2=Scott|last3=Prausnitz|first3=John M.|date=1992-04-01|title=Liquid-liquid equilibria for aqueous systems containing N,N-diethylmethylamine and sodium chloride or sodium sulfate|journal=Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data|volume=37|issue=2|pages=252\u2013259|doi=10.1021/je00006a032|issn=0021-9568}}</ref>\n\n== Reaction with other chemical ==\n\n=== Interfacial bonding mechanisms between iron and diethylmethylamine ===\nMetal are easily be corroded when expose in environment, so polymers are always used on the surface of the metal inhibit it from erosion. Although it's common to use polymers on the surface of metal to prevent it from corrosive things, the interfacial bonding mechanisms between them are not understandable yet. Research was done to understand the intersection mechanisms of dissolved diethylmethylamine (dissolve in [[tetrahydrofuran]]) to iron surface. From the [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] (FTIR) result of unrinsed and rinsed sample, researchers discovered that diethylmethylamine bonds to Fe surface were washed away because of the rinsing. The potential-time respond showed, the potential maintained constant for both unrinsed and rinsed sample. Further test by [[Attenuated total reflectance|ATR-FTIR]] about the iron surface indicated through the reaction all molecular compound still remains the same as original.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=P.|last2=Terryn|first2=H.|last3=Mol|first3=J.M.C.|date=2015-11-01|title=An in situ study of amine and amide molecular interaction on Fe surfaces|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=354|pages=242\u2013249|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.08.042|bibcode=2015ApSS..354..242T|issn=0169-4332}}</ref>\n\n=== Substrate of trimethylamine dehydrogenase half reaction ===\n[[Trimethylamine dehydrogenase]] is an enzyme which used as catalyst in [[chemical reaction]]. Since it's enzyme, a substrate is needed to study the reductive half-reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase. If using [[trimethylamine]] as a substrate, it is hard to characterize the substrate concentration and pH dependence in detail. Diethylmethylamine has similar characteristic with trimethylamine but react slower than trimethylamine. For a better understanding and observation of the reductive half-reaction, diethylmethylamine was chosen to be the substrate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=M.H.|last2=Basran|first2=J.|last3=Scrutton|first3=N.S.|last4=Hille|first4=R.|date=1994-12-09|title=The reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase with diethylmethylamine|url=https://www.jbc.org/content/274/19/13147.long|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=269|issue=49|pages=30869\u201330879|via=|pmid=7983019}}</ref>\n\nAnother research use diethylmethylamine to study the role 6-''S''-cysteinyl-FMN bond of trimethylamine dehydrogenase played in the half-reaction of the enzyme. Since diethylmethylamine is a slow substrate, three well resolved kinetic phases (fast phase, intermediate phase, slow phase) can be observed in detail. This study is mainly to investigate is there any difference between the removal of the 6-''S''-cysteinyl-FMN bond. Through the experiment, K<sub>fast</sub> is depend on the concentration of diethylmethylamine, and K<sub>int</sub> (K<sub>intermediate</sub>), K<sub>slow</sub> are independent to the concentration of diethylmethylamine.

However, diethylmethylamine has two opposite effect in the same reduction, and can change to each other based on different condition. N,N-diethylmethylamine has contrasting effects during the reduction of protons and oxidation of formic acid. Based on different reaction conditions, diethylmethylamine can either inhibit or enhance the electrocatalysis of the liquid. For reduction, it can co-absorb onto Pt surface, which restrains H<sub>upd</sub> absorption onto Pt. For oxidation, it reinforces the oxidation of HCOOH.

It is an industrial chemical that is mainly used in the desalination of brackish water or used as a chemical intermediate and acid neutralizer. ''N'',''N''-Diethylmethylamine is a clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid at room temperature.\n\nDiethylmethylamine is a dangerous and toxic chemical which will cause bad effect on human body. There are evidences show that skin contact with diethylmethylamine will cause a sensitization reaction is some people. And, a few evidences indicate long time exposure in diethylemthylamine may damage organs. Diethylmethylamine is kind of tertiary amine which can become [[nitrosamine]] through nitrosating agents. Nitrosamine is considered as [[carcinogen]]. However, it occurs in certain food and daily use product as a byproduct from production. Not only from the production, nitrosamine can also form during the preparation of production, even at room temperature. Fortunately, by using [[vitamin C]] and vitamin E can stop the formation of nitrosamine. For consumers' safety, commercial goods with significant amount of nitrosamine is not allowed. Due to those reasons, it need be carefully store in approved plastic containers and avoid contact with acid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-236115.pdf|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine|last=|first=|date=|website=Santa Cruz Biotechnology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nDiethylmethylamine can be produced by the reaction between [[Methyl p-toluate|methyl toluate]] and [[diethylamine]]:\n\nCH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + HN(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n\nThis reaction required a temperature between 200<sup>o</sup>C to 250<sup>o</sup>C and a pressure between atmospheric and 1000 [[Pounds per square inch|p.s.i]]. The diethylmethylamine produced by the reaction is a typical organic tertiary amine which have the same characteristic as other amine. This was obtained from the experiment results. Since in this reaction, diethylmethylamine is an additional product which only have a little amount, the industrial production may use other reaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Class|first=J.B.|title=Production of diethylemthylamine|publisher=United States Patent Office|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nBasic properties like density and melting point are shown in the information box. The properties also contained part that need be discussed in micro level. Since diethylmethylamine is a polymer, it can have several isomers, the structural of the molecular is always focused.\n\n===Molecular structure and conformation===\nDue to the rotation of a single bond, [[Conformational isomerism|conformational isomers]] are formed. Conformational isomers have the same structural formula but different characteristic. This has always been interested by the scientist. In 1978, Crocker and Goggin had experimented on determined the conformation of diethylmethylamine. They used [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectra]] on diethylmethylamine in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Results showed two conformers exist in the solid phase and can be determined as tt (trans-trans conformer) and g<sup>+</sup>t (gauche<sup>+</sup>-trans conformer). Because of the complexity of the vapor spectrum, they can only infer there are two or more conformers that exist in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Christopher|last2=Goggin|first2=Peter L.|date=1978|title=Infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of conformations in liquid and solid triethyl-, diethyl(methyl)- and ethyldimethyl-amines, -phosphines, and -arsines|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions|issue=5|pages=388|doi=10.1039/dt9780000388|issn=0300-9246}}</ref>\n\nPresent studies used gas-phase IR spectra and FT-Raman spectra of the liquid to get more detailed results. The results of the regular coordinate analysis indicated there were four conformers, and the [[diffraction]] data showed the conformation of diethylmethylamine is 35 (14)% tt + 27 (14)% g<sup>+</sup>t + 20 (17)% g<sup>-</sup>t (gauche<sup>-</sup>-trans conformer) + 18 (23)% g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup>(gauche<sup>+</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer). To confirm the result, a [[Vibrational analysis with scanning probe microscopy|vibrational analysis]] of hydrocarbon analog in the liquid phase was done, and it identified the conformers were the same as diffraction data showed. Moreover, tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers were found more stable than the other two. The conformational stability of diethylmethylamine can be explained by the numbers of trans CNCC fragment that two fragments of tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers trans conformation and one fragment of g<sup>-</sup>t and g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup> conformers trans conformation. Further study showed the reason why diethylmethylamine did't have a g<sup>-</sup>g<sup>+</sup> (gauche<sup>-</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer) conformer that is the steric repulsion between terminal methyl groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Hiroshi|last2=Ito|first2=Masaki|last3=Egawa|first3=Toru|date=2007-09-17|title=Molecular structure and conformation of diethylmethylamine determined by gas electron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|volume=840|issue=1\u20133|pages=107\u2013113|doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2006.11.027|bibcode=2007JMoSt.840..107T|hdl=2115/28245|issn=0022-2860}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereodynamics (dynamics of stereochemical reaction) of N,N-diethylmethylamine ===\ndiethylmethylamine is the simplest trialkylamine that can be tested with two processes about the nitrogen atom in it. The first one is indeed pyramidal inversion, and the second is the isolated rotation of nitrogen carbon bond. From these two processes, the <sup>1</sup>H dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy obtained clear evidence for nitrogen [[pyramidal inversion]]. Also, the result indicates there were several \" familiars\" of [[rotamer]]s exist in diethylmethylamine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bushweller|first=C.H.|last2=Fleischman|first2=S.P.|last3=Grady|first3=G.L.|last4=McGoff|first4=P.|last5=Rithner|first5=C.D.|last6=Whalon|first6=M.R.|last7=Brennan|first7=J.G.|last8=Marcantonio|first8=R.P.|last9=Dominigue|first9=R.P.|date=1982-11-01|title=Stereodynamics of diethylmethylamine and triethylamine|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=104|issue=23|pages=6224\u20136236|doi=10.1021/ja00387a012}}</ref>\n\n=== Rotation inversion ===\nRotation is part of the conformational isomer, so study the rotational isomer help the scientists to understand the chemical better. Rotation study of diethylmethylamine was done by Bushweller and Laurenzi. From the research image of <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine at 200 K, ethyl group shows a A<sub>2</sub> X<sub>3</sub> spectrum and N-methyl protons shows a [[singlet]]. Two resonances can be tested in temperature range 140 K to 200 K---N-methyl and C-methyl resonances and they are independent. The result of DNMR also indicated, the slow nitrogen inversion in diethylmethylamine was caused by the coalescence phenomenon connected with CH<sub>2</sub> resonance. The nitrogen inversion process in diethylmethylamine contained not only the inversion of nitrogen but also rotation about the C-N bond, which can be named as inversion rotation. Inversion rotation means nitrogen inversion always occur with rotation about the C-N bond. Other studies found out that at low temperature (99 K), the <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine has more change. At 99 K, N-methyl and C-methyl resonance separate into more peaks. Two important things need to be mentioned. First, peaks of the N-methyl in diethylmethylamine can be assumed as broad singlets. Second, the C-methyl resonance can be assumed as equivalent for all three methyl protons.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bushweller|first=C.

In research, it can be the lineshape standard of the NMR test. In industry, it always play a role in extraction reaction due to its characteristic.\n\n=== Lineshape standard of nuclear magnetic resonance experiment ===\nFor an [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiment, the most important thing is to make sure the existence of narrow peak and maximum sensitivity, which can be achieved by adjusting shimming field to enhance the [[magnetic field]] homogeneity. A typically used sample is not very useful during low temperature (150 K) experiments, because the peak showed will broaden. Since no available samples can use in low temperature experiments, many tests were done under the condition that the researchers assume the field condition was the same for both low-temperature terms and room temperature conditions. This will influence the NMR result since the change in inhomogeneity is hard to notice. There were research shows in some instrument, re-shimming the field after changing temperature could improve the homogeneity. So, something is a liquid at standard temperature, and pressure has a low melting point is needed.\n\nN, N-diethylmethylamine was used to experiment. As the experimental results show, diethylmethylamine is useful in shimming magnetic field around 140 K. With other research, diethylmethylamine can be used in shimming the magnetic field at room temperature in NMR experiments and low temperature in dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. diethylmethylamine was very useful around 140 K; however, many low-temperature experiments need to proceed below 140 K. Future research need to focus on finding efficiency substitute of diethylmethylamine to work in experiments below 140 K. For now, diethylmethylamine is the best choice among all substances for low-temperature NMR experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritzsching|first=Keith J.|last2=Itin|first2=Boris|last3=McDermott|first3=Ann E.|date=2018-02-21|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine as lineshape standard for NMR above 130\u202fK|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=287|pages=110\u2013112|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.021|pmid=29335163|pmc=5821130|bibcode=2018JMagR.287..110F|issn=1090-7807}}</ref>\n\n=== Extraction of oil sand with microemulsions===\n[[Oil sands|Tar sand]] is an important source of petroleum, which contain 60 percent of the petroleum around the world. Extracting oil from tar sand has become an important part for nowadays industry. One way to extract oil is by using [[microemulsion]]s which are a mixture of oil, water and [[surfactant]]. Extracting oil sand with microemulsions, an important step is to decentralize the light hydrocarbons in the aqueous medium. Usually, alcohols are used as cosurfactants in the microemulsions. A good cosurfactants has two conditions which are strong acid-base type interaction with water and good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. However, some studies showed that diethylmethylamine is a more effective cosurfactants in water than commonly used alcohol. Experimental results indicated that a system based on diethylmethylamine and system based on simple alcohols have a similar feature in microemulsions. The result also pointed out diethylmethylamine reacts as medium chain length alcohols, which has both good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance and high solubility in water and many types of oil. However, this property causes diethylmethylamine has high efficiency and low specificity on nature and temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desnoyers|first=Jacques E.|last2=Quirion|first2=Fran\u00e7ois|last3=H\u00c9Tu|first3=Daniel|last4=Perron|first4=G\u00c9Rald|date=1983|title=Tar sand extractions with microemulsions: I-the dissolution of light hydrocarbons by microemulsions using 2-butoxyethanol and diethylmethylamine as cosurfactants|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=61|issue=5|pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1002/cjce.5450610509|issn=0008-4034}}</ref>\n\n=== Extractive crystallization ===\nExtractive crystallization is a way to obtain crystal besides using boiling. In the past, researchers used [[Diisopropylamine|di-isopropylamine]] (DIPA) to extract water; however, to get the crystal, it need to wait for the solution cool down. To reduce the energy used in refrigeration, diethylmethylamine is decided to use in extractive crystallization since it has similar properties as DIPA and higher [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical solution temperature]]. Critical solution temperature is the boundary that the mixture will mix. If the temperature is under the critical solution temperature, the mixture will remain the state of not mixed. So, a higher critical solution temperature means no refrigeration was needed. From the experiment, first, at low temperature (10<sup>o</sup>C to -0.5<sup>o</sup>C), diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium chloride; however, the percentage of sodium chloride in the organic phase increases. The best temperature range is 5<sup>o</sup>C to 10<sup>o</sup>C. In this range, the solubility of sodium chloride is relatively insensitive to temperature. For the diethylmethylamine/sodium chloride system, the lowest critical solution temperature is -0.6<sup>o</sup>C. Second, diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium sulfate at room temperature (21<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C). In this range, sodium sulfate solubility in diethylmethylamine is relatively insensitive to temperature. Further, for the diethylmethylamine/sodium sulfate system, the lowest critical solution temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ting|first=Andrew M.|last2=Lynn|first2=Scott|last3=Prausnitz|first3=John M.|date=1992-04-01|title=Liquid-liquid equilibria for aqueous systems containing N,N-diethylmethylamine and sodium chloride or sodium sulfate|journal=Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data|volume=37|issue=2|pages=252\u2013259|doi=10.1021/je00006a032|issn=0021-9568}}</ref>\n\n== Reaction with other chemical ==\n\n=== Interfacial bonding mechanisms between iron and diethylmethylamine ===\nMetal are easily be corroded when expose in environment, so polymers are always used on the surface of the metal inhibit it from erosion. Although it's common to use polymers on the surface of metal to prevent it from corrosive things, the interfacial bonding mechanisms between them are not understandable yet. Research was done to understand the intersection mechanisms of dissolved diethylmethylamine (dissolve in [[tetrahydrofuran]]) to iron surface. From the [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] (FTIR) result of unrinsed and rinsed sample, researchers discovered that diethylmethylamine bonds to Fe surface were washed away because of the rinsing. The potential-time respond showed, the potential maintained constant for both unrinsed and rinsed sample. Further test by [[Attenuated total reflectance|ATR-FTIR]] about the iron surface indicated through the reaction all molecular compound still remains the same as original.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=P.|last2=Terryn|first2=H.|last3=Mol|first3=J.M.C.|date=2015-11-01|title=An in situ study of amine and amide molecular interaction on Fe surfaces|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=354|pages=242\u2013249|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.08.042|bibcode=2015ApSS..354..242T|issn=0169-4332}}</ref>\n\n=== Substrate of trimethylamine dehydrogenase half reaction ===\n[[Trimethylamine dehydrogenase]] is an enzyme which used as catalyst in [[chemical reaction]]. Since it's enzyme, a substrate is needed to study the reductive half-reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase. If using [[trimethylamine]] as a substrate, it is hard to characterize the substrate concentration and pH dependence in detail. Diethylmethylamine has similar characteristic with trimethylamine but react slower than trimethylamine. For a better understanding and observation of the reductive half-reaction, diethylmethylamine was chosen to be the substrate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=M.H.|last2=Basran|first2=J.|last3=Scrutton|first3=N.S.|last4=Hille|first4=R.|date=1994-12-09|title=The reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase with diethylmethylamine|url=https://www.jbc.org/content/274/19/13147.long|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=269|issue=49|pages=30869\u201330879|via=|pmid=7983019}}</ref>\n\nAnother research use diethylmethylamine to study the role 6-''S''-cysteinyl-FMN bond of trimethylamine dehydrogenase played in the half-reaction of the enzyme.

This study is mainly to investigate is there any difference between the removal of the 6-''S''-cysteinyl-FMN bond. Through the experiment, K<sub>fast</sub> is depend on the concentration of diethylmethylamine, and K<sub>int</sub> (K<sub>intermediate</sub>), K<sub>slow</sub> are independent to the concentration of diethylmethylamine.

N,N-diethylmethylamine has contrasting effects during the reduction of protons and oxidation of formic acid. Based on different reaction conditions, diethylmethylamine can either inhibit or enhance the electrocatalysis of the liquid.

From the [[river source|headwaters]] at [[Xing'an County]], [[Guangxi]], the West Branch flows approximately {{convert|262|km}} to ''[[Ping Island]]'' of [[Yongzhou]], where it is joined by the [[Xiao River]] to form the middle Xiang River.<ref name=\"Left Branch\">about Xiang River in Guangxi Reachers, according to the ''Guangxi General Description'' (\u5e7f\u897f\u901a\u5fd7)/Geographica of Guangxi (\u5730\u7406\u5fd7)/Waters and Rivers (\u6c34\u7cfb\u6c34\u6587) - the Yangtze River System (\u957f\u6c5f\u6c34\u7cfb), see [http://www.gxdqw.com/bin/mse.exe?seachword=&K=a&A=69&rec=79&run=13 gxdqw.com (the Yangtze River System in Guangxi)]</ref>\n\nHistorically it was recognized that the headwaters of the Xiang rise in [[Haiyang Mountains]]. People say the Xiang and the [[Li River (Guangxi)|Li River]]s share the same origin, because the upper reaches of the two rivers are connected by  the ancient  [[Lingqu Canal]], which is located in [[Xing'an County]], [[Guangxi]].  According to a traditional saying, 70% of the water in Lingqu flows into the Xiang and 30% flows into the Li River. In the past, the canal, along with the Xiang River and the [[Gui River]] provided an important waterway connecting the Yangtze River with the [[Pearl River Delta]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ Lingqu Canal (Xiang'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Qin Dynasty)] (Nomination for the UNESCO Heritage List)</ref>\n\n===Xiao River===\nThe ''[[Xiao River]]'' is the East Branch of the upper course.

In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city.  Production was maintained during World War II, despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing.\n[[File:Ducati Werk.JPG|thumb|left|Ducati Factory]]\n[[File:Ducati Vilar Cucciolo 1950.jpg|left|thumb|Ducati \"Cucciolo\", 1950]]\nMeanwhile, at the small [[Turin]]ese firm SIATA (''Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie''), Aldo Farinelli began developing a small [[pushrod]] [[Motorized bicycle|engine for mounting on bicycles]]. Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944, SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine, called the [[Ducati Cucciolo|\"Cucciolo\"]] (Italian for \"puppy,\" in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound) to the public. The first Cucciolos were available alone, to be mounted on standard bicycles, by the buyer; however, businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity, and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale.\n\nIn 1950, after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold, in collaboration with SIATA, the Ducati firm finally offered its own Cucciolo-based motorcycle. This first Ducati motorcycle was a 48&nbsp;cc bike weighing {{Convert|98|lb}}, with a top speed of {{convert|abbr=on|40|mph|0}}, and had a {{convert|15|mm |in |adj=mid|[[carburetor]] |abbr=in}} giving just under {{convert|abbr=on|200|mpgus}}.

Despite being described as the most interesting new machine at the 1952 show, the Cruiser was not a great success, and only a few thousand were made over a two-year period before the model ceased production.\n\nIn 1953, management split the company into two separate entities, Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica, in acknowledgment of its diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250&nbsp;cc road bike then available, the [[Ducati Mach 1|Mach 1]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ducati.com/heritage/anni60/mach1/mach1.jhtml |title= Mach 1 |publisher= ducati.com |accessdate= 25 January 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"DUCATI-MOTOR-HOLDING-SPA-Jun-2004-20-F\">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2325/115697304000783/filing-main.htm |title=DUCATI MOTOR HOLDING SPA, Form 20-F, Annual and Transition Report (foreign private issuer), Filing Date Jun 30, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mecossemi.com/H4FrameSet_L.html|title=History of the Motorcycle |publisher= mecossemi.com |accessdate= 25 January 2007}}</ref> In the 1970s Ducati began producing large-displacement [[V-twin engine|V-twin]]  motorcycles and in 1973, released a V-twin with the trademarked [[desmodromic valve]] design. In 1985, [[Cagiva]] bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the \"Cagiva\" name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the \"Ducati\" name on its motorcycles. Eleven years later, in 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer from [[Texas Pacific Group]] and sold a 51% stake in the company for US$325 million; then, in 1998, Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49% to become the sole owner of Ducati. In 1999, TPG issued an [[initial public offering]] of Ducati stock and renamed the company \"Ducati Motor Holding SpA\". TPG sold over 65% of its shares in Ducati, leaving TPG the majority shareholder. In December 2005, Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific's stake (minus one share) to Investindustrial Holdings, the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi.\n\nIn April 2012, [[Volkswagen Group]]'s [[Audi]] subsidiary announced its intention to buy Ducati for \u20ac{{Format price|860000000}} (US${{Format price|1200000000}}). Volkswagen chairman [[Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch]], a motorcycle enthusiast, had long coveted Ducati, and had regretted that he passed up an opportunity to buy the company from the Italian government in 1984.

Modern Ducatis remain among the dominant performance motorcycles available today partly because of the desmodromic valve design, which is nearing its 50th year of use. Desmodromic valves are closed with a separate, dedicated cam lobe and lifter instead of the conventional valve [[spring (device)|springs]] used in most internal combustion engines in consumer vehicles. This allows the cams to have a more radical profile, thus opening and closing the valves more quickly without the risk of valve-float, which causes a loss of power that is likely when using a \"passive\" closing mechanism under the same conditions.\n\nWhile most other manufacturers use [[wet clutch]]es (with the spinning parts bathed in oil)<ref name=\"Transmissions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/our_company/news_item.php?news_id=45|title=What is in an oil|publisher=yamaha-motor.ca|accessdate=25 January 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117211117/http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/our_company/news_item.php?news_id=45|archivedate=17 November 2007}}</ref> Ducati previously used multiplate [[dry clutch]]es in many of their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the power loss from oil viscosity drag on the engine, even though the engagement may not be as smooth as the oil-bath versions, but the clutch plates can wear more rapidly.  Ducati has converted to wet clutches across their current product lines.\n\nDucati also extensively uses a [[Space frame|trellis frame]], although Ducati's MotoGP project broke with this tradition by introducing a revolutionary carbon fibre frame for the Ducati Desmosedici GP9.\n\n==Product history==\n{{see also|Ducati Museum}}\nThe chief designer of most Ducati motorcycles in the 1950s was [[Fabio Taglioni]] (1920\u20132001). His designs ranged from the small single-cylinder machines that were successful in the Italian 'street races' to the large-capacity twins of the 1980s. Ducati introduced the [[Ducati Pantah|Pantah]] in 1979; its engine was updated in the 1990s in the [[Ducati SuperSport]] (SS) series. All modern Ducati engines are derivatives of the Pantah, which uses a toothed belt to actuate the engine's valves. Taglioni used the [[Ferrari#Identity|Cavallino Rampante]] (identified with the [[Ferrari]] brand) on his Ducati motorbikes. Taglioni chose this emblem of courage and daring as a sign of respect and admiration for [[Francesco Baracca]], a heroic World War I fighter pilot who died during an air raid in 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ducati.com/heritage/protagonisti/fabiotaglioni6.jhtml|title=Fabio Taglioni: a Legend|publisher=ducati.com|accessdate=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===1950s===\n{{main|Ducati singles}}\n\n===1960s===\n{{main|Ducati singles}}\n{{see also|Ducati Apollo}}\n{{Expand section|date=November 2009}}\n\n===1970s===\n{{main|Ducati V-twin engine}}\n\nIn 1973, Ducati commemorated its 1972 win at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] 200 with the production model green frame Ducati 750 SuperSport.\n\nDucati also targeted the offroad market with the two-stroke Regolarit\u00e0 125, building 3,486 models from 1975 to 1979, but the bike was not successful.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/the-ducati-regolarita.aspx |title= Ducati Regolarit\u00e0 125 |publisher=Motorcycle Classics |accessdate= 15 December 2011 |date= January\u2013February 2011 |author= Alan Cathcart}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the company introduced the [[Ducati 860 GT|860 GT]], designed by noted car stylist [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]].

Ducati is best known for its [[V-twin engine]], called an L-twin by the company, which is the powerplant in the majority of Ducati-marqued motorcycles.\nDucati has also manufactured engines with one, two, three or four cylinders; operated by pull rod valves and push rod valves; single, double and triple overhead camshafts; [[two-stroke]] and even at one stage manufactured small diesel engines, many of which were used to power boats, generators, garden machinery and emergency pumps (for example, for fire fighting). The engines were the IS series from {{convert|7|to|22|hp|abbr=on}} air-cooled and the larger twin DM series water- and air-cooled. The engines have been found in all parts of the globe. Wisconsin Diesel even assembled and \"badge engineered\" the engines in the USA. They have also produced outboard motors for marine use. Currently, Ducati makes no other engines except for its motorcycles.\n\nOn current Ducati motors, except for the Desmosedici and 1199 Panigale, the valves are actuated by a standard valve cam shaft which is rotated by a [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]] driven by the motor directly. The teeth on the belt keep the [[camshaft]] drive pulleys indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to the camshaft through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older [[single-cylinder]] motorcycles \u2014 the shaft tube is visible on the outside of the cylinder.\n\nDucati is also famous for using the desmodromic valve system championed by engineer and designer Fabio Taglioni, though the firm has also used engines that use valve springs to close their valves. In the early days, Ducati reserved the desmodromic valve heads for its higher performance bikes and its race bikes. These valves do not suffer from [[valve float]] at high engine speeds, thus a desmodromic engine is capable of far higher revolutions than a similarly configured engine with traditional spring-valve heads.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Ducati produced a wide range of small two-stroke bikes, mainly sub-100&nbsp;cc capacities. Large quantities of some models were exported to the United States.\n\nDucati has produced the following motorcycle engine types:\n* Single-cylinder,\n**pullrod actuated, 48&nbsp;cc and 65&nbsp;cc (Cucciolo)\n**pushrod actuated, 98 and 125&nbsp;cc\n**two-stroke, 50, 80, 90, 100, 125&nbsp;cc\n**bevel actuated, spring valved: 98&nbsp;cc, 100&nbsp;cc, 125&nbsp;cc, 160&nbsp;cc, 175&nbsp;cc, 200&nbsp;cc, 239&nbsp;cc, 250&nbsp;cc, 350&nbsp;cc, 450&nbsp;cc\n**bevel actuated, desmodromic valved : 125&nbsp;cc, 239&nbsp;cc, 250&nbsp;cc, 350&nbsp;cc and 450&nbsp;cc\n**belt actuated, desmodromic valved : 549/572&nbsp;cc [[Ducati Supermono|Supermono]], only 65 made.\n* Two-cylinder,\n**bevel actuated, spring valved (V-twin): 750&nbsp;cc, 860&nbsp;cc\n**bevel actuated, desmo valved (V-twin): 750&nbsp;cc, 860&nbsp;cc, 900 cc, 973&nbsp;cc (Mille)\n**bevel actuated, desmo valved (parallel twin): 125&nbsp;cc,\n**chain actuated, spring valved (parallel twin): 350&nbsp;cc, 500&nbsp;cc (GTL)\n**chain actuated, desmo valved (parallel twin): 500&nbsp;cc (500SD)\n**belt actuated, desmo valved (V-twin): Almost all motors since 1986.\n* Four-cylinder,\n**gear actuated, desmo valved (V4): Prototype [[Ducati Desmosedici|Desmosedici]], and Low volume Production [[Ducati Desmosedici RR|Desmosedici RR]], 1,500 made\n**pushrod actuated, spring valved (V4): Prototype [[Ducati Apollo|Apollo]], only two made.\n\n==Enthusiasts groups==\nA key part of Ducati's marketing strategy since the 1990s has been fostering a distinct community identity in connection with branding efforts including online communities and local, regional and national Ducati enthusiast clubs.

In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city.  Production was maintained during World War II, despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing.\n[[File:Ducati Werk.JPG|thumb|left|Ducati Factory]]\n[[File:Ducati Vilar Cucciolo 1950.jpg|left|thumb|Ducati \"Cucciolo\", 1950]]\nMeanwhile, at the small [[Turin]]ese firm SIATA (''Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie''), Aldo Farinelli began developing a small [[pushrod]] [[Motorized bicycle|engine for mounting on bicycles]]. Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944, SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine, called the [[Ducati Cucciolo|\"Cucciolo\"]] (Italian for \"puppy,\" in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound) to the public. The first Cucciolos were available alone, to be mounted on standard bicycles, by the buyer; however, businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity, and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale.\n\nIn 1950, after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold, in collaboration with SIATA, the Ducati firm finally offered its own Cucciolo-based motorcycle. This first Ducati motorcycle was a 48&nbsp;cc bike weighing {{Convert|98|lb}}, with a top speed of {{convert|abbr=on|40|mph|0}}, and had a {{convert|15|mm |in |adj=mid|[[carburetor]] |abbr=in}} giving just under {{convert|abbr=on|200|mpgus}}. Ducati soon dropped the Cucciolo name in favor of \"55M\" and \"65TL\".\n[[File:Scooters.Assisi026.jpg|thumb|Ducati 175 Cruiser, 1952]]\n[[File:Ducati mach1 800.jpg|thumb|[[Ducati Mach 1]]]]\nWhen the market moved toward larger motorcycles, Ducati management decided to respond, making an impression at an early-1952 Milan show, introducing their 65TS cycle and Cruiser (a four-stroke [[motor scooter]]). Despite being described as the most interesting new machine at the 1952 show, the Cruiser was not a great success, and only a few thousand were made over a two-year period before the model ceased production.\n\nIn 1953, management split the company into two separate entities, Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica, in acknowledgment of its diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250&nbsp;cc road bike then available, the [[Ducati Mach 1|Mach 1]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ducati.com/heritage/anni60/mach1/mach1.jhtml |title= Mach 1 |publisher= ducati.com |accessdate= 25 January 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"DUCATI-MOTOR-HOLDING-SPA-Jun-2004-20-F\">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2325/115697304000783/filing-main.htm |title=DUCATI MOTOR HOLDING SPA, Form 20-F, Annual and Transition Report (foreign private issuer), Filing Date Jun 30, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mecossemi.com/H4FrameSet_L.html|title=History of the Motorcycle |publisher= mecossemi.com |accessdate= 25 January 2007}}</ref> In the 1970s Ducati began producing large-displacement [[V-twin engine|V-twin]]  motorcycles and in 1973, released a V-twin with the trademarked [[desmodromic valve]] design. In 1985, [[Cagiva]] bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the \"Cagiva\" name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the \"Ducati\" name on its motorcycles. Eleven years later, in 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer from [[Texas Pacific Group]] and sold a 51% stake in the company for US$325 million; then, in 1998, Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49% to become the sole owner of Ducati. In 1999, TPG issued an [[initial public offering]] of Ducati stock and renamed the company \"Ducati Motor Holding SpA\". TPG sold over 65% of its shares in Ducati, leaving TPG the majority shareholder. In December 2005, Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific's stake (minus one share) to Investindustrial Holdings, the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi.\n\nIn April 2012, [[Volkswagen Group]]'s [[Audi]] subsidiary announced its intention to buy Ducati for \u20ac{{Format price|860000000}} (US${{Format price|1200000000}}). Volkswagen chairman [[Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch]], a motorcycle enthusiast, had long coveted Ducati, and had regretted that he passed up an opportunity to buy the company from the Italian government in 1984. Analysts doubted a tiny motorcycle maker would have a meaningful effect on a company the size of Volkswagen, commenting that the acquisition has \"a trophy feel to it,\" and, \"is driven by VW's passion for nameplates rather than industrial or financial logic\". Italian luxury car brand [[Lamborghini]] was strengthened under VW ownership.<ref name=Cremer2012>{{Cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/audi-ducati-idUSL6E8FH5DR20120417 |title= UPDATE 2-Audi to pay about 860 mln euros for Ducati |agency= Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date= 17 April 2012 |first1= Andreas |last1=Cremer |first2=Christiaan |last2=Hetzner |accessdate= 17 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=Schultz2012>{{Citation |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Volkswagen Group to Add Ducati to Product Portfolio |first= Jonathan |last= Schultz |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/volkswagen-group-adds-ducati-to-product-portfolio |accessdate= 18 April 2012 }}</ref> AUDI AG's Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. subsidiary acquired 100 percent of the shares of Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. on 19 July 2012 for \u20ac{{Format price|747000000}} (US${{Format price|909323100}}).<ref name=audi_ifr_2012 />\n\n=== Ownership ===\nSince 1926, Ducati has been owned by a number of groups and companies.\n* 1926\u20131950 \u2013 Ducati family\n* 1950\u20131967 \u2013 Government [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale]] (IRI) management\n* 1967\u20131978 \u2013 Government EFIM management (control over day-to-day factory operations)\n** 1967\u20131973 \u2013 Headed By Giuseppe Montano<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SiJoP6aevEC&pg=PA12&dq=montano+ducati#PPA10,M1 |title=The Ducati Bible |author=Ian Falloon |publisher=Veloce Publishing |date=10 August 2006|accessdate=15 October 2010|isbn=978-1-84584-012-9}}</ref>\n** 1973\u20131978 \u2013 Headed by Cristiano de Eccher<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kAFtPvnegT8C&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=ducati+De+Eccher&source=bl&ots=ZyS-rrM1iN&sig=WHrqMlJ6hLIhasgqDlszU9ROAb4&hl=en&ei=I9AtSp_GE4SgM_7V8PIJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#PPA9,M1 The Ducati Bible: 860, 900 & Mille, Ian Falloon].

Modern Ducatis remain among the dominant performance motorcycles available today partly because of the desmodromic valve design, which is nearing its 50th year of use. Desmodromic valves are closed with a separate, dedicated cam lobe and lifter instead of the conventional valve [[spring (device)|springs]] used in most internal combustion engines in consumer vehicles. This allows the cams to have a more radical profile, thus opening and closing the valves more quickly without the risk of valve-float, which causes a loss of power that is likely when using a \"passive\" closing mechanism under the same conditions.\n\nWhile most other manufacturers use [[wet clutch]]es (with the spinning parts bathed in oil)<ref name=\"Transmissions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/our_company/news_item.php?news_id=45|title=What is in an oil|publisher=yamaha-motor.ca|accessdate=25 January 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117211117/http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/our_company/news_item.php?news_id=45|archivedate=17 November 2007}}</ref> Ducati previously used multiplate [[dry clutch]]es in many of their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the power loss from oil viscosity drag on the engine, even though the engagement may not be as smooth as the oil-bath versions, but the clutch plates can wear more rapidly.  Ducati has converted to wet clutches across their current product lines.\n\nDucati also extensively uses a [[Space frame|trellis frame]], although Ducati's MotoGP project broke with this tradition by introducing a revolutionary carbon fibre frame for the Ducati Desmosedici GP9.\n\n==Product history==\n{{see also|Ducati Museum}}\nThe chief designer of most Ducati motorcycles in the 1950s was [[Fabio Taglioni]] (1920\u20132001). His designs ranged from the small single-cylinder machines that were successful in the Italian 'street races' to the large-capacity twins of the 1980s. Ducati introduced the [[Ducati Pantah|Pantah]] in 1979; its engine was updated in the 1990s in the [[Ducati SuperSport]] (SS) series. All modern Ducati engines are derivatives of the Pantah, which uses a toothed belt to actuate the engine's valves. Taglioni used the [[Ferrari#Identity|Cavallino Rampante]] (identified with the [[Ferrari]] brand) on his Ducati motorbikes. Taglioni chose this emblem of courage and daring as a sign of respect and admiration for [[Francesco Baracca]], a heroic World War I fighter pilot who died during an air raid in 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ducati.com/heritage/protagonisti/fabiotaglioni6.jhtml|title=Fabio Taglioni: a Legend|publisher=ducati.com|accessdate=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===1950s===\n{{main|Ducati singles}}\n\n===1960s===\n{{main|Ducati singles}}\n{{see also|Ducati Apollo}}\n{{Expand section|date=November 2009}}\n\n===1970s===\n{{main|Ducati V-twin engine}}\n\nIn 1973, Ducati commemorated its 1972 win at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] 200 with the production model green frame Ducati 750 SuperSport.\n\nDucati also targeted the offroad market with the two-stroke Regolarit\u00e0 125, building 3,486 models from 1975 to 1979, but the bike was not successful.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/the-ducati-regolarita.aspx |title= Ducati Regolarit\u00e0 125 |publisher=Motorcycle Classics |accessdate= 15 December 2011 |date= January\u2013February 2011 |author= Alan Cathcart}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the company introduced the [[Ducati 860 GT|860 GT]], designed by noted car stylist [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]].

Ducati is best known for its [[V-twin engine]], called an L-twin by the company, which is the powerplant in the majority of Ducati-marqued motorcycles.\nDucati has also manufactured engines with one, two, three or four cylinders; operated by pull rod valves and push rod valves; single, double and triple overhead camshafts; [[two-stroke]] and even at one stage manufactured small diesel engines, many of which were used to power boats, generators, garden machinery and emergency pumps (for example, for fire fighting). The engines were the IS series from {{convert|7|to|22|hp|abbr=on}} air-cooled and the larger twin DM series water- and air-cooled. The engines have been found in all parts of the globe. Wisconsin Diesel even assembled and \"badge engineered\" the engines in the USA. They have also produced outboard motors for marine use. Currently, Ducati makes no other engines except for its motorcycles.\n\nOn current Ducati motors, except for the Desmosedici and 1199 Panigale, the valves are actuated by a standard valve cam shaft which is rotated by a [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]] driven by the motor directly. The teeth on the belt keep the [[camshaft]] drive pulleys indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to the camshaft through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older [[single-cylinder]] motorcycles \u2014 the shaft tube is visible on the outside of the cylinder.\n\nDucati is also famous for using the desmodromic valve system championed by engineer and designer Fabio Taglioni, though the firm has also used engines that use valve springs to close their valves. In the early days, Ducati reserved the desmodromic valve heads for its higher performance bikes and its race bikes. These valves do not suffer from [[valve float]] at high engine speeds, thus a desmodromic engine is capable of far higher revolutions than a similarly configured engine with traditional spring-valve heads.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Ducati produced a wide range of small two-stroke bikes, mainly sub-100&nbsp;cc capacities. Large quantities of some models were exported to the United States.\n\nDucati has produced the following motorcycle engine types:\n* Single-cylinder,\n**pullrod actuated, 48&nbsp;cc and 65&nbsp;cc (Cucciolo)\n**pushrod actuated, 98 and 125&nbsp;cc\n**two-stroke, 50, 80, 90, 100, 125&nbsp;cc\n**bevel actuated, spring valved: 98&nbsp;cc, 100&nbsp;cc, 125&nbsp;cc, 160&nbsp;cc, 175&nbsp;cc, 200&nbsp;cc, 239&nbsp;cc, 250&nbsp;cc, 350&nbsp;cc, 450&nbsp;cc\n**bevel actuated, desmodromic valved : 125&nbsp;cc, 239&nbsp;cc, 250&nbsp;cc, 350&nbsp;cc and 450&nbsp;cc\n**belt actuated, desmodromic valved : 549/572&nbsp;cc [[Ducati Supermono|Supermono]], only 65 made.\n* Two-cylinder,\n**bevel actuated, spring valved (V-twin): 750&nbsp;cc, 860&nbsp;cc\n**bevel actuated, desmo valved (V-twin): 750&nbsp;cc, 860&nbsp;cc, 900 cc, 973&nbsp;cc (Mille)\n**bevel actuated, desmo valved (parallel twin): 125&nbsp;cc,\n**chain actuated, spring valved (parallel twin): 350&nbsp;cc, 500&nbsp;cc (GTL)\n**chain actuated, desmo valved (parallel twin): 500&nbsp;cc (500SD)\n**belt actuated, desmo valved (V-twin): Almost all motors since 1986.\n* Four-cylinder,\n**gear actuated, desmo valved (V4): Prototype [[Ducati Desmosedici|Desmosedici]], and Low volume Production [[Ducati Desmosedici RR|Desmosedici RR]], 1,500 made\n**pushrod actuated, spring valved (V4): Prototype [[Ducati Apollo|Apollo]], only two made.\n\n==Enthusiasts groups==\nA key part of Ducati's marketing strategy since the 1990s has been fostering a distinct community identity in connection with branding efforts including online communities and local, regional and national Ducati enthusiast clubs.
