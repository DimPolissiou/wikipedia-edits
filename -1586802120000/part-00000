Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.\n\n''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments. However, some criticized its difficulty and weak [[multiplayer]] mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million copies. The Wisp power-ups introduced in ''Sonic Colors'' became a staple of the ''Sonic'' series.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Premise and setting===\n[[File:Sonic_Colors_gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Sonic Colors'', showing Sonic in one of the game's levels]]\n''Sonic Colors'' is a [[platform game]] set in [[outer space]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], whose goal is to save the [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, an alien race that has been enslaved by [[Doctor Eggman]].<ref name=\"ignwii\" /> The game's main [[Overworld#Platform games|hub]] is Doctor Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, an interplanetary [[amusement park]] that consists of six small planets chained to each other.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> Sonic must be guided through these planets to destroy the power source at their center.<ref name=\"nwr\"/>\n\nEach planet is split into seven parts: six main [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] called acts and a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] level.<ref name=\"gswii\" /> In each act, players must guide Sonic to the goal, whilst defeating enemies and dodging obstacles. In boss levels, players face one of Eggman's large robots, and must defeat it. Gameplay seamlessly shifts between [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] and [[Third-person view|third-person]] perspectives.<ref name=\"gswii\" /><ref name=\"wired\" /> Upon completion of a level, players are given a grade dependent on their performance, with an \"S\" being the best and a \"D\" being the worst.<ref name=\"James Newton\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|title=Sonic Colours Review \u2013 Wii|last=Newton|first=James|website=Nintendo Life|publisher=Gamer Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126165734/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/11/sonic_colours_wii|archive-date=January 26, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref> As the player progresses through the game, more planets become available to select.

The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.\n\nSonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.\n\nHowever, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box|quote= From a general game design perspective, in recent years we've been able to introduce Sonic to new fans, a lot of the Nintendo/''Mario'' fans, and because of that, we've made changes to the design, and we've designed things in ''Sonic Colors'' that we think will really appeal to people who are unfamiliar with the Sonic brand and the Sonic gameplay.|source=Takashi Iizuka, on why ''Sonic Colors'' was designed to appeal to a wider demographic.<ref name=\"vg\"/> |width=30em|quoted=1}}\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''Sonic Unleashed''.<ref name=\"Q&A\">{{cite web|last1=Earwaker|first1=Kiran|title=Sonic Colours \u2013 Q&A Feature|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|website=Total Video Games|accessdate=July 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606165905/http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|archivedate=June 6, 2015|date=August 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> While they kept most of ''Unleashed''{{'}}s core gameplay elements,<ref name=\"sonicstadiuminterview\">{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Jason|title=E3 2010 Q&A: Takashi Iizuka on Sonic Colors|url=https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|website=Sonic Stadium|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002057/https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> developers [[Sonic Team]] and [[Dimps]] decided to create an equal balance between speed and platforming similar to that of the games released for the Sega Genesis, in comparison to the straightforward gameplay of ''Unleashed''.<ref name=\"spong interview\">{{cite web|last1=Joscelyne|first1=Svend|title=Interviews// Sonic Colours Producer, Takashi Iizuka|url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|website=SPOnG|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68WAmiXNY?url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|archivedate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> Following requests by fans, the team also made the decision to make Sonic the only playable character, and to omit \"gimmick\" themes such as the [[swordplay]] mechanic used in the 2009 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]''.<ref name=\"canvas\"/> The team chose to develop ''Sonic Colors'' on [[Nintendo]]'s Wii and DS consoles, hoping to expand upon the audience attracted by the successful ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] games.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/>\n\nOne of the first ideas was the setting should be an amusement park; Sonic Team then realized that \"any sort of terrestrial amusement park would be too small to contain Sonic's adventures.\" From this came the idea of an interplanetary park, which would allow for more creativity and variance in the game.<ref name=\"canvas\">{{Cite journal|title=Fresh Canvas|journal=[[Nintendo Power]]|last=Thomason|first=Steve|date=July 2010|issue=256|pages=50\u201357}}</ref> The developers used [[Disneyland]] as visual inspiration for the levels.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/> Sonic Team also desired something that would diversify the gameplay, but did not slow it down.

An installment in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, it follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s quest to stop his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] from enslaving an alien race and taking over the world. The gameplay is similar to prior ''Sonic'' games, with players collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies; the camera perspective occasionally switches from [[Third-person view|third-person]] to [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] perspectives. The game also introduces [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, [[power-ups]] the player can use to increase attack power and reach new areas.\n\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.\n\n''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments.

The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.\n\nSonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.\n\nHowever, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box|quote= From a general game design perspective, in recent years we've been able to introduce Sonic to new fans, a lot of the Nintendo/''Mario'' fans, and because of that, we've made changes to the design, and we've designed things in ''Sonic Colors'' that we think will really appeal to people who are unfamiliar with the Sonic brand and the Sonic gameplay.|source=Takashi Iizuka, on why ''Sonic Colors'' was designed to appeal to a wider demographic.<ref name=\"vg\"/> |width=30em|quoted=1}}\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''Sonic Unleashed''.<ref name=\"Q&A\">{{cite web|last1=Earwaker|first1=Kiran|title=Sonic Colours \u2013 Q&A Feature|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|website=Total Video Games|accessdate=July 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606165905/http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|archivedate=June 6, 2015|date=August 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> While they kept most of ''Unleashed''{{'}}s core gameplay elements,<ref name=\"sonicstadiuminterview\">{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Jason|title=E3 2010 Q&A: Takashi Iizuka on Sonic Colors|url=https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|website=Sonic Stadium|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002057/https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> developers [[Sonic Team]] and [[Dimps]] decided to create an equal balance between speed and platforming similar to that of the games released for the Sega Genesis, in comparison to the straightforward gameplay of ''Unleashed''.<ref name=\"spong interview\">{{cite web|last1=Joscelyne|first1=Svend|title=Interviews// Sonic Colours Producer, Takashi Iizuka|url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|website=SPOnG|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68WAmiXNY?url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|archivedate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> Following requests by fans, the team also made the decision to make Sonic the only playable character, and to omit \"gimmick\" themes such as the [[swordplay]] mechanic used in the 2009 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]''.<ref name=\"canvas\"/> The team chose to develop ''Sonic Colors'' on [[Nintendo]]'s Wii and DS consoles, hoping to expand upon the audience attracted by the successful ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] games.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/>\n\nOne of the first ideas was the setting should be an amusement park; Sonic Team then realized that \"any sort of terrestrial amusement park would be too small to contain Sonic's adventures.\" From this came the idea of an interplanetary park, which would allow for more creativity and variance in the game.<ref name=\"canvas\">{{Cite journal|title=Fresh Canvas|journal=[[Nintendo Power]]|last=Thomason|first=Steve|date=July 2010|issue=256|pages=50\u201357}}</ref> The developers used [[Disneyland]] as visual inspiration for the levels.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/> Sonic Team also desired something that would diversify the gameplay, but did not slow it down.

[[Volkswagen Motorsport]] and based on the [[Volkswagen Polo]] for use in the [[World Rally Championship]]. The car, which made its d\u00e9but at the start of the [[2013 World Rally Championship season|2013 season]], is built to the second generation of World Rally Car regulations that were introduced in 2011, which are based upon the existing [[Super 2000]] regulations, but powered by a turbocharged 1.6-litre engine rather than the normally aspirated 2-litre engine found in Super 2000 cars.\n\nThe Polo R WRC marks [[Volkswagen]]'s second entry into the World Rally Championship as a manufacturer. Volkswagen Motorsport had previously entered the [[Volkswagen Golf|Volkswagen Golf GTI]] and [[Volkswagen Golf|GTI 16V]] in rallies between [[1983 World Rally Championship season|1983]] and [[1988 World Rally Championship season|1988]],<ref name=\"Klein 1\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Klein|editor1-first=Reinhardt|last1=Williams|first1=David|last2=Davenport|first2=John|last3=McMaster|first3=Colin|title=Rally Cars|year=2000|origyear=2000|publisher=K\u00f6nemann|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=3-8290-4625-1|page=420|chapter=Group A: 1987\u20131997}}</ref> while the company also made the [[Volkswagen Golf]] [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3|Mk3]] and [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Mk4]] available as a [[kit car]] to privateer entries during the [[Group A]] era from [[1993 World Rally Championship season|1993]] to [[1997 World Rally Championship season|1997]].<ref name=\"Klein 2\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Klein|editor1-first=Reinhardt|last1=Williams|first1=David|last2=Davenport|first2=John|last3=McMaster|first3=Colin|title=Rally Cars|year=2000|origyear=2000|publisher=K\u00f6nemann|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=3-8290-4625-1|page=529|chapter=Kit Cars}}</ref>\n\nThe car was extremely successful from its d\u00e9but, winning 43 of the 53 rallies that it entered, and scoring 37 more podiums.

As victims, he chose prostitutes working in parking lots and truck stops located alongside [[Interstate 71|I-71]]. In addition, there are suspicions that he committed three similar killings in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Illinois]] and [[Pennsylvania]], committed between 1986 and 1988.\n\n== Murders ==\nThree of the victims worked at \"Union 76\" truck stop in [[Austintown, Ohio|Austintown]], east of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and west of [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], which is the largest in the state, making the investigation suspect that the killer is a truck driver. Most of them were found without their underwear and shoes. The killings began in 1981, when the corpse of a young woman was found in [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami County]] on April 24th. After a forensic examination, it was determined that the girl died from strangulation, having received a head injury beforehand. At the time of her discovery, no personal belongings or documents were found on the deceased, making her identification difficult. She was nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl\", from a tasseled bucksin poncho she was when found. In 2018, the victim was finally identified as [[Murder of Marcia King|Marcia King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/body-buckskin-girl-found-ohio-1981-identified-arkansas/story?id=54417156|title=Body of 'Buckskin Girl' found in Ohio in 1981 identified as Arkansas woman. 12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdtn.com/news/local-news/cold-case-homicide-victim-identified-after-37-years/1116096993/|title=Cold case homicide victim identified after 37 years.

She had died from a traumatic brain injury, sustained after a beating with a blunt object. On July 20, 1986, the body of 23-year-old prostitute Shirley Dean Taylor was discovered, who was also beaten and strangled before death. Before her disappearance, she was seen at Union 76, where, according to witness reports, she went to meet a regular client nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whose identity was never established. Her body was discovered a few miles from the place of disappearance, with her underwear and shoes missing. In December 1986, 18-year-old prostitute April Barnett also went missing from the Union 76 truck stop, with her body found only a few days later 70 miles from Austintown. Like the previous cases, the girl was beaten and died from strangulation, with some of her clothes missing as well. A few days after, 28-year-old prostitute Jill Allen was found murdered in Illinois, near the [[Interstate 70|I-70]]. Despite the fact that she had been found in another state, she was also included as a victim, as her killer had the exact same [[modus operandi]]. Allen had also been beaten and asphyxiated, with strangulation marks found on her body. Her shoes, bra and underwear were never found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/05/mysterious-dr-no-may-have-been-serial-killer-responsible-for-rash-of-1980s-murders/|title=Mysterious \u201cDr. No\u201d May Have Been Serial Killer Responsible for Rash of 1980s Murders.

Her semi-decomposed body was found 40 days later, 250 miles away from Austintown, near [[Cincinnati]]. A week before the disappearance, Patterson had been arrested by police. At the police station, the girl gave information about a murder suspect and described his car. During the investigation, law enforcement agencies discovered that Patterson had made an appointment via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]] with the client, nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whom she characterized extremely negatively, and then disappeared.

The victim's jeans and underwear were lowered to the ankles, while the upper part of the clothes were missing. According to the nature of grass depressions and tire tracks located at the scene, forensic experts determined that the killer threw the girl's corpse out of his car. An autopsy revealed that the victim was a young woman, aged 20-25, and had died from strangulation. Despite the abundance of tattoes on her body, as well as jewelry the offender hadn't stolen, she hasn't been identified, and is simply named \"[[Jane Doe]]\". On November 22nd, the body of 19-year-old Lamonica Cole was discovered at a truck stop in [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania]]. Despite the fact that the truck stop was located on another interstate, Cole was included in the list of potential victims, because she had died from strangulation, was a native of Ohio and some of her things had been recovered, while others not. During the investigation, Lamonica's pimp, 24-year-old Derrick Mims, told police that the alleged killer with whom Cole left on the day of her disappearance was travelling in a blue lorry with white stripes.\n\nAccording to investigators, another murder was committed on March 29, 1988, this time in New York. The murder was 31-year-old Terri Roark, whose body was found on one of the bridges passing through the [[Mohawk River]]. The medical examiner found that the woman died from a traumatic brain injury that occurred during a beating with a blunt object several hours before the discovery of her body. Some of Roark's clothing, including underwear and shoes, were never found, on the basis of which she was included in the list potential victims of Dr. No. On April 19, 1990, the corpse of another young girl was found near a truck stop on the I-70. Most of her clothes were missing, but this time, her panties remained. An autopsy concluded that she had died from a traumatic brain injury resulting from a beating, and had had sexual intercourse 12-24 hours before her death. With these conclusions, the investigators suggested that the victim was a prostitute and had fallen victim to the serial killer. Despite multiple attempts to identify her, she remains unknown, and is simply named \"Jane Doe-2\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HkFHPBAgLiMJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/body-trail-prompts-fear-of-serial-killer---1991-dispatch-investigation+&cd=3&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru|title=Body trail prompts fear of serial killer.

The vehicle he was driving was described as a 1984 silver truck with a [[Wind deflector|windblocker]] and a red hood. The Ohio State Police Department and volunteers from various civil society organizations posted over 4,000 photographs of the victims and an identikit of the offender at 130 truck stops and service stations across the state, and 1,350 truck stops in 9 other states through which interstate motorways where the serial killer would ride through, offering $10,000 for information about him. As a result, five people were detained, who at different times were nicknamed \"Dr. No\", but subsequently no charges were filed against any of them and their names were never disclosed to the public. On most of the corpses, biological traces were discovered that, according to the investigators, came from the perpetrator. To establish if the sperm had the same affiliation, a forensic examination was carried out which gave mixed results, due to the fact that all of the victims had engaged in prostitution during life, and authorities stated questioning whether the deaths were actually related. Since no other incriminating evidence was found at the crime scenes, such as fingerprints, hair samples and pieces of clothing, the investigation to this day hasn't established the killer's identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/serial-killer-dr-no/|title=Articles}}</ref>\n===Suspects===\nIn April 1991, a resident of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]], 36-year-old Alvin Wilson, became the main suspect. Wilson, who worked as a trucker and owned two tractors, was among those whose hair samples matched those of the females. Credit card receipts and a number of other evidence indicated his possible responsibility for the Ohio murders. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of assault and attempted murder of a woman in October 1989. After his arrest, the girl contacted police, stating that in 1986, Wilson had picked her up in Akron after paying for her services, and had beat and attempted to strangle her afterwards. Alvin Wilson was tested for any involvement, but no evidence proving his guilt could be found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-04-23-9104230376-story.html|title=LAKE MAN A SUSPECT IN SERIAL MURDERS OHIO INVESTIGATORS COMING TO SEARCH TRUCKS.

In accordance with his occupation, Goble traveled to a several dozen states across the country, where cases of disappearances and murders of prostitutes along interstate highways were recorded. Following his arrest, Goble was investigated for murders in at least 10 states. Nevertheless, he was cleared of suspicion when it came to being the elusive \"Dr. No\", since at the time of the first murder in 1981, he wa still in high school, and in the mid-1980s, when the majority of the killings took place, he was serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was stationed outside Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950617/06170345.htm|title=DETECTIVES CREDIT LUCK IN HIGHWAY KILLINGS CASE.

Using DNA profiling, law enforcement agencies were able to prove his guilt in the four murders in Ohio and Illinois, the first of which he committed at age 20 in 1989. His initial arrested was thanks due to a match for an unsolved 1997 rape of a minor in [[Medina County, Ohio]], where he was extradited to stand trial. In the fall of 1990, Legg was already in the police's sights, as he was a suspect in the murder of his stepdaughter, 14-year-old Angela Hicks, in [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]], but as there wasn't enough evidence, he wasn't charged. Although the likelihood of him being \"Dr. No\" is questionable, since Legg was a teenager in the mid-1980s, it has been suggested that he could be responsible for some of the murders. If this theory is true, it links to another theory which proposes that the serial murders were the doing of several different individuals.<ref>[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uYyZljc1cnoJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/arizona-man-charged-in-1992-slaying-linked-by-dna-to-ohio-truck-stop-killings+&cd=15&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru Arizona man charged in 1992 slaying linked by DNA to Ohio truck-stop killings.

The vehicle he was driving was described as a 1984 silver truck with a [[Wind deflector|windblocker]] and a red hood. The Ohio State Police Department and volunteers from various civil society organizations posted over 4,000 photographs of the victims and an identikit of the offender at 130 truck stops and service stations across the state, and 1,350 truck stops in 9 other states through which interstate motorways where the serial killer would ride through, offering $10,000 for information about him. As a result, five people were detained, who at different times were nicknamed \"Dr. No\", but subsequently no charges were filed against any of them and their names were never disclosed to the public. On most of the corpses, biological traces were discovered that, according to the investigators, came from the perpetrator. To establish if the sperm had the same affiliation, a forensic examination was carried out which gave mixed results, due to the fact that all of the victims had engaged in prostitution during life, and authorities stated questioning whether the deaths were actually related. Since no other incriminating evidence was found at the crime scenes, such as fingerprints, hair samples and pieces of clothing, the investigation to this day hasn't established the killer's identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/serial-killer-dr-no/|title=Articles}}</ref>\n===Suspects===\nIn April 1991, a resident of [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]], 36-year-old Alvin Wilson, became the main suspect. Wilson, who worked as a trucker and owned two tractors, was among those whose hair samples matched those of the females. Credit card receipts and a number of other evidence indicated his possible responsibility for the Ohio murders. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of assault and attempted murder of a woman in October 1989. After his arrest, the girl contacted police, stating that in 1986, Wilson had picked her up in Akron after paying for her services, and had beat and attempted to strangle her afterwards. Alvin Wilson was tested for any involvement, but no evidence proving his guilt could be found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-04-23-9104230376-story.html|title=LAKE MAN A SUSPECT IN SERIAL MURDERS OHIO INVESTIGATORS COMING TO SEARCH TRUCKS.

The girl's body was discovered a few days after her death. Since most of her clothes were missing, Cruz was considered a possible suspect in the Ohio killings. He was tested, but subsequently, no charges were filed against him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/ohio-trucker-gets-life-for-killing-gary-runaway/article_edb57afb-4fb3-5a7f-b594-de046e08ed67.html|title=Ohio trucker gets life for killing Gary runaway.

In accordance with his occupation, Goble traveled to a several dozen states across the country, where cases of disappearances and murders of prostitutes along interstate highways were recorded. Following his arrest, Goble was investigated for murders in at least 10 states. Nevertheless, he was cleared of suspicion when it came to being the elusive \"Dr. No\", since at the time of the first murder in 1981, he wa still in high school, and in the mid-1980s, when the majority of the killings took place, he was serving in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was stationed outside Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950617/06170345.htm|title=DETECTIVES CREDIT LUCK IN HIGHWAY KILLINGS CASE.

Colvin later admitted to killing at least two others in [[New Jersey]], but vehemently denied any involvement in the Dr. No murders during the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2011/03/truck_driver_convicted_of_kil.html|title=Truck driver convicted of killing six prostitutes in Ohio to face charges in slaying of N.J. woman 24 years ago. Mar 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2019, 49-year-old Samuel Legg was arrested in [[Arizona]]. Using DNA profiling, law enforcement agencies were able to prove his guilt in the four murders in Ohio and Illinois, the first of which he committed at age 20 in 1989. His initial arrested was thanks due to a match for an unsolved 1997 rape of a minor in [[Medina County, Ohio]], where he was extradited to stand trial. In the fall of 1990, Legg was already in the police's sights, as he was a suspect in the murder of his stepdaughter, 14-year-old Angela Hicks, in [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]], but as there wasn't enough evidence, he wasn't charged. Although the likelihood of him being \"Dr. No\" is questionable, since Legg was a teenager in the mid-1980s, it has been suggested that he could be responsible for some of the murders. If this theory is true, it links to another theory which proposes that the serial murders were the doing of several different individuals.<ref>[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uYyZljc1cnoJ:https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190214/arizona-man-charged-in-1992-slaying-linked-by-dna-to-ohio-truck-stop-killings+&cd=15&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru Arizona man charged in 1992 slaying linked by DNA to Ohio truck-stop killings.
