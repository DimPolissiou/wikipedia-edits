He was a standout center for the basketball team and a tight end for the football team. He quit football after his freshman year, because of disputes with the coach. He continued to support the team by joining the cheerleading squad as a sophomore, partly from spite. He later called it \"the greatest experience of my life... everybody else was riding a bus with sweaty equipment and I'm in a van with seven cheerleaders who are all learning about life\".

Prior to attending Wichita State University, Wight attended Northern Oklahoma Junior College in [[Tonkawa, Oklahoma]], competing on the basketball team.

Through doing the latter for a karaoke company, he met [[Danny Bonaduce]] in a live microphone amateur contest on his morning radio show. Bonaduce introduced Wight to his friend, [[Hulk Hogan]]. They had an informal basketball game, as part of a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) promotion for an upcoming show at the [[Rosemont Horizon]]. Hogan liked how Wight worked the crowd, and recommended him to World Championship Wrestling's vice president, [[Eric Bischoff]]. Wight went to the Horizon show, and was invited into the locker room, where he met [[Ric Flair]], [[Arn Anderson]] (his boyhood hero) and [[Paul Orndorff]]. He later met Bischoff there and came to a deal.<ref name=SAS/> Wight had previously wrestled one match: on December 3, 1994, at a World Wrestling Association show in Clementon, New Jersey, he lost by countout to WWA Heavyweight Champion Frank Finnegan.<ref name=\"cagematch.net\"/>\n\nWight had earlier attempted to inquire about joining the WWF, also at the Horizon, during an autograph session. Promoter and scout Bob Collins turned him away after he admitted he had no experience. He paid [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler)|Larry Sharpe]]'s Monster Factory $5,000, but due to Sharpe's [[gout]] at the time, he was only very minimally trained ([[Raven (wrestler)|Johnny Polo]] taught him the collar-and-elbow lockup). While there, he made an audition tape and gave it to [[Mike Chioda]], whom he had met in a Philadelphia bar. Chioda forwarded it to [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], who did not bother watching it because he assumed Wight was another wrestler, [[Kurrgan]]. Only when he saw The Giant debut in WCW did Patterson realize his mistake, to [[Vince McMahon]]'s displeasure.<ref name=SAS/>\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling ===\n\n==== WCW World Heavyweight Champion (1995\u20131996) ====\nIn 1995, Wight signed with WCW, first appearing at [[Slamboree (1995)|Slamboree]], and was then billed as the son of [[Andre the Giant]] (although this was later dropped) and accordingly used the ring name '''The Giant''' as a member of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]'s [[The Dungeon of Doom|Dungeon of Doom]] stable. Wight made his professional in-ring debut at [[Halloween Havoc 1995|Halloween Havoc]] against [[Hulk Hogan]] for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]. He won the match after Hogan's manager, [[Jimmy Hart]], purposely got Hogan disqualified and then turned on him. The next night The Giant showed up on ''WCW Monday Nitro'' wearing the championship belt; Hart, who became The Giant's manager, revealed that he had put a stipulation in the contract for the match that if Hogan lost via disqualification, he would lose his championship. WCW responded by nullifying the title change due to the circumstances surrounding it and the championship was vacated.\n\nThe Giant then entered the sixty-man [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] contested for the vacant championship at [[World War 3 (1995)|World War 3]] in November 1995. He was one of the final six combatants, being eliminated simultaneously with [[Sting and Lex Luger]] by Hogan. The Giant did not leave the ring upon being eliminated and pulled Hogan underneath the ropes while [[Randy Savage]] was eliminating the [[One Man Gang]] from the match. The referee did not see The Giant's actions, only that Hogan was on the floor, and thus awarded the match and the title to Savage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/november/1995.htm|title=WCW World War 3 results|publisher=PWWEW| accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623212218/http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/november/1995.htm| archivedate=June 23, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/ww3.html#95|title=WCW World War 3 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095355/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/ww3.html| archivedate= June 23, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The Giant teamed with [[Ric Flair]] to defeat Hogan and Savage at [[Clash of the Champions XXXII]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXXII |title=WCW Clash of the Champions XXXII results |publisher=Pro Wrestling History |accessdate=June 8, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624035919/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html |archivedate=June 24, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> but was decisively beaten by Hogan in a [[professional wrestling match types#Cages|cage match]] at [[SuperBrawl VI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/february/1996.htm|title=WCW SuperBrawl VI results|publisher=PWWEW|accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617202948/http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/february/1996.htm| archivedate= June 17, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#VI|title= WCW SuperBrawr VI results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623094945/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html|archivedate=June 23, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> After a short feud with [[Martin Ruane|Loch Ness]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/march/1996.htm| title=WCW Uncensored 1996 results|publisher=PWWEW|accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617202954/http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/march/1996.htm| archivedate=June 17, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#96|title=WCW Uncensored 1996 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=June 8, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080623212141/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html|archivedate=June 23, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The Giant regained the World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Flair.

After winning the battle royal at [[World War 3 (1996)|World War 3]], Giant asked Hogan for a World Heavyweight Championship title match. For this, he was thrown out of the nWo on December 30. He fought against the nWo along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and Luger, winning the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] twice.\n\nIn 1997, The Giant began a feud with nWo member Nash, who constantly dodged the Giant, including no-showing their scheduled match at [[Starrcade (1997)|Starrcade]]. In 1998, at [[Souled Out 1998|Souled Out]], the two finally met in the ring, with Nash accidentally injuring The Giant's neck when he [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] his signature [[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|jackknife powerbomb]] finisher.

In the interim between those two reigns, he lost his half of the titles to Sting in a singles match where only the winner would remain champion and could choose a new partner.\n\nOn the October 12, 1998 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'', [[Bill Goldberg]] defeated The Giant in a no-disqualification match.

Nash defeated Giant following a [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#R|run-in]] by Scott Hall and [[Eric Bischoff]]. The Giant was then attacked by the entire nWo. On the \"Building An Army\" episode of the ''Monday Night War'' feature from the WWE Network, Wight stated that he was making a fraction of what the main eventers were making and his salary was not increased after he requested it be by Eric Bischoff; as a result, Wight allowed his WCW contract to expire on February 8, 1999, his 27th birthday.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment ===\n\n==== WWF Champion (1999\u20132000) ====\n{{Main article|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|l1=The Corporation}}\n[[File:The Big Show 1999 WWF Smackdown (WWE).jpg|thumb|Big Show entering the arena on the ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' entrance way in 1999]]\nWight signed a ten-year contract with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] on February 9, 1999, debuting under the name of Paul Wight as a member of [[Vince McMahon]]'s stable, [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House]]. During McMahon's cage match against [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], Big Show tore through the canvas from underneath the ring and attacked Austin, establishing himself as a heel. After he threw Austin into the side of the cage, the cage broke, causing Austin to fall outside to the floor, meaning he won the match. Wight subsequently served as McMahon's [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcer]].\n\nRenamed as The Big Show, he made his WrestleMania debut at [[WrestleMania XV]], facing [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] for the right to referee the main event between Austin and Corporation's WWF Champion The Rock. However, Wight incapacitated Mankind and was disqualified in the process, losing the match. After the match, McMahon slapped him, so he punched McMahon, turning face. After being defeated by Mankind in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Boiler Room Brawl|Boiler Room Brawl]], they formed a stable with [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], and [[Ken Shamrock]] known as [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]], who fought against the Corporation and later The [[Corporate Ministry]].

Trying to regain the title, Wight participated in the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble match]] where he was last eliminated by The Rock. They started a storyline where Big Show produced a video tape that showed The Rock's feet striking the ground first, leading to a match with The Rock at [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]], with the [[WrestleMania]] title shot on the line. Wight defeated The Rock when [[Shane McMahon]] interfered, knocking out The Rock with a chair shot. Rock was desperate to reclaim his title shot, and eventually agreed to a match with Big Show on the March 13 episode of ''Raw'' \u2013 if he won, the WrestleMania title match would become a Triple Threat match, and if he lost, he would retire from the WWF. Shane McMahon, now actively supporting Big Show's bid to become champion, appointed himself as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special guest referee]]. However, The Rock triumphed when Vince McMahon assaulted Shane and donned the referee shirt, personally making the three count. On the March 20 episode of ''Raw'', Triple H defended the title against The Rock and Big Show on the condition that the match would not take place at WrestleMania, pinning Big Show. [[Linda McMahon]] stated this match would not occur at WrestleMania as Triple H would defend the title there in a [[Three Way Dance|Fatal Four-Way Elimination match]], with [[Mick Foley]] as the fourth man. Big Show was the first man eliminated from the match at [[WrestleMania 2000]] after the other three competitors worked together against him.\n\n==== Championship reigns (2000\u20132003) ====\nAfter WrestleMania, Big Show turned face again and took on a comical [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] where he began mimicking other wrestlers, lampooning [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] as Showkishi, [[John Nord|The Berzerker]] as Shonan the Barbarian, and [[Val Venis]] as The Big Showbowski. He defeated [[Kurt Angle]] at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]] dressed like [[Hulk Hogan]] as the Showster, complete with skullcap/wig and yellow tights. Show began feuding with Shane McMahon after Shane voiced his disapproval of Big Show's antics. At [[Judgment Day (2000)|Judgment Day]], Shane defeated Wight in a [[Falls Count Anywhere match]] following interference from Big Boss Man, [[Barry Buchanan|Bull Buchanan]], Test, and Albert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2000/ |title=Judgment Day 2000 Results |accessdate=March 18, 2008 |publisher=[[WWE]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331122411/http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2000/ |archivedate=March 31, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Wight returned two months later, apparently intending to gain revenge on Shane. Instead, he turned heel again and attacked The Undertaker and sided with Shane once more, forming a short-lived stable known as \"The Conspiracy\" with Shane, [[Chris Benoit]], Kurt Angle, and [[Edge and Christian]]. After The Undertaker threw Show off a stage through a table on the August 7, 2000 episode of ''Raw'', he was removed from WWF television for the remainder of the year.

On the April 22 episode of ''Raw'', he turned heel again when he chokeslammed Stone Cold Steve Austin during a tag team match against X-Pac and Scott Hall, joining the nWo in the process. At [[Judgment Day (2002)|Judgment Day]], Big Show and Ric Flair were defeated by Austin in a Handicap match. The stable disbanded after Kevin Nash was injured. After the nWo disbanded, Show achieved little success on ''Raw'', losing matches against [[Jeff Hardy]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and the [[Dudley Boyz]].\n\n[[File:Big Show as US Champ.jpg|thumb|Big Show, as [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]], facing [[Brock Lesnar]]]]\nIn October, Big Show was traded to the SmackDown! brand, immediately challenging [[Brock Lesnar]] for the WWE Championship. During this time, Big Show adopted a new attire, donning black jeans and taking on a new hairstyle and facial hair. Big Show won the WWE Championship by defeating Brock Lesnar at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]], ending Lesnar's undefeated streak with help from [[Paul Heyman]]. He lost the title to Kurt Angle a month later at [[Armageddon (2002)|Armageddon]]. Then SmackDown! general manager [[Stephanie McMahon]] announced that he would wrestle [[Chris Benoit]] in a match to determine who would face Angle at the [[Royal Rumble 2003|Royal Rumble]]. He lost to Benoit after Benoit pinned him. After the match Benoit was brutally attacked by Big Show and Kurt Angle. At the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]], Big Show lost a Royal Rumble qualifying match to Lesnar. He then began feuding with The Undertaker, after Big Show threw him off the stage, injuring his neck, leading to Big Show and his partner A-Train losing to The Undertaker at [[WrestleMania XIX]]. He renewed his feud with Lesnar, wrestling him four times for the WWE Championship (including a Stretcher match at [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]]), but was unsuccessful in his attempt to regain the title. On the June 12 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Lesnar superplexed Big Show off the ropes and the ring imploded, two ring posts moved and three rows of ropes came down. The referee called for the event physician Dr. Burke, EMTs, medics, trainers, and even more referees. This kept the title in Lesnar's hands and both went to the hospital. On the June 26 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Big Show, [[Shelton Benjamin]], and [[Charlie Haas]] defeated Mr. America (a disguised Hulk Hogan), Brock Lesnar, and Kurt Angle in a six-man tag team match when Show pinned Mr. America. This was Hulk Hogan's last appearance as Mr. America. For several months afterwards, WWE hyped up Big Show as the man who retired Hogan.\n\n==== Various feuds (2003\u20132005) ====\nAt [[No Mercy (2003)|No Mercy]], Big Show defeated [[Eddie Guerrero]] for the [[WWE United States Championship]]. He then formed an alliance with then-WWE Champion Brock Lesnar. He was eliminated by Chris Benoit at the [[Royal Rumble (2004)|Royal Rumble]]. Big Show abandoned a departing Lesnar immediately before [[WrestleMania XX]]. At WrestleMania XX, Big Show lost the United States Championship to [[John Cena]].

Through doing the latter for a karaoke company, he met [[Danny Bonaduce]] in a live microphone amateur contest on his morning radio show. Bonaduce introduced Wight to his friend, [[Hulk Hogan]]. They had an informal basketball game, as part of a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) promotion for an upcoming show at the [[Rosemont Horizon]]. Hogan liked how Wight worked the crowd, and recommended him to World Championship Wrestling's vice president, [[Eric Bischoff]]. Wight went to the Horizon show, and was invited into the locker room, where he met [[Ric Flair]], [[Arn Anderson]] (his boyhood hero) and [[Paul Orndorff]]. He later met Bischoff there and came to a deal.<ref name=SAS/> Wight had previously wrestled one match: on December 3, 1994, at a World Wrestling Association show in Clementon, New Jersey, he lost by countout to WWA Heavyweight Champion Frank Finnegan.<ref name=\"cagematch.net\"/>\n\nWight had earlier attempted to inquire about joining the WWF, also at the Horizon, during an autograph session. Promoter and scout Bob Collins turned him away after he admitted he had no experience. He paid [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler)|Larry Sharpe]]'s Monster Factory $5,000, but due to Sharpe's [[gout]] at the time, he was only very minimally trained ([[Raven (wrestler)|Johnny Polo]] taught him the collar-and-elbow lockup). While there, he made an audition tape and gave it to [[Mike Chioda]], whom he had met in a Philadelphia bar. Chioda forwarded it to [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], who did not bother watching it because he assumed Wight was another wrestler, [[Kurrgan]].

Wight made his professional in-ring debut at [[Halloween Havoc 1995|Halloween Havoc]] against [[Hulk Hogan]] for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]. He won the match after Hogan's manager, [[Jimmy Hart]], purposely got Hogan disqualified and then turned on him. The next night The Giant showed up on ''WCW Monday Nitro'' wearing the championship belt; Hart, who became The Giant's manager, revealed that he had put a stipulation in the contract for the match that if Hogan lost via disqualification, he would lose his championship. WCW responded by nullifying the title change due to the circumstances surrounding it and the championship was vacated.\n\nThe Giant then entered the sixty-man [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] contested for the vacant championship at [[World War 3 (1995)|World War 3]] in November 1995. He was one of the final six combatants, being eliminated simultaneously with [[Sting and Lex Luger]] by Hogan. The Giant did not leave the ring upon being eliminated and pulled Hogan underneath the ropes while [[Randy Savage]] was eliminating the [[One Man Gang]] from the match. The referee did not see The Giant's actions, only that Hogan was on the floor, and thus awarded the match and the title to Savage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/november/1995.htm|title=WCW World War 3 results|publisher=PWWEW| accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623212218/http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/november/1995.htm| archivedate=June 23, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/ww3.html#95|title=WCW World War 3 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095355/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/ww3.html| archivedate= June 23, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The Giant teamed with [[Ric Flair]] to defeat Hogan and Savage at [[Clash of the Champions XXXII]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXXII |title=WCW Clash of the Champions XXXII results |publisher=Pro Wrestling History |accessdate=June 8, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624035919/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html |archivedate=June 24, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> but was decisively beaten by Hogan in a [[professional wrestling match types#Cages|cage match]] at [[SuperBrawl VI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/february/1996.htm|title=WCW SuperBrawl VI results|publisher=PWWEW|accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617202948/http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/february/1996.htm| archivedate= June 17, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#VI|title= WCW SuperBrawr VI results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623094945/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html|archivedate=June 23, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> After a short feud with [[Martin Ruane|Loch Ness]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/march/1996.htm| title=WCW Uncensored 1996 results|publisher=PWWEW|accessdate=June 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617202954/http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/march/1996.htm| archivedate=June 17, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#96|title=WCW Uncensored 1996 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=June 8, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080623212141/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html|archivedate=June 23, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The Giant regained the World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Flair.

On the \"Building An Army\" episode of the ''Monday Night War'' feature from the WWE Network, Wight stated that he was making a fraction of what the main eventers were making and his salary was not increased after he requested it be by Eric Bischoff; as a result, Wight allowed his WCW contract to expire on February 8, 1999, his 27th birthday.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment ===\n\n==== WWF Champion (1999\u20132000) ====\n{{Main article|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|l1=The Corporation}}\n[[File:The Big Show 1999 WWF Smackdown (WWE).jpg|thumb|Big Show entering the arena on the ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' entrance way in 1999]]\nWight signed a ten-year contract with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] on February 9, 1999, debuting under the name of Paul Wight as a member of [[Vince McMahon]]'s stable, [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House]]. During McMahon's cage match against [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], Big Show tore through the canvas from underneath the ring and attacked Austin, establishing himself as a heel. After he threw Austin into the side of the cage, the cage broke, causing Austin to fall outside to the floor, meaning he won the match. Wight subsequently served as McMahon's [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcer]].\n\nRenamed as The Big Show, he made his WrestleMania debut at [[WrestleMania XV]], facing [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] for the right to referee the main event between Austin and Corporation's WWF Champion The Rock. However, Wight incapacitated Mankind and was disqualified in the process, losing the match. After the match, McMahon slapped him, so he punched McMahon, turning face. After being defeated by Mankind in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Boiler Room Brawl|Boiler Room Brawl]], they formed a stable with [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], and [[Ken Shamrock]] known as [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]], who fought against the Corporation and later The [[Corporate Ministry]].

Wight defeated The Rock when [[Shane McMahon]] interfered, knocking out The Rock with a chair shot. Rock was desperate to reclaim his title shot, and eventually agreed to a match with Big Show on the March 13 episode of ''Raw'' \u2013 if he won, the WrestleMania title match would become a Triple Threat match, and if he lost, he would retire from the WWF. Shane McMahon, now actively supporting Big Show's bid to become champion, appointed himself as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special guest referee]]. However, The Rock triumphed when Vince McMahon assaulted Shane and donned the referee shirt, personally making the three count. On the March 20 episode of ''Raw'', Triple H defended the title against The Rock and Big Show on the condition that the match would not take place at WrestleMania, pinning Big Show. [[Linda McMahon]] stated this match would not occur at WrestleMania as Triple H would defend the title there in a [[Three Way Dance|Fatal Four-Way Elimination match]], with [[Mick Foley]] as the fourth man.

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access exit to a surface road to the airport. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of four interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beyond this point, I-40 continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, ascending the western escarpment of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and reaching elevations above {{convert|2000|ft|m}}, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]], where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 crosses into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]].\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 gas an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. At mile 340, the Interstate crosses into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]], and shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit is 60&nbsp;mph to 70&nbsp;mph. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eadtbound lanes have a direct access exit to a surface road to the airport. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of four interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beyond this point, I-40 continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, ascending the western escarpment of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and reaching elevations above {{convert|2000|ft|m}}, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]], where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 crosses into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]].\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 gas an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. At mile 340, the Interstate crosses into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]], and shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit is 60&nbsp;mph to 70&nbsp;mph. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

Medina is celebrated for containing ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi'' and as the city which gave refuge to him and his followers, and so ranks as the second holiest city of Islam, after Mecca.<ref>However, an article in [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200606/Saudi Aramco World] {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} by John Anthony states: \"To the perhaps parochial Muslims of North Africa in fact the sanctity of [[Kairouan]] is second only to Mecca among all cities of the world.\" [[Saudi Aramco]]'s bimonthly magazine's goal is to broaden knowledge of the cultures, history and geography of the Arab and Muslim worlds and their connections with the West; pages 30\u201336 of the January/February 1967 print edition [https://web.archive.org/web/20040624130307/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196701/the.fourth.holy.city.htm The Fourth Holy City]</ref> Muhammad was buried in Medina, under the [[Green Dome]], as were the first two [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliphs]], [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], who were buried next to him in what used to be Muhammad's house.\n\nMedina is {{convert|210|mi|abbr=out}} north of Mecca and about {{convert|120|mi|abbr=out}} from the [[Red Sea]] coast. It is situated in the most fertile part of all the Hejazi territory, the streams of the vicinity tending to converge in this locality. An immense [[plain]] extends to the south; in every direction the view is bounded by hills and mountains.\n\nThe historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, {{convert|30|to|40|ft|abbr=out}} high, dating from the 12th century CE, and was flanked with towers, while on a rock, stood a castle. Of its four gates, the ''Bab-al-Salam'', or [[Egypt]]ian gate, was remarkable for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations. These suburbs also had walls and gates. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''.\n\nThe graves of [[Fatimah]] ([[Genealogy of Khadijah's daughters|Muhammad's daughter]]) and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] ([[Ahl al-Bayt|Muhammad's grandson]]), across from the mosque at ''Jannat [[al-Baqi']]'', and Abu Bakr (first caliph and the father of [[Muhammad's wives|Muhammad's wife]], [[Aisha]]), and of Umar ibn Al-Khattab), the second caliph, are also here. The mosque dates back to the time of Muhammad, but has been twice reconstructed.<ref name=\"EA\">1954 [[Encyclopedia Americana]], vol. 18, pp.587, 588</ref>\n\nBecause of the Saudi government's religious policy and concern that historic sites could become the focus for [[idolatry in Islam|idolatry]], much of Medina's Islamic physical heritage has been [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|altered]].\n\n==Religious significance in Islam==\n{{Main|Muhammad in Medina}}\n[[File:The Green Dome, Masjid Nabawi, Madina.jpg|thumb|The Green Dome of the Prophet's Mosque]]\n\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''. The mosque was expanded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Caliph [[Al-Walid I]]. [[Mount Uhud]] is a mountain north of Medina which was the site of the second battle between [[Muslim]] and Meccan forces.\n\nAfter Muhammad migrated to Madinah, he built Quba' Mosque and offered prayers in it. He would ride a camel or walk to the mosque every Saturday to offer 2 rakaats of prayers.<ref>{{Citation|last=Moore|first=Cerwyn|chapter=Friday Prayers and Sermon in the Grand Mosque of Mosul|date=2018-01-15|pages=147\u2013152|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-085644-1|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190856441.003.0010|title=Al-Qaeda 2.0}}</ref> Quba' Mosque is now located in the metropolitan area of Medina. It was destroyed by lightning, probably about 850 CE, and the graves were almost forgotten. In 892, the place was cleared up, the graves located and a fine mosque built, which was destroyed by fire in 1257 CE and almost immediately rebuilt. It was restored by [[Qaitbay]], the [[List of rulers of Egypt|Egyptian ruler]], in 1487.<ref name=\"EA\"/> \n\nMuslims are encouraged to perform 2 rakaat of Sunnah prayer at this Quba' Mosque. According to a hadith from Sunan Ibn Majah, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad  said, ''\u201cWhoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\u201d'' (Hadith by Imam Ibn Majah)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://muslim.sg/articles/11-places-to-visit-in-madinah?type=articles|title=10 Places To Visit In Madinah|website=muslim.sg|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n''Masjid al-Qiblatain'' is another mosque also historically important to Muslims. It is where the command was sent to Muhammad to change the direction of prayer ([[qibla]]) from [[Jerusalem]] to Mecca, according to a [[hadith]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.dawntravels.com/performing-hajj-umrah/ |title=Place Pilgrims Visit During or After Performing Hajj / Umrah |publisher=Dawntravels.com |date= |accessdate=2 September 2014}}</ref> At the prayer hall, you would be able to see signs showing the direction of Makkah as well as Jerusalem.

Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their '[[Umrah]] (second pilgrimage after Hajj). Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina annually while performing pilgrimage [[Hajj]]. [[Al-Baqi']] is a significant cemetery in Medina where several [[Banu Hashim|family members of Muhammad]], caliphs and scholars are buried.\n\nIslamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times as being sacred in the Quran, for example [[ayah]]; 9:101, 9:129, 59:9, and ayah 63:7. [[Medinan sura]]s are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts. There is also a book within the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] titled 'Virtues of Medina'.<ref>[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=30&translator=1 hadith found in 'Virtues of Madinah' of Sahih Bukhari] searchtruth.com</ref>\n\n[[Sahih Bukhari]] says:\n{{quote|Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that.

At first, these tribes were allied with Jewish rulers, but later they revolted and became  independent.<ref name=\"Medina\">\"Al-Medina.\" ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''</ref> Toward the end of the 5th century,<ref>for date see \"J. Q. R.\" vii. 175, note</ref> the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj. The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/>\n\nMost modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the Aus and the Khazraj.<ref>See e.g., Peters 193; \"Qurayza\", ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''</ref> However, according to scholar of Islam [[William Montgomery Watt]], the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nEarly Muslim chronicler [[Ibn Ishaq]] tells of an ancient conflict between the last [[Yemen]]ite king of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]<ref>Muslim sources usually referred to Himyar kings by the dynastic title of \"[[Tubba']]\".</ref> and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], he was stopped from doing so by two [[rabbi]]s from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the [[Quraysh]] would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to [[Judaism]]. He took the [[rabbi]]s with him, and in [[Mecca]], they reportedly recognised the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] as a temple built by [[Abraham]] and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.<ref>Guillaume 7\u20139, Peters 49\u201350</ref>\n\nEventually the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE/1 AH, they had been fighting for 120 years and were the sworn enemies of each other.<ref name=\"balagh.net\">Subhani, ''The Message'': [http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm The Events of the First Year of Migration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053521/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aus, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.<ref>For alliances, see Guillaume 253</ref> They fought a total of four wars.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nTheir last and bloodiest battle was the [[Battle of Bu'ath]]<ref name=\"Medina\"/> that was fought a few years before the arrival of Muhammad.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/> The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. Until the arrival of Muhammad, he was the most respected inhabitant of Yathrib. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of the city met secretly with [[Muhammad]] in Al-Aqaba, a place between Makkah and Mina, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to Yathrib, where Muhammad could serve as disinterested mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n===Muhammad's arrival===\n{{Main|Hijra (Islam)|Constitution of Medina}}\nIn 622 CE/1 AH, Muhammad and around 70 Meccan [[Muhajirun]] believers left Mecca for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as civic leader. The Muslim converts native to Yathrib of whatever background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'' (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the [[Zakat]] tax.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the local pagan Arab tribes, the Muslim ''[[Muhajirun]]'' from Mecca, the local Muslims (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]''), and the Jewish population of the area signed an agreement, the [[Constitution of Medina]], which committed all parties to mutual co-operation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by [[Ibn Hisham]] is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.<ref>Firestone 118. For opinions disputing the early date of the Constitution of Medina, see e.g., Peters 116; \"Muhammad\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\"; \"Kurayza, Banu\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\".</ref> In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as ''kit\u0101b \u1e0fimmat al-nabi'', written in the 17th year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (638 CE), and which gave express liberty unto Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but were required to pay the [[jizya]] (poll-tax) annually for their protection by their patrons.<ref>Shelomo Dov Goitein, ''The Yemenites \u2013 History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 288\u2013299. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Badr====\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}\n{{Main|Battle of Badr}}\n[[File:Battle of Badr.png|thumb|Battle positions at Badr]]\nThe Battle of Badr was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraysh in Mecca. In the spring of 624, Muhammad received word from his intelligence sources that a trade caravan, commanded by [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], Chieftain of the Meccan Quraysh, and guarded by thirty to forty men, was travelling from [[Syria (region)|Syria]] back to Mecca. Muhammad gathered an army of 313 men, the largest army the Muslims had put in the field yet. However, many early Muslim sources, including the Quran, indicate that no serious fighting was expected,<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035058/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |date=21 August 2011 }}</ref> and the future Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife.\n\nAs the caravan approached Medina, Abu Sufyan began hearing from travellers and riders about Muhammad's planned ambush. He sent a messenger named Damdam to Mecca to warn the Quraysh and get reinforcements. Alarmed, the Quraysh assembled an army of 900\u20131,000 men to rescue the caravan. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]], [[Walid ibn Utba]], Shaiba, and [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]], joined the army. However, some of the army was to later return to Mecca before the battle.\n\nThe battle started with champions from both armies emerging to engage in combat. The Muslims sent out [[Ali]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] (Obeida), and [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]]. The Muslims dispatched the Meccan champions in a three-on-three m\u00eal\u00e9e, Hamzah killed his opponent with the very first strike, although Ubaydah was mortally wounded.<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 Sunan Abu Dawud: Book 14, Number 2659] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820142432/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 |date=20 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nNow both armies began firing arrows at each other.

Muhammad marched out to meet the force but before reaching the battle, about one third of the troops under Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew. With a smaller force, the Muslim army had to find a strategy to gain the upper hand. A group of archers were ordered to stay on a hill to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry forces and to provide protection at the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to somewhat retreat. The battle front was pushed further and further away from the archers, whom, from the start of the battle, had really nothing to do but watch. In their growing impatience to be part of the battle, and seeing that they were somewhat gaining advantage over the [[Kafir]]un ([[Infidel]]s) these archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading all along to the rest to not disobey their commanders' orders. But their words were lost among the enthusiastic yodels of their comrades.\n\nHowever, the Meccans' retreat was actually a manufactured manoeuvre that paid off. The hillside position had been a great advantage to the Muslim forces, and they had to be lured off their posts for the Meccans to turn the table over. Seeing that their strategy had actually worked, the Meccans cavalry forces went around the hill and re-appeared behind the pursuing archers. Thus, ambushed in the plain between the hill and the front line, the archers were systematically slaughtered, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill, shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but to little effect.\n\nHowever, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Medinans suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.<ref>Esposito, John L. \"Islam.\" Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices, edited by Thomas Riggs, vol. 1: Religions and Denominations, Gale, 2006, pp. 349-379.</ref>\n\n====Battle of the Trench====\n{{Main|Battle of the Trench}}\n\nIn 627, Abu Sufyan once more led Meccan forces against Medina. Because the people of Medina had dug a trench to further protect the city, this event became known as the Battle of the Trench. After a protracted siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again. During the siege, Abu Sufyan had contacted the remaining Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the defenders from behind the lines. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Banu Aus now interceded on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to the appointment of one of their chiefs, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish Law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason (Deutoronomy).<ref name=\"mantran\">Robert Mantran, ''L'expansion musulmane'' Presses Universitaires de France 1995, p. 86.</ref> This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The historian Robert Mantran argues that from this point of view it was successful&nbsp;\u2014 from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.<ref name=\"mantran\"/>\n\n===Capital city of Muhammad and the Rashidun Caliphate===\n[[File:Madina Munavara.JPG|thumb|250px|Old depiction of Medina during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times]]\n\nIn the ten years following the [[hijra (Islam)|hijra]], Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he [[Conquest of Mecca|marched on Mecca]], entering it without battle in 629 CE/8 AH, all parties acquiescing to his leadership. Afterwards, however, despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca and the ongoing importance of the Meccan [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] for Islamic pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the capital of the early [[caliphate]].\n\n''Yathrib'' was renamed Medina from ''Madinat al-Nabi'' (\"city of the Prophet\" in [[Arabic]]) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and death there. (Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Medinta'', which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dangoor.com/71page33.html|title=The Jews of Arabia|author=|date=|work=dangoor.com}}</ref>)\n\nUnder the first three caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]], Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the period of Uthman, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE/35 AH and murdered him in his own home. [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]]. After that, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power.\n\nIn 1256 CE Medina was threatened by a lava flow from the [[Harrat Rahat]] volcanic area.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0301-07=|title=Harrat Rahat}}</ref><ref>Bosworth,C.

Medina was a city of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Local rule was in the hands of the [[Hashemite]] clan as [[Sharif]]s or [[Emir]]s of Mecca. [[Fakhri Pasha]] was the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] governor of Medina. [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]] and leader of the Hashemite clan, revolted against the [[Caliph]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and sided with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The city of Medina was besieged by the Sharif's forces, and Fakhri Pasha tenaciously held on during the [[Siege of Medina]] from 1916 till 10 January 1919. He refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the [[Armistice of Moudros]], until he was arrested by his own men.<ref>Peters, Francis (1994).

Though the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is inhabited by an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers of other Arab nationalities (Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and Filipinos.\n\n==Geography==\nMedina is located in the [[Hejaz|Hijaz Region]] north-western of the country, {{convert|250|km|abbr=off}} east to the [[Red Sea]] , and {{convert|620|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It lies at the meeting-point of longitude 39\u00ba36' east and latitude 24\u00ba28' north. It covers an area of about {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}.\n\n===Topography===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by mountains and volcanic hills, as mentioned in several references and sources. It was known as Yathrib in Writings of ancient Maeniand, this is obvious evidence that the population structure of this desert oasis is a combination of north Arabs and South Arabs, who settled there and built their civilization during the thousand years before Christ.\n\nThe soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly [[basalt]], while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era.  It is surrounded by a number of mountains: Al-Hujaj, or Pilgrims' Mountain to the west, Salaa to the north-west, Al-E'er or Caravan Mountain to the south and Uhad to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the junction of the three valleys of Al-Aql, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry mountainous region. Its western and southwestern parts have many volcanic rocks. \n\n===Climate===\nMedina has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about {{convert|43|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} with nights about {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures above {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} at night to {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in the day.

It is situated in the most fertile part of all the Hejazi territory, the streams of the vicinity tending to converge in this locality. An immense [[plain]] extends to the south; in every direction the view is bounded by hills and mountains.\n\nThe historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, {{convert|30|to|40|ft|abbr=out}} high, dating from the 12th century CE, and was flanked with towers, while on a rock, stood a castle. Of its four gates, the ''Bab-al-Salam'', or [[Egypt]]ian gate, was remarkable for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations. These suburbs also had walls and gates. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''.\n\nThe graves of [[Fatimah]] ([[Genealogy of Khadijah's daughters|Muhammad's daughter]]) and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] ([[Ahl al-Bayt|Muhammad's grandson]]), across from the mosque at ''Jannat [[al-Baqi']]'', and Abu Bakr (first caliph and the father of [[Muhammad's wives|Muhammad's wife]], [[Aisha]]), and of Umar ibn Al-Khattab), the second caliph, are also here.

The mosque was expanded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Caliph [[Al-Walid I]]. [[Mount Uhud]] is a mountain north of Medina which was the site of the second battle between [[Muslim]] and Meccan forces.\n\nAfter Muhammad migrated to Madinah, he built Quba' Mosque and offered prayers in it.

It was restored by [[Qaitbay]], the [[List of rulers of Egypt|Egyptian ruler]], in 1487.<ref name=\"EA\"/> \n\nMuslims are encouraged to perform 2 rakaat of Sunnah prayer at this Quba' Mosque. According to a hadith from Sunan Ibn Majah, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad  said, ''\u201cWhoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\u201d'' (Hadith by Imam Ibn Majah)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://muslim.sg/articles/11-places-to-visit-in-madinah?type=articles|title=10 Places To Visit In Madinah|website=muslim.sg|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n''Masjid al-Qiblatain'' is another mosque also historically important to Muslims.

Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their '[[Umrah]] (second pilgrimage after Hajj). Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina annually while performing pilgrimage [[Hajj]]. [[Al-Baqi']] is a significant cemetery in Medina where several [[Banu Hashim|family members of Muhammad]], caliphs and scholars are buried.\n\nIslamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times as being sacred in the Quran, for example [[ayah]]; 9:101, 9:129, 59:9, and ayah 63:7. [[Medinan sura]]s are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts. There is also a book within the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] titled 'Virtues of Medina'.<ref>[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=30&translator=1 hadith found in 'Virtues of Madinah' of Sahih Bukhari] searchtruth.com</ref>\n\n[[Sahih Bukhari]] says:\n{{quote|Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that.

At first, these tribes were allied with Jewish rulers, but later they revolted and became  independent.<ref name=\"Medina\">\"Al-Medina.\" ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''</ref> Toward the end of the 5th century,<ref>for date see \"J.

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/>\n\nMost modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the Aus and the Khazraj.<ref>See e.g., Peters 193; \"Qurayza\", ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''</ref> However, according to scholar of Islam [[William Montgomery Watt]], the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nEarly Muslim chronicler [[Ibn Ishaq]] tells of an ancient conflict between the last [[Yemen]]ite king of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]<ref>Muslim sources usually referred to Himyar kings by the dynastic title of \"[[Tubba']]\".</ref> and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], he was stopped from doing so by two [[rabbi]]s from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the [[Quraysh]] would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to [[Judaism]]. He took the [[rabbi]]s with him, and in [[Mecca]], they reportedly recognised the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] as a temple built by [[Abraham]] and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.<ref>Guillaume 7\u20139, Peters 49\u201350</ref>\n\nEventually the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE/1 AH, they had been fighting for 120 years and were the sworn enemies of each other.<ref name=\"balagh.net\">Subhani, ''The Message'': [http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm The Events of the First Year of Migration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053521/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aus, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.<ref>For alliances, see Guillaume 253</ref> They fought a total of four wars.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nTheir last and bloodiest battle was the [[Battle of Bu'ath]]<ref name=\"Medina\"/> that was fought a few years before the arrival of Muhammad.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/> The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. Until the arrival of Muhammad, he was the most respected inhabitant of Yathrib. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of the city met secretly with [[Muhammad]] in Al-Aqaba, a place between Makkah and Mina, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to Yathrib, where Muhammad could serve as disinterested mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n===Muhammad's arrival===\n{{Main|Hijra (Islam)|Constitution of Medina}}\nIn 622 CE/1 AH, Muhammad and around 70 Meccan [[Muhajirun]] believers left Mecca for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as civic leader. The Muslim converts native to Yathrib of whatever background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'' (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the [[Zakat]] tax.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the local pagan Arab tribes, the Muslim ''[[Muhajirun]]'' from Mecca, the local Muslims (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]''), and the Jewish population of the area signed an agreement, the [[Constitution of Medina]], which committed all parties to mutual co-operation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by [[Ibn Hisham]] is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.<ref>Firestone 118.

In the spring of 624, Muhammad received word from his intelligence sources that a trade caravan, commanded by [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], Chieftain of the Meccan Quraysh, and guarded by thirty to forty men, was travelling from [[Syria (region)|Syria]] back to Mecca. Muhammad gathered an army of 313 men, the largest army the Muslims had put in the field yet. However, many early Muslim sources, including the Quran, indicate that no serious fighting was expected,<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035058/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |date=21 August 2011 }}</ref> and the future Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife.\n\nAs the caravan approached Medina, Abu Sufyan began hearing from travellers and riders about Muhammad's planned ambush. He sent a messenger named Damdam to Mecca to warn the Quraysh and get reinforcements. Alarmed, the Quraysh assembled an army of 900\u20131,000 men to rescue the caravan. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]], [[Walid ibn Utba]], Shaiba, and [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]], joined the army. However, some of the army was to later return to Mecca before the battle.\n\nThe battle started with champions from both armies emerging to engage in combat. The Muslims sent out [[Ali]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] (Obeida), and [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]]. The Muslims dispatched the Meccan champions in a three-on-three m\u00eal\u00e9e, Hamzah killed his opponent with the very first strike, although Ubaydah was mortally wounded.<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 Sunan Abu Dawud: Book 14, Number 2659] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820142432/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 |date=20 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nNow both armies began firing arrows at each other.

Muhammad marched out to meet the force but before reaching the battle, about one third of the troops under Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew. With a smaller force, the Muslim army had to find a strategy to gain the upper hand. A group of archers were ordered to stay on a hill to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry forces and to provide protection at the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to somewhat retreat. The battle front was pushed further and further away from the archers, whom, from the start of the battle, had really nothing to do but watch. In their growing impatience to be part of the battle, and seeing that they were somewhat gaining advantage over the [[Kafir]]un ([[Infidel]]s) these archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading all along to the rest to not disobey their commanders' orders. But their words were lost among the enthusiastic yodels of their comrades.\n\nHowever, the Meccans' retreat was actually a manufactured manoeuvre that paid off. The hillside position had been a great advantage to the Muslim forces, and they had to be lured off their posts for the Meccans to turn the table over. Seeing that their strategy had actually worked, the Meccans cavalry forces went around the hill and re-appeared behind the pursuing archers. Thus, ambushed in the plain between the hill and the front line, the archers were systematically slaughtered, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill, shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but to little effect.\n\nHowever, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Medinans suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.<ref>Esposito, John L. \"Islam.\" Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices, edited by Thomas Riggs, vol. 1: Religions and Denominations, Gale, 2006, pp. 349-379.</ref>\n\n====Battle of the Trench====\n{{Main|Battle of the Trench}}\n\nIn 627, Abu Sufyan once more led Meccan forces against Medina. Because the people of Medina had dug a trench to further protect the city, this event became known as the Battle of the Trench. After a protracted siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again. During the siege, Abu Sufyan had contacted the remaining Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the defenders from behind the lines. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Banu Aus now interceded on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to the appointment of one of their chiefs, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish Law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason (Deutoronomy).<ref name=\"mantran\">Robert Mantran, ''L'expansion musulmane'' Presses Universitaires de France 1995, p. 86.</ref> This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The historian Robert Mantran argues that from this point of view it was successful&nbsp;\u2014 from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.<ref name=\"mantran\"/>\n\n===Capital city of Muhammad and the Rashidun Caliphate===\n[[File:Madina Munavara.JPG|thumb|250px|Old depiction of Medina during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times]]\n\nIn the ten years following the [[hijra (Islam)|hijra]], Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he [[Conquest of Mecca|marched on Mecca]], entering it without battle in 629 CE/8 AH, all parties acquiescing to his leadership. Afterwards, however, despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca and the ongoing importance of the Meccan [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] for Islamic pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the capital of the early [[caliphate]].\n\n''Yathrib'' was renamed Medina from ''Madinat al-Nabi'' (\"city of the Prophet\" in [[Arabic]]) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and death there. (Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Medinta'', which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dangoor.com/71page33.html|title=The Jews of Arabia|author=|date=|work=dangoor.com}}</ref>)\n\nUnder the first three caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]], Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the period of Uthman, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE/35 AH and murdered him in his own home. [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]]. After that, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power.\n\nIn 1256 CE Medina was threatened by a lava flow from the [[Harrat Rahat]] volcanic area.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0301-07=|title=Harrat Rahat}}</ref><ref>Bosworth,C.

Medina was a city of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Local rule was in the hands of the [[Hashemite]] clan as [[Sharif]]s or [[Emir]]s of Mecca. [[Fakhri Pasha]] was the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] governor of Medina. [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]] and leader of the Hashemite clan, revolted against the [[Caliph]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and sided with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The city of Medina was besieged by the Sharif's forces, and Fakhri Pasha tenaciously held on during the [[Siege of Medina]] from 1916 till 10 January 1919. He refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the [[Armistice of Moudros]], until he was arrested by his own men.<ref>Peters, Francis (1994).

Though the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is inhabited by an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers of other Arab nationalities (Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and Filipinos.\n\n==Geography==\nMedina is located in the [[Hejaz|Hijaz Region]] north-western of the country, {{convert|250|km|abbr=off}} east to the [[Red Sea]] , and {{convert|620|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It lies at the meeting-point of longitude 39\u00ba36' east and latitude 24\u00ba28' north. It covers an area of about {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}.\n\n===Topography===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by mountains and volcanic hills, as mentioned in several references and sources. It was known as Yathrib in Writings of ancient Maeniand, this is obvious evidence that the population structure of this desert oasis is a combination of north Arabs and South Arabs, who settled there and built their civilization during the thousand years before Christ.\n\nThe soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly [[basalt]], while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era.  It is surrounded by a number of mountains: Al-Hujaj, or Pilgrims' Mountain to the west, Salaa to the north-west, Al-E'er or Caravan Mountain to the south and Uhad to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the junction of the three valleys of Al-Aql, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry mountainous region. Its western and southwestern parts have many volcanic rocks. \n\n===Climate===\nMedina has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about {{convert|43|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} with nights about {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures above {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} at night to {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in the day.

Coolangatta is a twin city with [[Tweed Heads]] located directly across the NSW border. At {{Coord|28.1667|S|153.55|E|region:AU-QLD}}, this is the most easterly point on the Queensland mainland (Point Lookout on the offshore island of [[North Stradbroke Island|North Stradbroke]] is slightly further east).

Breakwaters on either side of the Seaway prevent [[longshore drift]] and the bar from silting up. A sand pumping operation on the Spit pipes sand under the Seaway to continue this natural process.\n\nResidential canals were first built in the Gold Coast in the 1950s and construction continues. Most canals are extensions to the Nerang River, but there are more to the south along [[Tallebudgera Creek]] and [[Currumbin Creek]] and to the north along the [[Gold Coast Broadwater]], [[South Stradbroke Island]], [[Coomera River]] and southern Moreton Bay.

The Government-owned electricity corporation [[Energex]] distributes and retails electricity, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and value-added products and services to residential, industrial and commercial customers in South-East Queensland.\n\n'''Water supply'''\n\nThe [[Hinze Dam]] {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Nerang is the population's main water supply. The [[Little Nerang Dam]] which feeds into [[Hinze Dam]] can supplement part of the city area's water needs, and both are managed by the city council directorate [[Gold Coast Water]]. Reforms of the way in which the water industry is structured have been announced by the State Government, with transfer of ownership and management of water services from local government to the state occurring in 2008\u201309. [[City of Gold Coast]] also sources water from [[Wivenhoe Dam]], west of Brisbane for northern suburbs when the Hinze Dam, at one-tenth of Wivenhoe's capacity, becomes low.\n\nWater shortage and water restrictions have been current local issues, and a few new Gold Coast residential areas have recently included dual reticulation in their planning and development to supply water from a new water recycling plant being built concurrently. This will make available highly treated recycled water for use around the home in addition to potable water. The Gold Coast has received world recognition for this scheme in its Pimpama-Coomera suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/t_gcw.asp?PID=5909 |title=Gold Coast City Council \u2013 Pimpama Coomera Master Plan Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Gold Coast City Council |accessdate=2 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102084652/http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/t_gcw.asp?PID=5909 |archivedate=2 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nGold Coast Water has also been recognised for its world leading HACCP water quality management system by the [[World Health Organization]] which published Gold Coast Water's system as a good model for managing water quality and safety from catchment to tap.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsp0506/en/ |title=Water safety plans: Managing drinking-water quality from catchment to consumer |publisher=World Health Organization |date=21 February 2009 |accessdate=2 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317031857/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsp0506/en/ |archivedate=17 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Gold Coast desalination project|Gold Coast desalination plant]], which opened in February 2009,<ref>{{cite news |first=Charmaine |last=Kaine |title= Smooth start for Tugun Desalination Plant |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/27/2502850.htm |work=ABC News |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2009 }}</ref> has the capacity to supply up to 133 megalitres of desalinated water per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watersecure.com.au/GoldCoastDesalinationPlant.htm |title=WaterSecure \u2013 a new source of pure water |accessdate=26 July 2009 |publisher=WaterSecure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629100102/http://www.watersecure.com.au/GoldCoastDesalinationPlant.htm |archivedate=29 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{Main|Transport on the Gold Coast, Queensland}}The car is the dominant mode of transport in the Gold Coast, with over 70% of people using it as their sole mode of travelling to work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&documentproductno=LGA33460&documenttype=Details&order=1&tabname=Details&areacode=LGA33460&issue=2006&producttype=Census%20Tables&javascript=true&textversion=false&navmapdisplayed=true&breadcrumb=LPTD&&collection=Census&period=2006&productlabel=Method%20of%20Travel%20to%20Work%20by%20Sex&producttype=Census%20Tables&method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&topic=Transport%20Access%20&%20Use&|title=Method of Travel to Work by Sex&nbsp;\u2013 Gold Coast (Local Government Area)|date=27 June 2007|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|format=Excel Spreadsheet|accessdate=12 April 2008|quote=Consists of people who solely either drove or travelled as a passenger in a car to work.}}</ref> The Gold Coast has an extensive network of arterial roads that link coastal suburbs with inland suburbs.

[[File:Skylines of Surfers Paradise, Queensland in January 2017.jpg|thumb|The [[Gold Coast Highway]] and [[G:link]] crossing the [[Nerang River]]]]\n\n==== Road ====\nA number of major roads connect the Gold Coast with Brisbane, New South Wales, and the surrounding areas. The [[Pacific Motorway (Brisbane\u2013Brunswick Heads)|Pacific Motorway]] (M1) is the main motorway in the area. Beginning at the [[Logan Motorway]] (M6) in Brisbane, it travels through the inland Gold Coast region and links with the [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]] at the New South Wales/Queensland border near [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]]. Before the [[Tugun Bypass]] was completed in 2008, the motorway ended at [[Tugun, Queensland|Tugun]]. The [[Gold Coast Highway]] services the coastal suburbs of the Gold Coast, including Surfers Paradise, Southport, and Burleigh Heads. Starting at the Pacific Motorway at Tweed Heads, it runs parallel to the coast until it reaches Labrador, where it turns inland to meet the Pacific Motorway again at [[Helensvale]]. Other arterial roads include the [[Smith Street Motorway]] which connects Southport, Gold Coast\u2019s CBD with the [[Pacific Motorway (Brisbane\u2013Brunswick Heads)|M1]] in [[Parkwood, Queensland|Parkwood]]. Other major roads include Reedy Creek Road, [[Nerang\u2013Broadbeach Road]], [[Robina Parkway]] and [[Southport \u2013 Burleigh Road|Southport\u2013Burleigh Road]].\n\n==== Light rail ====\n[[File:FC 2 test, surfers paradise boulevard, March 2014.JPG|thumb|G:link tram on Surfers Paradise Boulevard]]\nThe Gold Coast's light rail service is called [[G:link]], a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} line between [[Helensvale, Queensland|Helensvale]] and [[Broadbeach, Queensland|Broadbeach]] that also connects the key activity centres of [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]] and [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]].
