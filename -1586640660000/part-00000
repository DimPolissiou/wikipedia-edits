It was partly demolished and converted to a country house between 1560 and 1590 by [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury|the 6th Earl]].\n\nThe estate was inherited in 1626 by Mary Talbot, sister of the 7th and 8th Earls from whom it passed to her husband, Sir George Savile, 2nd Baronet. He remodelled the house in 1685\u201395. [[Sir William Savile, 3rd Baronet]], George's successor, made Rufford Abbey the seat of the Savile family after he burnt down the Saviles' original home to prevent its being occupied by a Parliamentarian garrison during the Civil War, but was killed in action in 1644. It was next inhabited by his son, the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], the [[Lord Privy Seal]], who died in 1695. In 1679, he constructed a new north wing on the site of the abbey church, containing reception rooms and a long gallery. He also built the large stable block to the right of the house. The surviving service wing (currently used as offices) was also added by the Saviles in the 17th century.\n\n[[Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet]] died unmarried in 1784 and the estate passed to his nephew [[Richard Lumley-Saunderson, 6th Earl of Scarbrough|The Hon. Richard Lumley-Saunderson]], later 6th [[Earl of Scarbrough]]. He was the younger son of the [[Richard Lumley-Saunderson, 4th Earl of Scarbrough|4th Earl of Scarbrough]] and Barbara Savile, the 8th Baronet's sister and heiress. On his death the estate passed to his younger brother, the 7th Earl, and then to the latter's son the 8th Earl, who bequeathed the estate in turn to his second natural son Captain Henry Lumley-Savile. When Henry died in 1881 it passed to his younger brother [[Augustus William Lumley-Savile]] (1829\u20131887) and then to his eldest (but illegitimate) brother, the diplomat [[John Savile, 1st Baron Savile (second creation)|John Lumley-Savile]], who assumed the surname of Savile only and was created Baron Savile the following year.\n\nBy the early 1900s, the Rufford Abbey Estate comprised some {{convert|18500|acre|km2}}, but had begun to feel the effects of rising running costs and reduced incomes. In 1931 the estate descended to the [[George Halifax Lumley-Savile, 3rd Baron Savile|3rd Baron Savile]], who was only 12 years old, and the trustees took the decision to sell the estate off in lots in 1938. [[Albert Ball (politician)|Sir Albert Ball]] bought much of the land, and quickly sold the house to the eccentric aristocrat [[Harry Clifton (producer)|Harry Clifton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/culture-leisure/country-parks/rufford-abbey|title=Rufford Abbey Country Park|last=Council|first=Nottinghamshire County|website=Nottinghamshire County Council|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe abbey and 150 acres of grounds were bought by Nottinghamshire County Council in 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/culture-leisure/country-parks/rufford-abbey|title=Rufford Abbey Country Park|last=Council|first=Nottinghamshire County|website=Nottinghamshire County Council|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> In 1956 the late 17th century north and east wings were demolished and the remaining west range and south service wing put into the care of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]].

For example, the addition of the bath house, the creation of the lake and mill buildings, the construction of the brewhouse, water tower and coach house, and also the addition of five [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]].\n\nAlthough Rufford Abbey once boasted five ice houses, only two remain today. All were constructed around 1820, when the estate was owned by [[John Lumley-Savile, 8th Earl of Scarbrough]] (1788\u20131856). The five ice houses are located near Rufford lake, created c. 1750; for the simple reason that the movement of ice from its source was easier.\n\nNot all of Rufford's ice houses faced north, as accessibility and the logistics of the ice may have meant that the builders found it easier to place the doorways facing the lake rather than northerly. It is believed that ice was mainly taken from Blackwalk Pond, which was drained to make way for housing in the 20th century. Blackwalk Pond was used to serve the abbey in Rufford's monastic era, and later supplied water to Rufford's water tower and brewhouse, which remain on site today.\n\n==The 1851 poaching incident and ballad==\n\nIn 1851, a gang of forty or so [[Poaching|poachers]] assembled in Rufford Park as a mass action against what was perceived to be the unfair monopolising of game-hunting rights by wealthy landowners. The poachers were attacked by ten gamekeepers and, in the ensuing battle, one of the gamekeepers was badly injured and later died of a fractured skull. Four of the poachers' ringleaders were arrested and each subsequently sentenced to deportation and fourteen years of penal servitude for manslaughter.

It was partly demolished and converted to a country house between 1560 and 1590 by [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury|the 6th Earl]].\n\nThe estate was inherited in 1626 by Mary Talbot, sister of the 7th and 8th Earls from whom it passed to her husband, Sir George Savile, 2nd Baronet. He remodelled the house in 1685\u201395. [[Sir William Savile, 3rd Baronet]], George's successor, made Rufford Abbey the seat of the Savile family after he burnt down the Saviles' original home to prevent its being occupied by a Parliamentarian garrison during the Civil War, but was killed in action in 1644. It was next inhabited by his son, the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], the [[Lord Privy Seal]], who died in 1695. In 1679, he constructed a new north wing on the site of the abbey church, containing reception rooms and a long gallery. He also built the large stable block to the right of the house. The surviving service wing (currently used as offices) was also added by the Saviles in the 17th century.\n\n[[Sir George Savile, 8th Baronet]] died unmarried in 1784 and the estate passed to his nephew [[Richard Lumley-Saunderson, 6th Earl of Scarbrough|The Hon. Richard Lumley-Saunderson]], later 6th [[Earl of Scarbrough]]. He was the younger son of the [[Richard Lumley-Saunderson, 4th Earl of Scarbrough|4th Earl of Scarbrough]] and Barbara Savile, the 8th Baronet's sister and heiress. On his death the estate passed to his younger brother, the 7th Earl, and then to the latter's son the 8th Earl, who bequeathed the estate in turn to his second natural son Captain Henry Lumley-Savile. When Henry died in 1881 it passed to his younger brother [[Augustus William Lumley-Savile]] (1829\u20131887) and then to his eldest (but illegitimate) brother, the diplomat [[John Savile, 1st Baron Savile (second creation)|John Lumley-Savile]], who assumed the surname of Savile only and was created Baron Savile the following year.\n\nBy the early 1900s, the Rufford Abbey Estate comprised some {{convert|18500|acre|km2}}, but had begun to feel the effects of rising running costs and reduced incomes. In 1931 the estate descended to the [[George Halifax Lumley-Savile, 3rd Baron Savile|3rd Baron Savile]], who was only 12 years old, and the trustees took the decision to sell the estate off in lots in 1938. [[Albert Ball (politician)|Sir Albert Ball]] bought much of the land, and quickly sold the house to the eccentric aristocrat [[Harry Clifton (producer)|Harry Clifton]].<ref>http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/planning-and-environment/country-parks/rufford-abbey/history-of-rufford-abbey</ref>\n\nThe abbey and 150 acres of grounds were bought by Nottinghamshire County Council in 1952.<ref>http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/planning-and-environment/country-parks/rufford-abbey/history-of-rufford-abbey</ref> In 1956 the late 17th century north and east wings were demolished and the remaining west range and south service wing put into the care of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]].

For example, the addition of the bath house, the creation of the lake and mill buildings, the construction of the brewhouse, water tower and coach house, and also the addition of five [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]].\n\nAlthough Rufford Abbey once boasted five ice houses, only two remain today. All were constructed around 1820, when the estate was owned by [[John Lumley-Savile, 8th Earl of Scarbrough]] (1788\u20131856). The five ice houses are located near Rufford lake, created c. 1750; for the simple reason that the movement of ice from its source was easier.\n\nNot all of Rufford's ice houses faced north, as accessibility and the logistics of the ice may have meant that the builders found it easier to place the doorways facing the lake rather than northerly. It is believed that ice was mainly taken from Blackwalk Pond, which was drained to make way for housing in the 20th century. Blackwalk Pond was used to serve the abbey in Rufford's monastic era, and later supplied water to Rufford's water tower and brewhouse, which remain on site today.\n\n==The 1851 poaching incident and ballad==\n\nIn 1851, a gang of forty or so [[Poaching|poachers]] assembled in Rufford Park as a mass action against what was perceived to be the unfair monopolising of game-hunting rights by wealthy landowners. The poachers were attacked by ten gamekeepers and, in the ensuing battle, one of the gamekeepers was badly injured and later died of a fractured skull. Four of the poachers' ringleaders were arrested and each subsequently sentenced to deportation and fourteen years of penal servitude for manslaughter. The incident gave rise to the popular ballad, ''Rufford Park Poachers'' ([[Roud Folk Song Index|Roud]] #1759), which depicts the poachers as bold heroes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenhindmusic.com/lyrics/RUFFPARK.html |title=Rufford Park Poachers |publisher=Golden Hind Music |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/bbals_17.htm |title=Glimpses into the 19th Century Broadside Ballad Trade: No.17: Rutterford the Poacher |publisher=Musical Traditions |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nOne of, if not the, earliest recordings is a 1907 performance by [[Joseph Taylor (folk singer)|Joseph Taylor]], collected on wax cylinder by the musicologist [[Percy Grainger]] in 1907.<ref name=\"BL-PG\">{{cite web |title=Percy Grainger's collection of ethnographic wax cylinders |url=http://blogs.bl.uk/sound-and-vision/2018/02/percy-grainger-ethnographic-wax-cylinders.html |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 |date=20 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"BL-PGC\">{{cite web |title=Percy Grainger ethnographic wax cylinders - World and traditional music |url=https://sounds.bl.uk/World-and-traditional-music/Percy-Grainger-Collection |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=22 February 2018 }}</ref> It was digitised by the [[British Library]] and made available online in 2018.<ref name=\"BL-PGC\" /> Grainger transcribed \"Rufford Park Poachers\" in the third movement of his suite, ''[[Lincolnshire Posy]]''.\n\n\"Rufford Abbey\" is a popular piece composed and arranged for brass band by [[Drake Rimmer]].

This would be the second and final release with drummer Erin Tate, who was replaced by Ben Verellen in 2005 before going on tour with Minus the Bear.<ref name=\"punknews3\"/> One of the tracks included is \"Touched for the Very First Time\" in collaboration with the band Harkonen.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASdPUHhxr_oC&lpg=PA6&dq=like-a-virgin%20(harkenen%20OR%20%22these%20arms%20are%20snakes%22)&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=like-a-virgin%20(harkenen%20OR%20%22these%20arms%20are%20snakes%22)&f=false |page=6 |title=Now: This Week's Essential New Releases |magazine=CMJ New Music Report |date=June 28, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n===''Easter'' (2006\u20132007)===\nVerellen quit the band without an explanation given in 2005, and was quickly replaced by drummer and [[Record producer|producer]] Chris Common.<ref name=\"mtv1\"/> [[Ben Verellen]] would later go on to join [[Helms Alee]] and form his own amplifier company called Verellen Amplifiers.<ref name=\"altsounds1\"/><ref name=\"stranger2\"/> The group's previous conflicts with Underoath would loosely inspire their second studio album, ''[[Easter (These Arms Are Snakes Album)|Easter]]'', released through Jade Tree in 2006.<ref name=\"smn1\"/> While These Arms Are Snakes weren't trying to make a public statement about organized religion, themes about religion (most notably on \"Perpetual Bris\") were present. A more prominent lyrical theme throughout ''Easter'' was vocalist Steve Snere trying to examine the \"bigger picture\" of life and existence.<ref name=\"smn1\"/><ref name=\"stranger1\"/>\n\nAt the end of 2006, they toured in support of their new album with [[Thrice]], [[Planes Mistaken for Stars]], [[Mouth of the Architect]] and [[Young Widows]].<ref name=\"punknews6\"/> In early 2007, These Arms Are Snakes did a small headlining tour in Europe with various bands, and returned to America to open for [[Against Me!]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]].<ref name=\"punknews7\"/>\n\n===''Tail Swallower and Dove'' (2008\u20132009)===\nFor their third studio album, These Arms Are Snakes signed to [[Suicide Squeeze Records]]\u2014a label that far better supported the band than their previous record label, Jade Tree.<ref name=\"thepunksite1\"/> Over their former label, they praised Suicide Squeeze's treatment of the band and ability to market and sell records, in addition to being with more familiar groups like Minus the Bear.<ref name=\"grixer1\"/> ''[[Tail Swallower and Dove]]'' was released in October 2008. It was again produced by Chris Common and was only recorded in one month\u2014the shortest recording period of an album for the group.<ref name=\"grixer1\"/> The album was seen as a departure from their more [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]]-sounding songs and took a more experimental approach, and also more traditional song structures.<ref name=\"avclub1\"/><ref name=\"grixer1\"/>\n\nDuring this period, These Arms Are Snakes also released a number of split releases. They released ''Pelican / These Arms Are Snakes'', a split release with [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]] through Hydra Head. A limited edition 12-inch split with Cook's side project [[Russian Circles]] was released on tour, and a split with Tropics, ''Meet Your Mayor / Future Gets Tense'' was also made in limited quantities. The band's final release before disbanding was a split single with All the Saints, which was originally released as a limited edition 7-inch vinyl through [[Touch and Go Records]], but later released as a digital download.<ref name=\"thepunksite1\"/><ref name=\"punknews4\"/> Their contributed track \"Washburn\" was recorded during the ''Tail Swallower and Dove'' sessions.<ref name=\"thepunksite1\"/>\n\n===Break up (2009\u20132010)===\nOn December 25, 2009 These Arms Are Snakes announced that they had broken up.<ref name=\"absolutepunk1\"/> The band had been inactive since late 2009 with most of the members focusing on their respective side projects. Guitarist Ryan Frederiksen had formed [[Narrows (band)|Narrows]] in 2008 with former Botch vocalist Dave Verellen and released their debut album ''[[New Distances]]'' in May 2009. Bassist Brian Cook focused on Russian Circles who had released their third album ''[[Geneva (Russian Circles album)|Geneva]]'' in October 2009. Prior to disbanding, These Arms Are Snakes had expressed interest in taking their music in a new direction for a potential fourth studio album,<ref name=\"absolutepunk2\"/> with writing and recording expected to begin in December 2009.<ref name=\"thepunksite1\"/>\n\nAlso in 2009, the group announced they had recorded tracks for a split with Minus the Bear and a compilation covers album paying tribute to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]''<ref name=\"absolutepunk2\"/>\u2014both of which were unreleased at the time of the band's break up.

A more prominent lyrical theme throughout ''Easter'' was vocalist Steve Snere trying to examine the \"bigger picture\" of life and existence.<ref name=\"smn1\"/><ref name=\"stranger1\"/>\n\nAt the end of 2006, they toured in support of their new album with [[Thrice]], [[Planes Mistaken for Stars]], [[Mouth of the Architect]] and [[Young Widows]].<ref name=\"punknews6\"/> In early 2007, These Arms Are Snakes did a small headlining tour in Europe with various bands, and returned to America to open for [[Against Me!]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]].<ref name=\"punknews7\"/>\n\n===''Tail Swallower and Dove'' (2008\u20132009)===\nFor their third studio album, These Arms Are Snakes signed to [[Suicide Squeeze Records]]\u2014a label that far better supported the band than their previous record label, Jade Tree.<ref name=\"thepunksite1\"/> Over their former label, they praised Suicide Squeeze's treatment of the band and ability to market and sell records, in addition to being with more familiar groups like Minus the Bear.<ref name=\"grixer1\"/> ''[[Tail Swallower and Dove]]'' was released in October 2008. It was again produced by Chris Common and was only recorded in one month\u2014the shortest recording period of an album for the group.<ref name=\"grixer1\"/> The album was seen as a departure from their more [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]]-sounding songs and took a more experimental approach, and also more traditional song structures.<ref name=\"avclub1\"/><ref name=\"grixer1\"/>\n\nDuring this period, These Arms Are Snakes also released a number of split releases. They released ''Pelican / These Arms Are Snakes'', a split release with [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]] through Hydra Head. A limited edition 12-inch split with Cook's side project [[Russian Circles]] was released on tour, and a split with Tropics, ''Meet Your Mayor / Future Gets Tense'' was also made in limited quantities. The band's final release before disbanding was a split single with All the Saints, which was originally released as a limited edition 7-inch vinyl through [[Touch and Go Records]], but later released as a digital download.<ref name=\"thepunksite1\"/><ref name=\"punknews4\"/> Their contributed track \"Washburn\" was recorded during the ''Tail Swallower and Dove'' sessions.<ref name=\"thepunksite1\"/>\n\n===Break up (2009\u20132010)===\nOn December 25, 2009 These Arms Are Snakes announced that they had broken up.<ref name=\"absolutepunk1\"/> The band had been inactive since late 2009 with most of the members focusing on their respective side projects.

Bassist Brian Cook focused on Russian Circles who had released their third album ''[[Geneva (Russian Circles album)|Geneva]]'' in October 2009.

Today, most affiliates reside in [[Israel]] and the [[United States]].\n\nIsrael Ben Eliezer, the \"[[Baal Shem Tov]]\", is regarded as its founding father, and his disciples developed and disseminated it. Present-day Hasidism is a sub-group within [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox (\"Haredi\") Judaism]] and is noted for its religious conservatism and social seclusion. Its members adhere closely both to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish practice]] \u2013 with the movement's own unique emphases \u2013 and the traditions of Eastern European Jews, so much so that many of the latter, including various special styles of dress and the use of the [[Yiddish language]], are nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hasidism.\n\nHasidic thought draws heavily on [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] and, to an extent, is a popularization of it. Teachings emphasize God's [[immanence]] in the universe, the need to cleave and be one with him at all times, the devotional aspect of religious practice, and the spiritual dimension of corporeality and mundane acts. ''Hasidim'', the adherents of Hasidism, are organized in [[Hasidic dynasty|independent sects known as \"courts\" or dynasties]], each headed by its own hereditary leader, a ''[[Rebbe]]''. Reverence and submission to the ''Rebbe'' are key tenets, as he is considered a spiritual authority with whom the follower must bond to gain closeness to God. The various \"courts\" share basic convictions but operate apart and possess unique traits and customs. Affiliation is often retained in families for generations, and being Hasidic is as much a sociological factor \u2013 entailing, as it does, birth into a specific community and allegiance to a dynasty of ''Rebbe''s \u2013 as it is a purely religious one. There are several \"courts\" with many thousands of member households each and hundreds of smaller ones. {{As of|2016|}}, there were over 130,000 Hasidic households worldwide, about 5% of the global Jewish population.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Hasid (term)|terms ''hasid'']] and ''hasidut'', meaning \"pietist\" and \"piety\", have a long history in Judaism. The [[Talmud]] and other old sources refer to the \"Pietists of Old\" (''Hasidim ha-Rishonim'') who would contemplate an entire hour in preparation for prayer. The phrase denoted extremely devoted individuals who not only observed the Law to its letter, but performed good deeds even beyond it. [[Adam]] himself is honored with the title in [[Eruvin (Talmud)|tractate Eruvin]] 18b by [[Rabbi Meir]]: \"Adam was a great ''hasid'', having fasted for 130 years.\" The first to adopt the epithet collectively were apparently the ''hasidim'' in [[Second Temple period]] [[Judea]], known as [[Hasideans]] after the Greek rendering of their name, who perhaps served as the model for those mentioned in the Talmud. The title continued to be applied as an honorific for the exceptionally devout. In 12th-century [[Rhineland]], or ''[[Ashkenaz]]'' in Jewish parlance, another prominent school of ascetics named themselves ''hasidim''; to distinguish them from the rest, later research employed the term [[Ashkenazi Hasidim]]. In the 16th century, when [[Kabbalah]] spread, the title also became associated with it. [[Jacob ben Hayyim Zemah]] wrote in his glossa on [[Isaac Luria]]'s version of the [[Shulchan Aruch]] that, \"One who wishes to tap the hidden wisdom, must conduct himself in the manner of the Pious.\"\n\nThe movement founded by [[Israel Ben Eliezer]] in the 18th century adopted the term ''hasidim'' in the original connotation. But when the sect grew and developed specific attributes, from the 1770s, the names gradually acquired a new meaning. Its common adherents, belonging to groups each headed by a spiritual leader, were henceforth known as Hasidim. The transformation was slow: The movement was at first referred to as \"New Hasidism\" by outsiders (as recalled in the autobiography of [[Salomon Maimon]]) to separate it from the old one, and its enemies derisively mocked its members as ''Mithasdim'', \"[those who] pretend [to be] ''hasidim''\". Yet, eventually, the young sect gained such a mass following that the old connotation was sidelined. In popular discourse, at least, Hasid came to denote someone who follows a religious teacher from the movement. It also entered [[Modern Hebrew]] as such, meaning \"adherent\" or \"disciple\". One was not merely a ''hasid'' anymore, observed historian David Assaf, but a Hasid of someone or some dynasty in particular. This linguistic transformation paralleled that of the word ''[[tzaddik]]'', \"righteous\", which the Hasidic leaders adopted for themselves \u2013 though they are known colloquially as ''Rebbe''s or by the honorific ''Admor''. Originally denoting an observant, moral person, in Hasidic literature ''tzaddik'' became synonymous with the often hereditary master heading a sect of followers.<ref name=\"Assaf1\"/><ref name=\"Ros\"/>\n\n==Hasidic philosophy==\n{{Jewish mysticism}}\n{{Main|Hasidic philosophy}}\n\n===Distinctions===\nThe lengthy history of Hasidism, the numerous schools of thought therein, and particularly its use of the traditional medium of [[homiletic]] literature and sermons \u2013 comprising numerous references to earlier sources in the [[Torah]], Talmud and exegesis as a means to grounding oneself in tradition \u2013 as the almost sole channel to convey its ideas, all made the isolation of a common doctrine highly challenging to researchers. As noted by [[Joseph Dan]], \"Every attempt to present such a body of ideas has failed\". Even motifs presented by scholars in the past as unique Hasidic contributions were later revealed to have been common among both their predecessors and opponents, all the more so regarding many other traits that are widely extant \u2013 these play, Dan added, \"a prominent role in modern non-Hasidic and anti-Hasidic writings as well\".<ref name=\"Dan2\">Joseph Dan, ''[https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Teachings_and_Literature Hasidism: Teachings and Literature]'', [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]</ref> The difficulty of separating the movement's philosophy from that of its main inspiration, Lurianic Kabbalah, and determining what was novel and what merely a recapitulation, also baffled historians. Some, like [[Louis Jacobs]], regarded the early masters as innovators who introduced \"much that was new if only by emphasis\";<ref>Louis Jacobs, ''Basic Ideas of Hasidism'', in: ''Hasidism'', [[Encyclopedia Judaica]], 2007. Volume 8, p. 408.</ref> others, primarily [[Mendel Piekarz]], argued to the contrary that but a little was not found in much earlier tracts, and the movement's originality lay in the manner it popularized these teachings to become the ideology of a well-organized sect.<ref>Mendel Piekarz, ''Ben ide\u02bcologyah li-metsi\u02bcut'', [[Bialik Institute]] (1994), {{OCLC|31267606}}. pp. 151-152; Dynner, ''Men of Silk'', p. 27.</ref>\n\nAmong the traits particularly associated with Hasidism in common understanding which are in fact widespread, is the importance of joy and happiness at worship and religious life \u2013 though the sect undoubtedly stressed this aspect and still possesses a clear populist bent. Another example is the value placed on the simple, ordinary Jew in supposed contradiction with the favouring of elitist scholars beforehand; such ideas are common in ethical works far preceding Hasidism. The movement did for a few decades challenge the rabbinic establishment, which relied on the authority of [[Torah]] acumen, but affirmed the centrality of study very soon. Concurrently, the image of its [[Misnagdim|Opponents]] as dreary intellectuals who lacked spiritual fervour and opposed mysticism is likewise unfounded. Neither did Hasidism, often portrayed as promoting healthy sensuality, unanimously reject the asceticism and self-mortification associated primarily with its rivals. Joseph Dan ascribed all these perceptions to so-called \"[[Neo-Hasidic]]\" writers and thinkers, like [[Martin Buber]]. In their attempt to build new models of spirituality for modern Jews, they propagated a romantic, sentimental image of the movement. The \"Neo-Hasidic\" interpretation influenced even scholarly discourse to a great degree, but had a tenuous connection with reality.<ref name=\"Dan2\"/>\n\nA further complication is the divide between what researchers term \"early Hasidism\", which ended roughly in the 1810s, and established Hasidism since then onwards. While the former was a highly dynamic religious revival movement, the latter phase is characterized by consolidation into sects with hereditary leadership. The mystical teachings formulated during the first era were by no means repudiated, and many Hasidic masters remained consummate spiritualists and original thinkers; as noted by [[Benjamin Brown (scholar)|Benjamin Brown]], Buber's once commonly accepted view that the routinization constituted \"decadence\" was refuted by later studies, demonstrating that the movement remained very much innovative.<ref>See, for example, Benjamin Brown, [https://www.academia.edu/9612489/ Hasidism Without Romanticism: Mendel Piekarz's Path in the study of Hasidism]. pp. 455-456.</ref> Yet many aspects of early Hasidism were indeed de-emphasized in favour of more conventional religious expressions, and its radical concepts were largely neutralized. Some ''Rebbe''s adopted a relatively rationalist bent, sidelining their explicit mystical, [[theurgical]] roles, and many others functioned almost solely as political leaders of large communities. As to their Hasidim, affiliation was less a matter of admiring a charismatic leader as in the early days, but rather birth into a family belonging to a specific \"court\".<ref>Assaf, ''Regal Way'', pp. 49-55, 63-67; Dynner, ''Men of Silk'', pp. 117-121.</ref>\n\n===Immanence===\n[[File:Besht11.jpg|thumb|right|Rebuilt synagogue of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]. Rural [[shtetl]] life promoted awareness of the [[Divine immanence|immanent]] Divine Presence in Nature|300px]]\nThe most fundamental theme underlying all Hasidic theory is the [[immanence]] of God in the universe, often expressed in a phrase from [[Tikunei haZohar]], ''Leit Atar panuy mi-n\u00e9ya'' ([[Aramaic]]: \"no site is devoid of Him\"). This [[panentheistic]] concept was derived from Lurianic discourse, but greatly expanded in the Hasidic one. In the beginning, in order to [[Genesis creation narrative|create the world]], God contracted (''[[Tzimtzum]]'') his omnipresence, the ''[[Ein Sof]]'', leaving a Vacant Void (''Khalal panui''), bereft from obvious presence and therefore able to entertain free will, contradictions and other phenomena seemingly separate from God himself. These would have been impossible within his original, perfect existence. Yet, the very reality of the world which was created in the Void is entirely dependent on its divine origin. Matter would have been null and void without the true, spiritual essence it possesses. Just the same, the infinite ''Ein Sof'' cannot manifest in the Vacant Void, and must limit itself in the guise of measurable corporeality that may be perceived.<ref name=\"Elior1\">Rachel Elior, [http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~mselio/yesod-42-sci.pdf \u05d9\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df - \u05d3\u05e4\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea], in: ''Masu\u02bcot : me\u1e25\u1e33arim be-sifrut ha-\u1e33abalah ube-ma\u1e25shevet Yi\u015bra\u02bcel'', [[Bialik Institute]] (1994), {{OCLC|221873939}}. pp. 53-54.</ref>\n\nThus, there is a dualism between the true aspect of everything and the physical side, false but ineluctable, with each evolving into the other: as God must compress and disguise himself, so must humans and matter in general ascend and reunite with the omnipresence. [[Rachel Elior]] quoted [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], in his commentary ''[[Torah Or]]'' on Genesis 28:21, who wrote that \"''this is the purpose of Creation, from Infinity to Finitude, so it may be reversed from the state of Finite to that of Infinity''\". Kabbalah stressed the importance of this dialectic, but mainly (though not exclusively) evoked it in cosmic terms, referring for example to the manner in which God progressively diminished himself into the world through the various dimensions, or ''[[Sephirot]]''. Hasidism applied it also to the most mundane details of human existence. All Hasidic schools devoted a prominent place in their teaching, with differing accentuation, to the interchanging nature of ''Ein'', both infinite and imperceptible, becoming ''Yesh'', \"Existent\" \u2013 and vice versa. They used the concept as a prism to gauge the world, and the needs of the spirit in particular. Elior noted: \"''Reality lost its static nature and permanent value, now measured by a new standard, seeking to expose the Godly, boundless essence, manifest in its tangible, circumscribed opposite.''\"<ref>Elior, p. 56.</ref>\n\nOne major derivative of this philosophy is the notion of ''[[devekut]]'', \"communion\". As God was everywhere, connection with him had to be pursued ceaselessly as well, in all times, places and occasions. Such an experience was in the reach of every person, who only had to negate his inferior impulses and grasp the truth of divine immanence, enabling him to unite with it and attain the state of perfect, selfless bliss. Hasidic masters, well versed in the teachings concerning communion, are supposed not only to gain it themselves, but to guide their flock to it. ''Devekut'' was not a strictly defined experience; many varieties were described, from the utmost ecstasy of the learned leaders to the common man's more humble yet no less significant emotion during prayer.\n\nClosely linked with the former is ''Bitul ha-Yesh'', \"Negation of the Existent\", or of the \"Corporeal\". Hasidism teaches that while a superficial observance of the universe by the \"eyes of the flesh\" (''Einei ha-Basar'') purportedly reflects the reality of all things profane and worldly, a true devotee must transcend this illusory fa\u00e7ade and realize that there is nothing but God. It is not only a matter of perception, but very practical, for it entails also abandoning material concerns and cleaving only to the true, spiritual ones, oblivious to the surrounding false distractions of life. The practitioner's success in detaching from his sense of person, and conceive himself as ''Ein'' (in the double meaning of 'naught' and 'infinite'), is regarded as the highest state of elation in Hasidism. The true divine essence of man \u2013 the soul \u2013 may then ascend and return to the upper realm, where it does not possess an existence independent from God. This ideal is termed ''Hitpashtut ha-Gashmi'yut'', \"the expansion (or removal) of corporeality\". It is the dialectic opposite of God's contraction into the world.<ref>Elior, pp. 60-61.</ref>\n\nTo be enlightened and capable of ''Bitul ha-Yesh'', pursuing the pure spiritual aims and defying the primitive impulses of the body, one must overcome his inferior \"Bestial Soul\", connected with the Eyes of the Flesh. He may be able to tap into his \"Divine Soul\" (''Nefesh Elohit''), which craves communion, by employing constant contemplation, ''Hitbonenot'', on the hidden Godly dimension of all that exists. Then he could understand his surroundings with the \"Eyes of the Intellect\". The ideal adherent was intended to develop equanimity, or ''Hishtavut'' in Hasidic parlance, toward all matters worldly, not ignoring them, but understanding their superficiality.\n\nHasidic masters exhorted their followers to \"negate themselves\", paying as little heed as they could for worldly concerns, and thus, to clear the way for this transformation. The struggle and doubt of being torn between the belief in God's immanence and the very real sensual experience of the indifferent world is a key theme in the movement's literature. Many tracts have been devoted to the subject, acknowledging that the \"callous and rude\" flesh hinders one from holding fast to the ideal, and these shortcomings are extremely hard to overcome even in the purely intellectual level, a fortiori in actual life.<ref>Elior, pp. 55, 62-63.</ref>\n\nAnother implication of this dualism is the notion of \"Worship through Corporeality\", ''Avodah be-Gashmi'yut''. As the ''Ein Sof'' metamorphosed into substance, so may it in turn be raised back to its higher state; likewise, since the machinations in the higher ''Sephirot'' exert their influence on this world, even the most simple action may, if performed correctly and with understanding, achieve the reverse effect. According to Lurianic doctrine, the netherworld was suffused with divine sparks, concealed within \"husks\", ''[[Qliphoth]]''. The glints had to be recovered and elevated to their proper place in the cosmos. \"Materiality itself could be embraced and consecrated\", noted [[Glenn Dynner]], and Hasidism taught that by common acts like dancing or eating, performed with intention, the sparks could be extricated and set free. ''Avodah be-Gashmi'yut'' had a clear, if not implicit, [[antinomian]] edge, possibly equating sacred rituals mandated by Judaism with everyday activities, granting them the same status in the believer's eyes and having him content to commit the latter at the expense of the former. While at some occasions the movement did appear to step at that direction \u2013 for example, in its early days prayer and preparation for it consumed so much time that adherents were blamed of neglecting sufficient Torah study \u2013 Hasidic masters proved highly conservative. Unlike in other, more radical sects influenced by kabbalistic ideas, like the [[Sabbateans]], Worship through Corporeality was largely limited to the elite and carefully restrained. The common adherents were taught they may engage it only mildly, through small deeds like earning money to support their leaders.\n\nThe complementary opposite of corporeal worship, or the elation of the finite into infinite, is the concept of ''Hamshacha'', \"drawing down\" or \"absorbing\", and specifically, ''Hamschat ha-Shefa'', \"absorption of effluence\". During spiritual ascension, one could siphon the power animating the higher dimensions down into the material world, where it would manifest as benevolent influence of all kinds. These included spiritual enlightenment, zest in worship and other high-minded aims, but also the more prosaic health and healing, deliverance from various troubles and simple economic prosperity. Thus, a very tangible and alluring motivation to become followers emerged. Both corporeal worship and absorption allowed the masses to access, with common actions, a religious experience once deemed esoteric.<ref>Dynner, ''Men of Silk'', pp. 32-33.</ref>\n\nYet another reflection of the ''Ein''-''Yesh'' dialectic is pronounced in the transformation of evil to goodness and the relations between these two poles and other contradicting elements \u2013 including various traits and emotions of the human psyche, like pride and humility, purity and profanity, et cetera. Hasidic thinkers argued that in order to redeem the sparks hidden, one had to associate not merely with the corporeal, but with sin and evil. One example is the elevation of impure thoughts during prayer, transforming them to noble ones rather than repressing them, advocated mainly in the early days of the sect; or \"breaking\" oneself's character by directly confronting profane inclinations. This aspect, once more, had sharp antinomian implications and was used by the Sabbateans to justify excessive sinning. It was mostly toned down in late Hasidism, and even before that leaders were careful to stress that it was not exercised in the physical sense, but in the contemplative, spiritual one. This kabbalistic notion, too, was not unique to the movement and appeared frequently among other Jewish groups.<ref>The entire section is based on: Elior, ''\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df''; Dan, ''Teachings'', YIVO; ''Hasidism'', Judaica, pp. 410-412.</ref>\n\n===Righteous One===\n[[File:Isroel Hopsztajn.jpg|thumb|[[Rebbe]] [[Yisroel Hopsztajn]], a great promulgator of Hasidism in Poland, blessing acolytes c 1800. Hasidism gave the elite [[Tzadik]] a social mystical role|300px]]\nWhile its mystical and ethical teachings are not easily sharply distinguished from those of other Jewish currents, the defining doctrine of Hasidism is that of the saintly leader, serving both as an ideal inspiration and an institutional figure around whom followers are organized. In the movement's sacral literature, this person is referred to as the ''[[Tzadik|Tzaddiq]]'', the Righteous One \u2013 often also known by the general honorific ''Admor'' (acronym of Hebrew for \"our master, teacher and Rabbi\"), granted to rabbis in general, or colloquially as ''Rebbe''. The idea that, in every generation, there are righteous persons through whom the divine effluence is drawn to the material world is rooted in the kabbalistic thought, which also claims that one of them is supreme, the reincarnation of [[Moses]]. Hasidism elaborated the notion of the ''Tzaddiq'' into the basis of its entire system \u2013 so much that the very term gained an independent meaning within it, apart from the [[Tzadik|original which denoted God-fearing, highly observant]] people.<ref name=\"Assaf1\">David Assaf, ''The Regal Way: The Life and Times of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin'', Stanford University Press (2002). pp. 101\u2013104.</ref>\n\nWhen the sect began to attract following and expanded from a small circle of learned disciples to a mass movement, it became evident that its complex philosophy could be imparted only partially to the new rank and file. As even intellectuals struggled with the sublime dialectics of infinity and corporeality, there was little hope to have the common folk truly internalize these, not as mere abstractions to pay lip service to.<ref>Elior, p. 65.</ref> Ideologues exhorted them to have faith, but the true answer, which marked their rise as a distinct sect, was the concept of the ''Tzaddiq''. A Hasidic master was to serve as a living embodiment of the recondite teachings. He was able to transcend matter, gain spiritual communion, Worship through Corporeality and fulfill all the theoretical ideals. As the vast majority of his flock could not do so themselves, they were to cleave to him instead, acquiring at least some semblance of those vicariously. His commanding and often \u2013 especially in the early generations \u2013 charismatic presence was to reassure the faithful and demonstrate the truth in Hasidic philosophy by countering doubts and despair. But more than spiritual welfare was concerned: Since it was believed he could ascend to the higher realms, the leader was able to harvest effluence and bring it down upon his adherents, providing them with very material benefits. \"The crystallization of that [[theurgical]] phase\", noted [[Glenn Dynner]], \"marked Hasidism's evolution into a full-fledged social movement.\"\n\nIn Hasidic discourse, the willingness of the leader to sacrifice the ecstasy and fulfillment of unity in God was deemed a heavy sacrifice undertaken for the benefit of the congregation. His followers were to sustain and especially to obey him, as he possessed superior knowledge and insight gained through communion. The \"descent of the Righteous\" (''Yeridat ha-Tzaddiq'') into the matters of the world was depicted as identical with the need to save the sinners and redeem the sparks concealed in the most lowly places. Such a link between his functions as communal leader and spiritual guide legitimized the political power he wielded. It also prevented a retreat of Hasidic masters into hermitism and passivity, as many mystics before them did. Their worldly authority was perceived as part of their long-term mission to elevate the corporeal world back into divine infinity.<ref name=\"AA\">Elior, pp. 66\u201368; Dynner, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> To a certain extent, the Saint even fulfilled for his congregation, and for it alone, a limited [[Messiah in Judaism|Messianic]] capacity in his lifetime. After the Sabbatean debacle, this moderate approach provided a safe outlet for the eschatological urges. At least two leaders radicalized in this sphere and caused severe controversy: [[Nachman of Breslov]], who declared himself the only true ''Tzaddiq'', and [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], whom many of his followers believed to be the Messiah. The ''Rebbe''s were subject to intense hagiography, even subtly compared with Biblical figures by employing prefiguration.<ref name=\"Dan2\"/> It was argued that since followers could not \"negate themselves\" sufficiently to transcend matter, they should instead \"negate themselves\" in submission to the Saint (''hitbatlut la-Tzaddiq''), thus bonding with him and enabling themselves to access what he achieved in terms of spirituality. The Righteous served as a mystical bridge, drawing down effluence and elevating the prayers and petitions of his admirers.<ref name=\"AA\"/>\n\nThe Saintly forged a well-defined relationship with the masses: they provided the latter with inspiration, were consulted in all matters, and were expected to intercede on behalf of their adherents with God and ensure they gained financial prosperity, health and male offspring. The pattern still characterizes Hasidic sects, though prolonged routinization in many turned the ''Rebbes'' into de facto political leaders of strong, institutionalized communities. The role of a Saint was obtained by charisma, erudition and appeal in the early days of Hasidism. But by the dawn of the 19th century, the Righteous began to claim legitimacy by descent to the masters of the past, arguing that since they linked matter with infinity, their abilities had to be associated with their own corporeal body. Therefore, it was accepted \"there can be no ''Tzaddiq'' but the son of a ''Tzaddiq''\". Virtually all modern sects maintain this hereditary principle. For example, the ''Rebbe''s' families maintain endogamy and marry almost solely with scions of other dynasties.<ref>Assaf, ''Regal Way'', pp. 108\u2013110.</ref>\n\n===Schools of thought===\nSome Hasidic \"courts\", and not a few individual prominent masters, developed distinct philosophies with particular accentuation of various themes in the movement's general teachings. Several of these Hasidic schools had lasting influence over many dynasties, while others died with their proponents. In the doctrinal sphere, the dynasties may be divided along many lines. Some are characterized by ''Rebbe''s who are predominantly Torah scholars and [[Posek|decisors]], deriving their authority much like ordinary non-Hasidic rabbis do. Such \"courts\" place great emphasis on strict observance and study, and are among the most meticulous in the Orthodox world in practice. Prominent examples are the House of [[Sanz]] and its scions, such as [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], or [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]]. Other sects, like [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]], espouse a charismatic-populist line, centered on the admiration of the masses for the Righteous, his effervescent style of prayer and conduct and his purported miracle-working capabilities. Fewer still retain a high proportion of the mystical-spiritualist themes of early Hasidism, and encourage members to study much kabbalistic literature and (carefully) engage in the field. The various [[Ziditchover]] dynasties mostly adhere to this philosophy.<ref name=\"RAD\"/>\nOthers still focus on contemplation and achieving inner perfection. No dynasty is wholly devoted to a single approach of the above, and all offer some combination with differing emphasis on each of those.\n\nIn 1812, a schism occurred between the [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Seer of Lublin]] and his prime disciple, the [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Holy Jew]] of [[Przysucha]], due to both personal and doctrinal disagreements. The Seer adopted a populist approach, centered on the Righteous' theurgical functions to draw the masses. He was famous for his lavish, enthusiastic conduct during prayer and worship, and extremely charismatic demeanour. He stressed that as ''Tzaddiq'', his mission was to influence the common folk by absorbing Divine Light and satisfying their material needs, thus converting them to his cause and elating them. The Holy Jew pursued a more introspective course, maintaining that the ''Rebbe'''s duty was to serve as a spiritual mentor for a more elitist group, helping them to achieve a senseless state of contemplation, aiming to restore man to his oneness with God which [[Adam]] supposedly lost when he ate the fruit of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Lignum Scientiae]]. The Holy Jew and his successors did neither repudiate miracle working, nor did they eschew dramatic conduct; but they were much more restrained in general. The Przysucha School became dominant in [[Congress Poland|Central Poland]], while populist Hasidism resembling the Lublin ethos often prevailed in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]].<ref>Dynner, pp. 29-31.</ref> One extreme and renowned philosopher who emerged from the Przysucha School was [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]]. Adopting an elitist, hard-line attitude, he openly denounced the folkly nature of other ''Tzaddiqim'', and rejected financial support. Gathering a small group of devout scholars who sought to attain spiritual perfection, whom he often berated and mocked, he always stressed the importance of both somberness and totality, stating it was better to be fully wicked than only somewhat good.\n\nThe [[Chabad]] school, limited to its namesake dynasty, but prominent, was founded by [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] and was elaborated by his successors, until the late 20th century. The movement retained many of the attributes of early Hasidism, before a clear divide between Righteous and ordinary followers was cemented. Chabad ''Rebbe''s insisted their adherents acquire proficiency in the sect's lore, and not relegate most responsibility to the leaders. The sect emphasizes the importance of intellectually grasping the dynamics of the hidden divine aspect and how they affect the human psyche; the very acronym Chabad is for the three penultimate ''[[Sephirot]]'', associated with the cerebral side of consciousness.\n\nAnother famous philosophy is that formulated by [[Nachman of Breslov]] and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast to most of his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics and the manner in which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive faith in their reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to see the world as it truly is.\n\n[[Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov]], a major Galician ''Tzaddiq'', was a disciple of the Seer of Lublin, but combined his populist inclination with a strict observance even among his most common followers, and great pluralism in matters pertaining to mysticism, as those were eventually emanating from each person's unique soul.\n\n[[Mordechai Yosef Leiner]] of [[Izbica]] promulgated a radical understanding of free will, which he considered illusory and also derived directly from God. He argued that when one attained a sufficient spiritual level and could be certain evil thoughts did not derive from his animalistic soul, then sudden urges to transgress revealed Law were God-inspired and may be pursued. This volatile, potentially antinomian doctrine of \"Transgression for the Sake of Heaven\" is found also in other Hasidic writings, especially from the early period. His successors de-emphasized it in their commentaries. Leiner's disciple [[Zadok HaKohen]] of Lublin also developed a complex philosophic system which presented a dialectic nature in history, arguing that great progress had to be preceded by crisis and calamity.\n\n==Practice and culture==\n\n===''Rebbe'' and \"court\"===\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - The Rabbi of Kalib (1).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Menachem Mendel Taub|Kaliver Rebbe]], Holocaust survivor, inspiring his court on the festival of [[Sukkoth]]]]\n[[File:\u05e4\u05ea\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d8\u05e9.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kvitel]] requests for blessing piled on the [[Ohel (grave)|graves]] of the last [[Chabad|Lubavitcher Rebbes]]]]\nThe Hasidic community is organized in a sect known as \"court\" (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05e6\u05e8, ''hatzer''; Yiddish: \u05d4\u05d5\u05d9\u05e3, ''Hoif'' from German ''Hof/Gerichtshof''). In the early days of the movement, a particular ''Rebbe'''s following usually resided in the same town, and Hasidim were categorized by their leaders' settlement: a Hasid of Belz, Vizhnitz and so forth. Later, especially after World War II, the dynasties retained the names of their original Eastern European settlements when moving to the West or Israel. Thus, for example, the \"court\" established by [[Joel Teitelbaum]] in 1905 at Transylvania remained known after its namesake town, [[Sathmar]], even though its headquarters lay in New York, and almost all other Hasidic sects likewise \u2013 albeit some groups founded overseas were named accordingly, like the [[Boston (Hasidic dynasty)]].\n\nAkin to his spiritual status, the ''Rebbe'' is also the administrative head of the community. Sects often possess their own synagogues, study halls and internal charity mechanisms, and ones sufficiently large also maintain entire educational systems. The ''Rebbe'' is the supreme figure of authority, and not just for the institutions. The rank-and-file Hasidim are also expected to consult with him on important matters, and often seek his blessing and advice. He is personally attended by aides known as ''[[Gabbai]]'' or ''Mashbak''.\n\nMany particular Hasidic rites surround the leader. On the Sabbath, holidays, and celebratory occasions, ''Rebbe''s hold a ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|Tisch]]'' (table), a large feast for their male adherents. Together, they sing, dance, and eat, and the head of the sect shakes the hands of his followers to bless them, and often delivers a sermon. A ''Chozer'', \"repeater\", selected for his good memory, commits the text to writing after the Sabbath (any form of writing during the Sabbath itself [[activities prohibited on Shabbat|being forbidden]]). In many \"courts\", the remnants of his meal, supposedly suffused with holiness, are handed out and even fought over. Often, a very large dish is prepared beforehand and the ''Rebbe'' only tastes it before passing it to the crowd. Apart from the gathering at noon, the [[seudah shlishit|third repast]] on Sabbath and the \"[[Melaveh Malkah]]\" meal when it ends are also particularly important and an occasion for song, feasting, tales and sermons. A central custom, which serves as a major factor in the economics of most \"courts\", is the ''Pidyon'', \"Ransom\", better known by its Yiddish name ''[[Kvitel]]'', \"little note\": adherents submit a written petition, which the master may assist with on behalf of his sanctity, adding a sum of money for either charity or the leader's needs.<ref>[[Louis Jacobs]], ''[https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Everyday_Life Hasidism: Everyday Life]'', [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]].</ref><ref>''Hasidism: Hasidic Way of Life'', Encyclopedia Judaica, Volume 8, pp. 398-399.</ref> Occasions in the \"court\" serve as pretext for mass gatherings, flaunting the power, wealth and size of each. Weddings of the leader's family, for example, are often held with large multistoried stands (\u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05e0\u05d8\u05e9\u05e2\u05e1, ''Parentches'') filled with Hasidim surround the main floor, where the ''Rebbe'' and his relatives dine, celebrate and perform the [[Mitzvah tantz]]. This is a festive dance with the bride: both parties hold one end of a long sash, a Hasidic [[gartel]], for reasons of modesty.\n\nAllegiance to the dynasty and ''Rebbe'' is also often a cause for tension and violence.<ref>Mintz, Jerome R.

Technically, they fill the original role of ''Rebbe''s in providing for spiritual welfare; yet, they do not usurp the title, and are therefore countenanced.<ref>Tomer Persico, ''[https://tomerpersico.com/2014/03/27/brown_interview/ \u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05d6\u05e6\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05e7\u05e6\u05e0\u05d4, \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05e1\u05ea\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u2013 \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05dd \u05d3\"\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea]''.</ref>\n\n===Liturgy===\nMost Hasidim use some variation of ''[[Nusach Sefard]]'', a blend of [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]] liturgies, based on the innovations of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]]. Many dynasties have their own specific adaptation of Nusach Sefard; some, such as the versions of the Belzer, Bobover, and [[Dushinsky (Hasidic dynasty)|Dushinsky]] Hasidim, are closer to Nusach Ashkenaz, while others, such as the Munkacz version, are closer to the old Lurianic. Many sects believe that their version reflects Luria's mystical devotions best. The Baal Shem Tov added two segments to Friday services on the eve of Sabbath: Psalm 107 before [[Mincha|afternoon prayer]], and Psalm 23 at the end of [[Maariv (prayer)|evening service]].\n\nHasidim use the [[Ashkenazi pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]] for liturgical purposes, reflecting their Eastern European background. Wordless, emotional melodies, ''[[nigun]]im'', are particularly common in their services.\n\nHasidim lend great importance to ''[[kavanah|kavana]]'', devotion or intention, and their services tend to be extremely long and repetitive. Some courts nearly abolished traditional specified times by which prayers must be conducted (''zemanim''), to prepare and concentrate. This practice, still enacted in [[Chabad]] for one, is controversial in many dynasties, which do follow the specifics of [[Jewish Law]] on praying earlier, and not eating beforehand. Another reglement is daily immersion in a [[Mikveh|ritual bath]] by males for spiritual cleansing, at a rate much higher than is customary among other Orthodox Jews.\n\n===Melody===\nHasidism developed a unique emphasis on the spirituality of melody (''[[Nigunim]]'') as a means to reach [[Deveikut]] Divine communion, during prayer and communal gatherings. Ecstatic, often wordless Hasidic melodies developed new expressions and depths of the soul in Jewish life, often drawing from folk idioms of the surrounding gentile culture, which were adapted to elevate their concealed sparks of divinity, according to [[Lurianic]] theology.<ref>[https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Music Hasidism: Music] YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe</ref>\n\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Hasidic Family in Street - Borough Park - Hasidic District - Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Hasidic family in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]].

Some details of their dress are shared by non-Hasidic Haredim. Much of Hasidic dress was historically the clothing of all Eastern European Jews, influenced by the style of [[szlachta|Polish\u2013Lithuanian nobility]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goldberg-Mulkiewicz|first=Olga|encyclopedia=[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]|title=Dress|url=https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Dress|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref> Furthermore, Hasidim have attributed religious origins to specific Hasidic items of clothing.\n\nHasidic men most commonly wear dark overclothes. On weekdays, they wear a long, black, cloth jacket called a [[rekel]], and on [[Jewish holidays|Jewish Holy Days]], the [[bekishe]] ''zaydene kapote'' (Yiddish, lit., satin caftan), a similarly long, black jacket, but of [[satin]] fabric traditionally silk. Indoors, the colorful tish [[bekishe]] is still worn. Some Hasidim wear a satin overcoat, known as ''rezhvolke''. A rebbe's ''rezhvolke'' might be trimmed with velvet. Most do not wear [[necktie]]s.\n\nOn [[Shabbat|the Sabbath]], the Hasidic ''Rebbes'' traditionally wore a white [[bekishe]]. This practice has fallen into disuse among most. Many of them wear a black silk ''[[bekishe]]'' that is trimmed with velvet (known as ''stro-kes'' or ''samet'') and in Hungarian ones, gold-embroidered.\n\nVarious symbolic and religious qualities are attributed to Hasidic dress, though they are mainly apocryphal and the clothes' origin is cultural and historical. For example, the long overcoats are considered modest, the Shtreimel is supposedly related to [[shaatnez]] and keeps one warm without using [[wool]], and Sabbath shoes are laceless in order not to have to tie a knot, a prohibited action. A ''[[gartel]]'' divides the Hasid's lower parts from his upper parts, implying modesty and chastity, and for kabbalistic reasons, Hasidim button their clothes right over left. Hasidic men customarily wear black hats during the weekdays, as do nearly all Haredi men today. A variety of hats are worn depending on the group: Chabad men often pinch their hats to form a triangle on the top, Satmar men wear an open-crown hat with rounded edges, and ''Samet'' (velvet) or ''biber'' ([[beaver]]) hats are worn by many Galician and Hungarian Hasidic men.\n\nMarried Hasidic men don a variety of fur [[headdress]]es on the Sabbath, once common among all wedded Eastern European Jewish males and still worn by non-Hasidic [[Perushim]] in Jerusalem. The most ubiquitous is the ''[[Shtreimel]]'', which is seen especially among Galician and Hungarian sects like Satmar or Belz. A taller ''[[Spodik]]'' is donned by Polish dynasties such as [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]]. A ''[[Kolpik]]'' is worn by unmarried sons and grandsons of many Rebbes on the Sabbath. Some Rebbes don it on special occasions.\n\nThere are many other distinct items of clothing. Such are the [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerrer]] ''hoyznzokn''\u2014long black socks into which the trousers are tucked. Some Hasidic men from Eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] wear black socks with their breeches on the Sabbath, as opposed to white ones on weekdays, particularly [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belzer]] Hasidim.\n\nFollowing a Biblical commandment not to shave the sides of one's face (Leviticus 19:27), male members of most Hasidic groups wear long, uncut sidelocks called [[payot]] (or ''peyes''). Some Hasidic men shave off the rest of their hair. Not every Hasidic group requires long peyos, and not all Jewish men with peyos are Hasidic, but all Hasidic groups discourage the shaving of one's beard. Most Hasidic boys receive their [[first haircut]]s ceremonially at the age of three years (only the Skverrer Hasidim do this at their boys' second birthday). Until then, Hasidic boys have long hair.\n\nHasidic women wear clothing adhering to the principles of [[tzeniut|modest dress in Jewish law]]. This includes long, conservative skirts and sleeves past the elbow, as well as covered necklines. Also, the women wear stockings to cover their legs; in some Hasidic groups, such as [[Satmar]] or [[Toldot Aharon]], the stockings must be opaque. In keeping with [[Halacha|Jewish law]], married women cover their hair, using either a ''[[sheitel]]'' (wig), a ''[[tichel]]'' (headscarf), a ''[[shpitzel]]'', a [[snood (headgear)|snood]], a hat, or a beret. In some Hasidic groups, such as [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], women may wear two headcoverings \u2013 a wig and a scarf, or a wig and a hat.\n\n===Families===\n\nHasidic Jews, like many other Orthodox Jews, typically produce large families; the average Hasidic family in the United States has 8 children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aish.com/jw/s/48899452.html |title=Jews and the Jewish Birthrate |publisher=Aish.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> This is followed out of a desire to fulfill the Biblical mandate to \"[[cultural mandate|be fruitful and multiply]]\".\n\n===Languages===\nMost Hasidim speak the language of their countries of residence, but use [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] among themselves as a way of remaining distinct and preserving tradition. Thus, children are still learning Yiddish today, and the language, despite predictions to the contrary, is not dead. Yiddish newspapers are still published, and Yiddish fiction is being written, primarily aimed at women. Even films in Yiddish are being produced within the Hasidic community. Some Hasidic groups, such as Satmar or Toldot Aharon, actively oppose the everyday use of Hebrew, which they consider a holy tongue. The use of Hebrew for anything other than prayer and study is, according to them, profane and so Yiddish is the vernacular and common tongue for many Hasidim around the world.\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Chassid22.jpg|thumb|right|Sculpture of the Hasidic movement's celebration of spirituality on the [[Knesset Menorah]]]]\nHasidic Tales are a literary genre, concerning both hagiography of various ''Rebbes'' and moralistic themes. Some are anecdotes or recorded conversations dealing with matters of faith, practice, and the like. The most famous tend to be terse and carry a strong and obvious point. They were often transmitted orally, though the earliest compendium is from 1815.<ref name=\"Schacter-Shalomi, Zalman 2003\">Schacter-Shalomi, Zalman, Wrapped in a Holy Flame (2003) San Francisco CA, Jossey-Bass, {{ISBN|0-7879-6573-1}}</ref>\n\nMany revolve around the Righteous.

The right-wing, identified with [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], are hostile to the [[State of Israel]], and refuse to participate in the elections there or receive any state funding. They are mainly affiliated with the [[Orthodox Council of Jerusalem]] and the [[Central Rabbinical Congress]]. The great majority belong to ''Agudas Israel'', represented in Israel by the [[United Torah Judaism]] party. Its [[Council of Torah Sages]] now includes a dozen ''Rebbe''s. In the past, there were Religious Zionist ''Rebbe''s, mainly of the Ruzhin line, but there are virtually none today.<ref>Brown, \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4. pp. 1-14, etc.</ref>\n\nIn 2016, a study conducted by Prof. [[Marcin Wodzi\u0144ski]], drawing from the courts' own internal phone-books and other resources, located 129,211 Hasidic households worldwide, about 5% of the estimated total Jewish population. Of those, 62,062 resided in [[Israel]] and 53,485 in the [[United States]], 5,519 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and 3,392 in [[Canada]]. In Israel, the largest Hasidic concentrations are in the Ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods of [[Jerusalem]] \u2013 including [[Ramot Alon]], [[Batei Ungarin]] et cetera \u2013 in the cities of [[Bnei Brak]] and [[El'ad]], and in the [[West Bank settlement]]s of [[Modi'in Illit]] and [[Beitar Illit]]. There is considerable presence in other specifically Orthodox municipalities or enclaves, like [[Kiryat Sanz, Netanya]]. In the United States, most Hasidim reside in [[New York (state)|New York]], though there are small communities across the entire country. [[Brooklyn]], [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], and [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] all house a particularly large population. So does the hamlet of [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]] in upstate New York. In the same region, [[New Square]] and [[Kiryas Joel]] are rapidly growing all-Hasidic enclaves, one founded by the [[Skver]] dynasty and the other by Satmar. In Britain, [[Stamford Hill]] is home to the largest Hasidic community in the country, and there are others in London and [[Prestwich]] in Manchester. In Canada, [[Kiryas Tosh]] is a settlement populated entirely by [[Tosh (Hasidic dynasty)|Tosh]] Hasidim, and there are more adherents of other sects in and around Montreal.<ref name=\"Wodz\">All numbers are from: Marcin Wodzi\u0144ski, ''Historical Atlas of Hasidism'', Princeton University Press, 2018. pp. 192-205.</ref>\n\nThere are more than a dozen Hasidic dynasties with a large following, and over a hundred which have small or minuscule adherence, sometimes below twenty people, with the presumptive ''Rebbe'' holding the title more as a matter of prestige. Many \"courts\" became completely extinct during the [[Holocaust]], like the [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)]] from [[Aleksandr\u00f3w \u0141\u00f3dzki]], which numbered tens of thousands in 1939, and barely exists today.<ref>Jacques Gutwirth, The Rebirth of Hasidism: From 1945 to the Present Day, Odile Jacob, 2004. pp. 106-108.</ref>\n\nThe largest sect in the world, with some 26,000 member households which constitute 20% of all Hasidim, is Satmar, founded in 1905 in the namesake city in Hungary and based in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] and [[Kiryas Joel]]. Satmar is known for its conservatism and opposition to both ''[[World Agudath Israel|Agudas Israel]]'' and [[Zionism]], inspired by the legacy of Hungarian Ultra-Orthodoxy. The sect underwent a schism in 2006 and two competing factions emerged, led by rival brothers [[Aaron Teitelbaum]] and [[Zalman Teitelbaum]]. The second-largest \"court\" worldwide, with some 11,600 households (or 9% of all Hasidism) is [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], established in 1859 at [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria]], near [[Warsaw]]. For decades, it was the dominant power in ''Agudas'' and espoused a moderate line toward Zionism and modern culture. Its origins lay in the rationalist [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Przysucha School]] of [[Congress Poland|Central Poland]]. The current Rebbe is [[Yaakov Aryeh Alter]]. The third largest dynasty is [[Vizhnitz]], a charismatic sect founded in 1854 at [[Vyzhnytsia]], [[Bukovina]]. A moderate group involved in Israeli politics, it is split into several branches, which maintain cordial relations. The main partition is between Vizhnitz-Israel and Vizhnitz-Monsey, headed respectively by Rebbes Israel Hager and the eight sons of the late Rebbe Mordecai Hager. In total, all Vizhnitz sub-\"courts\" constitute over 10,500 households. The fourth major dynasty, with some 7,000 households, is [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]], established 1817 in namesake [[Belz]], south of [[Lviv]]. An [[Eastern Galicia]]n dynasty drawing both from the [[Seer of Lublin]]'s charismatic-populist style and \"rabbinic\" Hasidism, it espoused hard-line positions, but broke off from the [[Orthodox Council of Jerusalem]] and joined ''Agudas'' in 1979. Belz is led by Rebbe [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (fifth Belzer rebbe)|Yissachar Dov Rokeach]].<ref name=\"Wodz\"/>\n\nThe [[Bobover]] dynasty, founded 1881 in [[Bobowa]], [[West Galicia]], constitutes some 4,500 households in total and has undergone a bitter succession strife since 2005, eventually forming the \"Bobov\" (3,000 households) and \"[[Bobov-45]]\" (1,500 households) sects. [[Sanz-Klausenburg]], divided into a New York and Israeli branches, presides over 3,800 households. The [[Skver]] sect, established in 1848 in [[Skvyra]] near [[Kiev]], constitutes 3,300. The [[Shomer Emunim]] dynasties, originating in Jerusalem during the 1920s and known for their unique style of dressing imitating that of the [[Old Yishuv]], have over 3,000 families, almost all in the larger \"courts\" of [[Toldos Aharon]] and [[Toldos Avraham Yitzchak]]. [[Karlin Stolin]], which rose already in the 1760s in a quarter of [[Pinsk]], encompasses 2,200 families.<ref name=\"Wodz\"/>\n\nThere are two other populous Hasidic sub-groups, which do not function as classical ''Rebbe''-headed \"courts\", but as decentralized movements, retaining some of the characteristics of early Hasidism.<ref>Brown, \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4. p. 86.</ref> [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]] rose under its charismatic leader [[Nachman of Breslov]] in the early 19th century. Critical of all other ''Rebbes'', he forbade his followers to appoint a successor upon his death in 1810. His acolytes led small groups of adherents, persecuted by other Hasidim, and disseminated his teachings. The original philosophy of the sect elicited great interest among modern scholars, and that led many [[Baal teshuva movement|newcomers to Orthodox Judaism (\"repentants\")]] to join it. Numerous Breslov communities, each led by its own rabbis, now have thousands of full-fledged followers and far more admirers and semi-committed supporters; Marcin Wodzi\u0144ski estimated that the fully committed population of Breslovers may be estimated at 7,000 households. [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], originating in the 1770s, did have hereditary leadership, but always stressed the importance of self-study rather than reliance on the Righteous. Its seventh and last leader, [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], converted it into a vehicle for Jewish outreach. By his death in 1994, it had many more semi-engaged supporters than Hasidim in the strict sense, and they are still hard to distinguish. Chabad's own internal phone-books list some 16,800 member households.<ref name=\"Wodz\"/> None succeeded Schneerson, and the sect operates as a large network of communities with independent leaders.\n\n==History==\n{{Judaism}}\n\n===Background===\nIn the late 17th century, several social trends converged among the Jews who inhabited the southern periphery of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], especially in contemporary [[Western Ukraine]]. These enabled the emergence and flourishing of Hasidism.\n[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e5 027-0.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[History of the Jews in Brody|Great synagogue of Brody]], where an 18th century ''Klaus'' \"close\" of pre-Hasidic kabbalists convened in seclusion]]\nThe first and most prominent was the popularization of the mystical lore of Kabbalah. For several centuries, an esoteric teaching practiced surreptitiously by few, it was transformed into almost household knowledge by a mass of cheap printed pamphlets. The kabbalistic inundation was a major influence behind the rise of the heretical [[Sabbatean]] movement, led by [[Sabbatai Zevi]], who declared himself [[Messiah]] in 1665. The propagation of Kabbalah made the Jewish masses susceptible to Hasidic ideas, themselves in essence a popularized version of the teaching \u2013 indeed, Hasidism actually emerged when its founders determined to openly practice it instead of remaining a secret circle of ascetics as was the manner of almost all past kabbalists. The correlation between publicizing the lore and Sabbateanism did not escape the rabbinic elite, and caused vehement opposition to the new movement.\n\nAnother factor was the decline of the traditional authority structures. Jewish autonomy remained quite secured; later research debunked [[Simon Dubnow]]'s claim that the [[Council of Four Lands]]' demise in 1746 was a culmination of a long process which destroyed judicial independence and paved the way for the Hasidic ''rebbes'' to serve as leaders (another long-held explanation for the sect's rise advocated by [[Raphael Mahler]], that the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] effected economic impoverishment and despair, was also refuted). However, the [[Szlachta|magnates and nobles]] held much sway over the nomination of both rabbis and communal elders, to such a degree that the masses often perceived them as mere lackeys of the land owners. Their ability to serve as legitimate arbiters in disputes \u2013 especially those concerning the regulation of leasehold rights over alcohol distillation and other monopolies in the estates \u2013 was severely diminished. The reduced prestige of the establishment, and the need for an alternative source of authority to pass judgement, left a vacuum which Hasidic charismatics eventually filled. They transcended old communal institutions, to which all the Jews of a locality were subordinate, and had groups of followers in each town across vast territories. Often supported by rising strata outside the traditional elite, whether nouveau riche or various low-level religious functionaries, they created a modern form of leadership.\n\nHistorians discerned other influences. The formative age of Hasidism coincided with the rise of numerous religious revival movements across the world, including the [[First Great Awakening]] in [[New England]], German [[Pietism]], [[Wahhabism]] in Arabia and the Russian [[Old Believers]] who opposed the established church. They all rejected the existing order, decrying it as stale and overly hierarchic. They offered what they described as more spiritual, candid and simple substitutes. [[Gershon David Hundert]] noted the considerable similarity between the Hasidic conceptions and this general background, rooting both in the growing importance attributed to the individual's consciousness and choices.<ref>[[Glenn Dynner]], ''Men of Silk: The Hasidic Conquest of Polish Jewish Society'', Oxford University Press (2006). pp. 3\u201323.</ref>\n\n===Israel ben Eliezer===\n{{Main|Baal Shem Tov}}\n[[File:Besht Signature.jpg|thumb|left|Israel ben Eliezer's autograph]]\n[[File:Ohel Baal Shem Tov.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of the Baal Shem Tov in [[Medzhybizh]], [[Podolia]], Hasidism's first centre]]\n[[Israel ben Eliezer]] (ca. 1690\u20131760), known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'' (\"Master of the ''Good'' Name\", [[acronym]]: \"Besht\"), is considered the founder of Hasidism. Born apparently south of the [[Prut]], in the northern frontier of [[Moldavia]], he earned a reputation as a [[Baal Shem]], \"Master of the Name\". These were common folk healers who employed mysticism, amulets and incantations at their trade. Little is known for certain on ben Eliezer. Though no scholar, he was sufficiently learned to become notable in the communal hall of study and marry into the rabbinic elite, his wife being the divorced sister of a rabbi; in his later years he was wealthy and famous, as attested by contemporary chronicles. Apart from that, most is derived from Hasidic hagiographic accounts. These claim that as a boy he was recognized by one \"Rabbi Adam Baal Shem Tov\" who entrusted him with great secrets of the [[Torah]] passed in his illustrious family for centuries. The Besht later spent a decade in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] as a hermit, where he was visited by the Biblical prophet [[Ahijah the Shilonite]] who taught him more. At the age of thirty-six, he was granted heavenly permission to reveal himself as a great kabbalist and miracle worker.\n\nBy the 1740s, it is verified that he relocated to the town of [[Medzhybizh]] and became recognized and popular in all [[Podolia]] and beyond. It is well attested that he did emphasize several known kabbalistic concepts, formulating a teaching of his own to some degree. The Besht stressed the immanence of God and his presence in the material world, and that therefore, physical acts, such as eating, have actual influence on the spiritual sphere and may serve to hasten the achievement of communion with the divine (''devekut''). He was known to pray ecstatically and with great [[kavanah|intention]], again in order to provide channels for the [[Ohr|divine light]] to flow into the earthly realm. The Besht stressed the importance of joy and contentment in the worship of God, rather than the abstinence and self-mortification deemed essential to become a pious mystic, and of fervent and vigorous prayer as a means of spiritual elation instead of severe aestheticism<ref name=\"Ros1\"/>, but many of his immediate disciples reverted in part to the older doctrines, especially in disavowing sexual pleasure even in marital relations.<ref>David Biale, ''The Lust for Asceticism in the Ha-sidic Movement'', in: Jonathan Magonet, ''Jewish Explorations of Sexuality''. Oxford University Press (1995). pp. 53-55.</ref>\n\nIn that, the \"Besht\" laid the foundation for a popular movement, offering a far less rigorous course for the masses to gain a significant religious experience. And yet, he remained the guide of a small society of elitists, in the tradition of former kabbalists, and never led a large public as his successors did. While many later figures cited him as the inspiration behind the full-fledged Hasidic doctrine, the Besht himself did not practice it in his lifetime.<ref name=\"Ros1\">Moshe Rosman, ''[https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Baal_Shem_Tov Ba\u2018al Shem Tov]'', [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]].</ref>\n\n===Consolidation===\n[[File:\u0413\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0456\u043b\u044c.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hannopil]], early Hasidic town and burial place of [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch]], architect of the Hasidic movement, near his court in Hasidism's second centre [[Mezeritch]], [[Volhynia]]]]\n[[File:Korets vlasenko.jpg|thumb|right|[[Korets]], [[Volhynia]]. The first works of Hasidic thought, as Hasidism became a popular movement, were printed in Koretz, beginning with ''Toldot Yaakov Yosef'' by [[Jacob Joseph of Polonne]] in 1780]]\n[[File:Shivchei besht.jpg|thumb|right|''Shivchei HaBesht'' (Praises of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]), the first compilation of Hasidic hagiographic storytelling, was printed from manuscripts in 1815]]\nIsrael ben Eliezer gathered a considerable following, drawing to himself disciples from far away. They were largely of elitist background, yet adopted the populist approach of their master. The most prominent was Rabbi [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch|Dov Ber]] the ''[[Maggid]]'' (preacher). He succeeded the former upon his death, though other important acolytes, mainly [[Jacob Joseph of Polonne]], did not accept his leadership. Establishing himself in [[Mezhirichi]], the Maggid turned to greatly elaborate the Besht's rudimentary ideas and institutionalize the nascent circle into an actual movement. Ben Eliezer and his acolytes used the very old and common epithet ''[[hasidim]]'', \"pious\"; in the latter third of the 18th century, a clear differentiation arose between that sense of the word and what was at first described as \"New Hasidism\", propagated to a degree by the Maggid and especially his successors.<ref name=\"Ros\">Moshe Rosman, ''Founder of Hasidism: A Quest for the Historical Ba'al Shem Tov''. University of California Press (1996). pp. 37-38.</ref>\n\nDoctrine coalesced as Jacob Joseph, Dov Ber and the latter's disciple Rabbi [[Elimelech of Lizhensk]] composed the three magna opera of early Hasidism, respectively: the 1780 ''Toldot Ya'akov Yosef'', the 1781 ''Maggid d'varav le-Ya'akov'' and the 1788 ''No'am Elimelekh''. Other books were also published. Their new teaching had many aspects. The importance of devotion in prayer was stressed to such degree that many waited beyond the prescribed time to properly prepare; the Besht's recommendation to \"elevate and sanctify\" impure thoughts rather than simply repress them during the service was expanded by Dov Ber into an entire precept, depicting prayer as a mechanism to transform thoughts and feelings from a primal to a higher state in a manner parallel to the unfolding of the ''[[Sephirot]]''. But the most important was the notion of the ''Tzaddiq'' \u2013 later designated by the general rabbinic honorific [[Rebbe#The hasidic rebbe|''Admor'' (our master, teacher and rabbi) or by the colloquial ''Rebbe'']] \u2013 the Righteous One, the mystic who was able to elate and achieve communion with the divine, but unlike kabbalists past, did not practice it in secret, but as leader of the masses. He was able to bring down prosperity and guidance from the higher ''Sephirot'', and the common people who could not attain such a state themselves would achieve it by \"clinging\" to and obeying him. The ''Tzaddiq'' served as a bridge between the spiritual realm and the ordinary folk, as well as a simple, understandable embodiment of the esoteric teachings of the sect, which were still beyond the reach of most just as old-style Kabbalah before.\n\nThe various Hasidic ''Tzaddiqim'', mainly the Maggid's disciples, spread across Eastern Europe with each gathering adherents among the people and learned acolytes who could be initiated as leaders. The Righteous' \"courts\" in which they resided, attended by their followers to receive blessing and council, became the institutional centers of Hasidism, serving as its branches and organizational core. Slowly, various rites emerged in them, like the Sabbath ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|Tisch]]'' or \"table\", in which the Righteous would hand out food scraps from their meals, considered blessed by the touch of ones imbued with godly Light during their mystical ascensions.<ref>Dynner, pp. 34-39, 42.</ref> Another potent institution was the ''[[Shtibel]]'', the private prayer gatherings opened by adherents in every town which served as a recruiting mechanism. The ''Shtibel'' differed from the established synagogues and study halls, allowing their members greater freedom to worship when they pleased and also serving recreational and welfare purposes. Combined with its simplified message, more appealing to the common man, its honed organizational framework accounted for the exponential growth of Hasidic ranks.<ref>{{cite book|title=Stampfer, Why Hasidism Spreaf|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem|year=|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=203\u2013207}}</ref> Having ousted the old communal model and replaced it with a less-hierarchical structure and more individually-oriented religiosity, Hasidism was in fact the first great modern \u2013 albeit not modernist; its self-understanding was grounded in a traditional mindset \u2013 Jewish movement.<ref>For exampe: Murray Rosman, ''[https://www.academia.edu/19681639 Hasidism \u2013 Traditional Modernization]'', Simon Dubnow Institute Yearbook 6 (2007).</ref>\n\nFrom its original base in [[Podolia]] and [[Volhynia]], the movement was rapidly disseminated during the Maggid's lifetime and after his 1772 death. Twenty or so of Dov Ber's prime disciples each brought it to a different region, and their own successors followed: [[Aharon of Karlin (I)]], [[Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk]] and [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] were the emissaries to the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] in the far north, while [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]] headed to [[Chernobyl]] in the east and [[Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev]] remained nearby. Elimelech of Lizhensk, his brother [[Zusha of Hanipol]] and [[Yisroel Hopsztajn]] established the sect in [[Polish Crown|Poland proper]]. Vitebsk and [[Abraham Kalisker]] later led a small ascension to the [[Land of Israel]], establishing a Hasidic presence in the [[Galilee]].\n\n{{Anchor|Opposition}}The spread of Hasidism also incurred organized opposition. Rabbi [[Elijah of Vilna|Elijah of Vilnius]], one of the greatest authorities of the generation and a ''hasid'' and secret kabbalist of the old style, was deeply suspicious of their emphasis on mysticism rather than mundane Torah study, threat to established communal authority, resemblance to the Sabbatean movement and other details he considered infractions. In April 1772, he and the Vilnius community wardens launched a systematic campaign against the sect, placing an [[herem (censure)|anathema]] upon them, banishing their leaders and sending letters denouncing the movement. Further excommunication followed in [[Brody]] and other cities. In 1781, during a second round of hostilities, the books of Jacob Joseph were burned in Vilnius. Another cause for strife emerged when the Hasidim adopted the [[Lurianic]] prayer rite, which they revised somewhat to [[Nusach Sefard]]; the first edition in Eastern Europe was printed in 1781 and received approbation from the anti-Hasidic scholars of Brody, but the sect quickly embraced the Kabbalah-infused tome and popularized it, making it their symbol. Their rivals, named ''[[Misnagdim]]'', \"opponents\" (a generic term which acquired an independent meaning as Hasidism grew stronger) soon accused them of abandoning the traditional [[Nusach Ashkenaz]].\n\nIn 1798, Opponents made accusations of espionage against [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] and he was imprisoned by the Russian government for two months. Excoriatory polemics were printed and anathemas declared in the entire region. But Elijah's death in 1797 denied the ''Misnagdim'' their powerful leader. In 1804, [[Alexander I of Russia]] allowed independent prayer groups to operate, the chief vessel through which the movement spread from town to town. The failure to eradicate Hasidism, which acquired a clear self-identity in the struggle and greatly expanded throughout it, convinced its adversaries to adopt a more passive method of resistance, as exemplified by [[Chaim of Volozhin]]. The growing conservatism of the new movement \u2013 which at some occasions drew close to Kabbalah-based antinomian phraseology, as did the Sabbateans, but never crossed the threshold and remained thoroughly observant \u2013 and the rise of common enemies slowly brought a rapprochement, and by the second half of the 19th century both sides basically considered each other legitimate.\n\nThe turn of the century saw several prominent new, fourth-generation ''tzaddiqim''. Upon Elimelech's death in the [[Partitions of Poland|now-partitioned Poland]], his place in [[Habsburg Galicia]] was assumed by [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], who was deeply hostile to the modernization the Austrian rulers attempted to force on the traditional Jewish society (though this same process also allowed his sect to flourish, as communal authority was severely weakened). The rabbi of Rimanov hearkened the alliance the hasidim would form with the most conservative elements of the Jewish public. In Central Poland, the new leader was Jacob Isaac Horowiz, the \"[[Seer of Lublin]]\", who was of a particularly populist bent and appealed to the common folk with miracle working and little strenuous spiritual demands. The Seer's senior acolyte, [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Jacob Isaac Rabinovitz]] the \"Holy Jew\" of [[Przysucha]], gradually dismissed his mentor's approach as overly vulgar and adopted a more aesthetic and scholarly approach, virtually without theurgy to the masses. The Holy Jew's \"Przysucha School\" was continued by his successor [[Simcha Bunim]] and especially the reclusive, morose [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]]. The most controversial fourth-generation ''tzaddiq'' was the Podolia-based [[Nachman of Breslov]], who denounced his peers for becoming too institutionalized, much like the old establishment their predecessors challenged decades before, and espoused an anti-rationalist, pessimistic spiritual teaching, very different from the prevalent stress on joy.\n\n[[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia]] in 1812 promised to bring the first [[Jewish emancipation]] to the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Hasidic Rebbes in Poland and Russia were divided on the issue, between supporting western freedom from imperial antisemitic decrees, to regarding Napoleon as the opening to heresy and agnosticism. According to Hasidic legend, the fate of Napoleon was decided not on the battlefields, but between the theurgic prayers and deeds of the Hasidic Rebbes.\n\n===Routinization===\n[[File:Moshe Teitelbaum.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moses Teitelbaum of Ujhel]] spread Hasidism in Hungary, where non-Hasidic Orthodox [[Oberlander Jews]] remained, without Lithuania's [[Mitnagdic]] opposition to Hasidism]]\n[[File:Menachem Mendel from Kock grave.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Grave of the radical [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]], the culmination of [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Peshischa]] introspection, that saught to renew Hasidism from conformity]]\n[[File:Sadigura rebbe's palace.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Palace of the [[Ruzhin (Hasidic dynasty)|Ruzhin dynasty]] in [[Sadhora]], whose Rebbes conducted themselves royally]]\nThe opening of the 19th century saw the Hasidic sect transformed. Once a rising force outside the establishment, the ''tzaddiqim'' now became an important and often dominant power in most of Eastern Europe. The slow process of encroachment, which mostly begun with forming an independent ''Shtibel'' and culminated in the Righteous becoming an authority figure (either alongside or above the official rabbinate) for the entire community, overwhelmed many towns even in ''Misnagdic'' stronghold of Lithuania, far more so in [[Congress Poland]] and the vast majority in Podolia, Volhynia and Galicia. It began to make inroads into [[Bukovina]], [[Bessarabia]] and the westernmost frontier of autochthonic pre-WWII Hasidism, in [[Unterlander Jews|northeastern Hungary]], where the Seer's disciple [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moses Teitelbaum (I)]] was appointed in [[Ujhely]].\n\nLess than three generations after the Besht's death, the sect grew to encompass hundreds of thousands by 1830. As a mass movement, a clear stratification emerged between the court's functionaries and permanent residents (''yoshvim'', \"sitters\"), the devoted followers who would often visit the Righteous on Sabbath, and the large public which prayed at Sefard Rite synagogues and was minimally affiliated.\n\nAll this was followed by a more conservative approach and power bickering among the Righteous. Since the Maggid's death, none could claim the overall leadership. Among the several dozens active, each ruled over his own turf, and local traditions and customs began to emerge in the various courts which developed their own identity. The high mystical tension typical of a new movement subsided, and was soon replaced by more hierarchical, orderly atmosphere.\n\nThe most important aspect of the routinization Hasidism underwent was the adoption of dynasticism. The first to claim legitimacy by right of descent from the Besht was his grandson, [[Boruch of Medzhybizh]], appointed 1782. He held a lavish court with [[Hershel of Ostropol]] as jester, and demanded the other Righteous acknowledge his supremacy. Upon the death of [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]] of [[Chernobyl]], his son [[Mordechai Twersky]] succeeded him. The principle was conclusively affirmed in the great dispute after Liadi's demise in 1813: his senior acolyte [[Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye]] was defeated by his son, [[Dovber Schneuri]], whose offspring [[Chabad|retained the title for 181 years]].\n\nBy the 1860s, virtually all courts were dynastic. Rather than single ''tzaddiqim'' with followings of their own, each sect would command a base of rank-and-file hasidim attached not just to the individual leader, but to the bloodline and the court's unique attributes. [[Israel Friedman of Ruzhyn]] insisted on royal splendour, resided in a palace and his six sons all inherited some of his followers. With the constraints of maintaining their gains replacing the dynamism of the past, the Righteous or ''Rebbe''s/''Admorim'' also silently retreated from the overt, radical mysticism of their predecessors. While populist miracle working for the masses remained a key theme in many dynasties, a new type of \"Rebbe-Rabbi\" emerged, one who was both a completely traditional ''[[halakhic]]'' authority as well as a spiritualist. The tension with the ''Misnagdim'' subsided significantly.<ref name=\"RAD\">Benjamin Brown, [https://www.academia.edu/4900677/ The Two Faces of Religious Radicalism - Orthodox Zealotry and Holy Sinning in Nineteenth Century Hasidism in Hungary and Galicia].</ref><ref>Stephen Sharot, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386127 Hasidism and the Routinization of Charisma], Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1980</ref>\n\nBut it was an external threat, more than anything else, that mended relations. While traditional Jewish society remained well entrenched in backward Eastern Europe, reports of the rapid acculturation and religious laxity in the West troubled both camps. When the ''[[Haskalah]]'', the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], appeared in Galicia and Congress Poland in the 1810s, it was soon perceived as a dire threat. The ''maskilim'' themselves detested Hasidism as an anti-rationalist and barbaric phenomenon, as did Western Jews of all shades, including the most right-wing Orthodox such as Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].<ref>[[David Ellenson]], ''Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer and the Creation of a Modern Jewish Orthodoxy''. University of Alabama Press, 1990. p. 44.</ref> In Galicia especially, hostility towards it defined the ''Haskalah'' to a large extent, from the staunchly observant Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]] and [[Joseph Perl]] to the radical anti-Talmudists like [[Osias Schorr]]. The Enlightened, who [[Revival of the Hebrew language|revived Hebrew grammar]], often mocked their rivals' lack of eloquence in the language. While a considerable proportion of the ''Misnagdim'' were not adverse to at least some of the ''Haskala'''s goals, the ''Rebbe''s were unremittingly hostile.\n\nThe most distinguished Hasidic leader in Galicia in the era was [[Chaim Halberstam]], who combined talmudic erudition and the status of a major [[posek|decisor]] with his function as ''tzaddiq''. He symbolized the new era, brokering peace between the small Hasidic sect in Hungary to its opponents. In that country, where modernization and assimilation were much more prevalent than in the East, the local Righteous joined forces with those now termed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] against the rising liberals. Rabbi [[Moses Sofer]] of [[Pressburg]], while no friend to Hasidism, tolerated it as he combated the forces which sought modernization of the Jews; a generation later, in the 1860s, the ''Rebbe''s and the zealot ultra-Orthodox [[Hillel Lichtenstein]] allied closely.\n\nAround the mid-19th century, over a hundred dynastic courts related by marriage were the main religious power in the territory enclosed between Hungary, former Lithuania, Prussia and inner Russia, with considerable presence in the former two. In Central Poland, the pragmatist, rationalist Przysucha school thrived: [[Yitzchak Meir Alter]] founded the [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|court of Ger]] in 1859, and in 1876 [[Jechiel Danziger]] established [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Alexander]]. In Galicia and Hungary, apart from Halberstam's House of [[Sanz]], [[Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov]]'s descendants each pursued a mystical approach in the dynasties of [[Zidichov (Hasidic dynasty)|Zidichov]], [[Komarno (Hasidic dynasty)|Komarno]] and so forth. In 1817, [[Sholom Rokeach]] became the first ''Rebbe'' of [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]]. At [[Bukovina]], the Hager line of [[Kosov (Hasidic dynasty)|Kosov]]-[[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]] was the largest court.\n\nThe ''Haskalah'' was always a minor force, but the [[Jewish national movements (disambiguation)|Jewish national movements]] which emerged in the 1880s, as well as Socialism, proved much more appealing to the young. Progressive strata condemned Hasidism as a primitive relic, strong, but doomed to disappear, as Eastern European Jewry underwent slow yet steady secularization. The gravity of the situation was attested to by the foundation of Hasidic [[yeshiva]]s (in the modern, boarding school-equivalent sense) to enculturate the young and preserve their loyalty: The first was established at [[Nowy Wi\u015bnicz]] by Rabbi [[Shlomo Halberstam (I)]] in 1881. These institutions were originally utilized by the ''Misnagdim'' to protect their youth from Hasidic influence, but now, the latter faced a similar crisis. One of the most contentious issues in this respect was [[Zionism]]; the Ruzhin dynasties were quite favourably disposed toward it, while Hungarian and Galician courts reviled it.\n\n===Calamity and renaissance===\n[[File:Jews of Khorostkiv (western Ukraine), 1917.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jews in Ukraine 1917. [[World War I]] and [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet antisemitism]] after 1917 dissolved Hasidic heartlands, causing migration from villages to cities. Various Hasidic courts relocated to [[History of the Jews in Poland|Warsaw]] and [[History of the Jews in Vienna|Vienna]]]]\n[[File:Drohobycz, Rebe Aharon Rokach.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belzer]] Rebbe [[Aharon Rokeach]] (depicted 1934), who was hidden from the Nazis and smuggled out of the Holocaust inferno by his disciples]]\nOutside pressure was mounting in the early 20th century. In 1912, many Hasidic leaders partook in the creation of the [[World Agudath Israel|Agudas Israel]] party, a political instrument intended to safeguard what was now named [[Orthodox Judaism]] even in the relatively traditional East; the more hard-line dynasties, mainly Galician and Hungarian, opposed the Aguda as too lenient. Mass immigration to America, urbanization, [[World War I]] and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War]] uprooted the ''[[shtetl]]''s in which the local Jews lived for centuries and were the bedrock of Hasidism. In the new [[Soviet Union]], civil equality first achieved and a harsh repression of religion caused a rapid secularization. Few remaining Hasidim, especially of [[Chabad]], continued to practice underground for decades. In the new states of the [[Interbellum]] era, the process was only somewhat slower. On the eve of [[World War II]], strictly observant Jews were estimated to constitute no more than a third of the total Jewish population in Poland, the world's most Orthodox country.<ref>Jaff Schatz, ''Jews and the Communist Movement in Interwar Poland'', in: ''Dark Times, Dire Decisions: Jews and Communism''. Oxford University Press (2005). p. 36.</ref> While the Rebbes still had a vast base of support, it was aging and declining.\n\nThe [[Holocaust]] hit the Hasidim, easily identifiable and almost unable to disguise themselves among the larger populace due to cultural insularity, particularly hard. Hundreds of leaders perished with their flock, while the flight of many notable ones as their followers were being exterminated \u2013 especially [[Aharon Rokeach]] of Belz and [[Joel Teitelbaum]] of Satmar \u2013 elicited bitter recrimination. In the immediate post-war years, the entire movement seemed to teeter on the precipice of oblivion. In Israel, the United States, and Western Europe, the survivors' children were at best becoming [[Modern Orthodox]]. While a century earlier the ''Haskalah'' depicted it as a medieval, malicious power, now it was so weakened that the popular cultural image was sentimental and romantic, what [[Joseph Dan]] termed \"Frumkinian Hasidism\" for it began with the short stories of [[Michael Levi Rodkinson]] (Frumkin). [[Martin Buber]] was the major contributor to this trend, portraying the sect as a model of a healthy folk consciousness. \"Frumkinian\" style was very influential, later inspiring the so-called \"[[Neo-Hasidism]]\", and also utterly ahistorical.<ref name=\"Dan\">Joseph Dan, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1396266 A Bow to Frumkinian Hasidism]'', Modern Judaism, Volume 11, pp. 175-193.</ref>\n\nYet, the movement proved more resilient than expected. Talented and charismatic Hasidic masters emerged, who reinvigorated their following and drew new crowds. In New York, the Satmar Rebbe [[Joel Teitelbaum]] formulated a fiercely anti-Zionist [[Holocaust theology]] and founded an insular, self-sufficient community which attracted many immigrants from Greater Hungary; already by 1961, 40% of families were newcomers.<ref>Israel Rubin. ''Satmar: Two Generations of an Urban Island''. P. Lang (1997). p. 42</ref> [[Yisrael Alter]] of [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]] created robust institutions, fortified his court's standing in ''Agudas Israel'' and held ''tisch'' every week for 29 years. He halted the hemorrhage of his followers and retrieved many Litvaks (the contemporary, less adverse epithet for ''Misnagdim'') and [[Religious Zionists]] whose parents were Gerrer Hasidim before the war. Chaim Meir Hager similarly restored [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]]. Moses Isaac Gewirtzman founded the new [[Pshevorsk (Hasidic dynasty)]] in [[Antwerp]].\n\nThe most explosive growth was experienced in [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], whose head [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] adopted a modern (he and his disciples ceased wearing the customary [[Shtreimel]]) and outreach-centered orientation. At a time when most Orthodox and Hasidim in particular rejected proselytization, he turned his sect into a mechanism devoted almost solely to it, blurring the difference between actual Hasidim and loosely affiliated supporters until researchers could scarcely define it as a regular Hasidic group. Another phenomenon was the revival of [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], which remained without an acting ''Tzaddiq'' since the rebellious [[Rebbe Nachman]]'s 1810 death. Its complex, existentialist philosophy drew many to it.\n\nHigh fertility rates, increasing tolerance and [[multiculturalism]] on behalf of surrounding society, and the great wave of [[Baal teshuva movement|newcomers to Orthodox Judaism]] which began in the 1970s all cemented the movement's status as very much alive and thriving. The clearest indication for that, noted Joseph Dan, was the disappearance of the \"Frumkinian\" narrative which inspired much sympathy towards it from non-Orthodox Jews and others, as actual Hasidism returned to the fore. It was replaced by apprehension and concern due to the growing presence of the reclusive, strictly religious Hasidic lifestyle in the public sphere, especially in Israel.<ref name=\"Dan\"/> As numbers grew, \"courts\" were again torn apart by schisms between Rebbes' sons vying for power, a common occurrence during the golden age of the 19th century.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=60em}}\n*{{cite book\n|last= Elior\n|first=Rachel\n|title=The Mystical Origins of Hasidism\n|year=2006\n|publisher=Littman Library of Jewish Civilization\n|isbn=978-1-904113-04-1\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last=Buber\n|first=Martin\n|authorlink= Martin Buber\n|others=translated by Olga Marx; foreword by [[Chaim Potok]]\n|title=Tales of the Hasidim\n|origyear=1947\n|edition= Paperback: 2 volumes in 1\n|date= July 23, 1991\n|publisher=[[Schocken Books]]\n|location=New York\n|isbn=0-8052-0995-6 |lccn=90052921\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last= Berger\n|first=Joseph\n|title=The Pious Ones: The World of Hasidim and Their Battle with America\n|year=2014\n|publisher=Harper Perennial\n|isbn=978-0-06-212334-3\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{cite NIE|wstitle=Chasidim |year=1905 |short=x}}\n*[http://www.routledge.com/textbooks/0415236614/resources/maps/map50.jpg Map of the spread of Hasidism from 1730 and 1760\u201375, and its encroachment on the Lithuanian centre of Rabbinic opposition]\n\n{{Hasidic dynasties by country of ancestral origin}}\n{{Orthodox Judaism}}\n{{Jews and Judaism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hasidic Judaism| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the modern movement|the Jewish honorific|Hasid|the Judean sect|Hasideans|the medieval one|Ashkenazi Hasidim}}\n[[File:Boyan tish, Sukkot 2009.jpg|thumb|A ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|tish]]'' of the [[Boyan (Hasidic dynasty)|Boyan]] [[Hasidic dynasty]] in [[Jerusalem]], holiday of [[Sukkot]], 2009|300px]]\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}\n\n'''Hasidism''', sometimes spelt '''Chassidism''' and also known as '''Hasidic Judaism''' ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea|\u1e24\u0103s\u012bdut}}, {{IPA-he|\u03c7a\u02c8sidus|}}<!-- This is the traditional Ashkenazi pronunciation of tav typically used by Hasidim -->; originally, \"piety\"), is a [[Judaism|Jewish]] religious group that arose as a spiritual revival movement in the territory of contemporary [[Western Ukraine]] during the 18th century and spread rapidly throughout [[Eastern Europe]]. Today, most affiliates reside in [[Israel]] and the [[United States]].\n\nIsrael Ben Eliezer, the \"[[Baal Shem Tov]]\", is regarded as its founding father, and his disciples developed and disseminated it. Present-day Hasidism is a sub-group within [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox (\"Haredi\") Judaism]] and is noted for its religious conservatism and social seclusion. Its members adhere closely both to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish practice]] \u2013 with the movement's own unique emphases \u2013 and the traditions of Eastern European Jews, so much so that many of the latter, including various special styles of dress and the use of the [[Yiddish language]], are nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hasidism.\n\nHasidic thought draws heavily on [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] and, to an extent, is a popularization of it. Teachings emphasize God's [[immanence]] in the universe, the need to cleave and be one with him at all times, the devotional aspect of religious practice, and the spiritual dimension of corporeality and mundane acts. ''Hasidim'', the adherents of Hasidism, are organized in [[Hasidic dynasty|independent sects known as \"courts\" or dynasties]], each headed by its own hereditary leader, a ''[[Rebbe]]''. Reverence and submission to the ''Rebbe'' are key tenets, as he is considered a spiritual authority with whom the follower must bond to gain closeness to God. The various \"courts\" share basic convictions but operate apart and possess unique traits and customs. Affiliation is often retained in families for generations, and being Hasidic is as much a sociological factor \u2013 entailing, as it does, birth into a specific community and allegiance to a dynasty of ''Rebbe''s \u2013 as it is a purely religious one. There are several \"courts\" with many thousands of member households each and hundreds of smaller ones. {{As of|2016|}}, there were over 130,000 Hasidic households worldwide, about 5% of the global Jewish population.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Hasid (term)|terms ''hasid'']] and ''hasidut'', meaning \"pietist\" and \"piety\", have a long history in Judaism. The [[Talmud]] and other old sources refer to the \"Pietists of Old\" (''Hasidim ha-Rishonim'') who would contemplate an entire hour in preparation for prayer. The phrase denoted extremely devoted individuals who not only observed the Law to its letter, but performed good deeds even beyond it. [[Adam]] himself is honored with the title in [[Eruvin (Talmud)|tractate Eruvin]] 18b by [[Rabbi Meir]]: \"Adam was a great ''hasid'', having fasted for 130 years.\" The first to adopt the epithet collectively were apparently the ''hasidim'' in [[Second Temple period]] [[Judea]], known as [[Hasideans]] after the Greek rendering of their name, who perhaps served as the model for those mentioned in the Talmud. The title continued to be applied as an honorific for the exceptionally devout. In 12th-century [[Rhineland]], or ''[[Ashkenaz]]'' in Jewish parlance, another prominent school of ascetics named themselves ''hasidim''; to distinguish them from the rest, later research employed the term [[Ashkenazi Hasidim]]. In the 16th century, when [[Kabbalah]] spread, the title also became associated with it. [[Jacob ben Hayyim Zemah]] wrote in his glossa on [[Isaac Luria]]'s version of the [[Shulchan Aruch]] that, \"One who wishes to tap the hidden wisdom, must conduct himself in the manner of the Pious.\"\n\nThe movement founded by [[Israel Ben Eliezer]] in the 18th century adopted the term ''hasidim'' in the original connotation. But when the sect grew and developed specific attributes, from the 1770s, the names gradually acquired a new meaning. Its common adherents, belonging to groups each headed by a spiritual leader, were henceforth known as Hasidim. The transformation was slow: The movement was at first referred to as \"New Hasidism\" by outsiders (as recalled in the autobiography of [[Salomon Maimon]]) to separate it from the old one, and its enemies derisively mocked its members as ''Mithasdim'', \"[those who] pretend [to be] ''hasidim''\". Yet, eventually, the young sect gained such a mass following that the old connotation was sidelined. In popular discourse, at least, Hasid came to denote someone who follows a religious teacher from the movement. It also entered [[Modern Hebrew]] as such, meaning \"adherent\" or \"disciple\". One was not merely a ''hasid'' anymore, observed historian David Assaf, but a Hasid of someone or some dynasty in particular. This linguistic transformation paralleled that of the word ''[[tzaddik]]'', \"righteous\", which the Hasidic leaders adopted for themselves \u2013 though they are known colloquially as ''Rebbe''s or by the honorific ''Admor''. Originally denoting an observant, moral person, in Hasidic literature ''tzaddik'' became synonymous with the often hereditary master heading a sect of followers.<ref name=\"Assaf1\"/><ref name=\"Ros\"/>\n\n==Hasidic philosophy==\n{{Jewish mysticism}}\n{{Main|Hasidic philosophy}}\n\n===Distinctions===\nThe lengthy history of Hasidism, the numerous schools of thought therein, and particularly its use of the traditional medium of [[homiletic]] literature and sermons \u2013 comprising numerous references to earlier sources in the [[Torah]], Talmud and exegesis as a means to grounding oneself in tradition \u2013 as the almost sole channel to convey its ideas, all made the isolation of a common doctrine highly challenging to researchers. As noted by [[Joseph Dan]], \"Every attempt to present such a body of ideas has failed\". Even motifs presented by scholars in the past as unique Hasidic contributions were later revealed to have been common among both their predecessors and opponents, all the more so regarding many other traits that are widely extant \u2013 these play, Dan added, \"a prominent role in modern non-Hasidic and anti-Hasidic writings as well\".<ref name=\"Dan2\">Joseph Dan, ''[https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Teachings_and_Literature Hasidism: Teachings and Literature]'', [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]</ref> The difficulty of separating the movement's philosophy from that of its main inspiration, Lurianic Kabbalah, and determining what was novel and what merely a recapitulation, also baffled historians. Some, like [[Louis Jacobs]], regarded the early masters as innovators who introduced \"much that was new if only by emphasis\";<ref>Louis Jacobs, ''Basic Ideas of Hasidism'', in: ''Hasidism'', [[Encyclopedia Judaica]], 2007. Volume 8, p. 408.</ref> others, primarily [[Mendel Piekarz]], argued to the contrary that but a little was not found in much earlier tracts, and the movement's originality lay in the manner it popularized these teachings to become the ideology of a well-organized sect.<ref>Mendel Piekarz, ''Ben ide\u02bcologyah li-metsi\u02bcut'', [[Bialik Institute]] (1994), {{OCLC|31267606}}. pp. 151-152; Dynner, ''Men of Silk'', p. 27.</ref>\n\nAmong the traits particularly associated with Hasidism in common understanding which are in fact widespread, is the importance of joy and happiness at worship and religious life \u2013 though the sect undoubtedly stressed this aspect and still possesses a clear populist bent. Another example is the value placed on the simple, ordinary Jew in supposed contradiction with the favouring of elitist scholars beforehand; such ideas are common in ethical works far preceding Hasidism. The movement did for a few decades challenge the rabbinic establishment, which relied on the authority of [[Torah]] acumen, but affirmed the centrality of study very soon. Concurrently, the image of its [[Misnagdim|Opponents]] as dreary intellectuals who lacked spiritual fervour and opposed mysticism is likewise unfounded. Neither did Hasidism, often portrayed as promoting healthy sensuality, unanimously reject the asceticism and self-mortification associated primarily with its rivals. Joseph Dan ascribed all these perceptions to so-called \"[[Neo-Hasidic]]\" writers and thinkers, like [[Martin Buber]]. In their attempt to build new models of spirituality for modern Jews, they propagated a romantic, sentimental image of the movement. The \"Neo-Hasidic\" interpretation influenced even scholarly discourse to a great degree, but had a tenuous connection with reality.<ref name=\"Dan2\"/>\n\nA further complication is the divide between what researchers term \"early Hasidism\", which ended roughly in the 1810s, and established Hasidism since then onwards. While the former was a highly dynamic religious revival movement, the latter phase is characterized by consolidation into sects with hereditary leadership. The mystical teachings formulated during the first era were by no means repudiated, and many Hasidic masters remained consummate spiritualists and original thinkers; as noted by [[Benjamin Brown (scholar)|Benjamin Brown]], Buber's once commonly accepted view that the routinization constituted \"decadence\" was refuted by later studies, demonstrating that the movement remained very much innovative.<ref>See, for example, Benjamin Brown, [https://www.academia.edu/9612489/ Hasidism Without Romanticism: Mendel Piekarz's Path in the study of Hasidism]. pp. 455-456.</ref> Yet many aspects of early Hasidism were indeed de-emphasized in favour of more conventional religious expressions, and its radical concepts were largely neutralized. Some ''Rebbe''s adopted a relatively rationalist bent, sidelining their explicit mystical, [[theurgical]] roles, and many others functioned almost solely as political leaders of large communities. As to their Hasidim, affiliation was less a matter of admiring a charismatic leader as in the early days, but rather birth into a family belonging to a specific \"court\".<ref>Assaf, ''Regal Way'', pp. 49-55, 63-67; Dynner, ''Men of Silk'', pp. 117-121.</ref>\n\n===Immanence===\n[[File:Besht11.jpg|thumb|right|Rebuilt synagogue of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]. Rural [[shtetl]] life promoted awareness of the [[Divine immanence|immanent]] Divine Presence in Nature|300px]]\nThe most fundamental theme underlying all Hasidic theory is the [[immanence]] of God in the universe, often expressed in a phrase from [[Tikunei haZohar]], ''Leit Atar panuy mi-n\u00e9ya'' ([[Aramaic]]: \"no site is devoid of Him\"). This [[panentheistic]] concept was derived from Lurianic discourse, but greatly expanded in the Hasidic one. In the beginning, in order to [[Genesis creation narrative|create the world]], God contracted (''[[Tzimtzum]]'') his omnipresence, the ''[[Ein Sof]]'', leaving a Vacant Void (''Khalal panui''), bereft from obvious presence and therefore able to entertain free will, contradictions and other phenomena seemingly separate from God himself. These would have been impossible within his original, perfect existence. Yet, the very reality of the world which was created in the Void is entirely dependent on its divine origin. Matter would have been null and void without the true, spiritual essence it possesses. Just the same, the infinite ''Ein Sof'' cannot manifest in the Vacant Void, and must limit itself in the guise of measurable corporeality that may be perceived.<ref name=\"Elior1\">Rachel Elior, [http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~mselio/yesod-42-sci.pdf \u05d9\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df - \u05d3\u05e4\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea], in: ''Masu\u02bcot : me\u1e25\u1e33arim be-sifrut ha-\u1e33abalah ube-ma\u1e25shevet Yi\u015bra\u02bcel'', [[Bialik Institute]] (1994), {{OCLC|221873939}}. pp. 53-54.</ref>\n\nThus, there is a dualism between the true aspect of everything and the physical side, false but ineluctable, with each evolving into the other: as God must compress and disguise himself, so must humans and matter in general ascend and reunite with the omnipresence. [[Rachel Elior]] quoted [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], in his commentary ''[[Torah Or]]'' on Genesis 28:21, who wrote that \"''this is the purpose of Creation, from Infinity to Finitude, so it may be reversed from the state of Finite to that of Infinity''\". Kabbalah stressed the importance of this dialectic, but mainly (though not exclusively) evoked it in cosmic terms, referring for example to the manner in which God progressively diminished himself into the world through the various dimensions, or ''[[Sephirot]]''. Hasidism applied it also to the most mundane details of human existence. All Hasidic schools devoted a prominent place in their teaching, with differing accentuation, to the interchanging nature of ''Ein'', both infinite and imperceptible, becoming ''Yesh'', \"Existent\" \u2013 and vice versa. They used the concept as a prism to gauge the world, and the needs of the spirit in particular. Elior noted: \"''Reality lost its static nature and permanent value, now measured by a new standard, seeking to expose the Godly, boundless essence, manifest in its tangible, circumscribed opposite.''\"<ref>Elior, p. 56.</ref>\n\nOne major derivative of this philosophy is the notion of ''[[devekut]]'', \"communion\". As God was everywhere, connection with him had to be pursued ceaselessly as well, in all times, places and occasions. Such an experience was in the reach of every person, who only had to negate his inferior impulses and grasp the truth of divine immanence, enabling him to unite with it and attain the state of perfect, selfless bliss. Hasidic masters, well versed in the teachings concerning communion, are supposed not only to gain it themselves, but to guide their flock to it. ''Devekut'' was not a strictly defined experience; many varieties were described, from the utmost ecstasy of the learned leaders to the common man's more humble yet no less significant emotion during prayer.\n\nClosely linked with the former is ''Bitul ha-Yesh'', \"Negation of the Existent\", or of the \"Corporeal\". Hasidism teaches that while a superficial observance of the universe by the \"eyes of the flesh\" (''Einei ha-Basar'') purportedly reflects the reality of all things profane and worldly, a true devotee must transcend this illusory fa\u00e7ade and realize that there is nothing but God. It is not only a matter of perception, but very practical, for it entails also abandoning material concerns and cleaving only to the true, spiritual ones, oblivious to the surrounding false distractions of life. The practitioner's success in detaching from his sense of person, and conceive himself as ''Ein'' (in the double meaning of 'naught' and 'infinite'), is regarded as the highest state of elation in Hasidism. The true divine essence of man \u2013 the soul \u2013 may then ascend and return to the upper realm, where it does not possess an existence independent from God. This ideal is termed ''Hitpashtut ha-Gashmi'yut'', \"the expansion (or removal) of corporeality\". It is the dialectic opposite of God's contraction into the world.<ref>Elior, pp. 60-61.</ref>\n\nTo be enlightened and capable of ''Bitul ha-Yesh'', pursuing the pure spiritual aims and defying the primitive impulses of the body, one must overcome his inferior \"Bestial Soul\", connected with the Eyes of the Flesh. He may be able to tap into his \"Divine Soul\" (''Nefesh Elohit''), which craves communion, by employing constant contemplation, ''Hitbonenot'', on the hidden Godly dimension of all that exists. Then he could understand his surroundings with the \"Eyes of the Intellect\". The ideal adherent was intended to develop equanimity, or ''Hishtavut'' in Hasidic parlance, toward all matters worldly, not ignoring them, but understanding their superficiality.\n\nHasidic masters exhorted their followers to \"negate themselves\", paying as little heed as they could for worldly concerns, and thus, to clear the way for this transformation. The struggle and doubt of being torn between the belief in God's immanence and the very real sensual experience of the indifferent world is a key theme in the movement's literature. Many tracts have been devoted to the subject, acknowledging that the \"callous and rude\" flesh hinders one from holding fast to the ideal, and these shortcomings are extremely hard to overcome even in the purely intellectual level, a fortiori in actual life.<ref>Elior, pp. 55, 62-63.</ref>\n\nAnother implication of this dualism is the notion of \"Worship through Corporeality\", ''Avodah be-Gashmi'yut''. As the ''Ein Sof'' metamorphosed into substance, so may it in turn be raised back to its higher state; likewise, since the machinations in the higher ''Sephirot'' exert their influence on this world, even the most simple action may, if performed correctly and with understanding, achieve the reverse effect. According to Lurianic doctrine, the netherworld was suffused with divine sparks, concealed within \"husks\", ''[[Qliphoth]]''. The glints had to be recovered and elevated to their proper place in the cosmos. \"Materiality itself could be embraced and consecrated\", noted [[Glenn Dynner]], and Hasidism taught that by common acts like dancing or eating, performed with intention, the sparks could be extricated and set free. ''Avodah be-Gashmi'yut'' had a clear, if not implicit, [[antinomian]] edge, possibly equating sacred rituals mandated by Judaism with everyday activities, granting them the same status in the believer's eyes and having him content to commit the latter at the expense of the former. While at some occasions the movement did appear to step at that direction \u2013 for example, in its early days prayer and preparation for it consumed so much time that adherents were blamed of neglecting sufficient Torah study \u2013 Hasidic masters proved highly conservative. Unlike in other, more radical sects influenced by kabbalistic ideas, like the [[Sabbateans]], Worship through Corporeality was largely limited to the elite and carefully restrained. The common adherents were taught they may engage it only mildly, through small deeds like earning money to support their leaders.\n\nThe complementary opposite of corporeal worship, or the elation of the finite into infinite, is the concept of ''Hamshacha'', \"drawing down\" or \"absorbing\", and specifically, ''Hamschat ha-Shefa'', \"absorption of effluence\". During spiritual ascension, one could siphon the power animating the higher dimensions down into the material world, where it would manifest as benevolent influence of all kinds. These included spiritual enlightenment, zest in worship and other high-minded aims, but also the more prosaic health and healing, deliverance from various troubles and simple economic prosperity. Thus, a very tangible and alluring motivation to become followers emerged. Both corporeal worship and absorption allowed the masses to access, with common actions, a religious experience once deemed esoteric.<ref>Dynner, ''Men of Silk'', pp. 32-33.</ref>\n\nYet another reflection of the ''Ein''-''Yesh'' dialectic is pronounced in the transformation of evil to goodness and the relations between these two poles and other contradicting elements \u2013 including various traits and emotions of the human psyche, like pride and humility, purity and profanity, et cetera. Hasidic thinkers argued that in order to redeem the sparks hidden, one had to associate not merely with the corporeal, but with sin and evil. One example is the elevation of impure thoughts during prayer, transforming them to noble ones rather than repressing them, advocated mainly in the early days of the sect; or \"breaking\" oneself's character by directly confronting profane inclinations. This aspect, once more, had sharp antinomian implications and was used by the Sabbateans to justify excessive sinning. It was mostly toned down in late Hasidism, and even before that leaders were careful to stress that it was not exercised in the physical sense, but in the contemplative, spiritual one. This kabbalistic notion, too, was not unique to the movement and appeared frequently among other Jewish groups.<ref>The entire section is based on: Elior, ''\u05d9\u05e9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df''; Dan, ''Teachings'', YIVO; ''Hasidism'', Judaica, pp. 410-412.</ref>\n\n===Righteous One===\n[[File:Isroel Hopsztajn.jpg|thumb|[[Rebbe]] [[Yisroel Hopsztajn]], a great promulgator of Hasidism in Poland, blessing acolytes c 1800. Hasidism gave the elite [[Tzadik]] a social mystical role|300px]]\nWhile its mystical and ethical teachings are not easily sharply distinguished from those of other Jewish currents, the defining doctrine of Hasidism is that of the saintly leader, serving both as an ideal inspiration and an institutional figure around whom followers are organized. In the movement's sacral literature, this person is referred to as the ''[[Tzadik|Tzaddiq]]'', the Righteous One \u2013 often also known by the general honorific ''Admor'' (acronym of Hebrew for \"our master, teacher and Rabbi\"), granted to rabbis in general, or colloquially as ''Rebbe''. The idea that, in every generation, there are righteous persons through whom the divine effluence is drawn to the material world is rooted in the kabbalistic thought, which also claims that one of them is supreme, the reincarnation of [[Moses]]. Hasidism elaborated the notion of the ''Tzaddiq'' into the basis of its entire system \u2013 so much that the very term gained an independent meaning within it, apart from the [[Tzadik|original which denoted God-fearing, highly observant]] people.<ref name=\"Assaf1\">David Assaf, ''The Regal Way: The Life and Times of Rabbi Israel of Ruzhin'', Stanford University Press (2002). pp. 101\u2013104.</ref>\n\nWhen the sect began to attract following and expanded from a small circle of learned disciples to a mass movement, it became evident that its complex philosophy could be imparted only partially to the new rank and file. As even intellectuals struggled with the sublime dialectics of infinity and corporeality, there was little hope to have the common folk truly internalize these, not as mere abstractions to pay lip service to.<ref>Elior, p. 65.</ref> Ideologues exhorted them to have faith, but the true answer, which marked their rise as a distinct sect, was the concept of the ''Tzaddiq''. A Hasidic master was to serve as a living embodiment of the recondite teachings. He was able to transcend matter, gain spiritual communion, Worship through Corporeality and fulfill all the theoretical ideals. As the vast majority of his flock could not do so themselves, they were to cleave to him instead, acquiring at least some semblance of those vicariously. His commanding and often \u2013 especially in the early generations \u2013 charismatic presence was to reassure the faithful and demonstrate the truth in Hasidic philosophy by countering doubts and despair. But more than spiritual welfare was concerned: Since it was believed he could ascend to the higher realms, the leader was able to harvest effluence and bring it down upon his adherents, providing them with very material benefits. \"The crystallization of that [[theurgical]] phase\", noted [[Glenn Dynner]], \"marked Hasidism's evolution into a full-fledged social movement.\"\n\nIn Hasidic discourse, the willingness of the leader to sacrifice the ecstasy and fulfillment of unity in God was deemed a heavy sacrifice undertaken for the benefit of the congregation. His followers were to sustain and especially to obey him, as he possessed superior knowledge and insight gained through communion. The \"descent of the Righteous\" (''Yeridat ha-Tzaddiq'') into the matters of the world was depicted as identical with the need to save the sinners and redeem the sparks concealed in the most lowly places. Such a link between his functions as communal leader and spiritual guide legitimized the political power he wielded. It also prevented a retreat of Hasidic masters into hermitism and passivity, as many mystics before them did. Their worldly authority was perceived as part of their long-term mission to elevate the corporeal world back into divine infinity.<ref name=\"AA\">Elior, pp. 66\u201368; Dynner, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> To a certain extent, the Saint even fulfilled for his congregation, and for it alone, a limited [[Messiah in Judaism|Messianic]] capacity in his lifetime. After the Sabbatean debacle, this moderate approach provided a safe outlet for the eschatological urges. At least two leaders radicalized in this sphere and caused severe controversy: [[Nachman of Breslov]], who declared himself the only true ''Tzaddiq'', and [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], whom many of his followers believed to be the Messiah. The ''Rebbe''s were subject to intense hagiography, even subtly compared with Biblical figures by employing prefiguration.<ref name=\"Dan2\"/> It was argued that since followers could not \"negate themselves\" sufficiently to transcend matter, they should instead \"negate themselves\" in submission to the Saint (''hitbatlut la-Tzaddiq''), thus bonding with him and enabling themselves to access what he achieved in terms of spirituality. The Righteous served as a mystical bridge, drawing down effluence and elevating the prayers and petitions of his admirers.<ref name=\"AA\"/>\n\nThe Saintly forged a well-defined relationship with the masses: they provided the latter with inspiration, were consulted in all matters, and were expected to intercede on behalf of their adherents with God and ensure they gained financial prosperity, health and male offspring. The pattern still characterizes Hasidic sects, though prolonged routinization in many turned the ''Rebbes'' into de facto political leaders of strong, institutionalized communities. The role of a Saint was obtained by charisma, erudition and appeal in the early days of Hasidism. But by the dawn of the 19th century, the Righteous began to claim legitimacy by descent to the masters of the past, arguing that since they linked matter with infinity, their abilities had to be associated with their own corporeal body. Therefore, it was accepted \"there can be no ''Tzaddiq'' but the son of a ''Tzaddiq''\". Virtually all modern sects maintain this hereditary principle. For example, the ''Rebbe''s' families maintain endogamy and marry almost solely with scions of other dynasties.<ref>Assaf, ''Regal Way'', pp. 108\u2013110.</ref>\n\n===Schools of thought===\nSome Hasidic \"courts\", and not a few individual prominent masters, developed distinct philosophies with particular accentuation of various themes in the movement's general teachings. Several of these Hasidic schools had lasting influence over many dynasties, while others died with their proponents. In the doctrinal sphere, the dynasties may be divided along many lines. Some are characterized by ''Rebbe''s who are predominantly Torah scholars and [[Posek|decisors]], deriving their authority much like ordinary non-Hasidic rabbis do. Such \"courts\" place great emphasis on strict observance and study, and are among the most meticulous in the Orthodox world in practice. Prominent examples are the House of [[Sanz]] and its scions, such as [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], or [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]]. Other sects, like [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]], espouse a charismatic-populist line, centered on the admiration of the masses for the Righteous, his effervescent style of prayer and conduct and his purported miracle-working capabilities. Fewer still retain a high proportion of the mystical-spiritualist themes of early Hasidism, and encourage members to study much kabbalistic literature and (carefully) engage in the field. The various [[Ziditchover]] dynasties mostly adhere to this philosophy.<ref name=\"RAD\"/>\nOthers still focus on contemplation and achieving inner perfection. No dynasty is wholly devoted to a single approach of the above, and all offer some combination with differing emphasis on each of those.\n\nIn 1812, a schism occurred between the [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Seer of Lublin]] and his prime disciple, the [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Holy Jew]] of [[Przysucha]], due to both personal and doctrinal disagreements. The Seer adopted a populist approach, centered on the Righteous' theurgical functions to draw the masses. He was famous for his lavish, enthusiastic conduct during prayer and worship, and extremely charismatic demeanour. He stressed that as ''Tzaddiq'', his mission was to influence the common folk by absorbing Divine Light and satisfying their material needs, thus converting them to his cause and elating them. The Holy Jew pursued a more introspective course, maintaining that the ''Rebbe'''s duty was to serve as a spiritual mentor for a more elitist group, helping them to achieve a senseless state of contemplation, aiming to restore man to his oneness with God which [[Adam]] supposedly lost when he ate the fruit of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Lignum Scientiae]]. The Holy Jew and his successors did neither repudiate miracle working, nor did they eschew dramatic conduct; but they were much more restrained in general. The Przysucha School became dominant in [[Congress Poland|Central Poland]], while populist Hasidism resembling the Lublin ethos often prevailed in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]].<ref>Dynner, pp. 29-31.</ref> One extreme and renowned philosopher who emerged from the Przysucha School was [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]]. Adopting an elitist, hard-line attitude, he openly denounced the folkly nature of other ''Tzaddiqim'', and rejected financial support. Gathering a small group of devout scholars who sought to attain spiritual perfection, whom he often berated and mocked, he always stressed the importance of both somberness and totality, stating it was better to be fully wicked than only somewhat good.\n\nThe [[Chabad]] school, limited to its namesake dynasty, but prominent, was founded by [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] and was elaborated by his successors, until the late 20th century. The movement retained many of the attributes of early Hasidism, before a clear divide between Righteous and ordinary followers was cemented. Chabad ''Rebbe''s insisted their adherents acquire proficiency in the sect's lore, and not relegate most responsibility to the leaders. The sect emphasizes the importance of intellectually grasping the dynamics of the hidden divine aspect and how they affect the human psyche; the very acronym Chabad is for the three penultimate ''[[Sephirot]]'', associated with the cerebral side of consciousness.\n\nAnother famous philosophy is that formulated by [[Nachman of Breslov]] and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast to most of his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics and the manner in which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive faith in their reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to see the world as it truly is.\n\n[[Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov]], a major Galician ''Tzaddiq'', was a disciple of the Seer of Lublin, but combined his populist inclination with a strict observance even among his most common followers, and great pluralism in matters pertaining to mysticism, as those were eventually emanating from each person's unique soul.\n\n[[Mordechai Yosef Leiner]] of [[Izbica]] promulgated a radical understanding of free will, which he considered illusory and also derived directly from God. He argued that when one attained a sufficient spiritual level and could be certain evil thoughts did not derive from his animalistic soul, then sudden urges to transgress revealed Law were God-inspired and may be pursued. This volatile, potentially antinomian doctrine of \"Transgression for the Sake of Heaven\" is found also in other Hasidic writings, especially from the early period. His successors de-emphasized it in their commentaries. Leiner's disciple [[Zadok HaKohen]] of Lublin also developed a complex philosophic system which presented a dialectic nature in history, arguing that great progress had to be preceded by crisis and calamity.\n\n==Practice and culture==\n\n===''Rebbe'' and \"court\"===\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - The Rabbi of Kalib (1).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Menachem Mendel Taub|Kaliver Rebbe]], Holocaust survivor, inspiring his court on the festival of [[Sukkoth]]]]\n[[File:\u05e4\u05ea\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d8\u05e9.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kvitel]] requests for blessing piled on the [[Ohel (grave)|graves]] of the last [[Chabad|Lubavitcher Rebbes]]]]\nThe Hasidic community is organized in a sect known as \"court\" (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05e6\u05e8, ''hatzer''; Yiddish: \u05d4\u05d5\u05d9\u05e3, ''Hoif'' from German ''Hof/Gerichtshof''). In the early days of the movement, a particular ''Rebbe'''s following usually resided in the same town, and Hasidim were categorized by their leaders' settlement: a Hasid of Belz, Vizhnitz and so forth. Later, especially after World War II, the dynasties retained the names of their original Eastern European settlements when moving to the West or Israel. Thus, for example, the \"court\" established by [[Joel Teitelbaum]] in 1905 at Transylvania remained known after its namesake town, [[Sathmar]], even though its headquarters lay in New York, and almost all other Hasidic sects likewise \u2013 albeit some groups founded overseas were named accordingly, like the [[Boston (Hasidic dynasty)]].\n\nAkin to his spiritual status, the ''Rebbe'' is also the administrative head of the community. Sects often possess their own synagogues, study halls and internal charity mechanisms, and ones sufficiently large also maintain entire educational systems. The ''Rebbe'' is the supreme figure of authority, and not just for the institutions. The rank-and-file Hasidim are also expected to consult with him on important matters, and often seek his blessing and advice. He is personally attended by aides known as ''[[Gabbai]]'' or ''Mashbak''.\n\nMany particular Hasidic rites surround the leader. On the Sabbath, holidays, and celebratory occasions, ''Rebbe''s hold a ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|Tisch]]'' (table), a large feast for their male adherents. Together, they sing, dance, and eat, and the head of the sect shakes the hands of his followers to bless them, and often delivers a sermon. A ''Chozer'', \"repeater\", selected for his good memory, commits the text to writing after the Sabbath (any form of writing during the Sabbath itself [[activities prohibited on Shabbat|being forbidden]]). In many \"courts\", the remnants of his meal, supposedly suffused with holiness, are handed out and even fought over. Often, a very large dish is prepared beforehand and the ''Rebbe'' only tastes it before passing it to the crowd. Apart from the gathering at noon, the [[seudah shlishit|third repast]] on Sabbath and the \"[[Melaveh Malkah]]\" meal when it ends are also particularly important and an occasion for song, feasting, tales and sermons. A central custom, which serves as a major factor in the economics of most \"courts\", is the ''Pidyon'', \"Ransom\", better known by its Yiddish name ''[[Kvitel]]'', \"little note\": adherents submit a written petition, which the master may assist with on behalf of his sanctity, adding a sum of money for either charity or the leader's needs.<ref>[[Louis Jacobs]], ''[https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Everyday_Life Hasidism: Everyday Life]'', [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]].</ref><ref>''Hasidism: Hasidic Way of Life'', Encyclopedia Judaica, Volume 8, pp. 398-399.</ref> Occasions in the \"court\" serve as pretext for mass gatherings, flaunting the power, wealth and size of each. Weddings of the leader's family, for example, are often held with large multistoried stands (\u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05e0\u05d8\u05e9\u05e2\u05e1, ''Parentches'') filled with Hasidim surround the main floor, where the ''Rebbe'' and his relatives dine, celebrate and perform the [[Mitzvah tantz]]. This is a festive dance with the bride: both parties hold one end of a long sash, a Hasidic [[gartel]], for reasons of modesty.\n\nAllegiance to the dynasty and ''Rebbe'' is also often a cause for tension and violence.<ref>Mintz, Jerome R.

Due to their strictly religious education and traditionalist upbringing, those who leave their sects are devoid of working skills and even command of the English language, and their integration into outer society is extremely problematic.<ref>Cf., for example: Judy Bolton-Fasman, [https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/memoirs-of-ex-hasidic-jews-shine-light-on-faigy-mayers-world-1.5385468 'Off the Path' Memoirs of ex-Hasidic Jews Shine Light on Faigy Mayer\u2019s World].

Once a title for an instructor in Chabad and Breslov only, the institutionalized nature of the established \"courts\" led many adherents to seek guidance and inspiration from persons who did not declare themselves new leaders, but only ''Mashpi'im''. Technically, they fill the original role of ''Rebbe''s in providing for spiritual welfare; yet, they do not usurp the title, and are therefore countenanced.<ref>Tomer Persico, ''[https://tomerpersico.com/2014/03/27/brown_interview/ \u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05d6\u05e6\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05e7\u05e6\u05e0\u05d4, \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05d5\u05dc \u05d4\u05e1\u05ea\u05d2\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u2013 \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05dd \u05d3\"\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea]''.</ref>\n\n===Liturgy===\nMost Hasidim use some variation of ''[[Nusach Sefard]]'', a blend of [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi]] liturgies, based on the innovations of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]]. Many dynasties have their own specific adaptation of Nusach Sefard; some, such as the versions of the Belzer, Bobover, and [[Dushinsky (Hasidic dynasty)|Dushinsky]] Hasidim, are closer to Nusach Ashkenaz, while others, such as the Munkacz version, are closer to the old Lurianic. Many sects believe that their version reflects Luria's mystical devotions best. The Baal Shem Tov added two segments to Friday services on the eve of Sabbath: Psalm 107 before [[Mincha|afternoon prayer]], and Psalm 23 at the end of [[Maariv (prayer)|evening service]].\n\nHasidim use the [[Ashkenazi pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]] for liturgical purposes, reflecting their Eastern European background. Wordless, emotional melodies, ''[[nigun]]im'', are particularly common in their services.\n\nHasidim lend great importance to ''[[kavanah|kavana]]'', devotion or intention, and their services tend to be extremely long and repetitive. Some courts nearly abolished traditional specified times by which prayers must be conducted (''zemanim''), to prepare and concentrate. This practice, still enacted in [[Chabad]] for one, is controversial in many dynasties, which do follow the specifics of [[Jewish Law]] on praying earlier, and not eating beforehand. Another reglement is daily immersion in a [[Mikveh|ritual bath]] by males for spiritual cleansing, at a rate much higher than is customary among other Orthodox Jews.\n\n===Melody===\nHasidism developed a unique emphasis on the spirituality of melody (''[[Nigunim]]'') as a means to reach [[Deveikut]] Divine communion, during prayer and communal gatherings. Ecstatic, often wordless Hasidic melodies developed new expressions and depths of the soul in Jewish life, often drawing from folk idioms of the surrounding gentile culture, which were adapted to elevate their concealed sparks of divinity, according to [[Lurianic]] theology.<ref>[https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Music Hasidism: Music] YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe</ref>\n\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Hasidic Family in Street - Borough Park - Hasidic District - Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Hasidic family in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]].

Some details of their dress are shared by non-Hasidic Haredim. Much of Hasidic dress was historically the clothing of all Eastern European Jews, influenced by the style of [[szlachta|Polish\u2013Lithuanian nobility]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goldberg-Mulkiewicz|first=Olga|encyclopedia=[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]|title=Dress|url=https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Dress|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref> Furthermore, Hasidim have attributed religious origins to specific Hasidic items of clothing.\n\nHasidic men most commonly wear dark overclothes. On weekdays, they wear a long, black, cloth jacket called a [[rekel]], and on [[Jewish holidays|Jewish Holy Days]], the [[bekishe]] ''zaydene kapote'' (Yiddish, lit., satin caftan), a similarly long, black jacket, but of [[satin]] fabric traditionally silk. Indoors, the colorful tish [[bekishe]] is still worn. Some Hasidim wear a satin overcoat, known as ''rezhvolke''. A rebbe's ''rezhvolke'' might be trimmed with velvet. Most do not wear [[necktie]]s.\n\nOn [[Shabbat|the Sabbath]], the Hasidic ''Rebbes'' traditionally wore a white [[bekishe]]. This practice has fallen into disuse among most. Many of them wear a black silk ''[[bekishe]]'' that is trimmed with velvet (known as ''stro-kes'' or ''samet'') and in Hungarian ones, gold-embroidered.\n\nVarious symbolic and religious qualities are attributed to Hasidic dress, though they are mainly apocryphal and the clothes' origin is cultural and historical. For example, the long overcoats are considered modest, the Shtreimel is supposedly related to [[shaatnez]] and keeps one warm without using [[wool]], and Sabbath shoes are laceless in order not to have to tie a knot, a prohibited action. A ''[[gartel]]'' divides the Hasid's lower parts from his upper parts, implying modesty and chastity, and for kabbalistic reasons, Hasidim button their clothes right over left. Hasidic men customarily wear black hats during the weekdays, as do nearly all Haredi men today. A variety of hats are worn depending on the group: Chabad men often pinch their hats to form a triangle on the top, Satmar men wear an open-crown hat with rounded edges, and ''Samet'' (velvet) or ''biber'' ([[beaver]]) hats are worn by many Galician and Hungarian Hasidic men.\n\nMarried Hasidic men don a variety of fur [[headdress]]es on the Sabbath, once common among all wedded Eastern European Jewish males and still worn by non-Hasidic [[Perushim]] in Jerusalem. The most ubiquitous is the ''[[Shtreimel]]'', which is seen especially among Galician and Hungarian sects like Satmar or Belz. A taller ''[[Spodik]]'' is donned by Polish dynasties such as [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]]. A ''[[Kolpik]]'' is worn by unmarried sons and grandsons of many Rebbes on the Sabbath. Some Rebbes don it on special occasions.\n\nThere are many other distinct items of clothing. Such are the [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerrer]] ''hoyznzokn''\u2014long black socks into which the trousers are tucked. Some Hasidic men from Eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] wear black socks with their breeches on the Sabbath, as opposed to white ones on weekdays, particularly [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belzer]] Hasidim.\n\nFollowing a Biblical commandment not to shave the sides of one's face (Leviticus 19:27), male members of most Hasidic groups wear long, uncut sidelocks called [[payot]] (or ''peyes''). Some Hasidic men shave off the rest of their hair. Not every Hasidic group requires long peyos, and not all Jewish men with peyos are Hasidic, but all Hasidic groups discourage the shaving of one's beard. Most Hasidic boys receive their [[first haircut]]s ceremonially at the age of three years (only the Skverrer Hasidim do this at their boys' second birthday). Until then, Hasidic boys have long hair.\n\nHasidic women wear clothing adhering to the principles of [[tzeniut|modest dress in Jewish law]]. This includes long, conservative skirts and sleeves past the elbow, as well as covered necklines. Also, the women wear stockings to cover their legs; in some Hasidic groups, such as [[Satmar]] or [[Toldot Aharon]], the stockings must be opaque. In keeping with [[Halacha|Jewish law]], married women cover their hair, using either a ''[[sheitel]]'' (wig), a ''[[tichel]]'' (headscarf), a ''[[shpitzel]]'', a [[snood (headgear)|snood]], a hat, or a beret. In some Hasidic groups, such as [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], women may wear two headcoverings \u2013 a wig and a scarf, or a wig and a hat.\n\n===Families===\n\nHasidic Jews, like many other Orthodox Jews, typically produce large families; the average Hasidic family in the United States has 8 children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aish.com/jw/s/48899452.html |title=Jews and the Jewish Birthrate |publisher=Aish.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> This is followed out of a desire to fulfill the Biblical mandate to \"[[cultural mandate|be fruitful and multiply]]\".\n\n===Languages===\nMost Hasidim speak the language of their countries of residence, but use [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] among themselves as a way of remaining distinct and preserving tradition. Thus, children are still learning Yiddish today, and the language, despite predictions to the contrary, is not dead. Yiddish newspapers are still published, and Yiddish fiction is being written, primarily aimed at women. Even films in Yiddish are being produced within the Hasidic community. Some Hasidic groups, such as Satmar or Toldot Aharon, actively oppose the everyday use of Hebrew, which they consider a holy tongue. The use of Hebrew for anything other than prayer and study is, according to them, profane and so Yiddish is the vernacular and common tongue for many Hasidim around the world.\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Chassid22.jpg|thumb|right|Sculpture of the Hasidic movement's celebration of spirituality on the [[Knesset Menorah]]]]\nHasidic Tales are a literary genre, concerning both hagiography of various ''Rebbes'' and moralistic themes. Some are anecdotes or recorded conversations dealing with matters of faith, practice, and the like. The most famous tend to be terse and carry a strong and obvious point. They were often transmitted orally, though the earliest compendium is from 1815.<ref name=\"Schacter-Shalomi, Zalman 2003\">Schacter-Shalomi, Zalman, Wrapped in a Holy Flame (2003) San Francisco CA, Jossey-Bass, {{ISBN|0-7879-6573-1}}</ref>\n\nMany revolve around the Righteous.

The right-wing, identified with [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], are hostile to the [[State of Israel]], and refuse to participate in the elections there or receive any state funding. They are mainly affiliated with the [[Orthodox Council of Jerusalem]] and the [[Central Rabbinical Congress]]. The great majority belong to ''Agudas Israel'', represented in Israel by the [[United Torah Judaism]] party. Its [[Council of Torah Sages]] now includes a dozen ''Rebbe''s. In the past, there were Religious Zionist ''Rebbe''s, mainly of the Ruzhin line, but there are virtually none today.<ref>Brown, \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4. pp. 1-14, etc.</ref>\n\nIn 2016, a study conducted by Prof. [[Marcin Wodzi\u0144ski]], drawing from the courts' own internal phone-books and other resources, located 129,211 Hasidic households worldwide, about 5% of the estimated total Jewish population. Of those, 62,062 resided in [[Israel]] and 53,485 in the [[United States]], 5,519 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and 3,392 in [[Canada]]. In Israel, the largest Hasidic concentrations are in the Ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods of [[Jerusalem]] \u2013 including [[Ramot Alon]], [[Batei Ungarin]] et cetera \u2013 in the cities of [[Bnei Brak]] and [[El'ad]], and in the [[West Bank settlement]]s of [[Modi'in Illit]] and [[Beitar Illit]]. There is considerable presence in other specifically Orthodox municipalities or enclaves, like [[Kiryat Sanz, Netanya]]. In the United States, most Hasidim reside in [[New York (state)|New York]], though there are small communities across the entire country. [[Brooklyn]], [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], and [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] all house a particularly large population. So does the hamlet of [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]] in upstate New York. In the same region, [[New Square]] and [[Kiryas Joel]] are rapidly growing all-Hasidic enclaves, one founded by the [[Skver]] dynasty and the other by Satmar. In Britain, [[Stamford Hill]] is home to the largest Hasidic community in the country, and there are others in London and [[Prestwich]] in Manchester. In Canada, [[Kiryas Tosh]] is a settlement populated entirely by [[Tosh (Hasidic dynasty)|Tosh]] Hasidim, and there are more adherents of other sects in and around Montreal.<ref name=\"Wodz\">All numbers are from: Marcin Wodzi\u0144ski, ''Historical Atlas of Hasidism'', Princeton University Press, 2018. pp. 192-205.</ref>\n\nThere are more than a dozen Hasidic dynasties with a large following, and over a hundred which have small or minuscule adherence, sometimes below twenty people, with the presumptive ''Rebbe'' holding the title more as a matter of prestige. Many \"courts\" became completely extinct during the [[Holocaust]], like the [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)]] from [[Aleksandr\u00f3w \u0141\u00f3dzki]], which numbered tens of thousands in 1939, and barely exists today.<ref>Jacques Gutwirth, The Rebirth of Hasidism: From 1945 to the Present Day, Odile Jacob, 2004. pp. 106-108.</ref>\n\nThe largest sect in the world, with some 26,000 member households which constitute 20% of all Hasidim, is Satmar, founded in 1905 in the namesake city in Hungary and based in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] and [[Kiryas Joel]]. Satmar is known for its conservatism and opposition to both ''[[World Agudath Israel|Agudas Israel]]'' and [[Zionism]], inspired by the legacy of Hungarian Ultra-Orthodoxy. The sect underwent a schism in 2006 and two competing factions emerged, led by rival brothers [[Aaron Teitelbaum]] and [[Zalman Teitelbaum]]. The second-largest \"court\" worldwide, with some 11,600 households (or 9% of all Hasidism) is [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], established in 1859 at [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria]], near [[Warsaw]]. For decades, it was the dominant power in ''Agudas'' and espoused a moderate line toward Zionism and modern culture. Its origins lay in the rationalist [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Przysucha School]] of [[Congress Poland|Central Poland]]. The current Rebbe is [[Yaakov Aryeh Alter]]. The third largest dynasty is [[Vizhnitz]], a charismatic sect founded in 1854 at [[Vyzhnytsia]], [[Bukovina]]. A moderate group involved in Israeli politics, it is split into several branches, which maintain cordial relations. The main partition is between Vizhnitz-Israel and Vizhnitz-Monsey, headed respectively by Rebbes Israel Hager and the eight sons of the late Rebbe Mordecai Hager. In total, all Vizhnitz sub-\"courts\" constitute over 10,500 households. The fourth major dynasty, with some 7,000 households, is [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]], established 1817 in namesake [[Belz]], south of [[Lviv]]. An [[Eastern Galicia]]n dynasty drawing both from the [[Seer of Lublin]]'s charismatic-populist style and \"rabbinic\" Hasidism, it espoused hard-line positions, but broke off from the [[Orthodox Council of Jerusalem]] and joined ''Agudas'' in 1979. Belz is led by Rebbe [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (fifth Belzer rebbe)|Yissachar Dov Rokeach]].<ref name=\"Wodz\"/>\n\nThe [[Bobover]] dynasty, founded 1881 in [[Bobowa]], [[West Galicia]], constitutes some 4,500 households in total and has undergone a bitter succession strife since 2005, eventually forming the \"Bobov\" (3,000 households) and \"[[Bobov-45]]\" (1,500 households) sects. [[Sanz-Klausenburg]], divided into a New York and Israeli branches, presides over 3,800 households. The [[Skver]] sect, established in 1848 in [[Skvyra]] near [[Kiev]], constitutes 3,300. The [[Shomer Emunim]] dynasties, originating in Jerusalem during the 1920s and known for their unique style of dressing imitating that of the [[Old Yishuv]], have over 3,000 families, almost all in the larger \"courts\" of [[Toldos Aharon]] and [[Toldos Avraham Yitzchak]]. [[Karlin Stolin]], which rose already in the 1760s in a quarter of [[Pinsk]], encompasses 2,200 families.<ref name=\"Wodz\"/>\n\nThere are two other populous Hasidic sub-groups, which do not function as classical ''Rebbe''-headed \"courts\", but as decentralized movements, retaining some of the characteristics of early Hasidism.<ref>Brown, \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4. p. 86.</ref> [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]] rose under its charismatic leader [[Nachman of Breslov]] in the early 19th century. Critical of all other ''Rebbes'', he forbade his followers to appoint a successor upon his death in 1810. His acolytes led small groups of adherents, persecuted by other Hasidim, and disseminated his teachings. The original philosophy of the sect elicited great interest among modern scholars, and that led many [[Baal teshuva movement|newcomers to Orthodox Judaism (\"repentants\")]] to join it. Numerous Breslov communities, each led by its own rabbis, now have thousands of full-fledged followers and far more admirers and semi-committed supporters; Marcin Wodzi\u0144ski estimated that the fully committed population of Breslovers may be estimated at 7,000 households. [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], originating in the 1770s, did have hereditary leadership, but always stressed the importance of self-study rather than reliance on the Righteous. Its seventh and last leader, [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], converted it into a vehicle for Jewish outreach. By his death in 1994, it had many more semi-engaged supporters than Hasidim in the strict sense, and they are still hard to distinguish. Chabad's own internal phone-books list some 16,800 member households.<ref name=\"Wodz\"/> None succeeded Schneerson, and the sect operates as a large network of communities with independent leaders.\n\n==History==\n{{Judaism}}\n\n===Background===\nIn the late 17th century, several social trends converged among the Jews who inhabited the southern periphery of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], especially in contemporary [[Western Ukraine]]. These enabled the emergence and flourishing of Hasidism.\n[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e5 027-0.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[History of the Jews in Brody|Great synagogue of Brody]], where an 18th century ''Klaus'' \"close\" of pre-Hasidic kabbalists convened in seclusion]]\nThe first and most prominent was the popularization of the mystical lore of Kabbalah. For several centuries, an esoteric teaching practiced surreptitiously by few, it was transformed into almost household knowledge by a mass of cheap printed pamphlets. The kabbalistic inundation was a major influence behind the rise of the heretical [[Sabbatean]] movement, led by [[Sabbatai Zevi]], who declared himself [[Messiah]] in 1665. The propagation of Kabbalah made the Jewish masses susceptible to Hasidic ideas, themselves in essence a popularized version of the teaching \u2013 indeed, Hasidism actually emerged when its founders determined to openly practice it instead of remaining a secret circle of ascetics as was the manner of almost all past kabbalists. The correlation between publicizing the lore and Sabbateanism did not escape the rabbinic elite, and caused vehement opposition to the new movement.\n\nAnother factor was the decline of the traditional authority structures. Jewish autonomy remained quite secured; later research debunked [[Simon Dubnow]]'s claim that the [[Council of Four Lands]]' demise in 1746 was a culmination of a long process which destroyed judicial independence and paved the way for the Hasidic ''rebbes'' to serve as leaders (another long-held explanation for the sect's rise advocated by [[Raphael Mahler]], that the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] effected economic impoverishment and despair, was also refuted). However, the [[Szlachta|magnates and nobles]] held much sway over the nomination of both rabbis and communal elders, to such a degree that the masses often perceived them as mere lackeys of the land owners. Their ability to serve as legitimate arbiters in disputes \u2013 especially those concerning the regulation of leasehold rights over alcohol distillation and other monopolies in the estates \u2013 was severely diminished. The reduced prestige of the establishment, and the need for an alternative source of authority to pass judgement, left a vacuum which Hasidic charismatics eventually filled. They transcended old communal institutions, to which all the Jews of a locality were subordinate, and had groups of followers in each town across vast territories. Often supported by rising strata outside the traditional elite, whether nouveau riche or various low-level religious functionaries, they created a modern form of leadership.\n\nHistorians discerned other influences. The formative age of Hasidism coincided with the rise of numerous religious revival movements across the world, including the [[First Great Awakening]] in [[New England]], German [[Pietism]], [[Wahhabism]] in Arabia and the Russian [[Old Believers]] who opposed the established church. They all rejected the existing order, decrying it as stale and overly hierarchic. They offered what they described as more spiritual, candid and simple substitutes. [[Gershon David Hundert]] noted the considerable similarity between the Hasidic conceptions and this general background, rooting both in the growing importance attributed to the individual's consciousness and choices.<ref>[[Glenn Dynner]], ''Men of Silk: The Hasidic Conquest of Polish Jewish Society'', Oxford University Press (2006). pp. 3\u201323.</ref>\n\n===Israel ben Eliezer===\n{{Main|Baal Shem Tov}}\n[[File:Besht Signature.jpg|thumb|left|Israel ben Eliezer's autograph]]\n[[File:Ohel Baal Shem Tov.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of the Baal Shem Tov in [[Medzhybizh]], [[Podolia]], Hasidism's first centre]]\n[[Israel ben Eliezer]] (ca. 1690\u20131760), known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'' (\"Master of the ''Good'' Name\", [[acronym]]: \"Besht\"), is considered the founder of Hasidism. Born apparently south of the [[Prut]], in the northern frontier of [[Moldavia]], he earned a reputation as a [[Baal Shem]], \"Master of the Name\". These were common folk healers who employed mysticism, amulets and incantations at their trade. Little is known for certain on ben Eliezer. Though no scholar, he was sufficiently learned to become notable in the communal hall of study and marry into the rabbinic elite, his wife being the divorced sister of a rabbi; in his later years he was wealthy and famous, as attested by contemporary chronicles. Apart from that, most is derived from Hasidic hagiographic accounts. These claim that as a boy he was recognized by one \"Rabbi Adam Baal Shem Tov\" who entrusted him with great secrets of the [[Torah]] passed in his illustrious family for centuries. The Besht later spent a decade in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] as a hermit, where he was visited by the Biblical prophet [[Ahijah the Shilonite]] who taught him more. At the age of thirty-six, he was granted heavenly permission to reveal himself as a great kabbalist and miracle worker.\n\nBy the 1740s, it is verified that he relocated to the town of [[Medzhybizh]] and became recognized and popular in all [[Podolia]] and beyond. It is well attested that he did emphasize several known kabbalistic concepts, formulating a teaching of his own to some degree. The Besht stressed the immanence of God and his presence in the material world, and that therefore, physical acts, such as eating, have actual influence on the spiritual sphere and may serve to hasten the achievement of communion with the divine (''devekut''). He was known to pray ecstatically and with great [[kavanah|intention]], again in order to provide channels for the [[Ohr|divine light]] to flow into the earthly realm. The Besht stressed the importance of joy and contentment in the worship of God, rather than the abstinence and self-mortification deemed essential to become a pious mystic, and of fervent and vigorous prayer as a means of spiritual elation instead of severe aestheticism<ref name=\"Ros1\"/>, but many of his immediate disciples reverted in part to the older doctrines, especially in disavowing sexual pleasure even in marital relations.<ref>David Biale, ''The Lust for Asceticism in the Ha-sidic Movement'', in: Jonathan Magonet, ''Jewish Explorations of Sexuality''. Oxford University Press (1995). pp. 53-55.</ref>\n\nIn that, the \"Besht\" laid the foundation for a popular movement, offering a far less rigorous course for the masses to gain a significant religious experience. And yet, he remained the guide of a small society of elitists, in the tradition of former kabbalists, and never led a large public as his successors did. While many later figures cited him as the inspiration behind the full-fledged Hasidic doctrine, the Besht himself did not practice it in his lifetime.<ref name=\"Ros1\">Moshe Rosman, ''[https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Baal_Shem_Tov Ba\u2018al Shem Tov]'', [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]].</ref>\n\n===Consolidation===\n[[File:\u0413\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0456\u043b\u044c.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hannopil]], early Hasidic town and burial place of [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch]], architect of the Hasidic movement, near his court in Hasidism's second centre [[Mezeritch]], [[Volhynia]]]]\n[[File:Korets vlasenko.jpg|thumb|right|[[Korets]], [[Volhynia]]. The first works of Hasidic thought, as Hasidism became a popular movement, were printed in Koretz, beginning with ''Toldot Yaakov Yosef'' by [[Jacob Joseph of Polonne]] in 1780]]\n[[File:Shivchei besht.jpg|thumb|right|''Shivchei HaBesht'' (Praises of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]), the first compilation of Hasidic hagiographic storytelling, was printed from manuscripts in 1815]]\nIsrael ben Eliezer gathered a considerable following, drawing to himself disciples from far away. They were largely of elitist background, yet adopted the populist approach of their master. The most prominent was Rabbi [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch|Dov Ber]] the ''[[Maggid]]'' (preacher). He succeeded the former upon his death, though other important acolytes, mainly [[Jacob Joseph of Polonne]], did not accept his leadership. Establishing himself in [[Mezhirichi]], the Maggid turned to greatly elaborate the Besht's rudimentary ideas and institutionalize the nascent circle into an actual movement. Ben Eliezer and his acolytes used the very old and common epithet ''[[hasidim]]'', \"pious\"; in the latter third of the 18th century, a clear differentiation arose between that sense of the word and what was at first described as \"New Hasidism\", propagated to a degree by the Maggid and especially his successors.<ref name=\"Ros\">Moshe Rosman, ''Founder of Hasidism: A Quest for the Historical Ba'al Shem Tov''. University of California Press (1996). pp. 37-38.</ref>\n\nDoctrine coalesced as Jacob Joseph, Dov Ber and the latter's disciple Rabbi [[Elimelech of Lizhensk]] composed the three magna opera of early Hasidism, respectively: the 1780 ''Toldot Ya'akov Yosef'', the 1781 ''Maggid d'varav le-Ya'akov'' and the 1788 ''No'am Elimelekh''. Other books were also published. Their new teaching had many aspects. The importance of devotion in prayer was stressed to such degree that many waited beyond the prescribed time to properly prepare; the Besht's recommendation to \"elevate and sanctify\" impure thoughts rather than simply repress them during the service was expanded by Dov Ber into an entire precept, depicting prayer as a mechanism to transform thoughts and feelings from a primal to a higher state in a manner parallel to the unfolding of the ''[[Sephirot]]''. But the most important was the notion of the ''Tzaddiq'' \u2013 later designated by the general rabbinic honorific [[Rebbe#The hasidic rebbe|''Admor'' (our master, teacher and rabbi) or by the colloquial ''Rebbe'']] \u2013 the Righteous One, the mystic who was able to elate and achieve communion with the divine, but unlike kabbalists past, did not practice it in secret, but as leader of the masses. He was able to bring down prosperity and guidance from the higher ''Sephirot'', and the common people who could not attain such a state themselves would achieve it by \"clinging\" to and obeying him. The ''Tzaddiq'' served as a bridge between the spiritual realm and the ordinary folk, as well as a simple, understandable embodiment of the esoteric teachings of the sect, which were still beyond the reach of most just as old-style Kabbalah before.\n\nThe various Hasidic ''Tzaddiqim'', mainly the Maggid's disciples, spread across Eastern Europe with each gathering adherents among the people and learned acolytes who could be initiated as leaders. The Righteous' \"courts\" in which they resided, attended by their followers to receive blessing and council, became the institutional centers of Hasidism, serving as its branches and organizational core. Slowly, various rites emerged in them, like the Sabbath ''[[Tish (Hasidic celebration)|Tisch]]'' or \"table\", in which the Righteous would hand out food scraps from their meals, considered blessed by the touch of ones imbued with godly Light during their mystical ascensions.<ref>Dynner, pp. 34-39, 42.</ref> Another potent institution was the ''[[Shtibel]]'', the private prayer gatherings opened by adherents in every town which served as a recruiting mechanism. The ''Shtibel'' differed from the established synagogues and study halls, allowing their members greater freedom to worship when they pleased and also serving recreational and welfare purposes. Combined with its simplified message, more appealing to the common man, its honed organizational framework accounted for the exponential growth of Hasidic ranks.<ref>{{cite book|title=Stampfer, Why Hasidism Spreaf|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem|year=|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=203\u2013207}}</ref> Having ousted the old communal model and replaced it with a less-hierarchical structure and more individually-oriented religiosity, Hasidism was in fact the first great modern \u2013 albeit not modernist; its self-understanding was grounded in a traditional mindset \u2013 Jewish movement.<ref>For exampe: Murray Rosman, ''[https://www.academia.edu/19681639 Hasidism \u2013 Traditional Modernization]'', Simon Dubnow Institute Yearbook 6 (2007).</ref>\n\nFrom its original base in [[Podolia]] and [[Volhynia]], the movement was rapidly disseminated during the Maggid's lifetime and after his 1772 death. Twenty or so of Dov Ber's prime disciples each brought it to a different region, and their own successors followed: [[Aharon of Karlin (I)]], [[Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk]] and [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] were the emissaries to the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] in the far north, while [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]] headed to [[Chernobyl]] in the east and [[Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev]] remained nearby. Elimelech of Lizhensk, his brother [[Zusha of Hanipol]] and [[Yisroel Hopsztajn]] established the sect in [[Polish Crown|Poland proper]]. Vitebsk and [[Abraham Kalisker]] later led a small ascension to the [[Land of Israel]], establishing a Hasidic presence in the [[Galilee]].\n\n{{Anchor|Opposition}}The spread of Hasidism also incurred organized opposition. Rabbi [[Elijah of Vilna|Elijah of Vilnius]], one of the greatest authorities of the generation and a ''hasid'' and secret kabbalist of the old style, was deeply suspicious of their emphasis on mysticism rather than mundane Torah study, threat to established communal authority, resemblance to the Sabbatean movement and other details he considered infractions. In April 1772, he and the Vilnius community wardens launched a systematic campaign against the sect, placing an [[herem (censure)|anathema]] upon them, banishing their leaders and sending letters denouncing the movement. Further excommunication followed in [[Brody]] and other cities. In 1781, during a second round of hostilities, the books of Jacob Joseph were burned in Vilnius. Another cause for strife emerged when the Hasidim adopted the [[Lurianic]] prayer rite, which they revised somewhat to [[Nusach Sefard]]; the first edition in Eastern Europe was printed in 1781 and received approbation from the anti-Hasidic scholars of Brody, but the sect quickly embraced the Kabbalah-infused tome and popularized it, making it their symbol. Their rivals, named ''[[Misnagdim]]'', \"opponents\" (a generic term which acquired an independent meaning as Hasidism grew stronger) soon accused them of abandoning the traditional [[Nusach Ashkenaz]].\n\nIn 1798, Opponents made accusations of espionage against [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] and he was imprisoned by the Russian government for two months. Excoriatory polemics were printed and anathemas declared in the entire region. But Elijah's death in 1797 denied the ''Misnagdim'' their powerful leader. In 1804, [[Alexander I of Russia]] allowed independent prayer groups to operate, the chief vessel through which the movement spread from town to town. The failure to eradicate Hasidism, which acquired a clear self-identity in the struggle and greatly expanded throughout it, convinced its adversaries to adopt a more passive method of resistance, as exemplified by [[Chaim of Volozhin]]. The growing conservatism of the new movement \u2013 which at some occasions drew close to Kabbalah-based antinomian phraseology, as did the Sabbateans, but never crossed the threshold and remained thoroughly observant \u2013 and the rise of common enemies slowly brought a rapprochement, and by the second half of the 19th century both sides basically considered each other legitimate.\n\nThe turn of the century saw several prominent new, fourth-generation ''tzaddiqim''. Upon Elimelech's death in the [[Partitions of Poland|now-partitioned Poland]], his place in [[Habsburg Galicia]] was assumed by [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], who was deeply hostile to the modernization the Austrian rulers attempted to force on the traditional Jewish society (though this same process also allowed his sect to flourish, as communal authority was severely weakened). The rabbi of Rimanov hearkened the alliance the hasidim would form with the most conservative elements of the Jewish public. In Central Poland, the new leader was Jacob Isaac Horowiz, the \"[[Seer of Lublin]]\", who was of a particularly populist bent and appealed to the common folk with miracle working and little strenuous spiritual demands. The Seer's senior acolyte, [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Jacob Isaac Rabinovitz]] the \"Holy Jew\" of [[Przysucha]], gradually dismissed his mentor's approach as overly vulgar and adopted a more aesthetic and scholarly approach, virtually without theurgy to the masses. The Holy Jew's \"Przysucha School\" was continued by his successor [[Simcha Bunim]] and especially the reclusive, morose [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]]. The most controversial fourth-generation ''tzaddiq'' was the Podolia-based [[Nachman of Breslov]], who denounced his peers for becoming too institutionalized, much like the old establishment their predecessors challenged decades before, and espoused an anti-rationalist, pessimistic spiritual teaching, very different from the prevalent stress on joy.\n\n[[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia]] in 1812 promised to bring the first [[Jewish emancipation]] to the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Hasidic Rebbes in Poland and Russia were divided on the issue, between supporting western freedom from imperial antisemitic decrees, to regarding Napoleon as the opening to heresy and agnosticism. According to Hasidic legend, the fate of Napoleon was decided not on the battlefields, but between the theurgic prayers and deeds of the Hasidic Rebbes.\n\n===Routinization===\n[[File:Moshe Teitelbaum.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moses Teitelbaum of Ujhel]] spread Hasidism in Hungary, where non-Hasidic Orthodox [[Oberlander Jews]] remained, without Lithuania's [[Mitnagdic]] opposition to Hasidism]]\n[[File:Menachem Mendel from Kock grave.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Grave of the radical [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk]], the culmination of [[Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz|Peshischa]] introspection, that saught to renew Hasidism from conformity]]\n[[File:Sadigura rebbe's palace.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Palace of the [[Ruzhin (Hasidic dynasty)|Ruzhin dynasty]] in [[Sadhora]], whose Rebbes conducted themselves royally]]\nThe opening of the 19th century saw the Hasidic sect transformed. Once a rising force outside the establishment, the ''tzaddiqim'' now became an important and often dominant power in most of Eastern Europe. The slow process of encroachment, which mostly begun with forming an independent ''Shtibel'' and culminated in the Righteous becoming an authority figure (either alongside or above the official rabbinate) for the entire community, overwhelmed many towns even in ''Misnagdic'' stronghold of Lithuania, far more so in [[Congress Poland]] and the vast majority in Podolia, Volhynia and Galicia. It began to make inroads into [[Bukovina]], [[Bessarabia]] and the westernmost frontier of autochthonic pre-WWII Hasidism, in [[Unterlander Jews|northeastern Hungary]], where the Seer's disciple [[Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)|Moses Teitelbaum (I)]] was appointed in [[Ujhely]].\n\nLess than three generations after the Besht's death, the sect grew to encompass hundreds of thousands by 1830. As a mass movement, a clear stratification emerged between the court's functionaries and permanent residents (''yoshvim'', \"sitters\"), the devoted followers who would often visit the Righteous on Sabbath, and the large public which prayed at Sefard Rite synagogues and was minimally affiliated.\n\nAll this was followed by a more conservative approach and power bickering among the Righteous. Since the Maggid's death, none could claim the overall leadership. Among the several dozens active, each ruled over his own turf, and local traditions and customs began to emerge in the various courts which developed their own identity. The high mystical tension typical of a new movement subsided, and was soon replaced by more hierarchical, orderly atmosphere.\n\nThe most important aspect of the routinization Hasidism underwent was the adoption of dynasticism. The first to claim legitimacy by right of descent from the Besht was his grandson, [[Boruch of Medzhybizh]], appointed 1782. He held a lavish court with [[Hershel of Ostropol]] as jester, and demanded the other Righteous acknowledge his supremacy. Upon the death of [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]] of [[Chernobyl]], his son [[Mordechai Twersky]] succeeded him. The principle was conclusively affirmed in the great dispute after Liadi's demise in 1813: his senior acolyte [[Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye]] was defeated by his son, [[Dovber Schneuri]], whose offspring [[Chabad|retained the title for 181 years]].\n\nBy the 1860s, virtually all courts were dynastic. Rather than single ''tzaddiqim'' with followings of their own, each sect would command a base of rank-and-file hasidim attached not just to the individual leader, but to the bloodline and the court's unique attributes. [[Israel Friedman of Ruzhyn]] insisted on royal splendour, resided in a palace and his six sons all inherited some of his followers. With the constraints of maintaining their gains replacing the dynamism of the past, the Righteous or ''Rebbe''s/''Admorim'' also silently retreated from the overt, radical mysticism of their predecessors. While populist miracle working for the masses remained a key theme in many dynasties, a new type of \"Rebbe-Rabbi\" emerged, one who was both a completely traditional ''[[halakhic]]'' authority as well as a spiritualist. The tension with the ''Misnagdim'' subsided significantly.<ref name=\"RAD\">Benjamin Brown, [https://www.academia.edu/4900677/ The Two Faces of Religious Radicalism - Orthodox Zealotry and Holy Sinning in Nineteenth Century Hasidism in Hungary and Galicia].</ref><ref>Stephen Sharot, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386127 Hasidism and the Routinization of Charisma], Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1980</ref>\n\nBut it was an external threat, more than anything else, that mended relations. While traditional Jewish society remained well entrenched in backward Eastern Europe, reports of the rapid acculturation and religious laxity in the West troubled both camps. When the ''[[Haskalah]]'', the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], appeared in Galicia and Congress Poland in the 1810s, it was soon perceived as a dire threat. The ''maskilim'' themselves detested Hasidism as an anti-rationalist and barbaric phenomenon, as did Western Jews of all shades, including the most right-wing Orthodox such as Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].<ref>[[David Ellenson]], ''Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer and the Creation of a Modern Jewish Orthodoxy''. University of Alabama Press, 1990. p. 44.</ref> In Galicia especially, hostility towards it defined the ''Haskalah'' to a large extent, from the staunchly observant Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]] and [[Joseph Perl]] to the radical anti-Talmudists like [[Osias Schorr]]. The Enlightened, who [[Revival of the Hebrew language|revived Hebrew grammar]], often mocked their rivals' lack of eloquence in the language. While a considerable proportion of the ''Misnagdim'' were not adverse to at least some of the ''Haskala'''s goals, the ''Rebbe''s were unremittingly hostile.\n\nThe most distinguished Hasidic leader in Galicia in the era was [[Chaim Halberstam]], who combined talmudic erudition and the status of a major [[posek|decisor]] with his function as ''tzaddiq''. He symbolized the new era, brokering peace between the small Hasidic sect in Hungary to its opponents. In that country, where modernization and assimilation were much more prevalent than in the East, the local Righteous joined forces with those now termed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] against the rising liberals. Rabbi [[Moses Sofer]] of [[Pressburg]], while no friend to Hasidism, tolerated it as he combated the forces which sought modernization of the Jews; a generation later, in the 1860s, the ''Rebbe''s and the zealot ultra-Orthodox [[Hillel Lichtenstein]] allied closely.\n\nAround the mid-19th century, over a hundred dynastic courts related by marriage were the main religious power in the territory enclosed between Hungary, former Lithuania, Prussia and inner Russia, with considerable presence in the former two. In Central Poland, the pragmatist, rationalist Przysucha school thrived: [[Yitzchak Meir Alter]] founded the [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|court of Ger]] in 1859, and in 1876 [[Jechiel Danziger]] established [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Alexander]]. In Galicia and Hungary, apart from Halberstam's House of [[Sanz]], [[Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov]]'s descendants each pursued a mystical approach in the dynasties of [[Zidichov (Hasidic dynasty)|Zidichov]], [[Komarno (Hasidic dynasty)|Komarno]] and so forth. In 1817, [[Sholom Rokeach]] became the first ''Rebbe'' of [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]]. At [[Bukovina]], the Hager line of [[Kosov (Hasidic dynasty)|Kosov]]-[[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]] was the largest court.\n\nThe ''Haskalah'' was always a minor force, but the [[Jewish national movements (disambiguation)|Jewish national movements]] which emerged in the 1880s, as well as Socialism, proved much more appealing to the young. Progressive strata condemned Hasidism as a primitive relic, strong, but doomed to disappear, as Eastern European Jewry underwent slow yet steady secularization. The gravity of the situation was attested to by the foundation of Hasidic [[yeshiva]]s (in the modern, boarding school-equivalent sense) to enculturate the young and preserve their loyalty: The first was established at [[Nowy Wi\u015bnicz]] by Rabbi [[Shlomo Halberstam (I)]] in 1881. These institutions were originally utilized by the ''Misnagdim'' to inoculate their youth from Hasidic influence, but now, the latter faced a similar crisis. One of the most contentious issues in this respect was [[Zionism]]; the Ruzhin dynasties were quite favourably disposed toward it, while Hungarian and Galician courts reviled it.\n\n===Calamity and renaissance===\n[[File:Jews of Khorostkiv (western Ukraine), 1917.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jews in Ukraine 1917. [[World War I]] and [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet antisemitism]] after 1917 dissolved Hasidic heartlands, causing migration from villages to cities. Various Hasidic courts relocated to [[History of the Jews in Poland|Warsaw]] and [[History of the Jews in Vienna|Vienna]]]]\n[[File:Drohobycz, Rebe Aharon Rokach.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belzer]] Rebbe [[Aharon Rokeach]] (depicted 1934), who was hidden from the Nazis and smuggled out of the Holocaust inferno by his disciples]]\nOutside pressure was mounting in the early 20th century. In 1912, many Hasidic leaders partook in the creation of the [[World Agudath Israel|Agudas Israel]] party, a political instrument intended to safeguard what was now named [[Orthodox Judaism]] even in the relatively traditional East; the more hard-line dynasties, mainly Galician and Hungarian, opposed the Aguda as too lenient. Mass immigration to America, urbanization, [[World War I]] and the subsequent [[Russian Civil War]] uprooted the ''[[shtetl]]''s in which the local Jews lived for centuries and were the bedrock of Hasidism. In the new [[Soviet Union]], civil equality first achieved and a harsh repression of religion caused a rapid secularization. Few remaining Hasidim, especially of [[Chabad]], continued to practice underground for decades. In the new states of the [[Interbellum]] era, the process was only somewhat slower. On the eve of [[World War II]], strictly observant Jews were estimated to constitute no more than a third of the total Jewish population in Poland, the world's most Orthodox country.<ref>Jaff Schatz, ''Jews and the Communist Movement in Interwar Poland'', in: ''Dark Times, Dire Decisions: Jews and Communism''. Oxford University Press (2005). p. 36.</ref> While the Rebbes still had a vast base of support, it was aging and declining.\n\nThe [[Holocaust]] hit the Hasidim, easily identifiable and almost unable to disguise themselves among the larger populace due to cultural insularity, particularly hard. Hundreds of leaders perished with their flock, while the flight of many notable ones as their followers were being exterminated \u2013 especially [[Aharon Rokeach]] of Belz and [[Joel Teitelbaum]] of Satmar \u2013 elicited bitter recrimination. In the immediate post-war years, the entire movement seemed to teeter on the precipice of oblivion. In Israel, the United States, and Western Europe, the survivors' children were at best becoming [[Modern Orthodox]]. While a century earlier the ''Haskalah'' depicted it as a medieval, malicious power, now it was so weakened that the popular cultural image was sentimental and romantic, what [[Joseph Dan]] termed \"Frumkinian Hasidism\" for it began with the short stories of [[Michael Levi Rodkinson]] (Frumkin). [[Martin Buber]] was the major contributor to this trend, portraying the sect as a model of a healthy folk consciousness. \"Frumkinian\" style was very influential, later inspiring the so-called \"[[Neo-Hasidism]]\", and also utterly ahistorical.<ref name=\"Dan\">Joseph Dan, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1396266 A Bow to Frumkinian Hasidism]'', Modern Judaism, Volume 11, pp. 175-193.</ref>\n\nYet, the movement proved more resilient than expected. Talented and charismatic Hasidic masters emerged, who reinvigorated their following and drew new crowds. In New York, the Satmar Rebbe [[Joel Teitelbaum]] formulated a fiercely anti-Zionist [[Holocaust theology]] and founded an insular, self-sufficient community which attracted many immigrants from Greater Hungary; already by 1961, 40% of families were newcomers.<ref>Israel Rubin. ''Satmar: Two Generations of an Urban Island''. P. Lang (1997). p. 42</ref> [[Yisrael Alter]] of [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]] created robust institutions, fortified his court's standing in ''Agudas Israel'' and held ''tisch'' every week for 29 years. He halted the hemorrhage of his followers and retrieved many Litvaks (the contemporary, less adverse epithet for ''Misnagdim'') and [[Religious Zionists]] whose parents were Gerrer Hasidim before the war. Chaim Meir Hager similarly restored [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]]. Moses Isaac Gewirtzman founded the new [[Pshevorsk (Hasidic dynasty)]] in [[Antwerp]].\n\nThe most explosive growth was experienced in [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], whose head [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] adopted a modern (he and his disciples ceased wearing the customary [[Shtreimel]]) and outreach-centered orientation. At a time when most Orthodox and Hasidim in particular rejected proselytization, he turned his sect into a mechanism devoted almost solely to it, blurring the difference between actual Hasidim and loosely affiliated supporters until researchers could scarcely define it as a regular Hasidic group. Another phenomenon was the revival of [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], which remained without an acting ''Tzaddiq'' since the rebellious [[Rebbe Nachman]]'s 1810 death. Its complex, existentialist philosophy drew many to it.\n\nHigh fertility rates, increasing tolerance and [[multiculturalism]] on behalf of surrounding society, and the great wave of [[Baal teshuva movement|newcomers to Orthodox Judaism]] which began in the 1970s all cemented the movement's status as very much alive and thriving.
