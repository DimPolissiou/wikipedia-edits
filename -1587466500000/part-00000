{"title_page": "Elections in Belize", "text_new": "{{Politics of Belize}}\n'''Elections in Belize''' are the duly held elections held at various levels of government in the nation of [[Belize]].\n\n== Dissolving elected bodies  ==\n\n=== The Legislature ===\nDissolving the [[National Assembly of Belize]] is the prerogative of the [[List of Governors-General of Belize|Governor General of Belize]], currently Sir [[Colville Young]]. Under sections 84 and 85 of the [[Constitution of Belize|Constitution]], the Governor General can at any time dissolve or [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] the Assembly under the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Belize]], with the caveat that a general election must be called within three months of such dissolution, unless the Governor General sees no reason to do so.\n\n=== City and town councils ===\nCity and town councils dissolve on the last Sunday of February in every third year, with the election called for the first Wednesday in March in every third year.\n\n=== Example ===\n\n[[Amandala]] columnist Henry Gordon, refuting a statement by former Prime Minister [[Said Musa]], laid out the boundaries under which national elections can be called in a recent article. Musa had said that elections would be held by March 2008 and that he would not take an election into \"the extra three months\", as he claimed Gordon had supposed. Gordon responded that there is no such provision in the Constitution and that Musa was being obscure on the matter.\n\nMr. Musa had requested a dissolution of the National Assembly on January 24, 2003, 4 years, 7 months and 4 days after the [[1998 Belizean legislative election|last general election, August 27, 1998]]. That dissolution was granted by Young on February 4, 2003, at which time the Assembly stood dissolved while preparations were made for [[2003 Belizean legislative election|elections on March 5, 2003]]. The PUP won the elections, with Musa continuing as Prime Minister. But his term did not begin, says Gordon, until the first meeting of the new National Assembly, on April 4, 2003. Since a National Assembly must continue for five years from this first sitting under Section 84, subsec. 2, the current assembly shall stand dissolved- unless sooner dissolved- on April 3, 2008. It follows that the latest a general election can be called after that date is July 3, 2008. Mr. Musa ended speculation over the date of general elections by calling them for February 7, 2008.\n* [http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=6066 Gordon's full statement]\n\n== General elections ==\nOn the national level Belize elects a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] called the [[National Assembly of Belize|National Assembly]]. The more powerful lower chamber, the [[House of Representatives of Belize|House of Representatives]], currently has 31 members elected for terms up to five years in single-seat [[Constituencies of Belize|constituencies]] on a [[Plurality voting system|first past the post]] basis. Members of the Belize House are called \"area representatives\" and are accorded the title of \"The Honourable.\" \n\n===Parties===\n\nBelize has a [[two-party system]], which means that there are two dominant [[political parties]]. The current two-party system, which has been in place since the pre-independence [[1974 Belizean general election|1974 election]], consists of the centre-left [[People's United Party]] (PUP) and the centre-right [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP). It has been extremely difficult for anybody to achieve electoral success as an independent or under the banner of any other party. [[Philip Goldson]], a longtime UDP area representative who ran under the [[National Alliance for Belizean Rights]] banner in 1993, is the only successful candidate outside the two major parties since independence.\n\nOnly once in recent general elections has an [[Independent politician|independent]] candidate received more votes than a major party candidate. [[Wilfred Elrington]], running independently in 2003, finished second in front of the UDP candidate in the [[Pickstock (Belize House constituency)|Pickstock]] constituency. Like Goldson, Elrington also had a longstanding prior relationship with the UDP. He later rejoined the UDP and won election to the Belize House from Pickstock in 2008. \n\nDespite the overall abysmal record of independent candidates and third parties, the political process in Belize still sees its fair share of well-intentioned people stepping forward to serve the nation.\n\n===Process===\n\nBoth major Belizean political parties nominate House candidates via a [[preselection]] process similar to those used in other [[Westminster system]]s. These nominees are called \"standard bearers.\" In most cases incumbent House members retain standard bearer status for their party, while the opposition party in a given constituency often nominates its standard bearer months or even years in advance of a general election. Standard bearers are considered party officials responsible for overall political organization in their particular constituencies regardless of whether they currently serve in the Belize House or not.\n\nMembers of the 12-seat upper house of the National Assembly, the [[Senate of Belize|Senate]], are officially appointed by the [[Governor-General of Belize]]. In current practice the majority party in the House appoints six senators and the minority party appoints three. The remaining three senators are appointed by nonpartisan groups.\n\nThe last Belizean general election was held on 4 November 2015.<ref name=\"15date\">Trujillo, Renee. [http://lovefm.com/2015/09/28/prime-minister-announces-date-for-general-elections/ \"Prime Minister Announces Date for General Elections\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930161815/http://lovefm.com/2015/09/28/prime-minister-announces-date-for-general-elections/ |date=2015-09-30 }}, [[LOVE FM (Belize)|LOVE FM]], 28 September 2015. (accessed 29 September 2015)</ref> The next general election must be held by late 2020.\n\n=== Constituencies ===\n{{Main|Constituencies of Belize}}\n\nSince 2008 the six [[Districts of Belize]] have been subdivided into 31 constituencies. Constituency breakdown by district is as follows:\n\n*[[Belize District]]: 13 (including 10 in [[Belize City]])\n*[[Cayo District]]: 6\n*[[Corozal District]]: 4\n*[[Orange Walk District]]: 4\n*[[Stann Creek District]]: 2\n*[[Toledo District]]: 2\n\n== Municipal elections ==\nUnlike general elections which are held every five years or at the pleasure of the governor-general, by statute cities and towns hold municipal elections on the first Wednesday in March every third year. Belize has seven towns and two recognized cities, [[Belize City]] (since 1945) and [[Belmopan]] (since 2000). The seven settlements with town status are [[Benque Viejo del Carmen]], [[Corozal Town]], [[Dangriga]], [[Orange Walk Town]], [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]], [[San Ignacio, Belize|San Ignacio/Santa Elena]] and [[San Pedro Town]]. Smaller settlements hold elections independent of this schedule.\n\nBelize City, due to its size, carries greater representation and importance, with one mayor and ten councilors elected (previously nine individuals out of which the mayor was selected), as opposed to one mayor and six councilors for Belmopan and the towns. The two-party system is in effect here as well, but independents and third party candidates have of late been doing relatively well in local elections. The last municipal election was held on [[2015 Belizean municipal elections|4 March 2015]]. The next municipal election is tentatively scheduled for 7 March 2018.\n\n== By-elections and referendums ==\nThese types of elections are held on a less regular basis. [[By-elections]] are usually held to replace representatives either locally or nationally, who are lost during the course of their term for various reasons.\n\nReferendums are normally held on issues of local or national importance. Belize had never held a national referendum before 2008, though one has consistently been demanded in order to settle the Guatemalan claim to Belize. Provisions have been made for a treaty to settle this claim to go to a referendum. In 1999, residents of Belmopan held a referendum to determine whether they would be responsible for their own affairs as a city; a majority voted yes, and Belmopan held its first City Council election less than a year later.\n\nPrime Minister Said Musa announced on 7 January 2008 a nonbinding [[2008 Belize referendum|national referendum]] would be held on the same date as general elections, asking the people of Belize to decide whether they wanted the country's upper house, the Senate, to be elected. The referendum passed with 61 percent of voters supporting an elected Senate.<ref name=\"08refer\">[http://www.elections.gov.bz/modules/wfdownloads/visit.php?cid=86&lid=214 Referendum Results 2008], [[Belize Elections and Boundaries Commission]].

Under sections 84 and 85 of the [[Constitution of Belize|Constitution]], the Governor General can at any time dissolve or [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]] the Assembly under the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Belize]], with the caveat that a general election must be called within three months of such dissolution, unless the Governor General sees no reason to do so.\n\n=== City and town councils ===\nCity and town councils dissolve on the last Sunday of February in every third year, with the election called for the first Wednesday in March in every third year.\n\n=== Example ===\n\n[[Amandala]] columnist Henry Gordon, refuting a statement by former Prime Minister [[Said Musa]], laid out the boundaries under which national elections can be called in a recent article. Musa had said that elections would be held by March 2008 and that he would not take an election into \"the extra three months\", as he claimed Gordon had supposed. Gordon responded that there is no such provision in the Constitution and that Musa was being obscure on the matter.\n\nMr. Musa had requested a dissolution of the National Assembly on January 24, 2003, 4 years, 7 months and 4 days after the [[1998 Belizean legislative election|last general election, August 27, 1998]]. That dissolution was granted by Young on February 4, 2003, at which time the Assembly stood dissolved while preparations were made for [[2003 Belizean legislative election|elections on March 5, 2003]]. The PUP won the elections, with Musa continuing as Prime Minister. But his term did not begin, says Gordon, until the first meeting of the new National Assembly, on April 4, 2003. Since a National Assembly must continue for five years from this first sitting under Section 84, subsec. 2, the current assembly shall stand dissolved- unless sooner dissolved- on April 3, 2008. It follows that the latest a general election can be called after that date is July 3, 2008. Mr. Musa ended speculation over the date of general elections by calling them for February 7, 2008.\n* [http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=6066 Gordon's full statement]\n\n== General elections ==\nOn the national level Belize elects a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] called the [[National Assembly of Belize|National Assembly]]. The more powerful lower chamber, the [[House of Representatives of Belize|House of Representatives]], currently has 31 members elected for terms up to five years in single-seat [[Constituencies of Belize|constituencies]] on a [[Plurality voting system|first past the post]] basis. Members of the Belize House are called \"area representatives\" and are accorded the title of \"The Honourable.\" \n\n===Parties===\n\nBelize has a [[two-party system]], which means that there are two dominant [[political parties]]. The current two-party system, which has been in place since the pre-independence [[1974 Belizean general election|1974 election]], consists of the centre-left [[People's United Party]] (PUP) and the centre-right [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP). It has been extremely difficult for anybody to achieve electoral success as an independent or under the banner of any other party. [[Philip Goldson]], a longtime UDP area representative who ran under the [[National Alliance for Belizean Rights]] banner in 1993, is the only successful candidate outside the two major parties since independence.\n\nOnly once in recent general elections has an [[Independent politician|independent]] candidate received more votes than a major party candidate. [[Wilfred Elrington]], running independently in 2003, finished second in front of the UDP candidate in the [[Pickstock (Belize House constituency)|Pickstock]] constituency. Like Goldson, Elrington also had a longstanding prior relationship with the UDP. He later rejoined the UDP and won election to the Belize House from Pickstock in 2008. \n\nDespite the overall abysmal record of independent candidates and third parties, the political process in Belize still sees its fair share of well-intentioned people stepping forward to serve the nation.\n\n===Process===\n\nBoth major Belizean political parties nominate House candidates via a [[preselection]] process similar to those used in other [[Westminster system]]s. These nominees are called \"standard bearers.\" In most cases incumbent House members retain standard bearer status for their party, while the opposition party in a given constituency often nominates its standard bearer months or even years in advance of a general election. Standard bearers are considered party officials responsible for overall political organization in their particular constituencies regardless of whether they currently serve in the Belize House or not.\n\nMembers of the 12-seat upper house of the National Assembly, the [[Senate of Belize|Senate]], are officially appointed by the [[Governor-General of Belize]]. In current practice the majority party in the House appoints six senators and the minority party appoints three. The remaining three senators are appointed by nonpartisan groups.\n\nThe last Belizean general election was held on 4 November 2015.<ref name=\"15date\">Trujillo, Renee. [http://lovefm.com/2015/09/28/prime-minister-announces-date-for-general-elections/ \"Prime Minister Announces Date for General Elections\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930161815/http://lovefm.com/2015/09/28/prime-minister-announces-date-for-general-elections/ |date=2015-09-30 }}, [[LOVE FM (Belize)|LOVE FM]], 28 September 2015. (accessed 29 September 2015)</ref> The next general election must be held by late 2020.\n\n=== Constituencies ===\n{{Main|Constituencies of Belize}}\n\nSince 2008 the six [[Districts of Belize]] have been subdivided into 31 constituencies. Constituency breakdown by district is as follows:\n\n*[[Belize District]]: 13 (including 10 in [[Belize City]])\n*[[Cayo District]]: 6\n*[[Corozal District]]: 4\n*[[Orange Walk District]]: 4\n*[[Stann Creek District]]: 2\n*[[Toledo District]]: 2\n\n== Municipal elections ==\nUnlike general elections which are held every five years or at the pleasure of the governor-general, by statute cities and towns hold municipal elections on the first Wednesday in March every third year. Belize has seven towns and two recognized cities, [[Belize City]] (since 1945) and [[Belmopan]] (since 2000). The seven settlements with town status are [[Benque Viejo del Carmen]], [[Corozal Town]], [[Dangriga]], [[Orange Walk Town]], [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]], [[San Ignacio, Belize|San Ignacio/Santa Elena]] and [[San Pedro Town]]. Smaller settlements hold elections independent of this schedule.\n\nBelize City, due to its size, carries greater representation and importance, with one mayor and ten councilors elected (previously nine individuals out of which the mayor was selected), as opposed to one mayor and six councilors for Belmopan and the towns. The two-party system is in effect here as well, but independents and third party candidates have of late been doing relatively well in local elections. The last municipal election was held on [[2015 Belizean municipal elections|4 March 2015]]. The next municipal election is tentatively scheduled for 7 March 2018.\n\n== By-elections and referendums ==\nThese types of elections are held on a less regular basis. [[By-elections]] are usually held to replace representatives either locally or nationally, who are lost during the course of their term for various reasons.\n\nReferendums are normally held on issues of local or national importance. Belize had never held a national referendum before 2008, though one has consistently been demanded in order to settle the Guatemalan claim to Belize. Provisions have been made for a treaty to settle this claim to go to a referendum. In 1999, residents of Belmopan held a referendum to determine whether they would be responsible for their own affairs as a city; a majority voted yes, and Belmopan held its first City Council election less than a year later.\n\nPrime Minister Said Musa announced on 7 January 2008 a nonbinding [[2008 Belize referendum|national referendum]] would be held on the same date as general elections, asking the people of Belize to decide whether they wanted the country's upper house, the Senate, to be elected. The referendum passed with 61 percent of voters supporting an elected Senate.<ref name=\"08refer\">[http://www.elections.gov.bz/modules/wfdownloads/visit.php?cid=86&lid=214 Referendum Results 2008], [[Belize Elections and Boundaries Commission]].

[[Nelson Glueck]] conducted the first archaeological survey on site in 1933 and modern day excavations commenced in 1989.{{sfn|Daviau|2003}}  No other research is known to have taken place between Glueck's survey and the start of modern excavations.  Tall Jawa underwent 6 seasons of research and excavations, first as part of the Madaba Plains Project and, after 1992, as the Tall Jawa excavation Project.  Lawrence T. Geraty (Project Director, Madaba Plains Project) was in charge of the excavations in 1989 and 1991 and Mich\u00e8le Daviau  oversaw them from 1992 to 1995.{{sfn|Daviau|2003}}\n\nArchaeological finds, including architecture and artefacts dating from the Iron Age (1100\u2013600 BC), have revealed information about the Kingdom of Ammon.  Some of the artefacts found on site have been retained by the Department of Antiquities of Jordan for the National Museum in Amman.  The remaining objects are either at [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] or in storage at the American Center for Oriental Research in Amman.{{sfn|Daviau|2002}}\n\nArchaeological research has revealed that the site was reoccupied 1200 years after the destruction of the Iron Age town, during the transition from the [[Byzantine]] to the [[Umayyad]] period.{{sfn|Daviau|2009}}\n\n==Archaeological finds==\n[[File:Tall Jawa Amman Jordan.jpg|thumb|Aspect of the Tall Jawa archaeological site in Jordan]]\nExcavations and research in 1989, 1991 and 1992\u201395, uncovered Iron Age settlements at Tall Jawa dating from 1100 to 600 BC. \nThe earliest settlement on site dates back to the Iron Age I period (1100-900 BC). After the destruction of the Iron Age I village, excavations revealed the existence of a fortification wall and a multi-chambered gate dating to mid-late Iron Age II.{{sfn|Daviau|2003}} \nThe majority of the ceramic material found date primarily to Iron Age II, putting the site within the range of Iron Age II residential towns. Items excavated include artefacts of daily life such as flasks, jars and ground stone tools, jewellery, figurative objects, coins, seals and even marine shells.{{sfn|Daviau|2002}}\n\nThe presence of pottery [[sherd]]s from the Byzantine period suggested the reoccupation of the site during the Late Antique period.  Building 600, a two-storey house, was used in the Early Islamic Period and abandoned thereafter.{{sfn|Daviau|2009}} Pottery, mould-made lamps, glass, a small coin hoard and mosaic pavements were amongst the artefacts and architectural elements found in or near the building.  Research on this building and the material culture attached to it has made a contribution to our understanding and knowledge of village life during and after the Islamic conquests in Central Transjordan, as well as the overall seventh to eighth century Christian\u2013Islamic transition.{{sfn|Daviau|2009}}\n\nThe zenith of Tall Jawa can be traced to during the period of the [[Assyrian Empire]], according to evidence of ceramic artefacts that are more advanced and of higher status compared to others at the site.{{sfn|Daviau|2003}}\n\n[[File:Tall_Jawa.jpg|alt=|450x450px|Tall Jawa]]\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{citation |last=Daviau |first=Mich\u00e8le |year=2003 |title=Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan |volume=I: The Iron Age Town |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |issn=1566-2055 |isbn=978-9004130128}}\n*{{citation |last=Daviau |first=Mich\u00e8le |year=2002 |title=Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan |volume=II: The Iron Age Artefacts |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |issn= |isbn=978-9004123632}}\n*{{citation |last=Daviau |first=Mich\u00e8le |year=2009 |title=Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan |volume=IV: The Early Islamic House |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |issn= |isbn=978-9004175525}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://moses.creighton.edu/new/Jawa/site.html Description of the Jawa site by Creighton University]\n* [http://www.tourism.jo/en/ Description Department of Tourism and Antiquities Jordan]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140413201708/http://acorjordan.org/index.php/en Description of the American Center for Oriental Research in Amman, Jordan]\n*[https://acor.digitalrelab.com/?s=file=222523 Tall Jawa] from [https://www.acorjordan.org/ the American Center of Oriental Research] Photo Archive.\n\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Jordan]]\n[[Category:Iron Age sites in Asia]]\n[[Category:Tells|Jawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Iron Age village in central Jordan|the Early Bronze Age proto-urban site in Jordan's basalt desert|Jawa, Jordan}}\n{{Infobox ancient site\n  |name = Tall Jawa\n  |native_name = \n  |alternate_name = \n  |image = \n  |alt = \n  |caption = \n  |map_type = Jordan\n  |map_alt = \n  |map_size = 250\n  |location = [[Jordan]]\n  |region = [[Amman Governorate]]\n  |coordinates = {{coord|31.857470|35.931608|display=inline}}\n  |type = \n  |part_of = \n  |length = \n  |width = \n  |area = \n  |height = \n  |builder = \n  |material = \n  |built = \n  |abandoned = \n  |epochs = \n  |cultures = [[Ammon|Ammonite]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]]\n\n  |dependency_of = \n  |occupants = \n  |event = \n  |excavations = \n  |archaeologists = \n  |condition = \n  |ownership = \n  |management = \n  |public_access = \n  |website = \n  |notes = \n}}\n'''Tall Jawa''' is an archaeological and historical site in central Jordan.\n\nExcavations and research have revealed the remains of an [[Iron Age]] village of the ancient [[Kingdom of Ammon]].{{sfn|Daviau|2003}}  A two-storey house of the early Islamic period was also found, providing insight of the seventh to eighth century transition from Christianity to Islam in Central Transjordan.{{sfn|Daviau|2009}}  Today Tall Jawa stands as a ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]'' \u2014 a mound of ruins \u2014 overlooking the [[Madaba]] Plain.

[[Nelson Glueck]] conducted the first archaeological survey on site in 1933 and modern day excavations commenced in 1989.{{sfn|Daviau|2003}}  No other research is known to have taken place between Glueck's survey and the start of modern excavations.  Tall Jawa underwent 6 seasons of research and excavations, first as part of the Madaba Plains Project and, after 1992, as the Tall Jawa excavation Project.  Lawrence T. Geraty (Project Director, Madaba Plains Project) was in charge of the excavations in 1989 and 1991 and Mich\u00e8le Daviau  oversaw them from 1992 to 1995.{{sfn|Daviau|2003}}\n\nArchaeological finds, including architecture and artefacts dating from the Iron Age (1100\u2013600 BC), have revealed information about the Kingdom of Ammon.  Some of the artefacts found on site have been retained by the Department of Antiquities of Jordan for the National Museum in Amman.  The remaining objects are either at [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] or in storage at the American Center for Oriental Research in Amman.{{sfn|Daviau|2002}}\n\nArchaeological research has revealed that the site was reoccupied 1200 years after the destruction of the Iron Age town, during the transition from the [[Byzantine]] to the [[Umayyad]] period.{{sfn|Daviau|2009}}\n\n==Archaeological finds==\n[[File:Tall Jawa Amman Jordan.jpg|thumb|Aspect of the Tall Jawa archaeological site in Jordan]]\nExcavations and research in 1989, 1991 and 1992\u201395, uncovered Iron Age settlements at Tall Jawa dating from 1100 to 600 BC. \nThe earliest settlement on site dates back to the Iron Age I period (1100-900 BC). After the destruction of the Iron Age I village, excavations revealed the existence of a fortification wall and a multi-chambered gate dating to mid-late Iron Age II.{{sfn|Daviau|2003}} \nThe majority of the ceramic material found date primarily to Iron Age II, putting the site within the range of Iron Age II residential towns. Items excavated include artefacts of daily life such as flasks, jars and ground stone tools, jewellery, figurative objects, coins, seals and even marine shells.{{sfn|Daviau|2002}}\n\nThe presence of pottery [[sherd]]s from the Byzantine period suggested the reoccupation of the site during the Late Antique period.  Building 600, a two-storey house, was used in the Early Islamic Period and abandoned thereafter.{{sfn|Daviau|2009}} Pottery, mould-made lamps, glass, a small coin hoard and mosaic pavements were amongst the artefacts and architectural elements found in or near the building.  Research on this building and the material culture attached to it has made a contribution to our understanding and knowledge of village life during and after the Islamic conquests in Central Transjordan, as well as the overall seventh to eighth century Christian\u2013Islamic transition.{{sfn|Daviau|2009}}\n\nThe zenith of Tall Jawa can be traced to during the period of the [[Assyrian Empire]], according to evidence of ceramic artefacts that are more advanced and of higher status compared to others at the site.{{sfn|Daviau|2003}}\n\n[[File:Tall_Jawa.jpg|alt=|450x450px|Tall Jawa]]\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{citation |last=Daviau |first=Mich\u00e8le |year=2003 |title=Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan |volume=I: The Iron Age Town |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |issn=1566-2055 |isbn=978-9004130128}}\n*{{citation |last=Daviau |first=Mich\u00e8le |year=2002 |title=Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan |volume=II: The Iron Age Artefacts |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |issn= |isbn=978-9004123632}}\n*{{citation |last=Daviau |first=Mich\u00e8le |year=2009 |title=Excavations at Tall Jawa, Jordan |volume=IV: The Early Islamic House |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |issn= |isbn=978-9004175525}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://moses.creighton.edu/new/Jawa/site.html Description of the Jawa site by Creighton University]\n* [http://www.tourism.jo/en/ Description Department of Tourism and Antiquities Jordan]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140413201708/http://acorjordan.org/index.php/en Description of the American Center for Oriental Research in Amman, Jordan]\n*[https://acor.digitalrelab.com/?s=file=222523 Tall Jawa] from [https://www.acorjordan.org/ the American Center of Oriental Research].\n\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Jordan]]\n[[Category:Iron Age sites in Asia]]\n[[Category:Tells|Jawa]]\n", "name_user": "Jackie.salzinger", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_Jawa"}

Danner also set the F2 lap record of the current configuration of the old [[N\u00fcrburgring]]. Danner moved to the [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]] championship in [[1985 International Formula 3000 season|1985]] which replaced the Formula Two championship.

He made his debut in 1988 after failing to find a ride in Formula one. Danner made an impressive start to his touring car career as he won both races at the [[Hockenheimring]] driving a  [[BMW M3]].

During his years in Formula Two Danner was a constant frontrunner. He scored several podiums but failed to win a race. Danner also set the F2 lap record of the current configuration of the old [[N\u00fcrburgring]]. Danner moved to the [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]] championship in [[1985 International Formula 3000 season|1985]] which replaced the Formula Two championship. With four wins Danner became the inaugural [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]] championship winner.\n\n===Formula One===\n[[File:1985 European GP Christian Danner.jpg|thumb|Danner at the [[1985 European Grand Prix]]]]\n{{f1|1985}} saw Danner also made his [[Formula One]] debut with [[Zakspeed]]. He made two starts but failed to finish any races due to mechanical failures. For {{f1|1986}} he signed with minor Italian outfit [[Osella]] but struggled to make an impression with the car and its under powered [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engine. After failing to finish a race in the first six races, Danner moved to [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] with their powerful [[BMW M12|BMW]] turbo engines and scored his first point at the [[1986 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]].\n\nDanner returned to Zakspeed in {{f1|1987}}. The [[Zakspeed 871|car]] was both un-competitive and often unreliable and when Danner finished a race it was always outside the points. After having raced touring cars in 1988, Danner returned to Formula one in {{f1|1989}} with [[Rial Racing]]. The car was highly uncompetitive and a fourth place due to a high attrition rate at the [[1989 United States Grand Prix]] was the only highlight of the year. Danner was fired after the [[1989 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]] after only qualifying for four races that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/con-rial.html|title=CONSTRUCTORS: RIAL|work=grandprix.com|accessdate=January 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Touring cars===\n[[File:Christian Danner -Schubel Engineering - Alfa Romeo 155 V6 TI 94 exits The Esses (46745275811).jpg|thumb|Christian Danner -Schubel Engineering - Alfa Romeo 155 V6 TI 94 exits The Esses, Donington 1994 DTM]]\nAfter his Formula one career Danner became a regular competitor in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]]. He made his debut in 1988 after failing to find a ride in Formula one. Danner made an impressive start to his touring car career as he won both races at the [[Hockenheimring]] driving a  [[BMW M3]]. After only  making sporadic appearances in 1989 and 1990, Danner made a full-time return to the series in [[1991 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft|1991]]. He had a disappointing season and only had one points scoring finish. In [[1993 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft|1993]] Danner had his best season. He scored six podium finishes and finished fifth in the points standings. He also won a race at the Non-Championship round in [[Donington Park]]. Danner returned to winning ways in [[1995 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft|1995]] when he won a race at the [[Norisring]]. Danner kept racing touring cars through 1997.\n\nIn 1991 he also started in one [[British Touring Car Championship]] race at [[Thruxton Circuit|Thruxton]] driving a [[BMW]] M3.\n\n===Other racing===\nDanner competed in [[1990 Japanese Formula 3000 season|Japanese Formula 3000 in 1990]] driving for [[Leyton House]]'s F3000 team. He scored 4 points and was ranked 14th. In the nineties Danner made several appearances in the Indy Car World Series. His best finish was a seventh place at [[Grand Prix of Miami (open wheel racing)|Homestead Miami]] in [[1995 PPG Indy Car World Series|1995]]. He also took part in the now defunct series, [[Grand Prix Masters]].\n\n===Media career===\nAfter his racing career Danner became an  F1 [[Sportscaster|commentator]] for the channel [[RTL Television|RTL]] in his native Germany.<ref name=\"Christian Danner's CV\" />\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\"\n!
