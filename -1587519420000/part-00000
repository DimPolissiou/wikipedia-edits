{"title_page": "Tensor product of representations", "text_new": "In mathematics, the '''tensor product of representations''' is a [[tensor product of vector spaces]] underlying representations together with the factor-wise group action on the product. This construction, together with the Clebsch\u2013Gordan procedure, can be used to generate additional [[irreducible representation]]s if one already knows a few.\n\n== Definition ==\n===Group representations===\nIf <math>V_1, V_2</math> are [[linear representation]]s of a group <math>G</math>, then their tensor product is the [[tensor product of vector spaces]] <math>V_1 \\otimes V_2</math> with the linear action of <math>G</math> uniquely determined by the condition that\n:<math>g \\cdot (v_1 \\otimes v_2) = (g\\cdot v_1) \\otimes (g\\cdot v_2)</math>{{sfn|Serre|1977|p=8}}{{sfn|Fulton|Harris|1991|p=4}}\nfor all <math>v_1\\in V_1</math> and <math>v_2\\in V_2</math>. Although not every element of <math>V_1\\otimes V_2</math> is expressible in the form <math>v_1\\otimes v_2</math>, the [[Tensor product#Universal property|universal property]] of the tensor product operation guarantees that this action is well defined.\n\nIn the language of homomorphisms, if the actions of <math>G</math> on <math>V_1</math> and <math>V_2</math> are given by homomorphisms <math>\\Pi_1:G\\rightarrow\\operatorname{GL}(V_1)</math> and <math>\\Pi_2:G\\rightarrow\\operatorname{GL}(V_2)</math>, then the tensor product representation is given by the homomorphism <math>\\Pi_1\\otimes\\Pi_2:G\\rightarrow\\operatorname{GL}(V_1\\otimes V_2)</math> given by\n:<math>\\Pi_1\\otimes\\Pi_2(g)=\\Pi_1(g)\\otimes\\Pi_2(g)</math>,\nwhere <math>\\Pi_1(g)\\otimes\\Pi_2(g)</math> is the [[Tensor product#Tensor product of linear maps|tensor product of linear maps]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 4.3.2</ref>\n\nOne can extend the notion of tensor products to any finite number of representations. If ''V'' is a linear representation of a group ''G'', then with the above linear action, the [[tensor algebra]] <math>T(V)</math> is an [[algebraic representation]] of ''G''; i.e., each element of ''G'' acts as an [[algebra automorphism]].\n\n===Lie algebra representations===\nIf <math>(V_1,\\pi_1)</math> and <math>(V_2,\\pi_2)</math> are representations of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, then the tensor product of these representations is given by the map <math>\\pi_1\\otimes\\pi_2:\\mathfrak g\\rightarrow\\operatorname{End}(V_1\\otimes V_2)</math> given by<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Definition 4.19</ref>\n:<math>\\pi_1\\otimes\\pi_2(X)=\\pi_1(X)\\otimes I+I\\otimes\\pi_2(X)</math>.\nThe motivation for this definition comes from the case in which <math>\\pi_1</math> and <math>\\pi_2</math> come from representations <math>\\Pi_1</math> and <math>\\Pi_2</math> of a Lie group <math>G</math>. In that case, a simple computation shows that the Lie algebra representation associated to <math>\\Pi_1\\otimes\\Pi_2</math> is given by the preceding formula.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 4.18</ref>\n\n== Action on linear maps ==\nIf <math>(V_1,\\Pi_1)</math> and <math>(V_2,\\Pi_2)</math> are representations of a group <math>G</math>, let <math>\\operatorname{Hom}(V_1,V_2)</math> denote the space of all linear maps from <math>V_1</math> to <math>V_2</math>. Then <math>\\operatorname{Hom}(V_1,V_2)</math> can be given the structure of a representation by defining\n:<math>g\\cdot A=\\Pi_2(g)A\\Pi_1(g)^{-1}</math>\nfor all <math>A\\in\\operatorname{Hom}(V,W)</math>. Now, there is a [[Tensor product#Tensor product vs. Hom|natural isomorphism]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{Hom}(V, W)\\cong V^* \\otimes W</math>\nas vector spaces;{{sfn|Fulton|Harris|1991|p=4}} this vector space isomorphism is in fact an isomorphism of representations.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} pp. 433\u2013434</ref>\n\nThe [[trivial subrepresentation]] <math>\\operatorname{Hom}(V, W)^G</math> consists of [[equivariant map|''G''-linear maps]]; i.e.,\n:<math>\\operatorname{Hom}_G(V, W) = \\operatorname{Hom}(V, W)^G.</math>\n\nLet <math>E = \\operatorname{End}(V)</math> denote the endomorphism algebra of ''V'' and let ''A'' denote the subalgebra of <math>E^{\\otimes m}</math> consisting of symmetric tensors. The [[main theorem of invariant theory]] states that ''A'' is [[semisimple algebra|semisimple]] when the characteristic of the base field is zero.\n\n==Clebsch\u2013Gordan theory==\n===The general problem===\nThe tensor product of two irreducible representations <math>V_1,V_2</math> of a group or Lie algebra is usually not irreducible. It is therefore of interest to attempt to decompose <math>V_1\\otimes V_2</math> into irreducible pieces. This decomposition problem is known as the Clebsch\u2013Gordan problem.\n\n===The SU(2) case===\nThe [[Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients|prototype example]] of this problem is the case of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]\u2014or its double cover, the [[Special unitary group#The group SU(2)|special unitary group SU(2)]]. The irreducible representations of SU(2) are described by a parameter <math>\\ell</math>, whose possible values are\n:<math>\\ell=0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, \\ldots.</math>\n(The dimension of the representation is then <math>2\\ell+1</math>.) Let us take two parameters <math>\\ell</math> and <math>m</math> with <math>\\ell\\geq m</math>. Then the tensor product representation <math>V_\\ell\\otimes V_m</math> then decomposes as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem C.1</ref>\n:<math>V_\\ell\\otimes V_m\\cong V_{\\ell+m}\\oplus V_{\\ell+m-1}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus V_{\\ell-m+1}\\oplus V_{\\ell-m}.</math>\nConsider, as an example, the tensor product of the four-dimensional representation <math>V_{3/2}</math> and the three-dimensional representation <math>V_1</math>. The tensor product representation <math>V_{3/2}\\otimes V_1</math> has dimension 12 and decomposes as\n:<math>V_{3/2}\\otimes V_1\\cong V_{5/2}\\oplus V_{3/2}\\oplus V_{1/2}</math>,\nwhere the representations on the right-hand side have dimension 6, 4, and 2, respectively. We may summarize this result arithmetically as <math>4\\times 3= 6+4+2</math>.\n\n===The SU(3) case===\n{{main|Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients for SU(3)}}\nIn the case of the group SU(3), all the [[Lie algebra representation#The case of sl(3,C)|irreducible representations]] can be generated from the standard 3-dimensional representation and its dual, as follows. To generate the representation with label <math>(m_1,m_2)</math>, one takes the tensor product of <math>m_1</math> copies of the standard representation and <math>m_2</math> copies of the dual of the standard representation, and then takes the invariant subspace generated by the tensor product of the highest weight vectors.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proof of Proposition 6.17</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the situation for SU(2), in the Clebsch\u2013Gordan decomposition for SU(3), a given irreducible representation <math>W</math> may occur more than once in the decomposition of <math>U\\otimes V</math>.\n\n== Tensor power ==\n\nAs with vector spaces, one can define the '''{{var|k}}<sup>th</sup> [[tensor power]] of a representation''' {{var|V}} to be the vector space <math>V^{\\otimes k}</math> with the action given above.\n\n=== The symmetric and alternating square ===\n\nOver a field of characteristic zero, the symmetric and alternating squares are [[subrepresentation]]s of the second tensor power. They can be used to define the [[Frobenius\u2013Schur indicator]], which indicates whether a given [[irreducible character]] is [[Real representation|real]], [[Complex representation|complex]], or [[Quaternionic representation|quaternionic]]. They are examples of [[Schur functor]]s.\nThey are defined as follows.\n\nLet {{var|V}} be a [[vector space]]. Define an [[endomorphism]] (self-map) {{var|T}} of <math>V\\otimes V</math> as follows:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  T:V\\otimes V &\\longrightarrow V\\otimes V \\\\\n  v\\otimes w &\\longmapsto v\\otimes w.\n\\end{align}\n</math><ref>Precisely, we have <math>V \\times V \\to V \\otimes V, (v, w) \\mapsto v \\otimes w</math>, which is bilinear and thus descends to the linear map <math>V \\otimes V \\to V \\otimes V.</math></ref>\n\nIt is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] (it is its own inverse), and so is an [[automorphism]] (self-[[isomorphism]]) of <math>V\\otimes V</math>.\n\nDefine two subsets of the second [[tensor power]] of {{var|V}}:\n\n:<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{align}\n  \\operatorname{Sym}^2(V) &:= \\{v\\in V\\otimes V\\mid T(v)=v \\} \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Alt}^2(V) &:= \\{v\\in V\\otimes V\\mid T(v)=-v \\}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThese are the '''symmetric square of {{var|V}}''' and the '''alternating square of {{var|V}}''', respectively.{{sfn|Serre|1977|p=9}} The symmetric and alternating squares are also known as the '''symmetric part''' and '''antisymmetric part''' of the tensor product.{{sfn|James|2001|p=196}}\n\n==== Properties ====\n\nThe second [[tensor power]] of a linear representation {{var|V}} of a group {{var|G}} decomposes as the direct sum of the symmetric and alternating squares:\n\n: <math display=\"block\">V^{\\otimes 2}=V\\otimes V \\cong \\operatorname{Sym}^2(V) \\oplus \\operatorname{Alt}^2(V)</math>\n\nas representations. In particular, both are [[Subrepresentation|subrepresenations]] of the second tensor power.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"Whispers Of The Dead\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}} </ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

When confronted, 29-year-old Ong Yeow Tian ran off while one of the policeman, Police Constable (PC) Chua Yeu Hua arrested his accomplice. The other policeman, 22-year-old PC Mirza Abdul Halim chased after Ong. Ong managed to hide in the bushes before launching an assault at PC Mizra. Ong used his weapon to stab PC Mizra before PC Mizra took out his revolver in an attempt to defend himself. Ong overpowered PC Mizra and shot him in the head before fleeing the scene together with the revolver. Ong fled in a taxi before it was sighted by another two policemen, Sergeant Omar Amin and PC Benny Goh. The taxi was pulled over and out of a sudden, Ong use the stolen revolver to fire at them. In return, PC Goh successfully shot Ong in the abdomen before he managed to flee. The [[Police Tactical Unit (Singapore)|Police Task Force]] was activated to hunt for Ong. When one of the groups of the Police Task Force was patrolling, Ong who was hiding managed to shoot one of the man on patrol who was saved by a bulletproof vest. He was eventually subdued and arrested. PC Mizra went into a coma. He was given the rare field promotion to the rank of Corporal before Corporal Mizra passed away a day after the shooting.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Earlier on in 1993, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"Whispers Of The Dead\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}} </ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

He was charged with murder, but it was found and proven in the middle of the trial that Somsak was fully intoxicated at the time he killed Choochai due to him having consumed too much alcohol before the killing; this has substantially impaired his mental responsibility at the time of the killing.

He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang.
