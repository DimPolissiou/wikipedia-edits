On the eastern side of the fort, there was a two storied building facing the sea. It was the main building of the fort. The vaulted lower storey served as a magazine and a warehouse, while the vaulted upper storey contained the church and the lodgings of the governor, the senior merchants, and the chaplain. The sea on the eastern and western side protected the fort. The fort was surrounded by a moat, access to the fort being over a drawbridge.

Freddy likes [[road bicycle racing]], but this is forbidden by his parents Agnes and Andr\u00e9 due to his [[fecal incontinence]]. Agnes is afraid her son will be ridiculed when \"the problem\" turns up in public, causing such [[psychological trauma]] leading Freddy to make some drastic decisions.

That's why Freddy might not leave the house, although he sneakily goes out sometimes.\n\nA [[France|French]] supermarket \"Magique\" opens, not far from the butchery. Freddy's brother Briek joins the \"Flemish Offensive\", some youth organization which protests all French influences. To promote the supermarket, the director organizes a road bicycle racing for children. Freddy subscribes secretly. The winner gets a trip to [[Roubaix]] to meet [[Eddy Merckx]]. Briek and Agnes think they have seen Freddy in the race. This is confirmed when the director visits the butchery as Freddy won the contest. However, although Andr\u00e9 is a big fan of Eddy Merckx, he does not allow his son to travel to Roubaix again due to the fecal problem.\n\nAndr\u00e9 is not impressed with the supermarket. He does not believe in the concept people buy things in a store where meat, clothes and food in cans are sold together. He is wrong and less and less customers visit the butchery. Thanks to his rich sister Marjet he gets an idea: customers can call the butchery for their order. Freddy will deliver the meat with his bicycle. This is however a modest success. Due to too fewer customers and a warm summer the meat gets rotten.\n\nFreddie becomes befriended with Marie, the daughter of the owner of Magique. One day, they decide to go on a bicycle trip. His fecal problem turns up. Whilst riding home, he is stopped by the Flemish Offensive who laugh at him when they see he has soiled his pants. This turns out in a fight between Freddy and Briek on the one hand and the Flemish Offensive on the other hand. Due to the incident, Briek cancels his membership. This is not appreciated by the Flemish Offensive and they throw a brick through the shopwindow. Agnes tells another story with an unhappy end. She had a younger brother who killed himself. He was bullied after he got some severe attacks of [[epilepsy]].\n\nAs the butchery is almost broke, Andr\u00e9 meets the director of Magique. He can convince the director \"meat in plastic\" is inferior and it is better to open a section with fresh quality meat. Andr\u00e9 gets a full-time job with guaranteed salary and a commission. Some days later, Andr\u00e9 closes his own shop.\n\nThe director convinces Andr\u00e9 to subscribe Freddy for a talent scout. After the school vacation a sports school starts a department for talented bicycle racers, sponsored by Eddy Merckx. Freddy gets selected but his candidacy is uncertain due to the fecal incontinence. It would be a scandal for the sponsors and the team when this happens in public. The medical advisor of the jury suggests to perform another medical examination.

He has authored more than 150 papers in Physical Review Letters and PRB Rapid Communication , has an [[h-index]] over  140, number of citations over 95,000 (Google Scholar); and authored the fifth-most cited paper ever to be published in ''[[Physical Review]]'' since 1893.\n\n== Work and career ==\nZunger received his B.Sc, M.Sc, and Ph.D. education at [[Tel Aviv University]] in Israel and did his post-doctoral training at [[Northwestern University]]  and (as an [[IBM Fellow]]) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the USA.\n\nZunger\u2019s research field is the [[condensed matter theory]] of real materials. He developed [[pseudopotential]]s for first-principles electronic structure calculations within the framework of [[density functional theory]] (1977), co-developed the momentum-space total-energy method (1978), co-developed what is now the most widely used exchange and correlation [[energy functional]] and the self-interaction correction (1981), and developed a novel theoretical method for simultaneous relaxation of atomic positions and [[Charge density|charge densities]] in self-consistent [[local-density approximation]] calculations (1983).  Recently he developed novel methods for calculating the electronic properties of [[semiconductor]] [[Quantum nanoscience|quantum nanostructure]]s. These atomistic methods have enabled Zunger and his team to discover a range of [[Many-body theory|many-body]] effects underlying the fundamental physics of the creation, multiplication, and annihilation of [[exciton]]s.\n\nHis work has contributed greatly to the fundamental understanding of a wide range of materials phenomena in [[photovoltaic]] utilization of solar energy materials. The foundational methods he developed in the quantum theory of solids now form an essential integral part of the worldwide activities in the broad field of first-principles calculations of solid-state materials.\n\nIn recent years, Zunger has focused on developing the \u201cInverse Band Structure\u201d concept, whereby one uses ideas from [[quantum mechanics]] as well as [[genetic algorithm]]s to search for atomic configurations that have a desired target property. Zunger has also worked on photovoltaic materials, spontaneous ordering in solids (the subject of Zunger\u2019s 2001 Bardeen Award), and quantum nanostructures.\n\n\n\n==Organizations and honors==\nIn 1978, Zunger established [[NREL]]\u2019s Solid-State Theory Group, which he headed until 2011. He has been an NREL Research Fellow, is a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], and was the first Director of the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] Basic Energy Sciences \u201cCenter for Inverse Design.\u201d  He has also trained 77 post-doctoral fellows. He is the recipient of the inaugural 2011 ''Materials Theory Award''  of the [[Materials Research Society]] (On the Inverse Band Structure method ), the [[William Hume-Rothery|Hume-Rothery]] Award of the [[The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society|TMS]] (on the foundational theory of alloys); the 2010 [[Tomassoni awards|Tomassoni Prize and Science Medal]] of the [[Scola Physica Romana]] (for Density Functional advances), the 2009 Gutenberg Research Award from [[Johannes Gutenberg University]] (on highly correlated physics); the 2001 [[John Bardeen]] Prize from TMS (on spontaneous ordering in semiconductor alloys), and the 2001 [[Aneesur Rahman Prize for Computational Physics|Rahman Award]] of the American Physical Society (on the foundations of first-principles pseudopotentials, the total energy in [[momentum space]] and the [[Local-density approximation|LDA]] exchange-correlation functional).

He has authored more than 150 papers in Physical Review Letters and PRB Rapid Communication , has an [[h-index]] over  140, number of citations over 95,000 (Google Scholar); and authored the fifth-most cited paper ever to be published in ''[[Physical Review]]'' since 1893.\n\n== Work and career ==\nZunger received his B.Sc, M.Sc, and Ph.D. education at [[Tel Aviv University]] in Israel and did his post-doctoral training at [[Northwestern University]]  and (as an [[IBM Fellow]]) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the USA.\n\nZunger\u2019s research field is the [[condensed matter theory]] of real materials. He developed [[pseudopotential]]s for first-principles electronic structure calculations within the framework of [[density functional theory]] (1977), co-developed the momentum-space total-energy method (1978), co-developed what is now the most widely used exchange and correlation [[energy functional]] and the self-interaction correction (1981), and developed a novel theoretical method for simultaneous relaxation of atomic positions and [[Charge density|charge densities]] in self-consistent [[local-density approximation]] calculations (1983).  Recently he developed novel methods for calculating the electronic properties of [[semiconductor]] [[Quantum nanoscience|quantum nanostructure]]s. These atomistic methods have enabled Zunger and his team to discover a range of [[Many-body theory|many-body]] effects underlying the fundamental physics of the creation, multiplication, and annihilation of [[exciton]]s.\n\nHis work has contributed greatly to the fundamental understanding of a wide range of materials phenomena in [[photovoltaic]] utilization of solar energy materials. The foundational methods he developed in the quantum theory of solids now form an essential integral part of the worldwide activities in the broad field of first-principles calculations of solid-state materials.\n\nIn recent years, Zunger has focused on developing the \u201cInverse Band Structure\u201d concept, whereby one uses ideas from [[quantum mechanics]] as well as [[genetic algorithm]]s to search for atomic configurations that have a desired target property. Zunger has also worked on photovoltaic materials, spontaneous ordering in solids (the subject of Zunger\u2019s 2001 Bardeen Award), and quantum nanostructures.\n\nIn May of 2011 Alex Zunger was escorted from the NREL campus and his employment terminated.  No explanation was given.\n\n==Organizations and honors==\nIn 1978, Zunger established [[NREL]]\u2019s Solid-State Theory Group, which he headed until 2011. He has been an NREL Research Fellow, is a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], and was the first Director of the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] Basic Energy Sciences \u201cCenter for Inverse Design.\u201d  He has also trained 77 post-doctoral fellows. He is the recipient of the inaugural 2011 ''Materials Theory Award''  of the [[Materials Research Society]] (On the Inverse Band Structure method ), the [[William Hume-Rothery|Hume-Rothery]] Award of the [[The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society|TMS]] (on the foundational theory of alloys); the 2010 [[Tomassoni awards|Tomassoni Prize and Science Medal]] of the [[Scola Physica Romana]] (for Density Functional advances), the 2009 Gutenberg Research Award from [[Johannes Gutenberg University]] (on highly correlated physics); the 2001 [[John Bardeen]] Prize from TMS (on spontaneous ordering in semiconductor alloys), and the 2001 [[Aneesur Rahman Prize for Computational Physics|Rahman Award]] of the American Physical Society (on the foundations of first-principles pseudopotentials, the total energy in [[momentum space]] and the [[Local-density approximation|LDA]] exchange-correlation functional).  In 2011, he moved from NREL to University of Colorado where he is working in the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute( RASEI).\n\n== Publications ==\n[[File:Alex Zunger Publications By Year Chart.jpg|thumb|Number of citations of Zunger by year]]\nFor the most recent citation report, h-index, etc., view Google Scholar Citations.<ref>{{GoogleScholar|id=9I1Ner8AAAAJ}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of Zunger\u2019s work is partially reflected by the very high number of citations his papers have received (over 95,000, according to the [[ISI Web of Science]]) and by his high \u201ch-index\u201d of 140 (i.e., 140 of his papers have been cited each at least 140 times).
