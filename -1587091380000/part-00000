Old East Slavic is therefore the more appropriate term.<ref name=\"LRC_OldES\" /> Some scholars, such as [[Horace Lunt]]<ref name=\"Lunt\">Lunt, Horace G. ''Old Church Slavonic Grammar, Seventh Edition'', 2001.</ref>, also employ the term \"Rusian\" (with one \"s\") for the language, although this is the least commonly used form.<ref name=\"LRC_OldES\" />\n\n==General considerations==\nThe language was a descendant of the [[Proto-Slavic language]] and faithfully retained many of its features. A striking innovation in the evolution of this language was the development of so-called [[pleophony]] (or ''polnoglasie'' 'full vocalisation'), which came to differentiate the newly evolving East Slavic from other Slavic dialects. For instance, Common Slavic ''[[Grad (Slavic settlement)|*gord\u044a]]'' 'settlement, town' was reflected as OESl. ''gorod\u044a'', Common Slavic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic *melko|*melko]]'' 'milk' > OESl. ''moloko'', and Common Slavic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic *korva|*korva]]'' 'cow' > OESl ''korova''. Other Slavic dialects are differed by resolving the closed-syllable clusters *eRC and *aRC as [[liquid metathesis]] ([[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] and [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]]), or by no change at all (see the article on ''[[Slavic liquid metathesis and pleophony]]'' for a detailed account).\n\nSince extant written records of the language are sparse, it is difficult to assess the level of its unity. In consideration of the number of tribes and clans that constituted [[Kievan Rus]], it is probable that there were many dialects of Old East Slavonic. Therefore, today we may speak definitively only of the languages of surviving manuscripts, which, according to some interpretations, show regional divergence from the beginning of the historical records. Nonetheless, by 1150 it had more unity than any other branch of Slavic, showing the fewest local variations.<ref name=\"Lunt\"/>\n\nWith time, it evolved into several more diversified forms, which were the predecessors of the modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] languages. The [[Russian language|Russo]]-[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] split came first, between 1200 and 1500, whereas separation of Russian and Belarusian took place by 1700.<ref name=\"Lunt\"/> Each of these languages preserves much of the Old East Slavic grammar and vocabulary.\n\nWhen after the end of the 'Tatar yoke' the territory of former Kievan Rus was divided between the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the medieval Rus' principality [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Principality of Moscow]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Grand-Principality-of-Moscow|title=Grand Principality of Moscow {{!}} medieval principality, Russia|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}</ref> two separate literary traditions emerged in these states, [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] in the west and [[History of the Russian language|medieval Russian]] in the east.\n\n== Literary language of Kievan Rus' ==\n[[File:Izbornik page.jpg|thumb|A page from Svyatoslav's ''Miscellanies'' (1073).]]\nThe political unification of the region into the state called [[Kievan Rus']], from which modern [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] trace their origins, occurred approximately a century before the adoption of [[Christianity]] in 988 and the establishment of the South Slavic [[Old Church Slavonic]] as the liturgical and literary language. The Old Church Slavonic language was introduced. Documentation of the language of this period is scanty, making it difficult at best fully to determine the relationship between the literary language and its spoken dialects.\n\nThere are references in Arab and Byzantine sources to pre-Christian Slavs in European Russia using some form of writing. Despite some suggestive archaeological finds and a corroboration by the tenth-century monk [[Chernorizets Hrabar]] that ancient Slavs wrote in \"[[Relationship of Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets#Chernorizets Hrabar.27s account|strokes and incisions]]\", the exact nature of this system is unknown.\n\nAlthough the [[Glagolitic]] alphabet was briefly introduced, as witnessed by church inscriptions in [[Novgorod]], it was soon entirely superseded by the [[Cyrillic]].  The samples of [[birch-bark writing]] excavated in [[Novgorod]] have provided crucial information about the pure tenth-century [[Old Novgorod dialect|vernacular in North-West Russia]], almost entirely free of Church Slavonic influence.

Surviving literary monuments include the legal code [[Ruska Pravda|''Justice of the Rus'']] (''\u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430'' {{IPA|/rus\u02b2ka pravda/}}), a corpus of [[hagiography]] and [[homily]], the epic [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Song of Igor]] (''\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435'' {{IPA|/slovo o polku i\u0261or\u02b2ev\u02b2e/}}) and the earliest surviving manuscript of the [[Primary Chronicle]] (''\u041f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0442'' {{IPA|/pov\u02b2est\u02b2 vr\u02b2em\u02b2ennix l\u02b2et/}}) \u2013 the Laurentian codex (''\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a'' {{IPA|/lavr\u02b2ent\u02b2jevskij sp\u02b2isok/}}) of 1377.\n\nThe earliest dated specimen of Old East Slavic (or, rather, of [[Church Slavonic]] with pronounced East Slavic interference) must be considered the written ''Slovo o zakone i blagodati'', by [[Hilarion of Kiev|Hilarion]], [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Kiev]]. In this work there is a panegyric on Prince [[Vladimir of Kiev]], the hero of so much of East Slavic popular poetry. This subtle and graceful oration admirably conforms to the precepts of the Byzantine eloquence. It is rivalled by another panegyric on Vladimir, written a decade later by Yakov the Monk.\n\n[[File:ostromirovo.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''[[Ostromir Gospels]]'' from [[Novgorod]] (mid-eleventh century)]]\n\nOther eleventh-century writers are Theodosius, a monk of the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], who wrote on the Latin faith and some ''Pouchenia'' or ''Instructions'', and Luka Zhidiata, bishop of [[Novgorod]], who has left us a curious ''Discourse to the Brethren''. From the writings of Theodosius we see that many pagan habits were still in vogue among the people. He finds fault with them for allowing these to continue, and also for their drunkenness; nor do the monks escape his censures. Zhidiata writes in a more vernacular style than many of his contemporaries; he eschews the declamatory tone of the Byzantine authors. And here may be mentioned the many lives of the saints and the Fathers to be found in early East Slavic literature, starting with the two Lives of Sts [[Boris and Gleb]], written in the late eleventh century and attributed to Jacob the Monk and to [[Nestor the Chronicler]].\n\nWith the so-called [[Primary Chronicle]], also attributed to Nestor, begins the long series of the Russian annalists. There is a regular catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks to the seventeenth century. Besides the work attributed to [[Nestor the Chronicler]], we have chronicles of [[Novgorod]], [[Kiev]], [[Volhynia]] and many others. Every town of any importance could boast of its annalists, [[Pskov]] and [[Suzdal]] among others. In some respects these compilations, the productions of monks in their cloisters, remind us of [[Herodotus]], dry details alternating with here and there a picturesque incident; and many of these annals abound with the quaintest stories.\n\nIn the twelfth century we have the sermons of bishop [[Cyril of Turov]], which are attempts to imitate in Old East Slavic the florid Byzantine style. In his sermon on [[Holy Week]], [[Christianity]] is represented under the form of spring, [[Paganism]] and [[Judaism]] under that of winter, and evil thoughts are spoken of as boisterous winds.\n\n[[File:beresta.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Fourteenth-century [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorodian]] children were literate enough to send each other letters written on [[Birch bark document|birch bark]]]]\n\nThere are also admirable works of early travellers, as the igumen Daniel, who visited the [[Holy Land]] at the end of the eleventh and beginning of the twelfth century. A later traveller was [[Afanasiy Nikitin]], a merchant of [[Tver]], who visited [[India]] in 1470. He has left a [[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas|record of his adventures]], which has been translated into English and published for the [[Hakluyt Society]].\n\nA curious monument of old Slavonic times is the ''Pouchenie'' (Instruction), written by [[Vladimir Monomakh]] for the benefit of his sons. This composition is generally found inserted in the Chronicle of Nestor; it gives a fine picture of the daily life of a Slavonic prince. ''The Paterik of the Kievan Caves Monastery'' is a typical medieval collection of stories from the life of monks, featuring devils, angels, ghosts, and miraculous resurrections.\n\nWe now come to the famous [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Lay of Igor's Campaign]], which narrates the expedition of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]], prince of [[Novhorod-Siverskyi]] against the [[Cumans]]. It is neither [[Epic poetry|epic]] nor a poem but is written in [[rhythmic prose]]. An interesting aspect of the text is its mix of [[Christianity]] and ancient [[Slavic mythology|Slavic religion]]. Igor's wife Yaroslavna famously invokes natural forces from the walls of [[Putyvl]]. Christian motifs present along with depersonalised pagan gods in the form of artistic images. Another aspect, which sets the book apart from contemporary Western epics, are its numerous and vivid descriptions of [[nature]], and the role which nature plays in human lives. Of the whole bulk of the Old East Slavic literature, the Lay is the only work familiar to every educated Russian or Ukrainian. Its brooding flow of images, murky [[metaphor]]s, and ever changing rhythm haven't been successfully rendered into English yet.  Indeed, the meanings of many words found in it have not been satisfactorily explained by scholars.\n\nThe ''[[Zadonshchina]]'' is a sort of prose poem much in the style of the ''Tale of Igor's Campaign'', and the resemblance of the latter to this piece furnishes an additional proof of its genuineness. This account of the [[battle of Kulikovo]], which was gained by [[Dmitri Donskoi]] over the [[Mongols]] in 1380, has come down in three important versions.\n\nThe early laws of Rus\u2019 present many features of interest, such as the [[Russkaya Pravda]] of [[Yaroslav the Wise]], which is preserved in the chronicle of Novgorod; the date is between 1018 and 1072. The [[law]]s show Rus at that time to have been in civilization quite on a level with the rest of Europe.\n\n== Study ==\n\nThe earliest attempts to compile a comprehensive [[lexicon]] of Old East Slavic were undertaken by [[Alexander Vostokov]] and [[Izmail Sreznevsky]] in the nineteenth century.

Old East Slavic is therefore the more appropriate term.<ref name=\"LRC_OldES\" /> Some scholars, such as [[Horace Lunt]]<ref name=\"Lunt\">Lunt, Horace G. ''Old Church Slavonic Grammar, Seventh Edition'', 2001.</ref>, also employ the term \"Rusian\" (with one \"s\") for the language, although this is the least commonly used form.<ref name=\"LRC_OldES\" />\n\n==General considerations==\nThe language was a descendant of the [[Proto-Slavic language]] and faithfully retained many of its features. A striking innovation in the evolution of this language was the development of so-called [[pleophony]] (or ''polnoglasie'' 'full vocalisation'), which came to differentiate the newly evolving East Slavic from other Slavic dialects. For instance, Common Slavic ''[[Grad (Slavic settlement)|*gord\u044a]]'' 'settlement, town' was reflected as OESl. ''gorod\u044a'', Common Slavic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic *melko|*melko]]'' 'milk' > OESl. ''moloko'', and Common Slavic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic *korva|*korva]]'' 'cow' > OESl ''korova''. Other Slavic dialects are differed by resolving the closed-syllable clusters *eRC and *aRC as [[liquid metathesis]] ([[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] and [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]]), or by no change at all (see the article on ''[[Slavic liquid metathesis and pleophony]]'' for a detailed account).\n\nSince extant written records of the language are sparse, it is difficult to assess the level of its unity. In consideration of the number of tribes and clans that constituted [[Kievan Rus]], it is probable that there were many dialects of Old East Slavonic. Therefore, today we may speak definitively only of the languages of surviving manuscripts, which, according to some interpretations, show regional divergence from the beginning of the historical records. Nonetheless, by 1150 it had more unity than any other branch of Slavic, showing the fewest local variations.<ref name=\"Lunt\"/>\n\nWith time, it evolved into several more diversified forms, which were the predecessors of the modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] languages. The [[Russian language|Russo]]-[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] split came first, between 1200 and 1500, whereas separation of Russian and Belarusian took place by 1700.<ref name=\"Lunt\"/> Each of these languages preserves much of the Old East Slavic grammar and vocabulary.\n\nWhen after the end of the 'Tatar yoke' the territory of former Kievan Rus was divided between the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the medieval Rus' principality [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Principality of Moscow]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Grand-Principality-of-Moscow|title=Grand Principality of Moscow {{!}} medieval principality, Russia|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}</ref> two separate literary traditions emerged in these states, [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] in the west and [[History of the Russian language|medieval Russian]] in the east.\n\n== Literary language of Kievan Rus' ==\n[[File:Izbornik page.jpg|thumb|A page from Svyatoslav's ''Miscellanies'' (1073).]]\nThe political unification of the region into the state called [[Kievan Rus']], from which modern [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] trace their origins, occurred approximately a century before the adoption of [[Christianity]] in 988 and the establishment of the South Slavic [[Old Church Slavonic]] as the liturgical and literary language. The Old Church Slavonic language was introduced. Documentation of the language of this period is scanty, making it difficult at best fully to determine the relationship between the literary language and its spoken dialects.\n\nThere are references in Arab and Byzantine sources to pre-Christian Slavs in European Russia using some form of writing. Despite some suggestive archaeological finds and a corroboration by the tenth-century monk [[Chernorizets Hrabar]] that ancient Slavs wrote in \"[[Relationship of Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets#Chernorizets Hrabar.27s account|strokes and incisions]]\", the exact nature of this system is unknown.\n\nAlthough the [[Glagolitic]] alphabet was briefly introduced, as witnessed by church inscriptions in [[Novgorod]], it was soon entirely superseded by the [[Cyrillic]].  The samples of [[birch-bark writing]] excavated in [[Novgorod]] have provided crucial information about the pure tenth-century [[Old Novgorod dialect|vernacular in North-West Russia]], almost entirely free of Church Slavonic influence. It is also known that borrowings and calques from [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]] began to enter the vernacular at this time, and that simultaneously the literary language in its turn began to be modified towards Eastern Slavic.\n\nThe following excerpts illustrate two of the most famous literary monuments.\n\n'''NOTE:'''. The spelling of the original excerpt has been partly modernized. The translations are best attempts at being literal, not literary.\n\n=== Primary Chronicle ===\n{{Further information|Primary Chronicle}}\n\n{{circa|1110}}, from the [[Laurentian Codex]], 1377:\n\n[[File:Povest vremennykh let text.png|500px]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Surviving literary monuments include the legal code [[Ruska Pravda|''Justice of the Rus'']] (''\u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430'' {{IPA|/rus\u02b2ka pravda/}}), a corpus of [[hagiography]] and [[homily]], the epic [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Song of Igor]] (''\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435'' {{IPA|/slovo o polku i\u0261or\u02b2ev\u02b2e/}}) and the earliest surviving manuscript of the [[Primary Chronicle]] (''\u041f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0442'' {{IPA|/pov\u02b2est\u02b2 vr\u02b2em\u02b2ennix l\u02b2et/}}) \u2013 the Laurentian codex (''\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a'' {{IPA|/lavr\u02b2ent\u02b2jevskij sp\u02b2isok/}}) of 1377.\n\nThe earliest dated specimen of Old East Slavic (or, rather, of [[Church Slavonic]] with pronounced East Slavic interference) must be considered the written ''Slovo o zakone i blagodati'', by [[Hilarion of Kiev|Hilarion]], [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Kiev]]. In this work there is a panegyric on Prince [[Vladimir of Kiev]], the hero of so much of East Slavic popular poetry. This subtle and graceful oration admirably conforms to the precepts of the Byzantine eloquence. It is rivalled by another panegyric on Vladimir, written a decade later by Yakov the Monk.\n\n[[File:ostromirovo.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''[[Ostromir Gospels]]'' from [[Novgorod]] (mid-eleventh century)]]\n\nOther eleventh-century writers are Theodosius, a monk of the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], who wrote on the Latin faith and some ''Pouchenia'' or ''Instructions'', and Luka Zhidiata, bishop of [[Novgorod]], who has left us a curious ''Discourse to the Brethren''. From the writings of Theodosius we see that many pagan habits were still in vogue among the people. He finds fault with them for allowing these to continue, and also for their drunkenness; nor do the monks escape his censures. Zhidiata writes in a more vernacular style than many of his contemporaries; he eschews the declamatory tone of the Byzantine authors. And here may be mentioned the many lives of the saints and the Fathers to be found in early East Slavic literature, starting with the two Lives of Sts [[Boris and Gleb]], written in the late eleventh century and attributed to Jacob the Monk and to [[Nestor the Chronicler]].\n\nWith the so-called [[Primary Chronicle]], also attributed to Nestor, begins the long series of the Russian annalists. There is a regular catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks to the seventeenth century. Besides the work attributed to [[Nestor the Chronicler]], we have chronicles of [[Novgorod]], [[Kiev]], [[Volhynia]] and many others. Every town of any importance could boast of its annalists, [[Pskov]] and [[Suzdal]] among others. In some respects these compilations, the productions of monks in their cloisters, remind us of [[Herodotus]], dry details alternating with here and there a picturesque incident; and many of these annals abound with the quaintest stories.\n\nIn the twelfth century we have the sermons of bishop [[Cyril of Turov]], which are attempts to imitate in Old East Slavic the florid Byzantine style. In his sermon on [[Holy Week]], [[Christianity]] is represented under the form of spring, [[Paganism]] and [[Judaism]] under that of winter, and evil thoughts are spoken of as boisterous winds.\n\n[[File:beresta.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Fourteenth-century [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorodian]] children were literate enough to send each other letters written on [[Birch bark document|birch bark]]]]\n\nThere are also admirable works of early travellers, as the igumen Daniel, who visited the [[Holy Land]] at the end of the eleventh and beginning of the twelfth century. A later traveller was [[Afanasiy Nikitin]], a merchant of [[Tver]], who visited [[India]] in 1470. He has left a [[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas|record of his adventures]], which has been translated into English and published for the [[Hakluyt Society]].\n\nA curious monument of old Slavonic times is the ''Pouchenie'' (Instruction), written by [[Vladimir Monomakh]] for the benefit of his sons. This composition is generally found inserted in the Chronicle of Nestor; it gives a fine picture of the daily life of a Slavonic prince. ''The Paterik of the Kievan Caves Monastery'' is a typical medieval collection of stories from the life of monks, featuring devils, angels, ghosts, and miraculous resurrections.\n\nWe now come to the famous [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Lay of Igor's Campaign]], which narrates the expedition of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]], prince of [[Novhorod-Siverskyi]] against the [[Cumans]]. It is neither [[Epic poetry|epic]] nor a poem but is written in [[rhythmic prose]]. An interesting aspect of the text is its mix of [[Christianity]] and ancient [[Slavic mythology|Slavic religion]]. Igor's wife Yaroslavna famously invokes natural forces from the walls of [[Putyvl]]. Christian motifs present along with depersonalised pagan gods in the form of artistic images. Another aspect, which sets the book apart from contemporary Western epics, are its numerous and vivid descriptions of [[nature]], and the role which nature plays in human lives. Of the whole bulk of the Old East Slavic literature, the Lay is the only work familiar to every educated Russian or Ukrainian. Its brooding flow of images, murky [[metaphor]]s, and ever changing rhythm haven't been successfully rendered into English yet.  Indeed, the meanings of many words found in it have not been satisfactorily explained by scholars.\n\nThe ''[[Zadonshchina]]'' is a sort of prose poem much in the style of the ''Tale of Igor's Campaign'', and the resemblance of the latter to this piece furnishes an additional proof of its genuineness. This account of the [[battle of Kulikovo]], which was gained by [[Dmitri Donskoi]] over the [[Mongols]] in 1380, has come down in three important versions.\n\nThe early laws of Rus\u2019 present many features of interest, such as the [[Russkaya Pravda]] of [[Yaroslav the Wise]], which is preserved in the chronicle of Novgorod; the date is between 1018 and 1072. The [[law]]s show Rus at that time to have been in civilization quite on a level with the rest of Europe.\n\n== Study ==\n\nThe earliest attempts to compile a comprehensive [[lexicon]] of Old East Slavic were undertaken by [[Alexander Vostokov]] and [[Izmail Sreznevsky]] in the nineteenth century. Sreznevsky's ''[http://imwerden.de/cat/modules.php?name=books&pa=last_update&pagenum=2&order=p.title,%20p.original&sort=&cid=26&lettereng=&letter= Materials for the Dictionary of the Old Russian Language on the Basis of Written Records]'' (1893\u20131903), though incomplete, remained a standard reference until the appearance of a 24-volume academic dictionary in 1975\u201399.\n\n== Notable texts ==\n[[File:Novgorod Codex.jpg|thumb|200px|First page of the tenth-century [[Novgorod Codex]], thought to be the oldest East Slavic book in existence]]\n* ''[[Bylina]]s''\n* ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'' \u2013 the most outstanding literary work in this language \t\n* ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]'' \u2013 an eleventh-century legal code issued by [[Yaroslav the Wise]]\n* ''[[Praying of Daniel the Immured]]''\n* ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Belarusian language]]\n* [[East Slavic languages#History|History of the East Slavic languages]]\n* [[Russian language]]\n* [[Rusyn language]]\n* [[Ruthenian language]]\n* [[Slavic languages]]\n* [[Ukrainian language]]\n* [[List of Latvian words borrowed from Old East Slavic]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Slavonic, Old |volume=25 |pages=227\u2013228}}\n* {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Slavs |volume=25 |pages=228\u2013237 |first=Ellis Hovell |last=Minns}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Incubator|code=orv}}\n* [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/oruol-0-X.html Introductory course] University of Texas Linguistics Research Center\n* [http://character.webzone.ru/ostromir.htm Ostromir's Gospel Online]\n* [http://www.drevne.ru/ Online library of the Old Russian texts] {{in lang|ru}}\n* [http://lib.pushkinskijdom.ru/Default.aspx?tabid=2070 The Pushkin House], a great 12-volumed collection of ancient texts of the 11th\u201317th centuries with parallel Russian translations\n* [http://litopys.org.ua/ ''Izbornyk''], library of Old East Slavic chronicles with Ukrainian and Russian translations\n\n{{Slavic languages}}\n\n[[Category:Old East Slavic| ]]\n[[Category:Belarusian language]]\n[[Category:Russian language]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian language]]\n", "name_user": "ToddBKrause", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUpdating links to lessons at the Linguistics Research Center", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_East_Slavic"}

{"title_page": "Georges de La Tour", "text_new": "{{short description|17th-century French painter}}\n[[File:La Tour.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Joseph the Carpenter]]'', 1642, [[Louvre]].]]\n'''Georges de La Tour''' (March 13, 1593 \u2013 January 30, 1652) was a [[French people|French]] [[Baroque]] painter, who spent most of his working life in the [[Duchy of Lorraine]], which was temporarily absorbed into France between 1641 and 1648.  He painted mostly religious [[chiaroscuro]] scenes lit by candlelight.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Image:Georges de La Tour 009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Penitent Magdalene'', 1625\u20131650, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\nGeorges de La Tour was born in the town of [[Vic-sur-Seille]] in the [[Diocese of Metz]], which was technically part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but had been ruled by France since 1552. Baptism documentation revealed that he was the son of Jean de La Tour, a baker, and Sybille de La Tour, n\u00e9e Molian. It has been suggested that Sybille came from a partly noble family.<ref>[https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_theses/462/] Crissy Bergeron Thesis \u2013 page 7, and note 4, quoting Thuillier p.19</ref> His parents had seven children in all, with Georges being the second-born. \n\nLa Tour's educational background remains somewhat unclear, but it is assumed that he traveled either to Italy or the Netherlands early in his career. He may possibly have trained under [[Jacques Bellange]] in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], the capital of Lorraine, although their styles are very different.  His paintings reflect the [[Baroque]] [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]] of [[Caravaggio]], but this probably reached him through the Dutch ''Caravaggisti'' of the [[Utrecht School]] and other Northern ([[List of French artists|French]] and [[List of Dutch painters|Dutch]]) contemporaries. In particular, La Tour is often compared to the Dutch painter [[Hendrick Terbrugghen]].<ref name=\"AB\">Anthony Blunt, ''Art and Architecture in France, 1500\u20131700'', 1953, Penguin</ref>  \n\nIn 1617 he married Diane Le Nerf, from a minor noble family, and in 1620 he established his studio in her quiet provincial home-town of [[Lun\u00e9ville]], part of the independent [[Duchy of Lorraine]] which was occupied by France, during his lifetime, in the period 1641\u20131648. He painted mainly religious and some genre scenes. He was given the title \"Painter to the King\" (of France) in 1638, and he also worked for the Dukes of Lorraine in 1623\u20134, but the local bourgeoisie provided his main market, and he achieved a certain affluence. He is not recorded in Lun\u00e9ville between 1639 and 1642, and may have traveled again; [[Anthony Blunt]] detected the influence of [[Gerrit van Honthorst]] in his paintings after this point. He was involved in a [[Franciscan]]-led religious revival in Lorraine, and over the course of his career he moved to painting almost entirely religious subjects, but in treatments with influence from ''genre'' painting.<ref name=\"AB\"/>  \n\nGeorges de La Tour and his family died in 1652 in an epidemic in Lun\u00e9ville. His son \u00c9tienne (born 1621) was his pupil.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Georges de La Tour (atelier) Saint Jerome lisant Musee Lorrain.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Saint Jerome]] reading]]\n\nLa Tour's early work shows influences from [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], probably via his Dutch followers, and the genre scenes of cheats\u2014as in ''[[the Fortune Teller (de La Tour)|The Fortune Teller]]''\u2014and fighting beggars clearly derive from the Dutch Caravaggisti, and probably also his fellow-Lorrainer, [[Jacques Bellange]]. These are believed to date from relatively early in his career. \n\nLa Tour is best known for the nocturnal light effects which he developed much further than his artistic predecessors had done, and transferred their use in the genre subjects in the paintings of the Dutch ''Caravaggisti'' to religious painting in his. Unlike Caravaggio his religious paintings lack dramatic effects. He painted these in a second phase of his style, perhaps beginning in the 1640s, using [[chiaroscuro]], careful geometrical compositions, and very simplified painting of forms.  His work moves during his career towards greater simplicity and stillness\u2014taking from Caravaggio very different qualities than [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and his [[Tenebrism|Tenebrist]] followers did.<ref name= \"AB\"/>  \n\n[[File:Georges de La Tour - Rixe de musiciens - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|''[[The Musicians' Brawl]]'', (Hurdy-gurdy group), c. 1625\u20131630, [[Getty Museum]]]]\n \nHe often painted several variations on the same subjects, and his surviving output is relatively small. His son \u00c9tienne was his pupil, and distinguishing between their work in versions of La Tour's compositions is difficult. The version of the ''Education of the Virgin'' in the [[Frick Collection]] in New York is an example, as the Museum itself admits. Another group of paintings (example left), of great skill but claimed to be different in style to those of La Tour, have been attributed to an unknown \"Hurdy-gurdy Master\".
