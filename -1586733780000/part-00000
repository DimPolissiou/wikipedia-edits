After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. He became [[1981 Burlington mayoral election|elected]] [[List of mayors of Burlington, Vermont|mayor of Burlington]] in 1981 as an independent and was reelected three times.
