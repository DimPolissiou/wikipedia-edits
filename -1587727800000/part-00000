See [[Endymion Wilkinson]]'s ''Chinese History'' (1998), p. 106\u2013107.</ref> was the second [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty of China]]. It followed the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013206 BCE), which had unified the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] of [[China]] by conquest. Interrupted briefly by the [[Xin dynasty]] (9\u201323 CE) of [[Wang Mang]], the Han dynasty is divided into two periods: the Western Han (206 BCE&nbsp;\u2013 9 CE) and the Eastern Han (25\u2013220 CE). These appellations are derived from the locations of the capital cities [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]], respectively. The third and final capital of the dynasty was [[Xuchang]], where the court moved in 196 CE during a period of political turmoil and [[End of the Han dynasty|civil war]].\n\nThe Han dynasty ruled in an era of Chinese [[Society and culture of the Han dynasty|cultural consolidation]], [[Government of the Han dynasty|political experimentation]], relative [[Economy of the Han dynasty|economic prosperity and maturity]], and great [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|technological advances]]. There was unprecedented territorial expansion and exploration initiated by struggles with non-Chinese peoples, especially the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. [[List of emperors of the Han dynasty|The Han emperors]] were initially forced to acknowledge the rival Xiongnu [[Chanyu]]s as their equals, yet in reality the Han was an inferior partner in a [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary]] and royal marriage alliance known as [[heqin]]. This agreement was broken when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141\u201387 BCE) [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|launched a series of military campaigns]] which eventually caused the fissure of the Xiongnu Federation and redefined the borders of China. The Han realm was expanded into the [[Hexi Corridor]] of modern [[Gansu]] province, the [[Tarim Basin]] of modern [[Xinjiang]], modern [[Yunnan]] and [[Hainan]], modern [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern Vietnam]], modern [[North Korea]], and southern [[Outer Mongolia]]. The Han court established trade and tributary relations with rulers as far west as the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacids]], to whose court at [[Ctesiphon]] in [[Mesopotamia]] the Han monarchs sent envoys. [[Buddhism]] first entered China during the Han, spread by missionaries from [[Parthia]] and the [[Kushan Empire]] of [[North India|northern India]] and [[Central Asia]].\n\nFrom its beginning, the Han imperial court was threatened by plots of treason and revolt from [[Kings of the Han dynasty|its subordinate kingdoms]], the latter eventually ruled only by royal [[Liu]] family members. Initially, the eastern half of the empire was indirectly administered through large semi-autonomous kingdoms which pledged loyalty and a portion of their tax revenues to the Han emperors, who ruled directly over the western half of the empire from Chang'an. Gradual measures were introduced by the imperial court to reduce the size and power of these kingdoms, until a reform of the middle 2nd century BCE abolished their semi-autonomous rule and staffed the kings' courts with central government officials. Yet much more volatile and consequential for the dynasty was the growing power of both [[consort clan]]s ([[:Category:Chinese empresses|of the empress]]) and the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] of [[Chinese Palaces|the palace]]. In 92 CE, the eunuchs entrenched themselves for the first time in the issue of the emperors' succession, [[Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions|causing a series of political crises]] which culminated in 189 CE with their downfall and slaughter in the palaces of Luoyang. This event triggered an age of [[Army of the Han dynasty|civil war]] as the country became divided by regional warlords vying for power. Finally, in 220 CE, [[Cao Pi|the son]] of [[Cao Cao|an imperial chancellor]] and king accepted the abdication of [[Emperor Xian of Han|the last Han emperor]], who was deemed to have lost the [[Mandate of Heaven]] according to [[Dong Zhongshu]]'s (179\u2013104 BCE) cosmological system that intertwined the fate of the imperial government with [[Tian|Heaven]] and the natural world. Following the Han, China was split into [[Three Kingdoms|three states]]: [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]], and [[Eastern Wu]]; these were reconsolidated into one empire by the [[Jin dynasty (266\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] (266\u2013420 CE).\n\n==Fall of Qin and Chu\u2013Han contention==\n{{main|Chu\u2013Han Contention|Eighteen Kingdoms}}\n{{further|Battle of Wei River}}\n\n===Collapse of Qin===\nThe [[Zhou dynasty]] (c. 1050\u2013256 BCE) had made the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] in [[Western China]] as an outpost to [[Horse breeding|breed horses]] and act as a defensive buffer against [[nomad]]ic armies of the [[Rong people|Rong]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], and [[Five Barbarians|Di]] peoples.<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 60\"/> After conquering [[Seven Warring States|six Warring States]] (i.e. [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], and [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi]]) by 221 BCE,<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 60\">Ebrey (1999), 60.</ref> the King of Qin, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], [[Qin's wars of unification|unified China under one empire]] divided into 36 centrally-controlled [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]].<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 61\">Ebrey (1999), 61.</ref> With control over much of [[China proper]], he affirmed his enhanced prestige by taking the unprecedented title [[Emperor of China|''huangdi'']], or 'emperor', known thereafter as Qin Shi Huang (i.e. the first emperor of Qin).<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 61\"/> Han-era historians would accuse his regime of employing ruthless methods to preserve his rule.<ref>Cullen (2006), 1\u20132.</ref>\n[[File:Group of soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Qin dynasty]] soldiers from the [[Terracotta Army]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]]'s mausoleum, located near [[Xi'an]]]]\n\nQin Shi Huang died of natural causes in 210 BCE.<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 63\">Ebrey (1999), 63.</ref> In 209 BCE the [[conscription]] officers [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]], leading 900 conscripts through the rain, failed to meet an arrival deadline; the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories|Standard Histories]]'' claim that the Qin punishment for this delay would have been [[execution]].<ref name=\"loewe 1986 112 113\">Loewe (1986), 112\u2013113.</ref> To avoid this, Chen and Wu started a rebellion against Qin, known as the [[Dazexiang Uprising]], but they were thwarted by the Qin general [[Zhang Han (Qin dynasty)|Zhang Han]] in 208 BCE; both Wu and Chen were subsequently assassinated by their own soldiers.<ref>Loewe (1986), 112\u2013113; ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377008|vol. 8]].</ref> Yet by this point others had rebelled, among them [[Xiang Yu]] (d. 202 BCE) and his uncle [[Xiang Liang]], men from a leading family of the [[Chu (state)|Chu]] aristocracy.<ref name=\"loewe 1986 113\">Loewe (1986), 113.</ref> They were joined by [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]], a man of peasant origin and supervisor of convicts in [[Pei County]].<ref name=\"loewe 1986 113\"/> [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Mi Xin]], grandson of [[King Huai I of Chu]], was declared King Huai II of Chu at his powerbase of Pengcheng (modern [[Xuzhou]]) with the support of the Xiangs, while other kingdoms soon formed in opposition to Qin.<ref name=\"loewe 1986 114\">Loewe (1986), 114.</ref> Despite this, in 208 BCE Xiang Liang was killed in a battle with Zhang Han,<ref name=ZZTJ8>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377008|vol. 8]].</ref> who subsequently attacked Zhao Xie the King of Zhao at his capital of [[Handan]], forcing him to flee to [[Pingxiang County|Julu]], which Zhang [[Battle of Julu|put under siege]].

See [[Endymion Wilkinson]]'s ''Chinese History'' (1998), p. 106\u2013107.</ref> was the second [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty of China]]. It followed the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013206 BCE), which had unified the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] of [[China]] by conquest. Interrupted briefly by the [[Xin dynasty]] (9\u201323 CE) of [[Wang Mang]], the Han dynasty is divided into two periods: the Western Han (206 BCE&nbsp;\u2013 9 CE) and the Eastern Han (25\u2013220 CE). These appellations are derived from the locations of the capital cities [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]], respectively. The third and final capital of the dynasty was [[Xuchang]], where the court moved in 196 CE during a period of political turmoil and [[End of the Han dynasty|civil war]].\n\nThe Han dynasty ruled in an era of Chinese [[Society and culture of the Han dynasty|cultural consolidation]], [[Government of the Han dynasty|political experimentation]], relative [[Economy of the Han dynasty|economic prosperity and maturity]], and great [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|technological advances]]. There was unprecedented territorial expansion and exploration initiated by struggles with non-Chinese peoples, especially the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. [[List of emperors of the Han dynasty|The Han emperors]] were initially forced to acknowledge the rival Xiongnu [[Chanyu]]s as their equals, yet in reality the Han was an inferior partner in a [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary]] and royal marriage alliance known as [[heqin]]. This agreement was broken when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141\u201387 BCE) [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|launched a series of military campaigns]] which eventually caused the fissure of the Xiongnu Federation and redefined the borders of China. The Han realm was expanded into the [[Hexi Corridor]] of modern [[Gansu]] province, the [[Tarim Basin]] of modern [[Xinjiang]], modern [[Yunnan]] and [[Hainan]], modern [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern Vietnam]], modern [[North Korea]], and southern [[Outer Mongolia]]. The Han court established trade and tributary relations with rulers as far west as the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacids]], to whose court at [[Ctesiphon]] in [[Mesopotamia]] the Han monarchs sent envoys. [[Buddhism]] first entered China during the Han, spread by missionaries from [[Parthia]] and the [[Kushan Empire]] of [[North India|northern India]] and [[Central Asia]].\n\nFrom its beginning, the Han imperial court was threatened by plots of treason and revolt from [[Kings of the Han dynasty|its subordinate kingdoms]], the latter eventually ruled only by royal [[Liu]] family members. Initially, the eastern half of the empire was indirectly administered through large semi-autonomous kingdoms which pledged loyalty and a portion of their tax revenues to the Han emperors, who ruled directly over the western half of the empire from Chang'an. Gradual measures were introduced by the imperial court to reduce the size and power of these kingdoms, until a reform of the middle 2nd century BCE abolished their semi-autonomous rule and staffed the kings' courts with central government officials. Yet much more volatile and consequential for the dynasty was the growing power of both [[consort clan]]s ([[:Category:Chinese empresses|of the empress]]) and the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] of [[Chinese Palaces|the palace]]. In 92 CE, the eunuchs entrenched themselves for the first time in the issue of the emperors' succession, [[Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions|causing a series of political crises]] which culminated in 189 CE with their downfall and slaughter in the palaces of Luoyang. This event triggered an age of [[Army of the Han dynasty|civil war]] as the country became divided by regional warlords vying for power. Finally, in 220 CE, [[Cao Pi|the son]] of [[Cao Cao|an imperial chancellor]] and king accepted the abdication of [[Emperor Xian of Han|the last Han emperor]], who was deemed to have lost the [[Mandate of Heaven]] according to [[Dong Zhongshu]]'s (179\u2013104 BCE) cosmological system that intertwined the fate of the imperial government with [[Tian|Heaven]] and the natural world. Following the Han, China was split into [[Three Kingdoms|three states]]: [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]], and [[Eastern Wu]]; these were reconsolidated into one empire by the [[Jin dynasty (266\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] (266\u2013420 CE).\n\n==Fall of Qin and Chu\u2013Han contention==\n{{main|Chu\u2013Han Contention|Eighteen Kingdoms}}\n{{further|Battle of Wei River}}\n\n===Collapse of Qin===\nThe [[Zhou dynasty]] (c. 1050\u2013256 BCE) had made the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] in [[Western China]] as an outpost to [[Horse breeding|breed horses]] and act as a defensive buffer against [[nomad]]ic armies of the [[Rong people|Rong]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], and [[Five Barbarians|Di]] peoples.<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 60\"/> After conquering [[Seven Warring States|six Warring States]] (i.e. [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], and [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi]]) by 221 BCE,<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 60\">Ebrey (1999), 60.</ref> the King of Qin, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], [[Qin's wars of unification|unified China under one empire]] divided into 36 centrally-controlled [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]].<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 61\">Ebrey (1999), 61.</ref> With control over much of [[China proper]], he affirmed his enhanced prestige by taking the unprecedented title [[Emperor of China|''huangdi'']], or 'emperor', known thereafter as Qin Shi Huang (i.e. the first emperor of Qin).<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 61\"/> Han-era historians would accuse his regime of employing ruthless methods to preserve his rule.<ref>Cullen (2006), 1\u20132.</ref>\n[[File:Group of soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Qin dynasty]] soldiers from the [[Terracotta Army]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]]'s mausoleum, located near [[Xi'an]]]]\n\nQin Shi Huang died of natural causes in 210 BCE.<ref name=\"ebrey 1999 63\">Ebrey (1999), 63.</ref> In 209 BCE the [[conscription]] officers [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]], leading 900 conscripts through the rain, failed to meet an arrival deadline; the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories|Standard Histories]]'' claim that the Qin punishment for this delay would have been [[execution]].<ref name=\"loewe 1986 112 113\">Loewe (1986), 112\u2013113.</ref> To avoid this, Chen and Wu started a rebellion against Qin, known as the [[Dazexiang Uprising]], but they were thwarted by the Qin general [[Zhang Han (Qin dynasty)|Zhang Han]] in 208 BCE; both Wu and Chen were subsequently assassinated by their own soldiers.<ref>Loewe (1986), 112\u2013113; ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377008|vol. 8]].</ref> Yet by this point others had rebelled, among them [[Xiang Yu]] (d. 202 BCE) and his uncle [[Xiang Liang]], men from a leading family of the [[Chu (state)|Chu]] aristocracy.<ref name=\"loewe 1986 113\">Loewe (1986), 113.</ref> They were joined by [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]], a man of peasant origin and supervisor of convicts in [[Pei County]].<ref name=\"loewe 1986 113\"/> [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Mi Xin]], grandson of [[King Huai I of Chu]], was declared King Huai II of Chu at his powerbase of Pengcheng (modern [[Xuzhou]]) with the support of the Xiangs, while other kingdoms soon formed in opposition to Qin.<ref name=\"loewe 1986 114\">Loewe (1986), 114.</ref> Despite this, in 208 BCE Xiang Liang was killed in a battle with Zhang Han,<ref name=ZZTJ8>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377008|vol. 8]].</ref> who subsequently attacked Zhao Xie the King of Zhao at his capital of [[Handan]], forcing him to flee to [[Pingxiang County|Julu]], which Zhang [[Battle of Julu|put under siege]].

He was active in [[politics]] at his native [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] and at the state and national level.\n\nBeginning an acting career in 1992, he appeared on numerous television series and in several films, including ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and released his own music CD.

While at the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]] in south-central South Dakota, he developed severe [[vertigo]]. Physicians at the reservation clinic believed that he had been brought in inebriated. After they refused to examine him for several days, Means was finally diagnosed with a [[concussion]] due to a presumed fight in a saloon. A visiting specialist later discovered that the reservation doctors had overlooked a common [[ear infection]], which cost Means the hearing in one ear.<ref name=Means17/>\n\nAfter recovering from the infection, Means worked for a year in the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]], where he came to know several legal activists who were managing legal action on behalf of the [[Lakota people]]. After a dispute with his supervisor, Means left Rosebud for [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. In Cleveland, he worked with Native American community leaders against the backdrop of the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].<ref name=Means17/>\n\nMeans was previously an accountant and a [[ballroom dance]] instructor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Involvement with the American Indian Movement==\nIn 1968, Means joined the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), where he rose to become a prominent leader. In 1970, Means was appointed AIM's first national director, and the organization began a period of increasing protests and activism.<ref name=pbs/>\n\n===Occupations===\n{{See also|Wounded Knee Incident}}\nMeans participated in the 1969 [[Alcatraz occupation]]. He had been there once before, to occupy it for 24 hours under the lead of his father, Walter \"Hank\" Means, and a few other Lakota men in March 1964<ref name=Means17/> (Means' father died in January 1967).<ref name=Means17/>\n\nOn [[Thanksgiving Day]] 1970, Means and other AIM activists staged their first protest in Boston: they seized the ''[[Mayflower II]]'', a replica ship of the [[Mayflower]], to protest the Puritans' and United States' mistreatment of Native Americans.<ref name=pbs/> In 1971 Means was one of the leaders of AIM's takeover of [[Mount Rushmore]], a federal monument.

The armed standoff of more than 300 Lakota and AIM activists with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and state law enforcement lasted for 71 days. A visiting [[Cherokee]] from North Carolina and an [[Oglala Lakota]] activist from Pine Ridge Reservation were killed in April.\n\n===Native American politics===\nIn 1974, Means resigned from AIM to run for the presidency of his native [[Oglala Sioux Tribe]] (OST) against the incumbent [[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Richard Wilson]]. The official vote count showed Wilson winning by more than 200 votes. Residents complained of intimidation by Wilson's private militia. The report of a government investigation confirmed problems in the election, but in a related court challenge to the results of the election, a federal court upheld the results.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Means turned to an international forum on issues of rights for [[indigenous peoples]]. He worked with Jimmie Durham, who established the offices of the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] to work with the United Nations in 1977. At the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he assisted in the organization of community institutions, such as the [[KILI]] radio station and the Porcupine Health Clinic in [[Porcupine, South Dakota]].\n\n===Splits in AIM===\nIn the 1980s, AIM divided into several competing factions, in part over differences among members regarding support for the indigenous peoples in [[Nicaragua]]. Means supported the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] group MISURASATA (later known as [[YATAMA]]), which was allied with the [[Contras]]. He traveled to Nicaragua in 1985 and 1986 on fact-finding tours. He came to believe that the Miskito as a people were being targeted for elimination.<ref name= McLellan/> Some AIM members supported the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]] of the national government, although they had forced removal of thousands of Miskito from their traditional territory. At that time, the \"Grand Governing Council\" of AIM, based in Minnesota, asked Means to cease representing himself as a leader of AIM.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Other chapters of AIM continued to support Means.\n\nOn January 8, 1988, Means held a press conference to announce his retirement from AIM, saying it had achieved its goals.<ref>[http://www.aimovement.org/moipr/onrussellmeans.html \"Indian activist Russell Means says he's retiring from AIM\", AP], Attachment 3, Articles on Means, AMERICAN INDIAN MOVEMENT GRAND GOVERNING COUNCIL</ref> That January, the \"AIM Grand Governing Council\", headed by the [[Clyde Bellecourt|Bellecourt]] brothers, released a press release noting this was the sixth resignation by Means since 1974, and asking the press to \"never again report either that he is a founder of the American Indian Movement, or [that] he is a leader of the American Indian Movement\".

It had been under investigation both by the Denver police, as Aquash had been kidnapped from there, and by the [[FBI]], as she had been taken across state lines and killed on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Both Branscombe and Means accused [[Vernon Bellecourt]], a high-ranking leader of AIM, of having ordered her execution. Means said that [[Clyde Bellecourt]], a founder of AIM, had ensured that it was carried out at the Pine Ridge Reservation. Means said that an AIM tribunal had banned the Bellecourt brothers but tried to keep the reason for the dissension internal to protect AIM.<ref name=\"press\"/>\n\nThe [[Associated Press]] (AP) reporter Robert Weller noted that this was the first time that an AIM leader active at the time of Aquash's death had publicly implicated AIM in her murder.

A visiting [[Cherokee]] from North Carolina and an [[Oglala Lakota]] activist from Pine Ridge Reservation were killed in April.\n\n===Native American politics===\nIn 1974, Means resigned from AIM to run for the presidency of his native [[Oglala Sioux Tribe]] (OST) against the incumbent [[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Richard Wilson]]. The official vote count showed Wilson winning by more than 200 votes. Residents complained of intimidation by Wilson's private militia. The report of a government investigation confirmed problems in the election, but in a related court challenge to the results of the election, a federal court upheld the results.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Means turned to an international forum on issues of rights for [[indigenous peoples]]. He worked with Jimmie Durham, who established the offices of the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] to work with the United Nations in 1977. At the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he assisted in the organization of community institutions, such as the [[KILI]] radio station and the Porcupine Health Clinic in [[Porcupine, South Dakota]].\n\n===Splits in AIM===\nIn the 1980s, AIM divided into several competing factions, in part over differences among members regarding support for the indigenous peoples in [[Nicaragua]]. Means supported the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] group MISURASATA (later known as [[YATAMA]]), which was allied with the [[Contras]]. He traveled to Nicaragua in 1985 and 1986 on fact-finding tours. He came to believe that the Miskito as a people were being targeted for elimination.<ref name= McLellan/> Some AIM members supported the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]] of the national government, although they had forced removal of thousands of Miskito from their traditional territory. At that time, the \"Grand Governing Council\" of AIM, based in Minnesota, asked Means to cease representing himself as a leader of AIM.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Other chapters of AIM continued to support Means.\n\nOn January 8, 1988, Means held a press conference to announce his retirement from AIM, saying it had achieved its goals.<ref>[http://www.aimovement.org/moipr/onrussellmeans.html \"Indian activist Russell Means says he's retiring from AIM\", AP], Attachment 3, Articles on Means, AMERICAN INDIAN MOVEMENT GRAND GOVERNING COUNCIL</ref> That January, the \"AIM Grand Governing Council\", headed by the [[Clyde Bellecourt|Bellecourt]] brothers, released a press release noting this was the sixth resignation by Means since 1974, and asking the press to \"never again report either that he is a founder of the American Indian Movement, or [that] he is a leader of the American Indian Movement\".

It had been under investigation both by the Denver police, as Aquash had been kidnapped from there, and by the [[FBI]], as she had been taken across state lines and killed on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Both Branscombe and Means accused [[Vernon Bellecourt]], a high-ranking leader of AIM, of having ordered her execution.

{"title_page": "List of shortest-reigning monarchs", "text_new": "{{Expand list|date=March 2020}}\n{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\nA monarch is the person who heads a [[monarchy]], usually reigning for life, or until [[abdication]] or [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]]. The reign of some monarchs has been notably short. Many of these monarchs acceded to the throne as a result of being first in an order of succession, while other monarchs claimed the throne as a result of some conflict.\n\nThe authenticity of some monarchs has been disputed, especially those who reigned during conflict. One factor in such debates is whether the monarch held the throne in a symbolic or nominal capacity. Two examples are\n\n*King [[Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angouleme|Louis XIX]] of France, who succeeded upon the abdication of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] only to abdicate in favour of [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Henry V]] instead of assuming the throne, and\n*Emperor [[Michael II of Russia]], who succeeded on the abdication of [[Nicholas II]] only to abdicate himself in favor of nobody.\n\n==Obscure monarchs thought to have reigned less than a year==\n''Note: Some of the following have been disputed as genuine monarchs''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  | Name\n!  | Country<br>or people\n!  | Royal house/dynasty\n!  | Reign began\n!  | Reign ended\n!  | Length\n! width=\"400pt\" | Comments\n|-\n| Shah [[Xerxes II]]\n| King of [[Persis|Persia]]\n| [[Achaemenid Empire]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | 424 BC\n| 45 days<br>(1 month 15 days)\n| Removed from the throne by [[Sogdianus]]\n|-\n| Queen [[Cleopatra IV of Egypt]]\n| Queen of [[Egypt]]\n| [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | 116 BC\n| \n| Pushed out of joint reign by her mother, [[Cleopatra III]]\n|-\n| King [[Zhao Jiande|Yang]]\n| [[Nanyue]]\n| [[Tri\u1ec7u dynasty|Zhao (Tri\u1ec7u)]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | 111 BC\n| \n| Captured and executed by the [[Han dynasty]] after his army was destroyed.

The reign of some monarchs has been notably short. Many of these monarchs acceded to the throne as a result of being first in an order of succession, while other monarchs claimed the throne as a result of some conflict.\n\nThe authenticity of some monarchs has been disputed, especially those who reigned during conflict. One factor in such debates is whether the monarch held the throne in a symbolic or nominal capacity. Two examples are\n\n*King [[Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angouleme|Louis XIX]] of France, who succeeded upon the abdication of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] only to abdicate in favour of [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Henry V]] instead of assuming the throne, and\n*Emperor [[Michael II of Russia]], who succeeded on the abdication of [[Nicholas II]] only to abdicate himself in favor of nobody.\n\n==Obscure monarchs thought to have reigned less than a year==\n''Note: Some of the following have been disputed as genuine monarchs''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  | Name\n!  | Country<br>or people\n!  | Royal house/dynasty\n!  | Reign began\n!  | Reign ended\n!  | Length\n! width=\"400pt\" | Comments\n|-\n| Shah [[Xerxes II]]\n| King of [[Persis|Persia]]\n| [[Achaemenid Empire]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | 424 BC\n| 45 days<br>(1 month 15 days)\n| Removed from the throne by [[Sogdianus]]\n|-\n| Queen [[Cleopatra IV of Egypt]]\n| Queen of [[Egypt]]\n| [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | 116 BC\n| \n| Pushed out of joint reign by her mother, [[Cleopatra III]]\n|-\n| King [[Zhao Jiande|Yang]]\n| [[Nanyue]]\n| [[Tri\u1ec7u dynasty|Zhao (Tri\u1ec7u)]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | 111 BC\n| \n| Captured and executed by the [[Han dynasty]] after his army was destroyed.

It includes [[Mount Surprise railway station]], [[Einasleigh railway station]], [[Wirra Wirra railway station]] and [[Forsayth railway station]]. Etheridge railway line was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 16 February 2009.<ref name=qhr>{{cite QHR|16398|Etheridge Railway|601637|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Etheridge Railway line, which branches off the [[Mareeba-to-Chillagoe railway]] at [[Almaden, Queensland|Almaden]] and heads south for {{convert|142|mi}} to Forsayth via Mount Surprise and [[Einasleigh, Queensland|Einasleigh]], was built between 1907 and 1910 by the [[Chillagoe Railway and Mining Company]] as a private railway line. The same company constructed the railway line from [[Mareeba]] to [[Chillagoe, Queensland|Chillagoe]] and [[Mungana, Queensland|Mungana]] between 1898 and 1901. The Etheridge line was built cheaply, with lighter rails and less earthworks than the Chillagoe line, to supply ore to the Chillagoe Company's under-utilised [[Chillagoe smelters]]. The Chillagoe Company was part of the business empire of [[John Moffat (mining pioneer)|John Moffat]], and between 1880 and 1914 much of the economic activity of [[North Queensland]] was driven by the railways and mining towns created by Moffat's enterprises. The remaining built infrastructure at stations along the Etheridge Railway provides examples of the type of buildings erected by the Chillagoe Company for its railway network.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nJohn Moffat arrived in [[Brisbane]] from [[Scotland]] in 1862, and in 1872 he opened a general store in [[Stanthorpe, Queensland|Stanthorpe]] with Robert Love, to take advantage of tin mining in the area. By 1880 Moffat decided to expand his tin-buying business to North Queensland, and that year his prospectors marked out a mineral freehold at the head of the Wild River, near [[Herberton, Queensland|Herberton]]. [[Stamping mill|Battery machinery]] was erected in 1881 at \"The Great Northern\" mine, and the Herberton Tin Company was formed. In 1884 the [[Loudoun Mill|Loudoun battery]] was established at Gibbs Creek and [[Irvinebank]] <nowiki/>(named after Moffat's birthplace) became Moffat's permanent headquarters. A tin smelter was also erected at Irvinebank in 1884, next to Moffat's residence [[Loudoun House, Irvinebank|Loudoun House]]. The Loudoun mill held a pivotal position in the North Queensland economy when Irvinebank was booming in 1899, and at its peak was the largest tin battery and smelter in Australia.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAs well as mining and smelting tin, Moffat was also interested in silver and copper. He opened a silver smelter at [[Montalbion, Queensland|Montalbion]] in 1886, and silver deposits were located at Muldiva in late 1889. In 1888 Moffat sent his prospectors to William Atherton's property at [[Chillagoe, Queensland|Chillagoe]] to look for copper, and Moffat soon monopolised the new field. The first copper smelter on the Chillagoe field was erected near the Boomerang mine at [[Calcifer, Queensland|Calcifer]] in 1894, and by 1897 there was also a copper smelter at Girofla (Mungana). However, Moffat had plans for a central ore smelter which would replace the Loudoun smelter and the small primitive mills located near individual mine groups.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nTo supply a central smelter, Moffat needed a network of railways to his mines. He had commissioned the survey of a railway route to Chillagoe in 1892, hoping for a land-grant railway, but the depression had stifled the proposal. The [[Queensland Government]]'s [[Tablelands railway line, Queensland|railway from Cairns]] reached [[Mareeba]] in the early 1890s and Moffat hoped to build a railway inland from this point. However, he needed capital for such a venture, and in 1897 he went to [[Melbourne]] to find investors, where he gained the attention of Charles William Chapman and James Smith Reid. In 1897 the Chillagoe Proprietary Company was formed. Reid and Chapman accompanied Moffat to Brisbane in November 1897 to present their railway proposal to the government. The resultant Mareeba to Chillagoe Railway Act of 1897 empowered the Chillagoe Proprietary Company to build a {{convert|96|mi|adj=on}} railway for {{A\u00a3|431,000}}, subject only to a government right of purchase after 50 years. In 1898 a new company, Chillagoe Railway and Mines Limited, was formed to take over the assets of the Chillagoe Proprietary Company.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe 1897 Act also approved a central smelter site at [[Barron Falls]], but a short-lived Labor Government quashed the project in December 1899. The Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company was forced to develop its central smelter inland, accruing high transport costs. A central smelter site was selected at Chillagoe Creek, and smelters were constructed during 1900 and 1901. From 1902 the smelters extracted gold, silver and copper from ore which was supplied from Redcap and Calcifer, and they also treated lead ore from the Girofla mine and Torpy's Crooked Creek silver lead mine. In 1901 a copper smelter was also built at [[Mount Garnet, Queensland|Mount Garnet]], where copper had been discovered in 1882, but this was not linked to the Company's rail network (at [[Lappa, Queensland|Lappa]]) until 1902.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nConstruction of a {{Track gauge|3 ft 6 in|lk=on}} gauge railway with {{convert|60|lb/yd|1}} steel rails was supervised by Archibald Smith Frew, the Chillagoe Company's Engineer-in-Charge, who had worked as an assistant to George Phillips on the [[Normanton to Croydon railway line]], built between 1888 and 1891. Construction of the Chillagoe line began in August 1898, and it opened to Lappa on 1 October 1900 and to Chillagoe and Mungana in 1901. Labourers were hired on piece-work, and substantial work was sub-contracted. Stone and concrete culverts and drains were inserted in all embankments over {{convert|3|ft}} high, and steel and masonry bridges were constructed.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nIn an attempt to obtain more copper ore for the [[Chillagoe smelters]], since ore reserves around Chillagoe had been overestimated, the Chillagoe Company sought to build a branch line from the Chillagoe Railway, south to the [[Shire of Etheridge|Etheridge goldfield]] and the [[Einasleigh Copper Mine and Smelter|Einasleigh copper mine]]. There had been a proposal by [[John Robb (civil engineer)|John Robb]] for a private railway to [[Georgetown, Queensland|Georgetown]] in 1890 and in 1902 the Einasleigh Freehold Mining Company proposed a tramway from Almaden to Einasleigh, but nothing eventuated. Negotiations between the Chillagoe Company and the Queensland Government occurred from 1904, and approval was finally given to build the railway subject to the provisions of the Etheridge Railway Act 1906. The Chillagoe Company agreed to build a railway to a point near Georgetown, for a cost not exceeding {{A\u00a3|450,000}}. The government would operate and maintain this private line for 15 years, guaranteeing the company a profit of 2.5% on its outlay, and then purchase the line. It was the first step towards the present system under which mineral railways are government owned and operated but built with private capital repaid out of profits.<ref name=qhr/>\n[[File:Chillagoe Railway and Mining Co. railway map.jpg|thumb|Chillagoe Railway and Mining Company railway map]]\nThe railway construction project was again overseen by Archibald Smith Frew, and began in 1907, branching off south from Almaden. The station at Almaden (not included within the heritage boundary of the Etheridge line) was opened in 1901. It became a busy centre for trucking cattle and servicing locomotives.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe Etheridge Railway was constructed in the most economical way possible using timber for the bridges, sharp curves, steep grades and light ({{frac|41|1|4}} pound per yard) rails. There were fewer earthworks than on the Mareeba to Chillagoe line, and minimal ballast was used under the sleepers. Despite controversy, the Chillagoe Company changed the line terminus from Georgetown to Charleston (Forsayth) because it was thought that the mines near Charleston were more promising than those near Georgetown.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nBy 31 August 1907 the railhead was at {{convert|12|mi}}. The line was opened to Mount Surprise in May 1908, and the railway station at Mount Surprise {{convert|108.5|km}} from Almaden) was named in December 1909. In 1916 Mount Surprise station had a gate, siding, telephone, scales, fork, cattle yards, and a horse and carriage loading bank. By 1932 it had a station building, closet, goods shed, loading bank, motor shed, camping quarters, two fettler's quarters, enginemen's quarters, coal stage, and cattle yards. Mount Surprise became an important cattle trucking centre after 1951, with the reconditioning of the line from Almaden for steam locomotives. In 1970 approval was given to erect the railway station building from Tumoulin at Mount Surprise as a cottage (removed 2008). A repair shed for the [[Savannahlander]] tourist railmotor and an interpretation centre were built in the mid-1990s.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAlthough construction was delayed by strikes in mid-1908 over the pay rate for railway workers, in February 1909 the line was opened to Einasleigh {{convert|165.5|km}} from Almaden. The Einasleigh copper mine was originally discovered by [[Richard Daintree]] in the mid 1860s, but the cost of transporting ore from the site made it uneconomic and it soon closed. The location was lost until the 1890s and a renewed interest in copper on the Etheridge field. A township known as Copperfield was established on the banks of the Copperfield River to service 12 copper mining leases extant by 1899, and this was surveyed as Einasleigh in 1900. The mine was reopened that year by the Einasleigh Freehold Mining Company, in which John Moffat had acquired an interest. By 1901 copper matte from a smelter at Einasleigh was being transported to Almaden by [[camel train]]. The coming of the Etheridge Railway in 1909 allowed Einasleigh to boom, and it was the largest centre on the Etheridge between 1907 and 1910. By 1910 six ore trains a week were running from Einasleigh to the Chillagoe smelters, and in 1911 the mine was purchased by the Chillagoe Company. It closed in 1914, and was reopened by the Queensland Government between 1920 and 1922.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nBy 1916 Einasleigh station consisted of a station building, siding, telephone, scales, fork, cattle yards, and a horse and cart loading bank. By 1935 it also had a goods shed (not extant). As both Einasleigh and Forsayth were expected to provide substantial amounts of copper ore, the importance of the towns' railway terminals meant that station master's houses, designed by Frew, were built at both towns. A branch line to the Einasleigh copper mine forked off to the north of the station, and today the remaining section off this line leads to cattle yards.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nBy July 1909 a train was running from Almaden to Reedy Springs (Wirra Wirra), and by the end of August 1909 cuttings and embankments had been made to within {{convert|7|mi}} of Charleston, with stone culverts and drains complete to {{convert|2|mi}} from Charleston. More earthworks were required on the Newcastle Range and Delaney Gorge sections than elsewhere on the line. Ore trains were running to Chillagoe from a terminus just short of Charleston by January 1910, and the terminus at {{convert|229.5|km}} from Almaden was renamed \"Forsayth\" in December 1910. The regular mixed train ran from Forsayth to Almaden three times a week, returning the next day, although there was only one train a week during [[World War I]]. By 1916 [[Forsayth railway station]] had a station building, siding, phone, scales, turning fork, cattle yards, and horse and cart loading bank. By 1935 it also had a gate and a goods shed. The cattle yards were rebuilt in 1970, but no cattle have been handled from the station since January 1993. The framed tent quarters date from about 1914, with 1930s additions.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe working and maintenance of the Etheridge railway was taken over by the government from 5 February 1911. From the beginning, cattle were transported from the various stations and sidings along the line, but this traffic increased in importance with the decline of mining. Apart from the main stations on the line there were a number of sidings, the majority situated between Almaden and Mount Surprise. Little survives at these sidings today, other than siding tracks, concrete slabs, some signals and points' equipment, loading banks and cattle yard remnants.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAround 1917 a lime burning business started at Ootann, {{convert|13|km}} south of Almaden, using old kilns used during the construction of the railway, and a siding was installed about 1918. Ootann was the limit of steam operation from 1927 to 1951. It had a shelter shed by 1935, and an overhead gantry for loading lime. The present main line was originally the siding, as the main line was moved to install the gantry. Gelaro at {{convert|30|km}} had a crossing loop, levers and a shelter shed by 1969. Bullock Creek at {{convert|52|km}} had a siding and railway phone by 1916, and was the site of a permanent fettler's (rail line maintenance worker's) camp by 1932. There was a side loading bank and shelter by 1935, and private cattle yards by 1951. A {{convert|30000|impgal|l|adj=on}} water tank was present, although this no longer exists. The loading of cattle at Bullock Creek ceased in late 1991.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nIn 1908 Lyndbrook at {{convert|69|km}} had a goods shed, engine shed, station house and forkline. It was named Lyndbrook in December 1909, and by 1935 it consisted of a siding, telephone, fork, side loading bank, shelter, and goods shed (the latter was removed that year). Private cattle yards existed by 1954, but no cattle have been loaded since January 1993. Fossilbrook Creek at {{convert|77|km}} consisted of a telephone in 1950. Nearby [[Fossilbrook, Queensland|Fossilbrook]] was a busy tin-mining town in 1905, with two hotels, but nothing remains of the town. [[Frewhurst, Queensland|Frewhurst]] at {{convert|88|km}} had a sawmill about 1908, and was named in 1909. By 1916 it had a gate, siding, telephone and loading bank. It had a shelter by 1935, and a private cattle yard by 1951, which was enlarged in the mid 1970s. Livestock has not been handled from Frewhurst since late 1991.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nSouth of Einasleigh, there was a siding at {{convert|178.6|km}} at Teasdale (Teesdale) adjacent to the Teasdale Mine. There was a hotel here in 1909, but nothing remains of this siding today, or of a sawmill siding {{convert|198|km}}. A siding at Reedy Springs at {{convert|208.5|km}} was renamed Wirra Wirra in December 1910. In 1916 it consisted of a gate, siding, telephone, and fork. By 1935 it also had a side loading bank and a shelter. A new stock yard was built in 1960.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe railway extension did not make a great deal of difference to the financial stability of the Chillagoe Company. The high cost of fuel for the smelters, a lack of ore, increasing wages, low metal prices and over-capitalisation on railways and smelters all contributed to the closure of the Chillagoe smelters. The Company asked for a government loan in February 1914 and when this was refused the company shut down its smelting and ore-buying operations. Ironically, the price of metal rose during the course of [[World War I]], while the smelters were idle.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nProtracted negotiations between the government and the Chillagoe Company led to the passing of The Chillagoe and Etheridge Railways Act 1918 and the resumption of the company assets, including the Etheridge Railway, on 20 June 1919. The Almaden to Forsayth line was purchased for {{A\u00a3|225,000}}. The Chillagoe smelters were reopened in January 1920, and were operated by the government until 1943.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nJohn Moffat retired in 1912, and died in June 1918. He helped develop North Queensland by bringing both public and private capital into the region, and from 1880 he had built up mining as the key foundation of the region's economy. His railway lines also assisted pastoralists, as railways resulted in cheaper rates for transporting supplies, and cattle could be sent to meatworks in better condition. Although gold mining briefly revived mining traffic on the Etheridge line in the 1930s, it was pastoralism that kept the towns of the Etheridge alive.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nIn January 1927 six bridges along the Etheridge line were destroyed by floods and the government sought to close the line beyond the lime works at Ootann, just south of Almaden. Due to public pressure the line was reopened in 1928, after the building of low-level bridges, but it was only maintained to standard suitable for use by railmotors. Steam trains did not operate on the line again until after the section from Almaden to Mount Surprise was reconditioned between 1949 and 1951 to allow the transport of heavier loads of cattle than could be pulled by diesel engines. This included adding {{convert|60|lb/yd|1}} rails on corners, regrading in six places, and one deviation. From the 1950s diesel-mechanical locomotives operated in multiple south of Mount Surprise to allow larger loads of cattle to be moved on the section of line to Forsayth. They were followed by diesel electric locomotives. This work assisted the cattle industry but the building of a bituminized \"Beef Road\" from Georgetown to Cairns reduced the use of the Etheridge line for cattle from the late 1960s. The use of steam locomotives to Mount Surprise ended in 1969.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe Etheridge line was closed again after floods in 1974, but reopened in December that year. In late 1994 and early 1995 the local community protested against the proposed ending of the Cairns to Forsayth freight and passenger rail service, which would leave only the Mount Surprise to Forsayth section of the Etheridge line operating as a tourist railway (the [[Savannahlander]]). Einasleigh's population blockaded the railway for four days in late December 1994, holding the \"Last Great Train Ride\" hostage. During this period the locals fed and housed the train passengers and crew until the blockade was lifted after negotiation with the police. The line from Mareeba to Mount Surprise was closed and the Savannahlander tourist railmotor started operation from Mount Surprise to Forsayth in April 1995. However, after an upgrade of the line for sugar syrup trains from Cairns to Arriga, and limited restoration of the rest of the line, the Savannahlander started travelling from Cairns to Forsayth in September 1998. Over four days the Savannahlander, operated by Cairns Kuranda Steam, travels to Mareeba, then west on the Chillagoe line as far as Almaden, before heading south to Forsayth on the Etheridge line and then returning to Cairns. It uses three railmotor units, including two [[2000 class railcar|2000 Class PD cars]] (1963) and one 2051 class PLDT car (1971). The Etheridge line is currently maintained by [[Queensland Rail]], on a contract basis for [[Queensland Transport]]. During 2007 and 2008 many of the Etheridge line's timber sleepers have been replaced with steel sleepers, leaving a 1:1 ratio of timber to steel.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Etheridge Railway line runs for about {{convert|230|km}} from Almaden to Forsayth, and the section from Mount Surprise to Forsayth (included in the heritage boundary) is about {{convert|121|km}} long. Built cheaply, the line rarely uses metal ballasting under the railway sleepers, and most sleepers are set directly onto the soil. Half of the sleepers are timber, and half are steel, due to a recent replacement project. Soon after heading south from Almaden, the rails change from {{convert|60|lb/yd}} to {{convert|41.25|lb/yd}}, with a noticeable increase in noise and vibration. The line tends to follow the lie of the land, with small cuttings and embankments, although there are larger earth embankments and cuttings on the Newcastle Range section of the line, between Einasleigh and Forsayth. The formation of the line between Almaden and Mount Surprise (not included within the heritage boundary) does not follow its original gradient, due to its reconditioning between 1949 and 1951.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe surviving railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle yards, loading banks, stone pitched bridges and culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes (for refilling the sand-dispensing units in front of train wheels), water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations and along the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth are significant.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== Mount Surprise railway station ===\n[[File:Etheridge railway - Mount Surprise. Water tank (2008).jpg|thumb|Water tank at Mount Surprise railway station, 2008]]\nThe significant elements of this station include: a steel semaphore signal frame and signal arm at the northeast end of the yards, west of the line; a turning fork southwest of the signal and to the north of the line (and associated points levers); a trolley [[shed]] south of the fork; two railway houses southwest of the fork and north of the line on Lot 73 SP127336; a metal sandbox, large water tank, tank stand and shower to the north of the modern carriage shelter built over the main line southwest of the fork; a siding south of the main line (and associated points levers); a goods shed on the south side of the siding; a station building southwest of the goods shed and north of the main line; and a timber shed southwest of the station building, on the north side of the main line. Non significant elements include: modern demountable buildings and a shelter shed at the apex of the fork; a modern highset house north of the main line on Lot 73 SP127336; the steel framed, [[gable]] roofed, corrugated zincalume-clad carriage shade over the main line, and the skillion roofed, steel framed and corrugated zincalume-clad interpretation shed northeast of the station building; a small timber shed just southwest of the water tank; and a QR telephone box southwest of the station building.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThe passenger station is a lowset timber-framed building, with chamferboard-clad walls and a skillion corrugated iron roof that has been extended to form an [[awning]] supported by straight timber [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. The central waiting area has a picket fence and gate, toilets are on the left hand side of the building, and an office with a stable style door is on the right. Some original sash windows survive. There is a modern plastic water tank to the rear of the station building (not significant). The goods shed is a lowset, timber-framed building clad in corrugated iron. Its gabled corrugated iron roof has an awning over a loading platform on the north-west elevation which is supported by curved timber brackets. The goods shed has timber doors on its north- west, south-west and south-east elevations, and narrow windows on the north-east and south-west elevations. A plastic water tank on the north-east elevation is not significant. The small, gable-roofed timber shed south-west of the station building is clad in chamferboard, with an exposed stud to the exterior. It stands on a recent timber and steel platform, has a single timber door on its south-east elevation, a double timber door on its north-west elevation, and fixed timber louvers at each end. The area between the above three buildings has been turfed, up to and between the rails, which gives the appearance that the train is running on grass.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe large riveted iron water tank on a timber stand provided water for engines and the station complex. There is an unused corrugated iron- clad shower room underneath the tank stand, which contains the remains of plumbing fittings. The five-bay trolley shed is clad in corrugated iron, with a skillion roof, and gates of timber battens. The two lowset, gable-roofed houses north of the line are timber-framed, and clad in timber and fibrous cement sheeting. Their yards have gates opening into the railway station area.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== Einasleigh railway station ===\n[[File:Etheridge railway - Einasleigh station (2008).jpg|thumb|Einasleigh railway station, 2008]]\nThe significant elements of this station include semaphore signal frames (no signal arms) and sand boxes at the approaches to each end of the station; a siding north of the main line and a small siding south of the main line (and any associated points levers); the station building to the south of the main line; a small shed to the north-east of the station building; a loading bank south-west of the station building; and a loading bank on the north side of the northern siding (site of the removed goods shed), to the south-west of the station building. The fork line north of the station, and the cattle yards at the apex of the fork, are also significant, although they are outside the railway reserve. The nearby [[Station Master's Residence, Einasleigh|station master's residence at Einasleigh]] is separately listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Non-significant elements of the station include: a modern metal-clad storage shed to the north of the northern siding, to the northeast of the station building; a QR telephone box and a communications tower behind the station building; two concrete water tanks southwest of the station building; and a recent metal clad three-bay trolley shed at the southwest end of the station, south of the main line.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThe skillion-roofed passenger station is lowset, and is clad with weatherboards over a timber frame. Straight timber brackets support the awning, and there is a picket fence to the waiting shed section at the south-west end of the building. An office is at the centre of the building, with toilets at the north-east end. The small gable-roofed shed is clad in corrugated iron, and is set on concrete stumps. It has double timber doors and a small timber loading platform on its north- west elevation, which is reached by modern steel steps with a steel balustrade. The loading banks are made of earth, with retaining walls made with a combination of concrete, steel and timber.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== Forsayth railway station ===\nThe significant elements of Forsayth Station include: a semaphore signal frame with signal arm at the east end of the yards, south of the main line; a trolley shed south of the line at the east end of the station; a siding north of the main line, and a turning fork north of the main line; another trolley shed south of the main line near the start of the east arm of the fork; a sandbox and a points lever to the east of the second trolley shed; loading bank and a signal lever south of the main line; a station building to the south of the main line and west of the loading bank; a goods shed north of the siding and west of the station building; cattle yards west of the fork; a loading bank east of the apex of the fork; and a framed tent quarters east of the apex of the fork. The nearby [[Station Master's Residence, Forsayth|station master's residence at Forsayth]] is separately listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Non-significant elements include: modern demountable buildings east of the station; modern toilets east of the fork line; a shelter shed for a DR2 diesel locomotive (one of a number which hauled stock on the Etheridge line) south of the main line; and a large modern steel shed on the west side of the cattle yards.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThe station building is a lowset, chamferboard-clad, timber-framed building standing on concrete stumps. It has a skillion roof clad in corrugated steel with modern gutters and downpipes, and the building has been partly reclad in Hardiplank. The original windows have been replaced. The building has been modified internally, and now consists of a women's toilet and an office, the shelter section having been enclosed. Two plastic water tanks to the south of the building are not significant. The gable-roofed goods shed is clad with corrugated iron, and the awning over the small timber [[loading dock]] on the southern elevation is supported on curved timber brackets. There is a concrete loading dock on the east elevation of the goods shed, which has timber doors on its north, south and east elevations. The two skillion roofed, two-bay trolley [[sheds]] are clad in corrugated iron, with corrugated iron sliding doors. The loading bank near the station building is made of earth, with concrete retaining walls, as is the loading bank near the tent quarters.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe framed tent quarters consist of two gable-roofed structures and a skillion-roofed bathroom. The northern structure is clad with corrugated iron and has a skillion-roofed stove recess to the north, and the southern structure is clad with chamferboard with timber studs exposed internally. Just to the east of the northern structure is a small bathroom clad with fibrous cement sheeting. All three elements of the quarters are linked by an open timber deck. The two main structures stand on concrete stumps, while the bathroom stands on metal stumps. The roof of the southern structure used to be supported independently on freestanding timber posts and over-sailed the ceiling line in the form of a tent. This has collapsed to the ground, although the roof of the southern structure is still clad with timber boards. There are two tank stands, to the east and west of the quarters, although only the east stand still has a corrugated iron tank. A corrugated iron-clad earth closet is located to the north of the quarters. The cattle yards are steel; with a loading ramp to the fork, and the northern section of the yards is made of timber.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== The Newcastle Range and Delaney Gorge section of line ===\nThe section of the Etheridge Railway over the Newcastle range and through the Delaney Gorge has more earthworks than the rest of the railway. The railway track runs along the north face of the Delaney Gorge and along the bed of the Delaney River for a short distance. The significant elements within this section of the railway include any stone pitched bridge piers and abutments, stone pitched culverts, and stone cuttings. A large stone pitched culvert is located near Native Well, east of Wirra Wirra. A bridge over Starlight Creek, just east of Delaney Gorge, has stone piers and abutments, and a small bridge just east of Wirra Wirra has stone abutments. Bridges constructed with stonework are significant due to their rarity on the Etheridge line.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThere is a siding at Wirra Wirra, {{convert|208.5|km}} from Almaden), on the tableland of the Newcastle Range. Within the rail reserve there is a remnant of the east branch of the fork; and concrete slabs and concrete water tank footings south of the main line. Outside the railway reserve, near the location of the removed western arm of the fork, there is an earth and steel loading bank and some timber cattle yard posts. The modern QR telephone box and its supporting infrastructure are not significant.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== Non-significant elements ===\n[[File:Etheridge railway - Copperfield River bridge from Einasleigh end (2008).jpg|thumb|Copperfield River bridge, 2008]]\nThe line has a large number of short timber trestle bridges with concrete abutments, along with a smaller number of medium-size timber trestle bridges, such as the High Bridge in the Delaney Gorge. Longer bridges on the line include those at Junction Creek, Lighthouse Creek, the Einasleigh River and the Copperfield River. Some bridges have one or more concrete piers, and some timbers have been replaced with steel. The bridges without stonework are not of cultural heritage significance, as they were designed to be cheaply replaced if damaged during floods, and the larger bridges have been replaced at various times; for example the Copperfield Bridge was destroyed in 1927, 1980 and 2002.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThere are a number of small concrete culverts and open drains, concrete retaining walls in the Delaney Gorge, and modern Queensland Rail communications installations at the stations and Wirra Wirra siding which are not significant. The sleepers of the main line within the railway reserve are not significant.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nEtheridge Railway was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 16 February 2009 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''\n\nThe Etheridge Railway, constructed by John Moffat's Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company between 1907 and 1910, was a significant component of an important, large-scale, privately built mining railway network in North Queensland and is important in demonstrating the widespread development of mining and transport infrastructure in this part of the State.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe railway stations at Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth and the route of the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth, including surviving railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, loading banks, stone pitched bridges and culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure, are important surviving evidence of the efforts of the Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company to supply copper ore to its smelters at Chillagoe.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe arrangement under which the State government maintained and operated the Etheridge Railway initially as a private line - with an option to purchase after 15 years - was the first step towards the present system under which mineral railways are government owned and operated but built with private capital repaid out of profits.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe station complexes at the mining towns of Einasleigh and Forsayth demonstrate the economic importance of these locations to the Chillagoe Company. Both stations have impressive triple-gabled station master's residences designed by AS Frew.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe Mount Surprise railway station complex and other remaining evidence of cattle transportation at the main stations along the Etheridge Railway, such as cattle yards and loading banks, are important in demonstrating the role that the railway played in maintaining pastoral activity in the area before the construction of the bitumen \"Beef Road\" in the 1960s.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.'''\n\nThe tent quarters at Forsayth is a rare surviving Queensland example of its type, and provides evidence of the amenities considered appropriate for railway workers in the early twentieth century.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe large iron water tank at Mount Surprise is a good example of a type now becoming rare.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''\n\nThe surviving railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle yards, loading banks, stone pitched bridges and culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations and along the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth all demonstrate the principal characteristics of a railway line that was used for mining and pastoral purposes.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe route and formation of the line between Mount Surprise and Forsayth, with its steep gradients and sharp curves and accompanying lack of earthworks, along with the relative lack of steel, stone or brick bridge piers and abutments, demonstrates the nature of a railway line that was built as economically as possible. The section of the railway over the Newcastle Range and through the Delaney Gorge, although it has more earthworks and stone cuttings than any other section of the railway, also demonstrates a cheap form of railway construction, due to its sharp curves and steep gradients.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe Mount Surprise station complex has the most intact group of railway buildings, and its station building, goods shed, small timber shed and water tank are all good examples of their type. Other elements, such as two railway houses, a trolley shed, sandbox, sidings, turning fork and signals and points levers all contribute to an understanding of how a rural railway station functioned. The shower under the water tank illustrates the past lifestyle of railway workers.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''\n\nThe Etheridge Railway was an essential element of the business empire of John Moffat and the Chillagoe Company. Between 1880 and 1914 much of the economic activity of North Queensland was driven by the railways and mining towns created by Moffat's enterprises.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{QHR-CC-2014}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category-inline|Etheridge railway line}}\n\n{{Railway lines in Queensland}}\n{{Australian railway bridges|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Queensland Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Forsayth, Queensland]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Queensland]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Etheridge Railway]]\n[[Category:Mount Surprise, Queensland]]\n[[Category:Einasleigh, Queensland]]\n[[Category:Railway bridges in Queensland]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Article title: '''Etheridge Railway''' siteId: 16398 placeRef:601637 -->\n{{Use Australian English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox historic site \n| name = Etheridge railway line\n| image =Etheridge railway - Typical small bridge, concrete abutments.

It includes [[Mount Surprise railway station]], [[Einasleigh railway station]], [[Wirra Wirra railway station]] and [[Forsayth railway station]]. Etheridge railway line was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 16 February 2009.<ref name=qhr>{{cite QHR|16398|Etheridge Railway|601637|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Etheridge Railway line, which branches off the [[Mareeba-to-Chillagoe railway]] at [[Almaden, Queensland|Almaden]] and heads south for {{convert|142|mi}} to Forsayth via Mount Surprise and [[Einasleigh, Queensland|Einasleigh]], was built between 1907 and 1910 by the [[Chillagoe Railway and Mining Company]] as a private railway line. The same company constructed the railway line from [[Mareeba]] to [[Chillagoe, Queensland|Chillagoe]] and [[Mungana, Queensland|Mungana]] between 1898 and 1901. The Etheridge line was built cheaply, with lighter rails and less earthworks than the Chillagoe line, to supply ore to the Chillagoe Company's under-utilised [[Chillagoe smelters]]. The Chillagoe Company was part of the business empire of [[John Moffat (mining pioneer)|John Moffat]], and between 1880 and 1914 much of the economic activity of [[North Queensland]] was driven by the railways and mining towns created by Moffat's enterprises. The remaining built infrastructure at stations along the Etheridge Railway provides examples of the type of buildings erected by the Chillagoe Company for its railway network.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nJohn Moffat arrived in [[Brisbane]] from [[Scotland]] in 1862, and in 1872 he opened a general store in [[Stanthorpe, Queensland|Stanthorpe]] with Robert Love, to take advantage of tin mining in the area. By 1880 Moffat decided to expand his tin-buying business to North Queensland, and that year his prospectors marked out a mineral freehold at the head of the Wild River, near [[Herberton, Queensland|Herberton]]. [[Stamping mill|Battery machinery]] was erected in 1881 at \"The Great Northern\" mine, and the Herberton Tin Company was formed. In 1884 the [[Loudoun Mill|Loudoun battery]] was established at Gibbs Creek and [[Irvinebank]] <nowiki/>(named after Moffat's birthplace) became Moffat's permanent headquarters. A tin smelter was also erected at Irvinebank in 1884, next to Moffat's residence [[Loudoun House, Irvinebank|Loudoun House]]. The Loudoun mill held a pivotal position in the North Queensland economy when Irvinebank was booming in 1899, and at its peak was the largest tin battery and smelter in Australia.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAs well as mining and smelting tin, Moffat was also interested in silver and copper. He opened a silver smelter at [[Montalbion, Queensland|Montalbion]] in 1886, and silver deposits were located at Muldiva in late 1889. In 1888 Moffat sent his prospectors to William Atherton's property at [[Chillagoe, Queensland|Chillagoe]] to look for copper, and Moffat soon monopolised the new field. The first copper smelter on the Chillagoe field was erected near the Boomerang mine at [[Calcifer, Queensland|Calcifer]] in 1894, and by 1897 there was also a copper smelter at Girofla (Mungana). However, Moffat had plans for a central ore smelter which would replace the Loudoun smelter and the small primitive mills located near individual mine groups.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nTo supply a central smelter, Moffat needed a network of railways to his mines. He had commissioned the survey of a railway route to Chillagoe in 1892, hoping for a land-grant railway, but the depression had stifled the proposal. The [[Queensland Government]]'s [[Tablelands railway line, Queensland|railway from Cairns]] reached [[Mareeba]] in the early 1890s and Moffat hoped to build a railway inland from this point. However, he needed capital for such a venture, and in 1897 he went to [[Melbourne]] to find investors, where he gained the attention of Charles William Chapman and James Smith Reid. In 1897 the Chillagoe Proprietary Company was formed. Reid and Chapman accompanied Moffat to Brisbane in November 1897 to present their railway proposal to the government. The resultant Mareeba to Chillagoe Railway Act of 1897 empowered the Chillagoe Proprietary Company to build a {{convert|96|mi|adj=on}} railway for {{A\u00a3|431,000}}, subject only to a government right of purchase after 50 years. In 1898 a new company, Chillagoe Railway and Mines Limited, was formed to take over the assets of the Chillagoe Proprietary Company.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe 1897 Act also approved a central smelter site at [[Barron Falls]], but a short-lived Labor Government quashed the project in December 1899. The Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company was forced to develop its central smelter inland, accruing high transport costs. A central smelter site was selected at Chillagoe Creek, and smelters were constructed during 1900 and 1901. From 1902 the smelters extracted gold, silver and copper from ore which was supplied from Redcap and Calcifer, and they also treated lead ore from the Girofla mine and Torpy's Crooked Creek silver lead mine. In 1901 a copper smelter was also built at [[Mount Garnet, Queensland|Mount Garnet]], where copper had been discovered in 1882, but this was not linked to the Company's rail network (at [[Lappa, Queensland|Lappa]]) until 1902.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nConstruction of a {{Track gauge|3 ft 6 in|lk=on}} gauge railway with {{convert|60|lb/yd|1}} steel rails was supervised by Archibald Smith Frew, the Chillagoe Company's Engineer-in-Charge, who had worked as an assistant to George Phillips on the [[Normanton to Croydon railway line]], built between 1888 and 1891. Construction of the Chillagoe line began in August 1898, and it opened to Lappa on 1 October 1900 and to Chillagoe and Mungana in 1901. Labourers were hired on piece-work, and substantial work was sub-contracted. Stone and concrete culverts and drains were inserted in all embankments over {{convert|3|ft}} high, and steel and masonry bridges were constructed.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nIn an attempt to obtain more copper ore for the [[Chillagoe smelters]], since ore reserves around Chillagoe had been overestimated, the Chillagoe Company sought to build a branch line from the Chillagoe Railway, south to the [[Shire of Etheridge|Etheridge goldfield]] and the [[Einasleigh Copper Mine and Smelter|Einasleigh copper mine]]. There had been a proposal by [[John Robb (civil engineer)|John Robb]] for a private railway to [[Georgetown, Queensland|Georgetown]] in 1890 and in 1902 the Einasleigh Freehold Mining Company proposed a tramway from Almaden to Einasleigh, but nothing eventuated. Negotiations between the Chillagoe Company and the Queensland Government occurred from 1904, and approval was finally given to build the railway subject to the provisions of the Etheridge Railway Act 1906. The Chillagoe Company agreed to build a railway to a point near Georgetown, for a cost not exceeding {{A\u00a3|450,000}}. The government would operate and maintain this private line for 15 years, guaranteeing the company a profit of 2.5% on its outlay, and then purchase the line. It was the first step towards the present system under which mineral railways are government owned and operated but built with private capital repaid out of profits.<ref name=qhr/>\n[[File:Chillagoe Railway and Mining Co. railway map.jpg|thumb|Chillagoe Railway and Mining Company railway map]]\nThe railway construction project was again overseen by Archibald Smith Frew, and began in 1907, branching off south from Almaden. The station at Almaden (not included within the heritage boundary of the Etheridge line) was opened in 1901. It became a busy centre for trucking cattle and servicing locomotives.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe Etheridge Railway was constructed in the most economical way possible using timber for the bridges, sharp curves, steep grades and light ({{frac|41|1|4}} pound per yard) rails. There were fewer earthworks than on the Mareeba to Chillagoe line, and minimal ballast was used under the sleepers. Despite controversy, the Chillagoe Company changed the line terminus from Georgetown to Charleston (Forsayth) because it was thought that the mines near Charleston were more promising than those near Georgetown.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nBy 31 August 1907 the railhead was at {{convert|12|mi}}. The line was opened to Mount Surprise in May 1908, and the railway station at Mount Surprise {{convert|108.5|km}} from Almaden) was named in December 1909. In 1916 Mount Surprise station had a gate, siding, telephone, scales, fork, cattle yards, and a horse and carriage loading bank. By 1932 it had a station building, closet, goods shed, loading bank, motor shed, camping quarters, two fettler's quarters, enginemen's quarters, coal stage, and cattle yards. Mount Surprise became an important cattle trucking centre after 1951, with the reconditioning of the line from Almaden for steam locomotives. In 1970 approval was given to erect the railway station building from Tumoulin at Mount Surprise as a cottage (removed 2008). A repair shed for the [[Savannahlander]] tourist railmotor and an interpretation centre were built in the mid-1990s.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAlthough construction was delayed by strikes in mid-1908 over the pay rate for railway workers, in February 1909 the line was opened to Einasleigh {{convert|165.5|km}} from Almaden. The Einasleigh copper mine was originally discovered by [[Richard Daintree]] in the mid 1860s, but the cost of transporting ore from the site made it uneconomic and it soon closed. The location was lost until the 1890s and a renewed interest in copper on the Etheridge field. A township known as Copperfield was established on the banks of the Copperfield River to service 12 copper mining leases extant by 1899, and this was surveyed as Einasleigh in 1900. The mine was reopened that year by the Einasleigh Freehold Mining Company, in which John Moffat had acquired an interest. By 1901 copper matte from a smelter at Einasleigh was being transported to Almaden by [[camel train]]. The coming of the Etheridge Railway in 1909 allowed Einasleigh to boom, and it was the largest centre on the Etheridge between 1907 and 1910. By 1910 six ore trains a week were running from Einasleigh to the Chillagoe smelters, and in 1911 the mine was purchased by the Chillagoe Company. It closed in 1914, and was reopened by the Queensland Government between 1920 and 1922.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nBy 1916 Einasleigh station consisted of a station building, siding, telephone, scales, fork, cattle yards, and a horse and cart loading bank. By 1935 it also had a goods shed (not extant). As both Einasleigh and Forsayth were expected to provide substantial amounts of copper ore, the importance of the towns' railway terminals meant that station master's houses, designed by Frew, were built at both towns. A branch line to the Einasleigh copper mine forked off to the north of the station, and today the remaining section off this line leads to cattle yards.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nBy July 1909 a train was running from Almaden to Reedy Springs (Wirra Wirra), and by the end of August 1909 cuttings and embankments had been made to within {{convert|7|mi}} of Charleston, with stone culverts and drains complete to {{convert|2|mi}} from Charleston. More earthworks were required on the Newcastle Range and Delaney Gorge sections than elsewhere on the line. Ore trains were running to Chillagoe from a terminus just short of Charleston by January 1910, and the terminus at {{convert|229.5|km}} from Almaden was renamed \"Forsayth\" in December 1910. The regular mixed train ran from Forsayth to Almaden three times a week, returning the next day, although there was only one train a week during [[World War I]]. By 1916 [[Forsayth railway station]] had a station building, siding, phone, scales, turning fork, cattle yards, and horse and cart loading bank. By 1935 it also had a gate and a goods shed. The cattle yards were rebuilt in 1970, but no cattle have been handled from the station since January 1993. The framed tent quarters date from about 1914, with 1930s additions.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe working and maintenance of the Etheridge railway was taken over by the government from 5 February 1911. From the beginning, cattle were transported from the various stations and sidings along the line, but this traffic increased in importance with the decline of mining. Apart from the main stations on the line there were a number of sidings, the majority situated between Almaden and Mount Surprise. Little survives at these sidings today, other than siding tracks, concrete slabs, some signals and points' equipment, loading banks and cattle yard remnants.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAround 1917 a lime burning business started at Ootann, {{convert|13|km}} south of Almaden, using old kilns used during the construction of the railway, and a siding was installed about 1918. Ootann was the limit of steam operation from 1927 to 1951. It had a shelter shed by 1935, and an overhead gantry for loading lime. The present main line was originally the siding, as the main line was moved to install the gantry. Gelaro at {{convert|30|km}} had a crossing loop, levers and a shelter shed by 1969. Bullock Creek at {{convert|52|km}} had a siding and railway phone by 1916, and was the site of a permanent fettler's (rail line maintenance worker's) camp by 1932. There was a side loading bank and shelter by 1935, and private cattle yards by 1951. A {{convert|30000|impgal|l|adj=on}} water tank was present, although this no longer exists. The loading of cattle at Bullock Creek ceased in late 1991.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nIn 1908 Lyndbrook at {{convert|69|km}} had a goods shed, engine shed, station house and forkline. It was named Lyndbrook in December 1909, and by 1935 it consisted of a siding, telephone, fork, side loading bank, shelter, and goods shed (the latter was removed that year). Private cattle yards existed by 1954, but no cattle have been loaded since January 1993. Fossilbrook Creek at {{convert|77|km}} consisted of a telephone in 1950. Nearby [[Fossilbrook, Queensland|Fossilbrook]] was a busy tin-mining town in 1905, with two hotels, but nothing remains of the town. [[Frewhurst, Queensland|Frewhurst]] at {{convert|88|km}} had a sawmill about 1908, and was named in 1909. By 1916 it had a gate, siding, telephone and loading bank. It had a shelter by 1935, and a private cattle yard by 1951, which was enlarged in the mid 1970s. Livestock has not been handled from Frewhurst since late 1991.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nSouth of Einasleigh, there was a siding at {{convert|178.6|km}} at Teasdale (Teesdale) adjacent to the Teasdale Mine. There was a hotel here in 1909, but nothing remains of this siding today, or of a sawmill siding {{convert|198|km}}. A siding at Reedy Springs at {{convert|208.5|km}} was renamed Wirra Wirra in December 1910. In 1916 it consisted of a gate, siding, telephone, and fork. By 1935 it also had a side loading bank and a shelter. A new stock yard was built in 1960.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe railway extension did not make a great deal of difference to the financial stability of the Chillagoe Company. The high cost of fuel for the smelters, a lack of ore, increasing wages, low metal prices and over-capitalisation on railways and smelters all contributed to the closure of the Chillagoe smelters. The Company asked for a government loan in February 1914 and when this was refused the company shut down its smelting and ore-buying operations. Ironically, the price of metal rose during the course of [[World War I]], while the smelters were idle.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nProtracted negotiations between the government and the Chillagoe Company led to the passing of The Chillagoe and Etheridge Railways Act 1918 and the resumption of the company assets, including the Etheridge Railway, on 20 June 1919. The Almaden to Forsayth line was purchased for {{A\u00a3|225,000}}. The Chillagoe smelters were reopened in January 1920, and were operated by the government until 1943.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nJohn Moffat retired in 1912, and died in June 1918. He helped develop North Queensland by bringing both public and private capital into the region, and from 1880 he had built up mining as the key foundation of the region's economy. His railway lines also assisted pastoralists, as railways resulted in cheaper rates for transporting supplies, and cattle could be sent to meatworks in better condition. Although gold mining briefly revived mining traffic on the Etheridge line in the 1930s, it was pastoralism that kept the towns of the Etheridge alive.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nIn January 1927 six bridges along the Etheridge line were destroyed by floods and the government sought to close the line beyond the lime works at Ootann, just south of Almaden. Due to public pressure the line was reopened in 1928, after the building of low-level bridges, but it was only maintained to standard suitable for use by railmotors. Steam trains did not operate on the line again until after the section from Almaden to Mount Surprise was reconditioned between 1949 and 1951 to allow the transport of heavier loads of cattle than could be pulled by diesel engines. This included adding {{convert|60|lb/yd|1}} rails on corners, regrading in six places, and one deviation. From the 1950s diesel-mechanical locomotives operated in multiple south of Mount Surprise to allow larger loads of cattle to be moved on the section of line to Forsayth. They were followed by diesel electric locomotives. This work assisted the cattle industry but the building of a bituminized \"Beef Road\" from Georgetown to Cairns reduced the use of the Etheridge line for cattle from the late 1960s. The use of steam locomotives to Mount Surprise ended in 1969.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe Etheridge line was closed again after floods in 1974, but reopened in December that year. In late 1994 and early 1995 the local community protested against the proposed ending of the Cairns to Forsayth freight and passenger rail service, which would leave only the Mount Surprise to Forsayth section of the Etheridge line operating as a tourist railway (the [[Savannahlander]]). Einasleigh's population blockaded the railway for four days in late December 1994, holding the \"Last Great Train Ride\" hostage. During this period the locals fed and housed the train passengers and crew until the blockade was lifted after negotiation with the police. The line from Mareeba to Mount Surprise was closed and the Savannahlander tourist railmotor started operation from Mount Surprise to Forsayth in April 1995. However, after an upgrade of the line for sugar syrup trains from Cairns to Arriga, and limited restoration of the rest of the line, the Savannahlander started travelling from Cairns to Forsayth in September 1998. Over four days the Savannahlander, operated by Cairns Kuranda Steam, travels to Mareeba, then west on the Chillagoe line as far as Almaden, before heading south to Forsayth on the Etheridge line and then returning to Cairns. It uses three railmotor units, including two [[2000 class railcar|2000 Class PD cars]] (1963) and one 2051 class PLDT car (1971). The Etheridge line is currently maintained by [[Queensland Rail]], on a contract basis for [[Queensland Transport]]. During 2007 and 2008 many of the Etheridge line's timber sleepers have been replaced with steel sleepers, leaving a 1:1 ratio of timber to steel.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Etheridge Railway line runs for about {{convert|230|km}} from Almaden to Forsayth, and the section from Mount Surprise to Forsayth (included in the heritage boundary) is about {{convert|121|km}} long. Built cheaply, the line rarely uses metal ballasting under the railway sleepers, and most sleepers are set directly onto the soil. Half of the sleepers are timber, and half are steel, due to a recent replacement project. Soon after heading south from Almaden, the rails change from {{convert|60|lb/yd}} to {{convert|41.25|lb/yd}}, with a noticeable increase in noise and vibration. The line tends to follow the lie of the land, with small cuttings and embankments, although there are larger earth embankments and cuttings on the Newcastle Range section of the line, between Einasleigh and Forsayth. The formation of the line between Almaden and Mount Surprise (not included within the heritage boundary) does not follow its original gradient, due to its reconditioning between 1949 and 1951.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe surviving railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle yards, loading banks, stone pitched bridges and culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes (for refilling the sand-dispensing units in front of train wheels), water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations and along the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth are significant.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== Mount Surprise railway station ===\n[[File:Etheridge railway - Mount Surprise. Water tank (2008).jpg|thumb|Water tank at Mount Surprise railway station, 2008]]\nThe significant elements of this station include: a steel semaphore signal frame and signal arm at the northeast end of the yards, west of the line; a turning fork southwest of the signal and to the north of the line (and associated points levers); a trolley [[shed]] south of the fork; two railway houses southwest of the fork and north of the line on Lot 73 SP127336; a metal sandbox, large water tank, tank stand and shower to the north of the modern carriage shelter built over the main line southwest of the fork; a siding south of the main line (and associated points levers); a goods shed on the south side of the siding; a station building southwest of the goods shed and north of the main line; and a timber shed southwest of the station building, on the north side of the main line. Non significant elements include: modern demountable buildings and a shelter shed at the apex of the fork; a modern highset house north of the main line on Lot 73 SP127336; the steel framed, [[gable]] roofed, corrugated zincalume-clad carriage shade over the main line, and the skillion roofed, steel framed and corrugated zincalume-clad interpretation shed northeast of the station building; a small timber shed just southwest of the water tank; and a QR telephone box southwest of the station building.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThe passenger station is a lowset timber-framed building, with chamferboard-clad walls and a skillion corrugated iron roof that has been extended to form an [[awning]] supported by straight timber [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. The central waiting area has a picket fence and gate, toilets are on the left hand side of the building, and an office with a stable style door is on the right. Some original sash windows survive. There is a modern plastic water tank to the rear of the station building (not significant). The goods shed is a lowset, timber-framed building clad in corrugated iron. Its gabled corrugated iron roof has an awning over a loading platform on the north-west elevation which is supported by curved timber brackets. The goods shed has timber doors on its north- west, south-west and south-east elevations, and narrow windows on the north-east and south-west elevations. A plastic water tank on the north-east elevation is not significant. The small, gable-roofed timber shed south-west of the station building is clad in chamferboard, with an exposed stud to the exterior. It stands on a recent timber and steel platform, has a single timber door on its south-east elevation, a double timber door on its north-west elevation, and fixed timber louvers at each end. The area between the above three buildings has been turfed, up to and between the rails, which gives the appearance that the train is running on grass.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe large riveted iron water tank on a timber stand provided water for engines and the station complex. There is an unused corrugated iron- clad shower room underneath the tank stand, which contains the remains of plumbing fittings. The five-bay trolley shed is clad in corrugated iron, with a skillion roof, and gates of timber battens. The two lowset, gable-roofed houses north of the line are timber-framed, and clad in timber and fibrous cement sheeting. Their yards have gates opening into the railway station area.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== Einasleigh railway station ===\n[[File:Etheridge railway - Einasleigh station (2008).jpg|thumb|Einasleigh railway station, 2008]]\nThe significant elements of this station include semaphore signal frames (no signal arms) and sand boxes at the approaches to each end of the station; a siding north of the main line and a small siding south of the main line (and any associated points levers); the station building to the south of the main line; a small shed to the north-east of the station building; a loading bank south-west of the station building; and a loading bank on the north side of the northern siding (site of the removed goods shed), to the south-west of the station building. The fork line north of the station, and the cattle yards at the apex of the fork, are also significant, although they are outside the railway reserve. The nearby [[Station Master's Residence, Einasleigh|station master's residence at Einasleigh]] is separately listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Non-significant elements of the station include: a modern metal-clad storage shed to the north of the northern siding, to the northeast of the station building; a QR telephone box and a communications tower behind the station building; two concrete water tanks southwest of the station building; and a recent metal clad three-bay trolley shed at the southwest end of the station, south of the main line.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThe skillion-roofed passenger station is lowset, and is clad with weatherboards over a timber frame. Straight timber brackets support the awning, and there is a picket fence to the waiting shed section at the south-west end of the building. An office is at the centre of the building, with toilets at the north-east end. The small gable-roofed shed is clad in corrugated iron, and is set on concrete stumps. It has double timber doors and a small timber loading platform on its north- west elevation, which is reached by modern steel steps with a steel balustrade. The loading banks are made of earth, with retaining walls made with a combination of concrete, steel and timber.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== Forsayth railway station ===\nThe significant elements of Forsayth Station include: a semaphore signal frame with signal arm at the east end of the yards, south of the main line; a trolley shed south of the line at the east end of the station; a siding north of the main line, and a turning fork north of the main line; another trolley shed south of the main line near the start of the east arm of the fork; a sandbox and a points lever to the east of the second trolley shed; loading bank and a signal lever south of the main line; a station building to the south of the main line and west of the loading bank; a goods shed north of the siding and west of the station building; cattle yards west of the fork; a loading bank east of the apex of the fork; and a framed tent quarters east of the apex of the fork. The nearby [[Station Master's Residence, Forsayth|station master's residence at Forsayth]] is separately listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Non-significant elements include: modern demountable buildings east of the station; modern toilets east of the fork line; a shelter shed for a DR2 diesel locomotive (one of a number which hauled stock on the Etheridge line) south of the main line; and a large modern steel shed on the west side of the cattle yards.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThe station building is a lowset, chamferboard-clad, timber-framed building standing on concrete stumps. It has a skillion roof clad in corrugated steel with modern gutters and downpipes, and the building has been partly reclad in Hardiplank. The original windows have been replaced. The building has been modified internally, and now consists of a women's toilet and an office, the shelter section having been enclosed. Two plastic water tanks to the south of the building are not significant. The gable-roofed goods shed is clad with corrugated iron, and the awning over the small timber [[loading dock]] on the southern elevation is supported on curved timber brackets. There is a concrete loading dock on the east elevation of the goods shed, which has timber doors on its north, south and east elevations. The two skillion roofed, two-bay trolley [[sheds]] are clad in corrugated iron, with corrugated iron sliding doors. The loading bank near the station building is made of earth, with concrete retaining walls, as is the loading bank near the tent quarters.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe framed tent quarters consist of two gable-roofed structures and a skillion-roofed bathroom. The northern structure is clad with corrugated iron and has a skillion-roofed stove recess to the north, and the southern structure is clad with chamferboard with timber studs exposed internally. Just to the east of the northern structure is a small bathroom clad with fibrous cement sheeting. All three elements of the quarters are linked by an open timber deck. The two main structures stand on concrete stumps, while the bathroom stands on metal stumps. The roof of the southern structure used to be supported independently on freestanding timber posts and over-sailed the ceiling line in the form of a tent. This has collapsed to the ground, although the roof of the southern structure is still clad with timber boards. There are two tank stands, to the east and west of the quarters, although only the east stand still has a corrugated iron tank. A corrugated iron-clad earth closet is located to the north of the quarters. The cattle yards are steel; with a loading ramp to the fork, and the northern section of the yards is made of timber.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== The Newcastle Range and Delaney Gorge section of line ===\nThe section of the Etheridge Railway over the Newcastle range and through the Delaney Gorge has more earthworks than the rest of the railway. The railway track runs along the north face of the Delaney Gorge and along the bed of the Delaney River for a short distance. The significant elements within this section of the railway include any stone pitched bridge piers and abutments, stone pitched culverts, and stone cuttings. A large stone pitched culvert is located near Native Well, east of Wirra Wirra. A bridge over Starlight Creek, just east of Delaney Gorge, has stone piers and abutments, and a small bridge just east of Wirra Wirra has stone abutments. Bridges constructed with stonework are significant due to their rarity on the Etheridge line.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThere is a siding at Wirra Wirra, {{convert|208.5|km}} from Almaden), on the tableland of the Newcastle Range. Within the rail reserve there is a remnant of the east branch of the fork; and concrete slabs and concrete water tank footings south of the main line. Outside the railway reserve, near the location of the removed western arm of the fork, there is an earth and steel loading bank and some timber cattle yard posts. The modern QR telephone box and its supporting infrastructure are not significant.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n=== Non-significant elements ===\n[[File:Etheridge railway - Copperfield River bridge from Einasleigh end (2008).jpg|thumb|Copperfield River bridge, 2008]]\nThe line has a large number of short timber trestle bridges with concrete abutments, along with a smaller number of medium-size timber trestle bridges, such as the High Bridge in the Delaney Gorge. Longer bridges on the line include those at Junction Creek, Lighthouse Creek, the Einasleigh River and the Copperfield River. Some bridges have one or more concrete piers, and some timbers have been replaced with steel. The bridges without stonework are not of cultural heritage significance, as they were designed to be cheaply replaced if damaged during floods, and the larger bridges have been replaced at various times; for example the Copperfield Bridge was destroyed in 1927, 1980 and 2002.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\nThere are a number of small concrete culverts and open drains, concrete retaining walls in the Delaney Gorge, and modern Queensland Rail communications installations at the stations and Wirra Wirra siding which are not significant. The sleepers of the main line within the railway reserve are not significant.<ref name=\"qhr\" />\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nEtheridge Railway was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 16 February 2009 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''\n\nThe Etheridge Railway, constructed by John Moffat's Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company between 1907 and 1910, was a significant component of an important, large-scale, privately built mining railway network in North Queensland and is important in demonstrating the widespread development of mining and transport infrastructure in this part of the State.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe railway stations at Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth and the route of the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth, including surviving railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, loading banks, stone pitched bridges and culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure, are important surviving evidence of the efforts of the Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company to supply copper ore to its smelters at Chillagoe.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe arrangement under which the State government maintained and operated the Etheridge Railway initially as a private line - with an option to purchase after 15 years - was the first step towards the present system under which mineral railways are government owned and operated but built with private capital repaid out of profits.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe station complexes at the mining towns of Einasleigh and Forsayth demonstrate the economic importance of these locations to the Chillagoe Company. Both stations have impressive triple-gabled station master's residences designed by AS Frew.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe Mount Surprise railway station complex and other remaining evidence of cattle transportation at the main stations along the Etheridge Railway, such as cattle yards and loading banks, are important in demonstrating the role that the railway played in maintaining pastoral activity in the area before the construction of the bitumen \"Beef Road\" in the 1960s.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.'''\n\nThe tent quarters at Forsayth is a rare surviving Queensland example of its type, and provides evidence of the amenities considered appropriate for railway workers in the early twentieth century.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe large iron water tank at Mount Surprise is a good example of a type now becoming rare.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''\n\nThe surviving railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle yards, loading banks, stone pitched bridges and culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations and along the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth all demonstrate the principal characteristics of a railway line that was used for mining and pastoral purposes.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe route and formation of the line between Mount Surprise and Forsayth, with its steep gradients and sharp curves and accompanying lack of earthworks, along with the relative lack of steel, stone or brick bridge piers and abutments, demonstrates the nature of a railway line that was built as economically as possible. The section of the railway over the Newcastle Range and through the Delaney Gorge, although it has more earthworks and stone cuttings than any other section of the railway, also demonstrates a cheap form of railway construction, due to its sharp curves and steep gradients.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe Mount Surprise station complex has the most intact group of railway buildings, and its station building, goods shed, small timber shed and water tank are all good examples of their type. Other elements, such as two railway houses, a trolley shed, sandbox, sidings, turning fork and signals and points levers all contribute to an understanding of how a rural railway station functioned. The shower under the water tank illustrates the past lifestyle of railway workers.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''\n\nThe Etheridge Railway was an essential element of the business empire of John Moffat and the Chillagoe Company. Between 1880 and 1914 much of the economic activity of North Queensland was driven by the railways and mining towns created by Moffat's enterprises.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{QHR-CC-2014}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category-inline|Etheridge railway line}}{{Railway lines in Queensland}}\n\n[[Category:Queensland Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Forsayth, Queensland]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Queensland]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Etheridge Railway]]\n[[Category:Mount Surprise, Queensland]]\n[[Category:Einasleigh, Queensland]]\n[[Category:Railway bridges in Queensland]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:{{Australian railway bridges|state=autocollapse}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etheridge_railway_line"}
