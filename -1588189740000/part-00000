As a consequence, NHEJ often introduces mutations.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lieber MR | title = The mechanism of double-strand DNA break repair by the nonhomologous DNA end-joining pathway | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 79 | pages = 181\u2013211 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20192759 | pmc = 3079308 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.052308.093131 }}</ref>\n[[File:Benzopyrene DNA adduct 1JDG.png|thumb|right|250px|A [[covalent]] [[adduct]] between the [[(+)-Benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide|metabolite]] of [[Benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], the major [[mutagen]] in [[tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]], and DNA<ref>Created from [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?pdbId=1JDG PDB 1JDG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231235020/http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?pdbId=1JDG |date=31 December 2015 }}</ref>]]\n\n=== Induced mutation ===\n\nInduced mutations are alterations in the gene after it has come in contact with mutagens and environmental causes.\n\n''Induced mutations'' on the molecular level can be caused by:\n* Chemicals\n**[[Hydroxylamine]]\n** [[Base analog]]s (e.g., [[Bromodeoxyuridine]] (BrdU))\n** [[Alkylation|Alkylating agent]]s (e.g., [[ENU|''N''-ethyl-''N''-nitrosourea]] (ENU).

These include:\n**[[Chromosomal translocation]]s: interchange of genetic parts from nonhomologous chromosomes.\n**[[Chromosomal inversion]]s: reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment.\n** Non-homologous [[chromosomal crossover]].\n** Interstitial deletions: an intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human [[astrocytoma]], a type of brain tumor, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the Fused in Glioblastoma (FIG) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS), producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes [[Carcinogenesis|oncogenic]] transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells).\n*[[Loss of heterozygosity]]: loss of one [[allele]], either by a deletion or a genetic recombination event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles.\n\n==== Small-scale mutations ====\n\nSmall-scale mutations affect a gene in one or a few nucleotides. (If only a single nucleotide is affected, they are called [[point mutation]]s.) Small-scale mutations include:\n\n* [[Insertion (genetics)|Insertions]] add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by [[transposable element]]s, or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] ([[splice site mutation]]), or cause a shift in the [[reading frame]] ([[Frameshift mutation|frameshift]]), both of which can significantly alter the [[gene product]]. Insertions can be reversed by excision of the transposable element.\n* [[Deletion (genetics)|Deletions]] remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. Like insertions, these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene. In general, they are irreversible: Though exactly the same sequence might, in theory, be restored by an insertion, transposable elements able to revert a very short deletion (say 1\u20132 bases) in ''any'' location either are highly unlikely to exist or do not exist at all.\n* [[Point mutation|Substitution mutations]], often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Freese E | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 622\u201333 | date = April 1959 | pmid = 16590424 | pmc = 222607 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.45.4.622 | authorlink = Ernst Freese | bibcode = 1959PNAS...45..622F | title = The Difference Between Spontaneous and Base-Analogue Induced Mutations of Phage T4 }}</ref> These changes are classified as transitions or transversions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Freese |first=Ernst | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 1959 |title=The specific mutagenic effect of base analogues on Phage T4 |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=87\u2013105 |doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(59)80038-3}}</ref> Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A \u2194 G) or a [[pyrimidine]] for a pyrimidine, (C \u2194 T). A transition can be caused by nitrous acid, base mispairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as BrdU. Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T \u2194 A/G). An example of a transversion is the conversion of [[adenine]] (A) into a cytosine (C). Point mutations are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene. A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). As discussed [[#By_impact_on_protein_sequence|below]], point mutations that occur within the protein [[coding region]] of a gene may be classified as [[Synonymous substitution|synonymous]] or [[nonsynonymous substitution]]s, the latter of which in turn can be divided into [[Missense mutation|missense]] or [[nonsense mutations]].\n\n=== By impact on protein sequence ===\n[[File:Gene structure eukaryote 2 annotated.svg|alt=Diagram of the structure of a eukaryotic protein-coding gene, showing regulatory regions, introns, and coding regions. Four stages are shown: DNA, initial mRNA product, mature mRNA, and protein.|thumb|460x460px|The structure of a [[eukaryotic]] protein-coding gene. A mutation in the [[protein coding region]] (red) can result in a change in the amino acid sequence. Mutations in other areas of the gene can have diverse effects. Changes within [[Regulatory sequence|regulatory sequences]] (yellow and blue) can effect [[transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] and [[Translation (biology)|translational]] regulation of [[gene expression]].]]\nThe effect of a mutation on protein sequence depends in part on where in the genome it occurs, especially whether it is in a [[Coding region|coding]] or [[Non-coding DNA|non-coding region]]. Mutations in the non-coding [[Regulatory sequence|regulatory sequences]] of a gene, such as promoters, enhancers, and silencers, can alter levels of gene expression, but are less likely to alter the protein sequence. Mutations within [[Intron|introns]] and in regions with no known biological function (e.g. [[Pseudogene|pseudogenes]], [[Retrotransposon|retrotransposons]]) are generally [[Neutral mutation|neutral]], having no effect on phenotype - though intron mutations could alter the protein product if they affect mRNA splicing.\n\nMutations in that occur in coding regions of the genome are more likely to alter the protein product, and can be categorized by their effect on amino acid sequence:\n\n*A [[frameshift mutation]] is caused by insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different [[Translation (biology)|translation]] from the original.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hogan|first=C.

(For example, the code CCU GAC UAC CUA codes for the amino acids proline, aspartic acid, tyrosine, and leucine. If the U in CCU was deleted, the resulting sequence would be CCG ACU ACC UAx, which would instead code for proline, threonine, threonine, and part of another amino acid or perhaps a [[stop codon]] (where the x stands for the following nucleotide).) By contrast, any insertion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an ''in-frame mutation''.\n*A point substitution mutation results in a change in a single nucleotide and can be either synonymous or nonsynonymous.\n**A [[synonymous substitution]] replaces a codon with another codon that codes for the same amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is not modified. Synonymous mutations occur due to the [[Degeneracy (biology)|degenerate]] nature of the [[genetic code]]. If this mutation does not result in any phenotypic effects, then it is called [[Silent mutation|silent]], but not all synonymous substitutions are silent. (There can also be silent mutations in nucleotides outside of the coding regions, such as the introns, because the exact nucleotide sequence is not as crucial as it is in the coding regions, but these are not considered synonymous substitutions.)\n**A [[nonsynonymous substitution]] replaces a codon with another codon that codes for a different amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is modified. Nonsynonymous substitutions can be classified as nonsense or missense mutations:\n***A [[missense mutation]] changes a nucleotide to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as [[Epidermolysis bullosa]], [[sickle-cell disease]], and [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD1]]-mediated [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Boill\u00e9e S, Vande Velde C, Cleveland DW|date=October 2006|title=ALS: a disease of motor neurons and their nonneuronal neighbors|journal=Neuron|volume=52|issue=1|pages=39\u201359|citeseerx=10.1.1.325.7514|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.09.018|pmid=17015226}}</ref> On the other hand, if a missense mutation occurs in an amino acid codon that results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid, then sometimes little or no change is rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode [[arginine]], a chemically similar molecule to the intended [[lysine]]. In this latter case the mutation will have little or no effect on phenotype and therefore be [[neutral mutation|neutral]].\n***A [[nonsense mutation]] is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a ''nonsense codon'' in the transcribed mRNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product. This sort of mutation has been linked to different mutations, such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. (See [[Stop codon]].)\n\n===By effect on function===\n\n* Loss-of-function mutations, also called inactivating mutations, result in the gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated). When the allele has a complete loss of function ([[null allele]]), it is often called an [[amorph (gene)|amorph]] or amorphic mutation in the [[Muller's morphs]] schema. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]]. Exceptions are when the organism is [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called [[haploinsufficiency]]).\n* Gain-of-function mutations, also called activating mutations, change the gene product such that its effect gets stronger (enhanced activation) or even is superseded by a different and abnormal function. When the new allele is created, a [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygote]] containing the newly created allele as well as the original will express the new allele; genetically this defines the mutations as [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] phenotypes. Several of Muller's morphs correspond to gain of function, including hypermorph (increased gene expression) and neomorph (novel function). In December 2017, the U.S. government lifted a temporary ban implemented in 2014 that banned federal funding for any new \"gain-of-function\" experiments that enhance pathogens \"such as Avian influenza, SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS viruses.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/news/articles/2017-12-19/us-lifts-funding-ban-on-studies-that-enhance-dangerous-germs|title=U.S. Lifts Funding Ban on Studies That Enhance Dangerous Germs|last=Steenhuysen|first=Julie|date=2017-12-19|work=U.S. News & World Report|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>\n* Dominant negative mutations (also called [[Muller's morphs#Antimorph|antimorphic]] mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele.

The nomenclature specifies the type of mutation and base or amino acid changes.\n\n*Nucleotide substitution (e.g., 76A>T) \u2014 The number is the position of the nucleotide from the 5' end; the first letter represents the wild-type nucleotide, and the second letter represents the nucleotide that replaced the wild type. In the given example, the adenine at the 76th position was replaced by a thymine.\n**If it becomes necessary to differentiate between mutations in [[genomic DNA]], [[mitochondrial DNA]], and [[RNA]], a simple convention is used. For example, if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from G to C, then it would be written as g.100G>C if the mutation occurred in genomic DNA, m.100G>C if the mutation occurred in mitochondrial DNA, or r.100g>c if the mutation occurred in RNA. Note that, for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case.\n*Amino acid substitution (e.g., D111E) \u2014 The first letter is the one letter [[Amino acid#Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties|code]] of the wild-type amino acid, the number is the position of the amino acid from the [[N-terminus]], and the second letter is the one letter code of the amino acid present in the mutation. Nonsense mutations are represented with an X for the second amino acid (e.g. D111X).\n*Amino acid deletion (e.g., \u0394F508) \u2014 The Greek letter \u0394 ([[delta (letter)|delta]]) indicates a deletion. The letter refers to the amino acid present in the wild type and the number is the position from the N terminus of the amino acid were it to be present as in the wild type.\n\n==Mutation rates==\n{{Further|Mutation rate}}\n[[Mutation rate]]s vary substantially across species, and the evolutionary forces that generally determine mutation are the subject of ongoing investigation.\n\nThe genomes of [[RNA virus]]es are based on [[RNA]] rather than DNA. The RNA viral genome can be double-stranded (as in DNA) or single-stranded. In some of these viruses (such as the single-stranded [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]), replication occurs quickly, and there are no mechanisms to check the genome for accuracy. This error-prone process often results in mutations.\n\n==Disease causation==\nChanges in DNA caused by mutation in a coding region of DNA can cause errors in protein sequence that may result in partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, in order to function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function in the right places at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of ''Drosophila'' suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, the mutation will most likely be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.<ref name=\"Sawyer2007\" /> However, studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doniger SW, Kim HS, Swain D, Corcuera D, Williams M, Yang SP, Fay JC | title = A catalog of neutral and deleterious polymorphism in yeast | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = e1000183 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18769710 | pmc = 2515631 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000183 | editor-first = Jonathan K. | last7 = Fay | editor-link = Jonathan K.

This is the case in hereditary diseases. In particular, if there is a mutation in a DNA repair gene within a germ cell, humans carrying such germline mutations may have an increased risk of cancer. A list of 34 such germline mutations is given in the article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]. An example of one is [[albinism]], a mutation that occurs in the OCA1 or OCA2 gene. Individuals with this disorder are more prone to many types of cancers, other disorders and have impaired vision.\n\nDNA damage can cause an error when the DNA is replicated, and this error of replication can cause a gene mutation that, in turn, could cause a genetic disorder. DNA damages are repaired by the DNA repair system of the cell. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair damages in DNA. Because DNA can be damaged in many ways, the process of DNA repair is an important way in which the body protects itself from disease. Once DNA damage has given rise to a mutation, the mutation cannot be repaired.\n\n=== Role in carcinogenesis ===\n{{See also|Carcinogenesis}}\nOn the other hand, a mutation may occur in a somatic cell of an organism. Such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism. The accumulation of certain mutations over generations of somatic cells is part of cause of [[malignant transformation]], from normal cell to cancer cell.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ionov Y, Peinado MA, Malkhosyan S, Shibata D, Perucho M|date=June 1993|title=Ubiquitous somatic mutations in simple repeated sequences reveal a new mechanism for colonic carcinogenesis|journal=Nature|volume=363|issue=6429|pages=558\u201361|bibcode=1993Natur.363..558I|doi=10.1038/363558a0|pmid=8505985}}</ref>\n\nCells with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations (one good copy of gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated. This kind of mutation happens often in living organisms, but it is difficult to measure the rate. Measuring this rate is important in predicting the rate at which people may develop cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|author3=Rong H. Zhang|vauthors=Araten DJ, Golde DW, Zhang RH, Thaler HT, Gargiulo L, Notaro R, Luzzatto L|date=September 2005|title=A quantitative measurement of the human somatic mutation rate|journal=Cancer Research|volume=65|issue=18|pages=8111\u20137|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1198|pmid=16166284}}</ref>\n\nPoint mutations may arise from spontaneous mutations that occur during DNA replication. The rate of mutation may be increased by mutagens. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from [[ultraviolet light|UV rays]], [[X-ray]]s or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.\n\n===Prion mutations===\n\n[[Prion]]s are proteins and do not contain genetic material. However, prion replication has been shown to be subject to mutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8435320.stm|title='Lifeless' prion proteins are 'capable of evolution'|date=January 1, 2010|work=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2015-10-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925132138/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8435320.stm|archivedate=25 September 2015|department=Health|location=London|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The human gene [[PRNP]] codes for the major prion protein, PrP, and is subject to mutations that can give rise to disease-causing prions.\n\n==Beneficial mutations==\nAlthough mutations that cause changes in protein sequences can be harmful to an organism, on occasions the effect may be positive in a given environment. In this case, the mutation may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild-type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection. Examples include the following:\n\n'''HIV resistance''': a specific 32 base pair deletion in human [[CCR5]] ([[CCR5#CCR5-.CE.9432|CCR5-\u039432]]) confers [[HIV]] resistance to [[Zygosity|homozygotes]] and delays [[AIDS]] onset in heterozygotes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sullivan AD, Wigginton J, Kirschner D | title = The coreceptor mutation CCR5Delta32 influences the dynamics of HIV epidemics and is selected for by HIV | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 18 | pages = 10214\u20139 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11517319 | pmc = 56941 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.181325198 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...9810214S }}</ref> One possible explanation of the [[etiology]] of the relatively high frequency of CCR5-\u039432 in the [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] population is that it conferred resistance to the [[bubonic plague]] in mid-14th century [[Europe]].

These include:\n**[[Chromosomal translocation]]s: interchange of genetic parts from nonhomologous chromosomes.\n**[[Chromosomal inversion]]s: reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment.\n** Non-homologous [[chromosomal crossover]].\n** Interstitial deletions: an intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human [[astrocytoma]], a type of brain tumor, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the Fused in Glioblastoma (FIG) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS), producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes [[Carcinogenesis|oncogenic]] transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells).\n*[[Loss of heterozygosity]]: loss of one [[allele]], either by a deletion or a genetic recombination event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles.\n\n==== Small-scale mutations ====\n\nSmall-scale mutations affect a gene in one or a few nucleotides. (If only a single nucleotide is affected, they are called [[point mutation]]s.) Small-scale mutations include:\n\n* [[Insertion (genetics)|Insertions]] add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by [[transposable element]]s, or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of the [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] ([[splice site mutation]]), or cause a shift in the [[reading frame]] ([[Frameshift mutation|frameshift]]), both of which can significantly alter the [[gene product]]. Insertions can be reversed by excision of the transposable element.\n* [[Deletion (genetics)|Deletions]] remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. Like insertions, these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene. In general, they are irreversible: Though exactly the same sequence might, in theory, be restored by an insertion, transposable elements able to revert a very short deletion (say 1\u20132 bases) in ''any'' location either are highly unlikely to exist or do not exist at all.\n* [[Point mutation|Substitution mutations]], often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Freese E | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 622\u201333 | date = April 1959 | pmid = 16590424 | pmc = 222607 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.45.4.622 | authorlink = Ernst Freese | bibcode = 1959PNAS...45..622F | title = The Difference Between Spontaneous and Base-Analogue Induced Mutations of Phage T4 }}</ref> These changes are classified as transitions or transversions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Freese |first=Ernst | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 1959 |title=The specific mutagenic effect of base analogues on Phage T4 |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=87\u2013105 |doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(59)80038-3}}</ref> Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A \u2194 G) or a [[pyrimidine]] for a pyrimidine, (C \u2194 T). A transition can be caused by nitrous acid, base mispairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as BrdU. Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T \u2194 A/G). An example of a transversion is the conversion of [[adenine]] (A) into a cytosine (C). Point mutations are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene. A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). As discussed [[#By_impact_on_protein_sequence|below]], point mutations that occur within the protein [[coding region]] of a gene may be classified as [[Synonymous substitution|synonymous]] or [[nonsynonymous substitution]]s, the latter of which in turn can be divided into [[Missense mutation|missense]] or [[nonsense mutations]].\n\n=== By impact on protein sequence ===\n[[File:Gene structure eukaryote 2 annotated.svg|alt=Diagram of the structure of a eukaryotic protein-coding gene, showing regulatory regions, introns, and coding regions. Four stages are shown: DNA, initial mRNA product, mature mRNA, and protein.|thumb|400x400px|The structure of a [[eukaryotic]] protein-coding gene. A mutation in the [[protein coding region]] (red) can result in a change in the amino acid sequence. Mutations in other areas of the gene can have diverse effects. Changes within [[Regulatory sequence|regulatory sequences]] (yellow and blue) can effect [[transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] and [[Translation (biology)|translational]] regulation of [[gene expression]].]]\nThe effect of a mutation on protein sequence depends in part on where in the genome it occurs, especially whether it is in a [[Coding region|coding]] or [[Non-coding DNA|non-coding region]]. Mutations in the non-coding [[Regulatory sequence|regulatory sequences]] of a gene, such as promoters, enhancers, and silencers, can alter levels of gene expression, but are less likely to alter the protein sequence. Mutations within [[Intron|introns]] and in regions with no known biological function (e.g. [[Pseudogene|pseudogenes]], [[Retrotransposon|retrotransposons]]) are generally [[Neutral mutation|neutral]], having no effect on phenotype - though intron mutations could alter the protein product if they affect mRNA splicing.\n\nMutations in that occur in coding regions of the genome are more likely to alter the protein product, and can be categorized by their effect on amino acid sequence:\n\n*A [[frameshift mutation]] is caused by insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different [[Translation (biology)|translation]] from the original.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hogan|first=C.

(For example, the code CCU GAC UAC CUA codes for the amino acids proline, aspartic acid, tyrosine, and leucine. If the U in CCU was deleted, the resulting sequence would be CCG ACU ACC UAx, which would instead code for proline, threonine, threonine, and part of another amino acid or perhaps a [[stop codon]] (where the x stands for the following nucleotide).) By contrast, any insertion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an ''in-frame mutation''.\n*A point substitution mutation results in a change in a single nucleotide and can be either synonymous or nonsynonymous.\n**A [[synonymous substitution]] replaces a codon with another codon that codes for the same amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is not modified. Synonymous mutations occur due to the [[Degeneracy (biology)|degenerate]] nature of the [[genetic code]]. If this mutation does not result in any phenotypic effects, then it is called [[Silent mutation|silent]], but not all synonymous substitutions are silent. (There can also be silent mutations in nucleotides outside of the coding regions, such as the introns, because the exact nucleotide sequence is not as crucial as it is in the coding regions, but these are not considered synonymous substitutions.)\n**A [[nonsynonymous substitution]] replaces a codon with another codon that codes for a different amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is modified. Nonsynonymous substitutions can be classified as nonsense or missense mutations:\n***A [[missense mutation]] changes a nucleotide to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as [[Epidermolysis bullosa]], [[sickle-cell disease]], and [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD1]]-mediated [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Boill\u00e9e S, Vande Velde C, Cleveland DW|date=October 2006|title=ALS: a disease of motor neurons and their nonneuronal neighbors|journal=Neuron|volume=52|issue=1|pages=39\u201359|citeseerx=10.1.1.325.7514|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.09.018|pmid=17015226}}</ref> On the other hand, if a missense mutation occurs in an amino acid codon that results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid, then sometimes little or no change is rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode [[arginine]], a chemically similar molecule to the intended [[lysine]]. In this latter case the mutation will have little or no effect on phenotype and therefore be [[neutral mutation|neutral]].\n***A [[nonsense mutation]] is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a ''nonsense codon'' in the transcribed mRNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product. This sort of mutation has been linked to different mutations, such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. (See [[Stop codon]].)\n\n===By effect on function===\n\n* Loss-of-function mutations, also called inactivating mutations, result in the gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated). When the allele has a complete loss of function ([[null allele]]), it is often called an [[amorph (gene)|amorph]] or amorphic mutation in the [[Muller's morphs]] schema. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]]. Exceptions are when the organism is [[Ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called [[haploinsufficiency]]).\n* Gain-of-function mutations, also called activating mutations, change the gene product such that its effect gets stronger (enhanced activation) or even is superseded by a different and abnormal function. When the new allele is created, a [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygote]] containing the newly created allele as well as the original will express the new allele; genetically this defines the mutations as [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] phenotypes. Several of Muller's morphs correspond to gain of function, including hypermorph (increased gene expression) and neomorph (novel function). In December 2017, the U.S. government lifted a temporary ban implemented in 2014 that banned federal funding for any new \"gain-of-function\" experiments that enhance pathogens \"such as Avian influenza, SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS viruses.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/news/articles/2017-12-19/us-lifts-funding-ban-on-studies-that-enhance-dangerous-germs|title=U.S. Lifts Funding Ban on Studies That Enhance Dangerous Germs|last=Steenhuysen|first=Julie|date=2017-12-19|work=U.S. News & World Report|access-date=2018-01-15}}</ref>\n* Dominant negative mutations (also called [[Muller's morphs#Antimorph|antimorphic]] mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele.

This step requires a tremendous scientific effort. Once the consensus sequence is known, the mutations in a genome can be pinpointed, described, and classified.

In principle, this nomenclature can also be used to describe mutations in other organisms. The nomenclature specifies the type of mutation and base or amino acid changes.\n\n*Nucleotide substitution (e.g., 76A>T) \u2014 The number is the position of the nucleotide from the 5' end; the first letter represents the wild-type nucleotide, and the second letter represents the nucleotide that replaced the wild type. In the given example, the adenine at the 76th position was replaced by a thymine.\n**If it becomes necessary to differentiate between mutations in [[genomic DNA]], [[mitochondrial DNA]], and [[RNA]], a simple convention is used. For example, if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from G to C, then it would be written as g.100G>C if the mutation occurred in genomic DNA, m.100G>C if the mutation occurred in mitochondrial DNA, or r.100g>c if the mutation occurred in RNA. Note that, for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case.\n*Amino acid substitution (e.g., D111E) \u2014 The first letter is the one letter [[Amino acid#Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties|code]] of the wild-type amino acid, the number is the position of the amino acid from the [[N-terminus]], and the second letter is the one letter code of the amino acid present in the mutation. Nonsense mutations are represented with an X for the second amino acid (e.g. D111X).\n*Amino acid deletion (e.g., \u0394F508) \u2014 The Greek letter \u0394 ([[delta (letter)|delta]]) indicates a deletion. The letter refers to the amino acid present in the wild type and the number is the position from the N terminus of the amino acid were it to be present as in the wild type.\n\n==Mutation rates==\n{{Further|Mutation rate}}\n[[Mutation rate]]s vary substantially across species, and the evolutionary forces that generally determine mutation are the subject of ongoing investigation.\n\nThe genomes of [[RNA virus]]es are based on [[RNA]] rather than DNA. The RNA viral genome can be double-stranded (as in DNA) or single-stranded. In some of these viruses (such as the single-stranded [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]), replication occurs quickly, and there are no mechanisms to check the genome for accuracy. This error-prone process often results in mutations.\n\n==Disease causation==\nChanges in DNA caused by mutation in a coding region of DNA can cause errors in protein sequence that may result in partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, in order to function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function in the right places at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of ''Drosophila'' suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, the mutation will most likely be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.<ref name=\"Sawyer2007\" /> However, studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doniger SW, Kim HS, Swain D, Corcuera D, Williams M, Yang SP, Fay JC | title = A catalog of neutral and deleterious polymorphism in yeast | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = e1000183 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18769710 | pmc = 2515631 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000183 | editor-first = Jonathan K. | last7 = Fay | editor-link = Jonathan K.

This is the case in hereditary diseases. In particular, if there is a mutation in a DNA repair gene within a germ cell, humans carrying such germline mutations may have an increased risk of cancer. A list of 34 such germline mutations is given in the article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]. An example of one is [[albinism]], a mutation that occurs in the OCA1 or OCA2 gene. Individuals with this disorder are more prone to many types of cancers, other disorders and have impaired vision.\n\nDNA damage can cause an error when the DNA is replicated, and this error of replication can cause a gene mutation that, in turn, could cause a genetic disorder. DNA damages are repaired by the DNA repair system of the cell. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair damages in DNA. Because DNA can be damaged in many ways, the process of DNA repair is an important way in which the body protects itself from disease. Once DNA damage has given rise to a mutation, the mutation cannot be repaired.\n\n=== Role in carcinogenesis ===\n{{See also|Carcinogenesis}}\nOn the other hand, a mutation may occur in a somatic cell of an organism. Such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism. The accumulation of certain mutations over generations of somatic cells is part of cause of [[malignant transformation]], from normal cell to cancer cell.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ionov Y, Peinado MA, Malkhosyan S, Shibata D, Perucho M|date=June 1993|title=Ubiquitous somatic mutations in simple repeated sequences reveal a new mechanism for colonic carcinogenesis|journal=Nature|volume=363|issue=6429|pages=558\u201361|bibcode=1993Natur.363..558I|doi=10.1038/363558a0|pmid=8505985}}</ref>\n\nCells with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations (one good copy of gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated.

The rate of mutation may be increased by mutagens. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from [[ultraviolet light|UV rays]], [[X-ray]]s or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.\n\n===Prion mutations===\n\n[[Prion]]s are proteins and do not contain genetic material.

With deep rural African roots, Steptoe teaches his audience about the power of kindness, thoughtfulness, and why it is important to always do the right thing- even if you think no one is watching.  ''Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters'' won many awards for Steptoe's illustrations, and went on to be adapted into many different children's literature curriculums.\n\n== Brief Plot Summary ==\nIn this book, The Great King calls upon his citizens to present him with the most beautiful and worthy young women in the village so he can choose a wife. Mufaro has two daughters, Nyasha and Manyara, who he believes are both worthy to be queen. However, Manyara is very mean to her sister and the other villagers. Both sisters travel to meet the king and the king picks Nyasha because she was kind to everyone (he knew this because he shape-shifted into many different animals to watch the daughter's actions). Manyara goes on to be a servant in Nyasha and the king's household, and the story ends there.\n\n== Pivotal Points ==\n\n# '''Manyara is introduced as the villain'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Steptoe|first=John|title=Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters|publisher=Puffin Books|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>:  Steptoe clearly states to the audience that Manyara is rude to her sister and teases her endlessly. This sets Manyara up to be the antagonist in the picture book.\n# '''Nyasha is introduced as kind'''<ref name=\":0\" />: In the wake of tormenting by her sister, Nyasha states that she will \"be pleased to serve\" her sister because she is \"cleaver and strong and beautiful\". Additionally, Manyara comments that, \"...everyone talks about how kind you (Nyasha) are...\". \n# '''Nyasha meets Nyoka'''<ref name=\":0\" />: Nyasha is tending to her garden when she meets a small green snake who she names \"Nyoka\". Nyoka is always at her side when she is tending to her garden and acts as a friend to her.\n# '''The Great King calls for a wife'''<ref name=\":0\" />: Word is sent to the village that the Great King is looking for a wife and that the village must send all beautiful and worthy young women to meet the king. Mufaro is adamant that both daughters should go to meet the king because he believes they are both worthy enough to be a queen.\n# '''Manyara leaves early for the kingdom and runs into trouble''' <ref name=\":0\" />: Manyara is met with a young hungry boy, an old women who gave advice, and a slew of laughing trees. Manyara did not feed the hungry boy, did not listen to the advice of the old lady, and did not follow the instructions when she approached the laughing trees.\n# '''Nyasha leaves for the kingdom''' <ref name=\":0\" />: Nyasha leaves with her family to travel to the kingdom. During her travels she runs into the same three things her sister saw : a hungry boy, an old woman, and some laughing trees. However, Nyasha fed the hungry boy and listened to the old women.\n# '''The Great King chooses Nyasha to be his wife'''<ref name=\":0\" />: It is now revealed to the audience (and the characters) that Nyoka, the garden snake, was actually the prince all along. Nyoka transforms from snake to his true form as a human male, and chooses to marry Nyasha.\n\n== Inspiration ==\nSteptoe derived his inspiration from the folktale, ''[[Kaffir Folk-lore]]'', published by author G.M. Theal in 1895. Steptoe's illustrations reflect his time in studying an ancient city in [[Zimbabwe]]; the images of flowers and trees are exact replicas of the ones that lived during the reign of this unknown ancient city.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Characters ==\n* Mufaro (moo-FAR-oh): means \u201chappiness\u201d in [[Shona language|Shona]]<ref name=\":0\" /> (native language of Steptoe); the father of Nyasha and Manyara; has some power in the village, but it is unclear the extent of it\n\n* Nyasha (n\u00e9e-AH-sha): means \u201cmercy\u201d in Shona<ref name=\":0\" />; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes queen at the end of the story\n\n* Manyara (mahn-YAR-ah): means \u201cashamed\u201d in Shona<ref name=\":0\" />; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes servant at the end of the story; is consistently mean to her sister, animals, and the other villagers\n\n* Nyoka (n\u00e9e-YO-kah): means \u201csnake\u201d in Shona<ref name=\":0\" />; is the king but we do not know that until the end of the story; the king shape-shifted into a snake (hence the name) to spy on the village women to decide which one is suitable to be his wife.\n\n== Themes ==\nThis book illustrates the \"[[Cinderella]]\" theme in a new light, and also highlights the theme of jealousy.\n\n* \"[[Cinderella]]\": very similar to the classic tale, popularized by Disney's version of the story, Steptoe mimics the storyline of a king looking for a suitable wife.<ref>Weikle-Mills, C. (2019). The Obscure Histories of Goosee Shoo-shoo and Black Cinderella: Seeking Afro-Caribbean Children's Literature in the Nineteenth Century. ''Children's Literature'' ''47'', 57-78.  doi:10.1353/chl.2019.0004.</ref> In past Cinderella stories the king/ prince chooses his wife based on her looks, but in Steptoe's version, the queen is chosen based on her personality.\n* Jealousy: throughout the story, Manyara is jealous of Nyasha, directly stating that Nyasha is their father's \"favorite\" out of the sisters; Manyara acts out and picks on Nyasha because of this. In the end of the novel, the act of jealousy is punished and seen as unfavorable to readers because the king choose the non-jealous sister to be queen.\n\n== Awards for ''Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters''==\n* The [[Caldecott Medal]] (1988): The Caldecott Medal is awarded annually to celebrate the achievement of picture book.<ref>\"The Randolph Caldecott Medal\", American Library Association, November 30, 1999.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/aboutcaldecott/aboutcaldecott</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n* [[Coretta Scott King Award]] for Illustrators (1988): The Coretta Scott King Award for Illustrators is awarded annually to one African American illustrator who demonstrates \"appreciation of African American culture and universal human values\".<ref>\"The Coretta Scott King Book Awards\", American Library Association, January 18, 2009.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/rt/emiert/cskbookawards</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nDue to the book's nature of putting value on kindness and the positives of living in a natural world, the book was welcomed among scholars and celebrated for its pointant tale along with beautiful illustrations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/clarita-kohen/mufaros-beautiful-daughters/|title=Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It went on to become a part of children's education about the need for generosity,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/mufaros-beautiful-daughters-literature-guide|title=Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters Literature Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> the importance of black representation in children's books,<ref>Muse, Daphne. \u201cBlack American Classics in Fiction and Poetry for Young Readers.\u201d ''American Visions'', vol. 8, no. 6, Dec. 1993, p. 33.

With deep rural African roots, Steptoe teaches his audience about the power of kindness, thoughtfulness, and why it is important to always do the right thing- even if you think no one is watching.  ''Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters'' won many awards for Steptoe's illustrations, and went on to be adapted into many different children's literature curriculums.\n\n== Brief Plot Summary ==\nIn this book, The Great King calls upon his citizens to present him with the most beautiful and worthy young women in the village so he can choose a wife. Mufaro has two daughters, Nyasha and Manyara, who he believes are both worthy to be queen. However, Manyara is very mean to her sister and the other villagers. Both sisters travel to meet the king and the king picks Nyasha because she was kind to everyone (he knew this because he shape-shifted into many different animals to watch the daughter's actions). Manyara goes on to be a servant in Nyasha and the king's household, and the story ends there.\n\n== Pivotal Points ==\n\n# '''Manyara is introduced as the villain'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Steptoe|first=John|title=Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters|publisher=Puffin Books|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>:  Steptoe clearly states to the audience that Manyara is rude to her sister and teases her endlessly. This sets Manyara up to be the antagonist in the picture book.\n# '''Nyasha is introduced as kind'''<ref name=\":0\" />: In the wake of tormenting by her sister, Nyasha states that she will \"be pleased to serve\" her sister because she is \"cleaver and strong and beautiful\". Additionally, Manyara comments that, \"...everyone talks about how kind you (Nyasha) are...\". \n# '''Nyasha meets Nyoka'''<ref name=\":0\" />: Nyasha is tending to her garden when she meets a small green snake who she names \"Nyoka\". Nyoka is always at her side when she is tending to her garden and acts as a friend to her.\n# '''The Great King calls for a wife'''<ref name=\":0\" />: Word is sent to the village that the Great King is looking for a wife and that the village must send all beautiful and worthy young women to meet the king. Mufaro is adamant that both daughters should go to meet the king because he believes they are both worthy enough to be a queen.\n# '''Manyara leaves early for the kingdom and runs into trouble''' <ref name=\":0\" />: Manyara is met with a young hungry boy, an old women who gave advice, and a slew of laughing trees. Manyara did not feed the hungry boy, did not listen to the advice of the old lady, and did not follow the instructions when she approached the laughing trees.\n# '''Nyasha leaves for the kingdom''' <ref name=\":0\" />: Nyasha leaves with her family to travel to the kingdom. During her travels she runs into the same three things her sister saw : a hungry boy, an old woman, and some laughing trees. However, Nyasha fed the hungry boy and listened to the old women.\n# '''The Great King chooses Nyasha to be his wife'''<ref name=\":0\" />: It is now revealed to the audience (and the characters) that Nyoka, the garden snake, was actually the prince all along. Nyoka transforms from snake to his true form as a human male, and chooses to marry Nyasha.\n\n== Inspiration ==\nSteptoe derived his inspiration from the folktale, ''[[Kaffir Folk-lore]]'', published by author G.M. Theal in 1895. Steptoe's illustrations reflect his time in studying an ancient city in [[Zimbabwe]]; the images of flowers and trees are exact replicas of the ones that lived during the reign of this unknown ancient city.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Characters ==\n* Mufaro (moo-FAR-oh): means \u201chappiness\u201d in [[Shona language|Shona]]<ref name=\":0\" /> (native language of Steptoe); the father of Nyasha and Manyara; has some power in the village, but it is unclear the extent of it\n\n* Nyasha (n\u00e9e-AH-sha): means \u201cmercy\u201d in Shona<ref name=\":0\" />; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes queen at the end of the story\n\n* Manyara (mahn-YAR-ah): means \u201cashamed\u201d in Shona<ref name=\":0\" />; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes servant at the end of the story; is consistently mean to her sister, animals, and the other villagers\n\n* Nyoka (n\u00e9e-YO-kah): means \u201csnake\u201d in Shona<ref name=\":0\" />; is the king but we do not know that until the end of the story; the king shape-shifted into a snake (hence the name) to spy on the village women to decide which one is suitable to be his wife.\n\n== Themes ==\nThis book illustrates the \"[[Cinderella]]\" theme in a new light, and also highlights the theme of jealousy.\n\n* \"[[Cinderella]]\": very similar to the classic tale, popularized by Disney's version of the story, Steptoe mimics the storyline of a king looking for a suitable wife.<ref>Weikle-Mills, C. (2019). The Obscure Histories of Goosee Shoo-shoo and Black Cinderella: Seeking Afro-Caribbean Children's Literature in the Nineteenth Century. ''Children's Literature'' ''47'', 57-78.  doi:10.1353/chl.2019.0004.</ref> In past Cinderella stories the king/ prince chooses his wife based on her looks, but in Steptoe's version, the queen is chosen based on her personality.\n* Jealousy: throughout the story, Manyara is jealous of Nyasha, directly stating that Nyasha is their father's \"favorite\" out of the sisters; Manyara acts out and picks on Nyasha because of this. In the end of the novel, the act of jealousy is punished and seen as unfavorable to readers because the king choose the non-jealous sister to be queen.\n\n== Awards for ''Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters''==\n* The [[Caldecott Medal]] (1988): The Caldecott Medal is awarded annually to celebrate the achievement of picture book.<ref>\"The Randolph Caldecott Medal\", American Library Association, November 30, 1999.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/aboutcaldecott/aboutcaldecott</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n* [[Coretta Scott King Award]] for Illustrators (1988): The Coretta Scott King Award for Illustrators is awarded annually to one African American illustrator who demonstrates \"appreciation of African American culture and universal human values\".<ref>\"The Coretta Scott King Book Awards\", American Library Association, January 18, 2009.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/rt/emiert/cskbookawards</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nDue to the book's nature of putting value on kindness and the positives of living in a natural world, the book was welcomed among scholars and celebrated for its pointant tale along with beautiful illustrations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/clarita-kohen/mufaros-beautiful-daughters/|title=Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It went on to become a part of children's education about the need for generosity,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/mufaros-beautiful-daughters-literature-guide|title=Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters Literature Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> the importance of black representation in children's books,<ref>Muse, Daphne. \u201cBlack American Classics in Fiction and Poetry for Young Readers.\u201d ''American Visions'', vol. 8, no. 6, Dec. 1993, p. 33.
