This is also the record for most consecutive title defenses in boxing history.\n\n[[Muhammad Ali]] is the only  boxer in the history of the heavyweight division to become Lineal world heavyweight champion three times: [[Michael Moorer]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Lennox Lewis]],  [[Vitali Klitschko]] and [[Ruslan Chagaev]] have held various versions of the title belts on three occasions.\n\nSix boxers have regained the Lineal heavyweight title: Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield, [[George Foreman]],  Lennox Lewis and [[Tyson Fury]].\n\nFour boxers have regained the heavyweight title in an immediate rematch: Floyd Patterson in 1960, Muhammad Ali in 1978, Lennox Lewis in 2001, and [[Anthony Joshua]] in 2019.\n\n[[Mike Tyson]] holds the record for being the youngest heavyweight to ever have achieve championship status. Becoming champion at age 20 years old.\n\nWith the exceptions of Lewis, Joshua, and Fury, each of the listed champions accomplished these feats back when the heavyweight minimum was set at 175 pounds, rather than 200. The cruiserweight division (first for boxers in the 175-190 pound range, later increased to the 175-200 pound range) was not established until 1979.\n\n====Historical development====\nBecause this division had no weight limit, it has been historically vaguely defined. In the 19th century, for example, many [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champions]] weighed {{convert|170|lb|kg stlb}} or less (although others weighed 200 pounds).\n\nThe first [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] under the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] was [[John L. Sullivan]], known as \"The Boston Strong Boy\". He weighed around 200 pounds when in shape and was a bare-knuckle champion.  He was defeated by [[James J. Corbett|Jim Corbett]] on September 7, 1892, in 21 rounds.\n\nIn 1920, the light heavyweight division was formed, with a maximum weight of {{convert|175|lb|kg stlb}}. \nAny fighter weighing more than 175 pounds was a heavyweight. In the 1980s, the various boxing organizations recognized the cruiserweight division, with a maximum weight of either {{convert|190|lb|kg stlb}} or {{convert|195|lb|kg stlb}}. Later these organizations increased the cruiserweight limit to 200 pounds.\n\nSince 1975, the [[Amateur Athletic Union of the United States]] and the Soviet Sports Committee established a new concept in international boxing, called \"Heavy Duals,\" an all-heavyweight team contest between the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref>'Heavy' Date, ''AAU News'', 1975, v. 45, p. 10.</ref>\n\n====Champions====\n{{main|List of world heavyweight boxing champions}}\n'''Current champions'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Sanctioning Body\n!Reign Began\n!Champion\n!Record\n!Defenses\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Association|WBA (Super)]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Council|WBC]]\n|February 22, 2020\n|{{flagicon|UK}} [[Tyson Fury]]\n|30\u20130\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Organization|WBO]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|}\n\n==== All-time table ====\n{{main|World heavyweight boxing championship records and statistics}}\n\nKeys:\n:{{Color box|#B2FFFF|border=darkgray}} Active title reign\n:{{Color box||border=darkgray}} Reign has ended\n\n:'''Note 1:''' WBA (Regular) champions are not included\n:'''Note 2:''' WBO heavyweight title bouts before August 1997 are not included<ref name=\"wbotitlebouts\">James B.

This is also the record for most consecutive title defenses in boxing history.\n\n[[Muhammad Ali]] is the only  boxer in the history of the heavyweight division to become Lineal world heavyweight champion three times: [[Michael Moorer]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Lennox Lewis]],  [[Vitali Klitschko]] and [[Ruslan Chagaev]] have held various versions of the title belts on three occasions.\n\nSix boxers have regained the Lineal heavyweight title: Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield, [[George Foreman]],  Lennox Lewis and [[Tyson Fury]].\n\nFour boxers have regained the heavyweight title in an immediate rematch: Floyd Patterson in 1960, Muhammad Ali in 1978, Lennox Lewis in 2001, and [[Anthony Joshua]] in 2019.\n\n[[Mike Tyson]] holds the record for being the youngest heavyweight to ever have achieve championship status. Becoming champion at age 20 years old.\n\nWith the exceptions of Lewis, Joshua, and Fury, each of the listed champions accomplished these feats back when the heavyweight minimum was set at 175 pounds, rather than 200. The cruiserweight division (first for boxers in the 175-190 pound range, later increased to the 175-200 pound range) was not established until 1979.\n\n====Historical development====\nBecause this division had no weight limit, it has been historically vaguely defined. In the 19th century, for example, many [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champions]] weighed {{convert|170|lb|kg stlb}} or less (although others weighed 200 pounds).\n\nThe first [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] under the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] was [[John L. Sullivan]], known as \"The Boston Strong Boy\". He weighed around 200 pounds when in shape and was a bare-knuckle champion.  He was defeated by [[James J. Corbett|Jim Corbett]] on September 7, 1892, in 21 rounds.\n\nIn 1920, the light heavyweight division was formed, with a maximum weight of {{convert|175|lb|kg stlb}}. \nAny fighter weighing more than 175 pounds was a heavyweight. In the 1980s, the various boxing organizations recognized the cruiserweight division, with a maximum weight of either {{convert|190|lb|kg stlb}} or {{convert|195|lb|kg stlb}}. Later these organizations increased the cruiserweight limit to 200 pounds.\n\nSince 1975, the [[Amateur Athletic Union of the United States]] and the Soviet Sports Committee established a new concept in international boxing, called \"Heavy Duals,\" an all-heavyweight team contest between the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref>'Heavy' Date, ''AAU News'', 1975, v. 45, p. 10.</ref>\n\n====Champions====\n{{main|List of world heavyweight boxing champions}}\n'''Current champions'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Sanctioning Body\n!Reign Began\n!Champion\n!Record\n!Defenses\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Association|WBA (Super)]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Council|WBC]]\n|February 22, 2020\n|{{flagicon|UK}} [[Tyson Fury]]\n|30-0\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Organization|WBO]]\n|December 7, 2019\n|{{flagicon|GBR\n}} [[Anthony Joshua]]\n|23\u20131 \n|0\n|-\n|}\n\n==== All-time table ====\n{{main|World heavyweight boxing championship records and statistics}}\n\nKeys:\n:{{Color box|#B2FFFF|border=darkgray}} Active title reign\n:{{Color box||border=darkgray}} Reign has ended\n\n:'''Note 1:''' WBA (Regular) champions are not included\n:'''Note 2:''' WBO heavyweight title bouts before August 1997 are not included<ref name=\"wbotitlebouts\">James B.

The World Heavyweight Championship in wrestling is usually considered the main title in a given promotion. Prior to the wrestling industry publicly acknowledging the predetermined nature of the sport, a Heavyweight title was generally competed for by larger wrestlers while smaller wrestlers competed as (among other names and classifications) \"[[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship|Junior Heavyweights]]\" and \"Light-Heavyweights\".\n\n==Analogous uses==\nThe word \"heavyweight\" is sometimes used in other fields (''e.g.'' politics) to denote a person who is especially powerful or influential. In this context, \"big beast\" has a similar meaning.

He was a Senior Editor with \"Lankadeepa\" at Times of Ceylon and the Chief Editor of \"Rasavahini\" magazine. His published work include research on Sinhala literature, Sinhala grammar lessons, and a number of popular Sinhala books for children and youngsters, several of which won national awards, presidential award and UNICEF Book Competition for \"Year of the Children 1979\". Children's books by Saman Tilakasiri have become classic contributions to the Sri Lankan and Sinhala literature due to their unique story-telling style that combines conversational and lyrical poetic expression to tell a story which is also enjoyed by adults.\n\nSaman Tilakasiri was also a lyricist with a rare catalogue of signature songs sung by prominent Sri Lankan musicians [[Sisira Senaratne]], and children's songs by [[Nanda Malini]]. He also assisted budding artists in their early career such as prominent musician Visharad [[W. D. Amaradeva]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSaman Tiakasiri was born to a rural family in Nawagamuwa, Devalegama in the Kegalle District. Henaka Arachchilage Appuhamy Senanayake was his father, and Bamuru Arachchilage Tikiri Menike was his mother. His elder brother H. M. Tilakaratne constructed a school in Nawagamuwa and Saman was the first student admitted to the new school, where he had his primary education. Then he joined Kegalle Maha Vidyalaya and continued his studies.\n\nSaman started his literary work, writing and composing poetry at the age of 12 years. While he was a student, he engaged himself as the newspaper reporter of the Kegalle District.\n\nHe wrote poems, articles on literature and current topics, and many of his writings were published in national newspapers and magazines such as \"Sinhala Bauddhaya\", \"Nidahasa\", \"Peramuna\" and \"Kavi Sammelanaya\", etc.\n\n== Career ==\nFluent in Sinhala and English, Saman joined the staff of Lankadeepa, the prominent national newspaper, in 1952 as a translator. Eminent journalist, the late Mr. D. B. Dhanapala was a source of inspiration for Saman to become a much-respected journalist in the course of time. He continued to work and was elevated to the post of Sub-Editor and Feature Editor. Later he was also the Editor of \"Rasavahini Magazine.\" He also contributed his writing to many publications such as \"Sanskruthi\", \"Dina Dina\", \"Cinema\" and other newspapers. He composed lyrics for popular songs, and helped new artists to break through in the early stages of career. One such discovery was Visharad [[W. D. Amaradeva]].\n\nHe excelled in writing stories and poems for children. His poetry book \"Pasal Lama Gee\" (meaning of name: School Children's Songs) was adjudged the Best Children's Book in 1969. Saman was the pioneer to receive the award for any books for children in Sri Lanka. In 1979 he won an award for his poetry collection \"Mal Onchilla\" (meaning of name: Flower Swings) at the national book competition for 1979, the Year of the Children by United Nations. He continued to win awards and accolades many a times.\n\nSaman also made translations for Children's Books from Chinese Folklore in a series titled \"Cheena Lama Katha I and II\" (Chinese Stories for Children.) Saman has completed the draft for the third book of this series, but was not able to publish it prior to his demise.
