Opening of the L-type calcium channel causes influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which then binds [[calmodulin]]. The activated calmodulin molecule activates [[myosin light-chain kinase]] (MLCK), which phosphorylates the [[myosin]] in [[thick filament]]s. Phosphorylated myosin is able to form [[crossbridge]]s with [[actin]] [[thin filament]]s, and the smooth muscle fiber (i.e., cell) contracts via the [[sliding filament mechanism]]. (See reference<ref name=\"pmid14627618\"/> for an illustration of the signaling cascade involving L-type calcium channels in smooth muscle).\n\nL-type calcium channels are also enriched in the [[t-tubule]]s of [[striated muscle]] cells, i.e., skeletal and cardiac [[myofiber]]s. When these cells are depolarized, the L-type calcium channels open as in smooth muscle. In skeletal muscle, the actual opening of the channel, which is mechanically gated to a [[ryanodine receptor|calcium-release channel]] (a.k.a. [[ryanodine receptor]], or RYR) in the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (SR), causes opening of the RYR. In [[cardiac muscle]], opening of the L-type calcium channel permits influx of calcium into the cell. The calcium binds to the calcium release channels (RYRs) in the SR, opening them; this phenomenon is called \"[[calcium-induced calcium release]]\", or CICR. However the RYRs are opened, either through mechanical-gating or CICR, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the SR and is able to bind to [[troponin C]] on the actin filaments. The muscles then contract through the sliding filament mechanism, causing shortening of [[sarcomeres]] and muscle contraction.\n\n=== Changes in expression during development ===\nEarly in development, there is a high amount of expression of [[T-type calcium channel]]s.

Opening of the L-type calcium channel causes influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which then binds [[calmodulin]]. The activated calmodulin molecule activates [[myosin light-chain kinase]] (MLCK), which phosphorylates the [[myosin]] in [[thick filament]]s. Phosphorylated myosin is able to form [[crossbridge]]s with [[actin]] [[thin filament]]s, and the smooth muscle fiber (i.e., cell) contracts via the [[sliding filament mechanism]]. (See reference<ref name=\"pmid14627618\"/> for an illustration of the signaling cascade involving L-type calcium channels in smooth muscle).\n\nL-type calcium channels are also enriched in the [[t-tubule]]s of [[striated muscle]] cells, i.e., skeletal and cardiac [[myofiber]]s. When these cells are depolarized, the L-type calcium channels open as in smooth muscle. In skeletal muscle, the actual opening of the channel, which is mechanically gated to a [[ryanodine receptor|calcium-release channel]] (a.k.a. [[ryanodine receptor]], or RYR) in the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] (SR), causes opening of the RYR. In [[cardiac muscle]], opening of the L-type calcium channel permits influx of calcium into the cell. The calcium binds to the calcium release channels (RYRs) in the SR, opening them; this phenomenon is called \"[[calcium-induced calcium release]]\", or CICR. However the RYRs are opened, either through mechanical-gating or CICR, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the SR and is able to bind to [[troponin C]] on the actin filaments. The muscles then contract through the sliding filament mechanism, causing shortening of [[sarcomeres]] and muscle contraction.\n\n=== Changes in expression during development ===\nEarly in development, there is a high amount of expression of [[T-type calcium channel]]s.

The different expression levels of low-voltage activated (LVA) and high-voltage activated (HVA) channels can also play an important role in [[Neuron|neuronal differentiation]]. In developing [[Xenopus]] [[spinal neuron]]s LVA calcium channels carry a spontaneous calcium transient that may be necessary for the neuron to adopt a [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABAergic]] phenotype

According to [[Samuel Pepys]], the boy Killigrew used to volunteer as an extra, or \"devil,\" at the [[Red Bull Theatre]], so that he could see the plays for free. The young Killigrew had limited formal education; the Court and the playhouse were his schoolroom.\n\nKilligrew was present at the exorcism of the possessed nuns of [[Loudun possessions|Loudun]]. In 1635 he left a sceptical account of the proceedings.<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1952) ''[[The Devils of Loudun]]''. New York: Harper</ref>\n\nBefore the [[English Civil War]], Killigrew wrote several plays\u2014[[tragicomedy|tragicomedies]] like ''Claracilla'' and ''The Prisoners'', as well as his most popular play, ''The Parson's Wedding'' (1637). The latter play has been criticized for its coarse humour; but it also contains prose readings of [[John Donne]]'s poetry to pique a literate audience.<ref>Keast, William R. (1950) \"Killigrew's Use of Donne in ''The Parson's Wedding''\" in: ''Modern Language Review'', 45 (1950), pp. 512-15</ref>\n\nA Royalist and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], Killigrew followed Prince Charles (the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]) into exile in 1647. In the years 1649-51, he was in [[Paris]], [[Geneva]], and [[Rome]], and in the later year was appointed Charles' representative in [[Venice]]. (It has been said that Killigrew wrote each of his plays in a different city; ''Thomaso, or the Wanderer'' was written in [[Madrid]])\n\nAt the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660, Killigrew returned to England along with many other Royalist exiles. Charles rewarded his loyalty by making him [[Groom of the Bedchamber]] and Chamberlain to Queen [[Catherine of Braganza|Catherine]]. He had a reputation as a wit; in his famous Diary, [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote that Killigrew had the office of the King's fool and jester, with privilege to mock and revile even the most prominent without penalty {{ws |[[s:Diary of Samuel Pepys/1668/February#13th|''Diary of Samuel Pepys'', Thursday, 13 February 1668]]}}\n\nAlong with Sir [[William Davenant]], he was given a royal warrant to form a [[theatre]] company in 1660\u2014which gave Killigrew a key role in the revival of English drama. Killigrew beat Davenant to a debut, at [[Gibbon's Tennis Court]] in [[Clare Market]], with the new [[King's Company]]. Its original members were [[Michael Mohun]], [[William Wintershall]], [[Robert Shatterell]], [[William Cartwright (actor)|William Cartwright]], [[Walter Clun]], [[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] and [[Nicholas Burt]]. They played for a time at the old [[Red Bull Theatre]], but in 1663 the company moved to the new [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal in Drury Lane]]. (Unfortunately, Killigrew gained a reputation as an incompetent manager; he was constantly in disputes with his actors and had to bribe his stars to keep working for him.) Killigrew staged plays by [[Aphra Behn]], [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]]...and Thomas Killigrew, as well as revivals of [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]. Having inherited the rights and repertory of the old [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the King's Company  performed many of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works, in the rewritten forms that were so popular at the time and so disparaged later. Two Killigrew productions of his own ''Parson's Wedding'', in 1664 and 1672-3, were cast entirely with women.\n\nIn 1673, Killigrew was appointed [[Master of the Revels]]. He lost control of his theatre in a conflict with his son Charles in 1677. (Charles, in turn, went bust a year later.) Thomas Killigrew died at [[Whitehall Palace|Whitehall]] on 19 March 1683.\n[[File:Anthony van Dyck- Thomas Killigrew and (possibly) Lord William Crofts.JPG|thumbnail|330px|  Thomas Killigrew and (possibly)  Lord William Crofts by  [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]\nThomas Killigrew's dramas are:\n\n*''[[The Prisoners (play)|The Prisoners]]'' (written c. 1632-5 in [[London]]; printed 1641)\n*''[[Claricilla]]'' (c. 1636, [[Rome]]; printed 1641)\n*''[[The Princess (Killigrew)|The Princess, or Love at First Sight]]'' (c. 1636; [[Naples]])\n*''[[The Parson's Wedding]]'' (c. 1637; [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]])\n*''The Pilgrim'' ([[Paris]])\n*''Bellamira Her Dream, or Love of Shadows'' (two-part play; [[Venice]])\n*''[[Cicilia and Clorinda|Cicilia and Clorinda, or Love in Arms]]'' (two-part play; ''Cicilia'', c. 1650, [[Turin]]; ''Clorinda'', 1651, [[Florence]])\n*''[[Thomaso|Thomaso, or the Wanderer]]'' (two-part play; [[Madrid]]).\n\nIn 1664,<ref>In the collected edition, each play has a separate title page (common in seventeenth-century collections); and some of these title pages are dated 1663 instead of 1664, causing some confusion in Killigrew's bibliography.

Of his last three works, ''Thomaso'' is a broad comedy based on Killigrew's experiences in European exile, while ''Bellamira'' and ''Cicillia'' are heroic romances\u2014but all three are [[closet drama]]s, ten-act double plays never intended for the stage.
