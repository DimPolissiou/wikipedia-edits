By most accounts he was born in Ainakea, [[Kohala, Hawaii]].{{sfn|Alexander|1912|p= 7}} His father was [[Ke\u014dua|Ke\u014dua Kalanikupuapa'ikalaninui]];{{sfn|Lili\u02bbuokalani|Forbes|2013|page= 3}}{{sfn|Pratt|1920|page= 9}} however, [[Native Hawaiian]] [[historian]] [[Samuel Kamakau]] states that Maui monarch [[Kahekili II]] had ''[[hanai]]'' adopted (traditional, informal adoption) Kamehameha at birth, as was the custom of the time. Kamakau believes this is why Kahekili II is often referred to as Kamehameha's father.{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|p=68}} The author also tells of how [[Kame'eiamoku]], (one of the royal twins and father of [[Hoapili]]), told Kamehameha I that he was actually the son of [[Kahekili II]], saying, was the butt \"I have something to tell you: Ka-hekili was your father, you were not Keoua's son. Here are the tokens that you are the son of Ka-hekili.\"{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|p=188}}  King Kalakaua wrote that these rumors are scandals and should be very properly dismissed as being the offspring of hatred and jealousies of later years.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gp1EAQAAMAAJ&pg=|title=The Legends and Myths of Hawaii: The Fables and Folk-lore of a Strange People|last=Hawaii)|first=David Kalakaua (King of|date=1888|publisher=C.L.

The 1758 dating also places his birth after the death of his father.{{sfn|Tregaskis|1973|page= xxi}} Kamakau published an account in the ''[[Ka Nupepa Kuokoa]]'' in 1867 placing the date of Kamehameha's birth around 1736.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|page= 429}} He wrote, \"It was during the time of the warfare among the chiefs of [the island of] Hawaii which followed the death of Keawe, chief over the whole island (Ke-awe-i-kekahi-ali\u02bbi-o-ka-moku) that Kamehameha I was born\". However, his general dating has been challenged as twenty years too early over issues involving Kamakau's inaccuracy of dating and the accounts of foreign visitors.{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|page=66}} Regardless, [[Abraham Fornander]] wrote in his book, \"An Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origins and Migrations\": \"when Kamehameha died in 1819 he was past eighty years old. His birth would thus fall between 1736 and 1740, probably nearer the former than the latter\".{{sfn|Fornander|Stokes|1880|page=136}} ''A Brief History of the Hawaiian People'' by William De Witt Alexander lists the birth date in the \"Chronological Table of Events of Hawaiian History\" as 1736.{{sfn|Alexander|1912|page=331}} In 1888 the Kamakau account was challenged by [[Samuel C. Damon]] in the missionary publication; ''The Friend'', deferring to a 1753 dating that was the first mentioned by [[James Jackson Jarves]]. Regardless of this challenge, the Kamakau dating was widely accepted due to support from [[Abraham Fornander]].{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|page= 429}}\n\n===Concealment, childhood===\n\nAt the time of Kamehameha's birth, Ke\u014dua and his half-brother [[Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu]] were serving [[Alapa\u02bbinui]], ruler of Hawaii\u02bbs island. Alapa\u02bbinui had brought the brothers to his court after defeating both their fathers in the civil war that followed the death of Keawe\u02bb\u012bkekahiali\u02bbiokamoku. Ke\u014dua died while Kamehameha was young, so Kamehameha was raised in the court of his uncle, Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu.{{sfn|Kanahele|1986|page=10}} The traditional ''mele'' chant of Keaka, wife of [[Alapainui]], indicates that Kamehameha was born in the month of ''ikuw\u0101'' (winter) or around November.{{sfn|TRUSTEES|1937|page= 15}} Alapai had given the child, Kamehameha, to his wife, Keaka, and her sister, H\u0101kau, to care for after the ruler discovered the infant had survived.{{sfn|\u02bb\u012a\u02bb\u012b|1983|page=4}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=79}}\n\nOn February 10, 1911, the Kamakau version was challenged again by the oral history of the Kaha family, as published in newspaper articles also appearing in the ''Kuoko''. After the republication of the story by Kamakau to a larger English reading public in 1911 Hawaii, this version of the story was published by [[Kamaka Stillman]], who had objected to the Nupepa article.{{sfn|Alexander|1912|pages=6-8}}\n\n==Unification of the islands==\n\n===Hawaii Island===\n[[Image:Kuka'ilimoku.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The god K\u016b-ka-ili-moku was left to Kamehameha I by his uncle [[Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu]]]]\nKamehameha was raised in the royal court of his uncle Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu. He achieved prominence in 1782, upon Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's death. While the kingship was inherited by Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's son, [[K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d]], Kamehameha was given a prominent religious position, guardianship of the Hawaiian god of war, [[K\u016b|K\u016bk\u0101{{okina}}ilimoku]], as well as control of the district of [[Waipio Valley|Waipi{{okina}}o valley]]. The two cousins' relationship was strained, caused when Kamehameha made a dedication to the gods instead of K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d. Kamehameha accepted the allegiance of a group of chiefs from the Kona district.\n\nThe other story is after the Prophecy was passed along by the High Priests/Priestesses and High Chiefs/Chiefesses. The fulfilling of the Prophecy by lifting the [[Naha Stone]], singled out Kamehameha as the fulfiller of the Prophecy. Other ruling Chiefs, Keawe Mauhili, the Mahoe (twins) Keoua, and other Chiefs rejected the Prophecy of Ka Poukahi. The High Chiefs of Kauai and supported Kiwala`o even after learning about the Prophecy.  The five Kona chiefs supporting Kamehameha were: [[Keeaumoku Papaiahiahi|Ke{{okina}}eaumoku P\u0101pa{{okina}}iahiahi]] (Kamehameha's father-in-law/grand Uncle), [[Keaweaheulu|Keaweaheulu Kalua{{okina}}\u0101pana]] (Kamehameha's uncle), Kek\u016bhaupi{{okina}}o (Kamehameha's warrior teacher), [[Kameeiamoku|Kame{{okina}}eiamoku]] and [[Kamanawa]] (twin uncles of Kamehameha). They defended Kamehameha as the Unifier Ka Na`i aupuni. High Chiefs Keawe Mauhili and Keeaumoku were by genealogy the next in line for Ali`i Nui. Both chose the younger nephews Kiwala`o and Kamehameha over themselves.  K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d was soon defeated in the first key conflict, the [[Battle of Moku'ohai|Battle of Moku{{okina}}\u014dhai]], and Kamehameha and His Chiefs took over Konohiki responsibilities and sacred obligations of the districts of Kohala, Kona, and H\u0101m\u0101kua on Hawai{{okina}}i island.{{sfn|Desha|Frazier|2000|pages=1-138}}\n\nThe Prophecy included far more than Hawai{{okina}}i island. It went across and beyond the Pacific Islands to the semi-continent of [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand). He was supported by his most political wife [[Kaahumanu|Ka{{okina}}ahumanu]] and father High Chief Keeaumoku  Senior Counselor to Kamehameha, She became one of Hawai{{okina}}i's most powerful figures. Kamehameha and his Council of Chiefs planned to unite the rest of the Hawaiian Islands. Allies came from British and American traders, who sold guns and ammunition to Kamehameha. Another major factor in Kamehameha's continued success was the support of Kauai Chief Ka`iana and Captain Brown, who used to be with Kaeo okalani. He guaranteed Kamehameha unlimited gunpowder from China and gave him the formula for gunpowder: sulfur, saltpeter/potassium nitrate, and charcoal, all abundant in the islands.  Two westerners who lived on Hawai{{okina}}i island, [[Isaac Davis (Hawaii)|Isaac Davis]] and [[John Young (Hawaii)|John Young]], married Native Hawaiian women and assisted Kamehameha.{{sfn|Archer|2018|page= 78}}\n\n===Olowalu Massacre===\n{{main|Olowalu Massacre}}\nIn 1789, [[Simon Metcalfe]] captained the fur trading vessel the ''Eleanora'' while his son, [[Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe]], captained the ship {{ship||Fair American}} along the Northwest Coast. They were to rendezvous in what was then known as the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]]. ''Fair American'' was held up when it was captured by the Spanish and then quickly released in [[San Blas Islands|San Blas]]. The ''Eleanora'' arrived in 1790, where it was greeted by chief [[Kame\u02bbeiamoku]]. The chief did something that the captain took offense to, and Metcalfe struck the chief with a rope's end. Sometime later, while docked in Honuaula, Maui, a small boat tied to the ship was stolen by native townspeople with a crewman inside. When Metcalfe discovered where the boat was taken, he sailed directly to the village called [[Olowalu]]. There he confirmed the boat had been broken apart and the man killed. He had already fired muskets into the previous village where he was anchored, killing some residents, Metcalfe took aim at this small town of native Hawaiians. He had all cannons moved to one side of the ship and began his trading call out to the locals. Hundreds of people came out to the beach to trade and canoes were launched. When they were within firing range, the ship fired on the Hawaiians, killing over 100. Six weeks later, ''Fair American'' was stuck near the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona coast]] of Hawaii where chief Kame\u02bbeiamoku was living. He had decided to attack the next foreign ship to avenge the strike by the elder Metcalfe. He canoed out to the ship with his men, where he killed Metcalfe's son and all but one (Isaac Davis) of the five crewmen. Kamehameha took Davis into protection and took possession of the ship. ''Eleanora'' was at that time anchored at [[Kealakekua Bay]], where the ship's [[boatswain]] had gone ashore and been captured by Kamehameha's forces because Kamehameha believed Metcalfe was planning more revenge. ''Eleanora'' waited several days before sailing off, apparently without knowledge of what had happened to ''Fair American'' or Metcalfe's son. Davis and ''Eleanora's'' boatswain, John Young, tried to escape, but were treated as chiefs, given wives and settled in Hawaii.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|page=24}}\n\n===Death of Ke\u014dua Kuahuula===\nIn 1790 Kamehameha advanced against the [[Puna, Hawaii|district of Puna]] deposing [[Keawemauhili|Chief Keawema{{okina}}uhili]]. At his home in Ka{{okina}}\u016b, where he was exiled, [[Keoua Kuahuula|Ke\u014dua K\u016b{{okina}}ahu{{okina}}ula]] took advantage of Kamehameha's absence and began an uprising. When Kamehameha returned, Ke\u014dua escaped to the [[Kilauea|K\u012blauea]] volcano, which erupted. Many warriors died from the poisonous gas.{{reference needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhen the [[Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site|Pu{{okina}}ukohol\u0101 Heiau]] was completed in 1791, Kamehameha invited Ke\u014dua to meet with him. Ke\u014dua may have been dispirited by his recent losses. He may have mutilated himself before landing so as to render himself an inappropriate sacrificial victim. As he stepped on shore, one of Kamehameha's chiefs threw a spear at him. By some accounts, he dodged it but was then cut down by musket fire. Caught by surprise, Ke\u014dua's bodyguards were killed. With Ke\u014dua dead, and his supporters captured or slain, Kamehameha became King of Hawai{{okina}}i island.{{sfn|Gowen|1919}}{{page number missing|date=April 2017}}\n\n=== Maui and O\u02bbahu ===\n[[File:Tianna by John Meares3.jpg|thumb|Ka\u02bbiana]]\nIn 1795, Kamehameha set sail with an armada of 960 war canoes and 10,000 soldiers. He quickly secured the lightly defended islands of [[Maui]] and [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]] at the [[Archeological Sites at Kawela|Battle of Kawela]]. He moved on to the island of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], landing his troops at Wai{{okina}}alae and [[Waikiki|Waik\u012bk\u012b]]. Kamehameha did not know that one of his commanders, a high-ranking ''ali{{okina}}i'' named Ka{{okina}}iana, had defected to Kalanik\u016bpule. Ka{{okina}}iana assisted in cutting notches into the [[Nu\u2018uanu Pali|Nu{{okina}}uanu Pali]] mountain ridge; these notches, like those on a [[castle]] turret, were to serve as gunports for Kalanik\u016bpule's cannon.{{sfn|Gowen|1919}}{{page number missing|date=April 2017}}  In a series of skirmishes, Kamehameha's forces pushed Kalanik\u016bpule's men back until they were cornered on the [[Pali Lookout]]. While Kamehameha moved on the Pali, his troops took heavy fire from the cannon. He assigned two divisions of his best warriors to climb to the Pali to attack the cannons from behind; they surprised Kalanik\u016bpule's gunners and took control. With the loss of their guns, Kalanik\u016bpule's troops fell into disarray and were cornered by Kamehameha's still-organized troops. A [[Battle of Nu\u02bbuanu|fierce battle]] ensued, with Kamehameha's forces forming an enclosing wall. Using traditional Hawaiian spears, as well as muskets and cannon, they killed most of Kalanik\u016bpule's forces. Over 400 men were forced over the Pali's cliff, a drop of 1,000 feet. Ka{{okina}}iana was killed during the action; Kalanik\u016bpule was later captured and sacrificed to K\u016bk\u0101{{okina}}ilimoku.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn April 1810, King [[Kaumualii|Kaumuali{{okina}}i]] of Kaua'i became a [[vassal]] of Kamehameha, who therefore emerged as the sole sovereign of the unified [[Hawaiian islands]].{{sfn|Potter|Kasdon|Rayson|2003}}{{page number needed|date=April 2017}} Angry over the settlement, several chiefs plotted to kill Kaumuali{{okina}}i with poison at the feast in his honor. Isaac Davis got word of this and warned the King who escaped unharmed quietly before the dinner. The poison meant for the king was said to instead have been given to Davis, who died suddenly.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Ali\u02bbi nui of the Hawaiian Islands==\n\nAs ruler, Kamehameha took steps to ensure the islands remained a united realm after his death. He unified the legal system. He used the products collected in taxes to promote trade with [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].\n\nThe origins of the ''[[Mamalahoe|Law of the Splintered Paddle]]'' are derived from before the unification of the Island of Hawai{{okina}}i. In 1782 during a raid, Kamehameha caught his foot in a rock. Two local fishermen, fearful of the great warrior, hit Kamehameha hard on the head with a large paddle, which broke the paddle. Kamehameha was stunned and left for dead, allowing the fisherman and his companion to escape. Twelve years later, the same fishermen were brought before Kamehameha for punishment. The king instead blamed himself for attacking innocent people, gave the fishermen gifts of land and set them free. He declared the new law, \"Let every elderly person, woman, and child lie by the roadside in safety.\" This influenced many subsequent humanitarian laws of war.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nYoung and Davis became advisors to Kamehameha and provided him with advanced weapons that helped in combat. Kamehameha was also a religious king and the holder of the war god Kuka{{okina}} ilimoku. Vancouver noted that Kamehameha worshiped his gods and wooden images in a [[heiau]], but originally wanted to bring England's religion, [[Christianity]], to Hawai{{okina}}i. Missionaries were not sent from Great Britain because Kamehameha told Vancouver that the gods he worshiped were his gods with ''[[mana]]'', and that through these gods, Kamehameha had become supreme ruler over all of the islands. Witnessing Kamehameha's devotion, Vancouver decided against sending missionaries from England.{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|pages=180-181}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Kamehameha Ier 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Kamehameha I in the United States Capitol.]]\nAfter about 1812, Kamehameha spent his time at [[Kamakahonu]], a compound he built in [[Kailua-Kona]].{{cn|date=May 2019}} As was the custom of the time, he had several wives and many children, though he outlived about half of them.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Final resting place===\nWhen Kamehameha died on May 8 or 14, 1819,{{sfn|Mookini|1998|pages=1-24}}{{sfn|Gast|1973|page= 24}}{{sfn|Klieger|1998|page=24}} his body was hidden by his trusted friends, [[Hoapili]] and [[Hoolulu|Ho{{okina}}olulu]], in the ancient custom called ''h\u016bn\u0101kele'' (literally, \"to hide in secret\"). The ''mana'', or power of a person, was considered to be sacred. As per the ancient custom, his body was buried in a hidden location because of his ''mana''. His final resting place remains unknown. At one point in his reign, [[Kamehameha III]] asked that Hoapili show him where his father's bones were buried, but on the way there Hoapili knew that they were being followed, so he turned around.{{sfn|Potter|Kasdon|Rayson|2003}}{{page number needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Family==\n{{Main article|House of Kamehameha}}\nKamehameha had many wives. The exact number is debated because documents that recorded the names of his wives were destroyed. Bingham lists 21, but earlier research from [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] counted 26.{{sfn|Van Dyke|2008|page= 360}} In ''Kamehameha's Children Today'' authors Ahlo and Walker list 30 wives: 18 that bore children, and 12 that did not. They state the total number of children to be 35: 17 sons, and 18 daughters.{{sfn|Ahlo|Walker|Johnson|2000|pages= 2-80}} While he had many wives and children, his children through his highest-ranking wife, [[Ke\u014dp\u016bolani]], succeeded him to the throne.{{sfn|Vowell|2011|page= 32}} In ''Ho`omana: Understanding the Sacred and Spiritual'', Chun stated that Ke\u014dp\u016bolani supported Ka\u02bbahumanu's ending of the [[Kapu]] system as the best way to ensure that Kamehameha's children and grandchildren would rule the kingdom.{{sfn|Chun|2007|page= 13}}\n\n{{Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu, Kamehameha, K\u0101nekap\u014dlei and Peleuli family tree}}\n\n===Pedigree chart===\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

By most accounts he was born in Ainakea, [[Kohala, Hawaii]].{{sfn|Alexander|1912|p= 7}} His father was [[Ke\u014dua|Ke\u014dua Kalanikupuapa'ikalaninui]];{{sfn|Lili\u02bbuokalani|Forbes|2013|page= 3}}{{sfn|Pratt|1920|page= 9}} however, [[Native Hawaiian]] [[historian]] [[Samuel Kamakau]] states that Maui monarch [[Kahekili II]] had ''[[hanai]]'' adopted (traditional, informal adoption) Kamehameha at birth, as was the custom of the time. Kamakau believes this is why Kahekili II is often referred to as Kamehameha's father.{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|p=68}} The author also tells of how [[Kame'eiamoku]], (one of the royal twins and father of [[Hoapili]]), told Kamehameha I that he was actually the son of [[Kahekili II]], saying, \"I have something to tell you: Ka-hekili was your father, you were not Keoua's son. Here are the tokens that you are the son of Ka-hekili.\"{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|p=188}}  King Kalakaua wrote that these rumors are scandals and should be very properly dismissed as being the offspring of hatred and jealousies of later years.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gp1EAQAAMAAJ&pg=|title=The Legends and Myths of Hawaii: The Fables and Folk-lore of a Strange People|last=Hawaii)|first=David Kalakaua (King of|date=1888|publisher=C.L.

The 1758 dating also places his birth after the death of his father.{{sfn|Tregaskis|1973|page= xxi}} Kamakau published an account in the ''[[Ka Nupepa Kuokoa]]'' in 1867 placing the date of Kamehameha's birth around 1736.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|page= 429}} He wrote, \"It was during the time of the warfare among the chiefs of [the island of] Hawaii which followed the death of Keawe, chief over the whole island (Ke-awe-i-kekahi-ali\u02bbi-o-ka-moku) that Kamehameha I was born\". However, his general dating has been challenged as twenty years too early over issues involving Kamakau's inaccuracy of dating and the accounts of foreign visitors.{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|page=66}} Regardless, [[Abraham Fornander]] wrote in his book, \"An Account of the Polynesian Race: Its Origins and Migrations\": \"when Kamehameha died in 1819 he was past eighty years old. His birth would thus fall between 1736 and 1740, probably nearer the former than the latter\".{{sfn|Fornander|Stokes|1880|page=136}} ''A Brief History of the Hawaiian People'' by William De Witt Alexander lists the birth date in the \"Chronological Table of Events of Hawaiian History\" as 1736.{{sfn|Alexander|1912|page=331}} In 1888 the Kamakau account was challenged by [[Samuel C. Damon]] in the missionary publication; ''The Friend'', deferring to a 1753 dating that was the first mentioned by [[James Jackson Jarves]]. Regardless of this challenge, the Kamakau dating was widely accepted due to support from [[Abraham Fornander]].{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|page= 429}}\n\n===Concealment, childhood===\n\nAt the time of Kamehameha's birth, Ke\u014dua and his half-brother [[Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu]] were serving [[Alapa\u02bbinui]], ruler of Hawaii\u02bbs island. Alapa\u02bbinui had brought the brothers to his court after defeating both their fathers in the civil war that followed the death of Keawe\u02bb\u012bkekahiali\u02bbiokamoku. Ke\u014dua died while Kamehameha was young, so Kamehameha was raised in the court of his uncle, Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu.{{sfn|Kanahele|1986|page=10}} The traditional ''mele'' chant of Keaka, wife of [[Alapainui]], indicates that Kamehameha was born in the month of ''ikuw\u0101'' (winter) or around November.{{sfn|TRUSTEES|1937|page= 15}} Alapai had given the child, Kamehameha, to his wife, Keaka, and her sister, H\u0101kau, to care for after the ruler discovered the infant had survived.{{sfn|\u02bb\u012a\u02bb\u012b|1983|page=4}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=79}}\n\nOn February 10, 1911, the Kamakau version was challenged again by the oral history of the Kaha family, as published in newspaper articles also appearing in the ''Kuoko''. After the republication of the story by Kamakau to a larger English reading public in 1911 Hawaii, this version of the story was published by [[Kamaka Stillman]], who had objected to the Nupepa article.{{sfn|Alexander|1912|pages=6-8}}\n\n==Unification of the islands==\n\n===Hawaii Island===\n[[Image:Kuka'ilimoku.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The god K\u016b-ka-ili-moku was left to Kamehameha I by his uncle [[Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu]]]]\nKamehameha was raised in the royal court of his uncle Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu. He achieved prominence in 1782, upon Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's death. While the kingship was inherited by Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's son, [[K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d]], Kamehameha was given a prominent religious position, guardianship of the Hawaiian god of war, [[K\u016b|K\u016bk\u0101{{okina}}ilimoku]], as well as control of the district of [[Waipio Valley|Waipi{{okina}}o valley]]. The two cousins' relationship was strained, caused when Kamehameha made a dedication to the gods instead of K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d. Kamehameha accepted the allegiance of a group of chiefs from the Kona district.\n\nThe other story is after the Prophecy was passed along by the High Priests/Priestesses and High Chiefs/Chiefesses. The fulfilling of the Prophecy by lifting the [[Naha Stone]], singled out Kamehameha as the fulfiller of the Prophecy. Other ruling Chiefs, Keawe Mauhili, the Mahoe (twins) Keoua, and other Chiefs rejected the Prophecy of Ka Poukahi. The High Chiefs of Kauai and supported Kiwala`o even after learning about the Prophecy.  The five Kona chiefs supporting Kamehameha were: [[Keeaumoku Papaiahiahi|Ke{{okina}}eaumoku P\u0101pa{{okina}}iahiahi]] (Kamehameha's father-in-law/grand Uncle), [[Keaweaheulu|Keaweaheulu Kalua{{okina}}\u0101pana]] (Kamehameha's uncle), Kek\u016bhaupi{{okina}}o (Kamehameha's warrior teacher), [[Kameeiamoku|Kame{{okina}}eiamoku]] and [[Kamanawa]] (twin uncles of Kamehameha). They defended Kamehameha as the Unifier Ka Na`i aupuni. High Chiefs Keawe Mauhili and Keeaumoku were by genealogy the next in line for Ali`i Nui. Both chose the younger nephews Kiwala`o and Kamehameha over themselves.  K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d was soon defeated in the first key conflict, the [[Battle of Moku'ohai|Battle of Moku{{okina}}\u014dhai]], and Kamehameha and His Chiefs took over Konohiki responsibilities and sacred obligations of the districts of Kohala, Kona, and H\u0101m\u0101kua on Hawai{{okina}}i island.{{sfn|Desha|Frazier|2000|pages=1-138}}\n\nThe Prophecy included far more than Hawai{{okina}}i island. It went across and beyond the Pacific Islands to the semi-continent of [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand). He was supported by his most political wife [[Kaahumanu|Ka{{okina}}ahumanu]] and father High Chief Keeaumoku  Senior Counselor to Kamehameha, She became one of Hawai{{okina}}i's most powerful figures. Kamehameha and his Council of Chiefs planned to unite the rest of the Hawaiian Islands. Allies came from British and American traders, who sold guns and ammunition to Kamehameha. Another major factor in Kamehameha's continued success was the support of Kauai Chief Ka`iana and Captain Brown, who used to be with Kaeo okalani. He guaranteed Kamehameha unlimited gunpowder from China and gave him the formula for gunpowder: sulfur, saltpeter/potassium nitrate, and charcoal, all abundant in the islands.  Two westerners who lived on Hawai{{okina}}i island, [[Isaac Davis (Hawaii)|Isaac Davis]] and [[John Young (Hawaii)|John Young]], married Native Hawaiian women and assisted Kamehameha.{{sfn|Archer|2018|page= 78}}\n\n===Olowalu Massacre===\n{{main|Olowalu Massacre}}\nIn 1789, [[Simon Metcalfe]] captained the fur trading vessel the ''Eleanora'' while his son, [[Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe]], captained the ship {{ship||Fair American}} along the Northwest Coast. They were to rendezvous in what was then known as the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]]. ''Fair American'' was held up when it was captured by the Spanish and then quickly released in [[San Blas Islands|San Blas]]. The ''Eleanora'' arrived in 1790, where it was greeted by chief [[Kame\u02bbeiamoku]]. The chief did something that the captain took offense to, and Metcalfe struck the chief with a rope's end. Sometime later, while docked in Honuaula, Maui, a small boat tied to the ship was stolen by native townspeople with a crewman inside. When Metcalfe discovered where the boat was taken, he sailed directly to the village called [[Olowalu]]. There he confirmed the boat had been broken apart and the man killed. He had already fired muskets into the previous village where he was anchored, killing some residents, Metcalfe took aim at this small town of native Hawaiians. He had all cannons moved to one side of the ship and began his trading call out to the locals. Hundreds of people came out to the beach to trade and canoes were launched. When they were within firing range, the ship fired on the Hawaiians, killing over 100. Six weeks later, ''Fair American'' was stuck near the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona coast]] of Hawaii where chief Kame\u02bbeiamoku was living. He had decided to attack the next foreign ship to avenge the strike by the elder Metcalfe. He canoed out to the ship with his men, where he killed Metcalfe's son and all but one (Isaac Davis) of the five crewmen. Kamehameha took Davis into protection and took possession of the ship. ''Eleanora'' was at that time anchored at [[Kealakekua Bay]], where the ship's [[boatswain]] had gone ashore and been captured by Kamehameha's forces because Kamehameha believed Metcalfe was planning more revenge. ''Eleanora'' waited several days before sailing off, apparently without knowledge of what had happened to ''Fair American'' or Metcalfe's son. Davis and ''Eleanora's'' boatswain, John Young, tried to escape, but were treated as chiefs, given wives and settled in Hawaii.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|page=24}}\n\n===Death of Ke\u014dua Kuahuula===\nIn 1790 Kamehameha advanced against the [[Puna, Hawaii|district of Puna]] deposing [[Keawemauhili|Chief Keawema{{okina}}uhili]]. At his home in Ka{{okina}}\u016b, where he was exiled, [[Keoua Kuahuula|Ke\u014dua K\u016b{{okina}}ahu{{okina}}ula]] took advantage of Kamehameha's absence and began an uprising. When Kamehameha returned, Ke\u014dua escaped to the [[Kilauea|K\u012blauea]] volcano, which erupted. Many warriors died from the poisonous gas.{{reference needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhen the [[Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site|Pu{{okina}}ukohol\u0101 Heiau]] was completed in 1791, Kamehameha invited Ke\u014dua to meet with him. Ke\u014dua may have been dispirited by his recent losses. He may have mutilated himself before landing so as to render himself an inappropriate sacrificial victim. As he stepped on shore, one of Kamehameha's chiefs threw a spear at him. By some accounts, he dodged it but was then cut down by musket fire. Caught by surprise, Ke\u014dua's bodyguards were killed. With Ke\u014dua dead, and his supporters captured or slain, Kamehameha became King of Hawai{{okina}}i island.{{sfn|Gowen|1919}}{{page number missing|date=April 2017}}\n\n=== Maui and O\u02bbahu ===\n[[File:Tianna by John Meares3.jpg|thumb|Ka\u02bbiana]]\nIn 1795, Kamehameha set sail with an armada of 960 war canoes and 10,000 soldiers. He quickly secured the lightly defended islands of [[Maui]] and [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]] at the [[Archeological Sites at Kawela|Battle of Kawela]]. He moved on to the island of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], landing his troops at Wai{{okina}}alae and [[Waikiki|Waik\u012bk\u012b]]. Kamehameha did not know that one of his commanders, a high-ranking ''ali{{okina}}i'' named Ka{{okina}}iana, had defected to Kalanik\u016bpule. Ka{{okina}}iana assisted in cutting notches into the [[Nu\u2018uanu Pali|Nu{{okina}}uanu Pali]] mountain ridge; these notches, like those on a [[castle]] turret, were to serve as gunports for Kalanik\u016bpule's cannon.{{sfn|Gowen|1919}}{{page number missing|date=April 2017}}  In a series of skirmishes, Kamehameha's forces pushed Kalanik\u016bpule's men back until they were cornered on the [[Pali Lookout]]. While Kamehameha moved on the Pali, his troops took heavy fire from the cannon. He assigned two divisions of his best warriors to climb to the Pali to attack the cannons from behind; they surprised Kalanik\u016bpule's gunners and took control. With the loss of their guns, Kalanik\u016bpule's troops fell into disarray and were cornered by Kamehameha's still-organized troops. A [[Battle of Nu\u02bbuanu|fierce battle]] ensued, with Kamehameha's forces forming an enclosing wall. Using traditional Hawaiian spears, as well as muskets and cannon, they killed most of Kalanik\u016bpule's forces. Over 400 men were forced over the Pali's cliff, a drop of 1,000 feet. Ka{{okina}}iana was killed during the action; Kalanik\u016bpule was later captured and sacrificed to K\u016bk\u0101{{okina}}ilimoku.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn April 1810, King [[Kaumualii|Kaumuali{{okina}}i]] of Kaua'i became a [[vassal]] of Kamehameha, who therefore emerged as the sole sovereign of the unified [[Hawaiian islands]].{{sfn|Potter|Kasdon|Rayson|2003}}{{page number needed|date=April 2017}} Angry over the settlement, several chiefs plotted to kill Kaumuali{{okina}}i with poison at the feast in his honor. Isaac Davis got word of this and warned the King who escaped unharmed quietly before the dinner. The poison meant for the king was said to instead have been given to Davis, who died suddenly.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Ali\u02bbi nui of the Hawaiian Islands==\n\nAs ruler, Kamehameha took steps to ensure the islands remained a united realm after his death. He unified the legal system. He used the products collected in taxes to promote trade with [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].\n\nThe origins of the ''[[Mamalahoe|Law of the Splintered Paddle]]'' are derived from before the unification of the Island of Hawai{{okina}}i. In 1782 during a raid, Kamehameha caught his foot in a rock. Two local fishermen, fearful of the great warrior, hit Kamehameha hard on the head with a large paddle, which broke the paddle. Kamehameha was stunned and left for dead, allowing the fisherman and his companion to escape. Twelve years later, the same fishermen were brought before Kamehameha for punishment. The king instead blamed himself for attacking innocent people, gave the fishermen gifts of land and set them free. He declared the new law, \"Let every elderly person, woman, and child lie by the roadside in safety.\" This influenced many subsequent humanitarian laws of war.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nYoung and Davis became advisors to Kamehameha and provided him with advanced weapons that helped in combat. Kamehameha was also a religious king and the holder of the war god Kuka{{okina}} ilimoku. Vancouver noted that Kamehameha worshiped his gods and wooden images in a [[heiau]], but originally wanted to bring England's religion, [[Christianity]], to Hawai{{okina}}i. Missionaries were not sent from Great Britain because Kamehameha told Vancouver that the gods he worshiped were his gods with ''[[mana]]'', and that through these gods, Kamehameha had become supreme ruler over all of the islands. Witnessing Kamehameha's devotion, Vancouver decided against sending missionaries from England.{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|pages=180-181}}\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Kamehameha Ier 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Kamehameha I in the United States Capitol.]]\nAfter about 1812, Kamehameha spent his time at [[Kamakahonu]], a compound he built in [[Kailua-Kona]].{{cn|date=May 2019}} As was the custom of the time, he had several wives and many children, though he outlived about half of them.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Final resting place===\nWhen Kamehameha died on May 8 or 14, 1819,{{sfn|Mookini|1998|pages=1-24}}{{sfn|Gast|1973|page= 24}}{{sfn|Klieger|1998|page=24}} his body was hidden by his trusted friends, [[Hoapili]] and [[Hoolulu|Ho{{okina}}olulu]], in the ancient custom called ''h\u016bn\u0101kele'' (literally, \"to hide in secret\"). The ''mana'', or power of a person, was considered to be sacred. As per the ancient custom, his body was buried in a hidden location because of his ''mana''. His final resting place remains unknown. At one point in his reign, [[Kamehameha III]] asked that Hoapili show him where his father's bones were buried, but on the way there Hoapili knew that they were being followed, so he turned around.{{sfn|Potter|Kasdon|Rayson|2003}}{{page number needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Family==\n{{Main article|House of Kamehameha}}\nKamehameha had many wives. The exact number is debated because documents that recorded the names of his wives were destroyed. Bingham lists 21, but earlier research from [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] counted 26.{{sfn|Van Dyke|2008|page= 360}} In ''Kamehameha's Children Today'' authors Ahlo and Walker list 30 wives: 18 that bore children, and 12 that did not.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jachts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L. Francis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q4RONp_1mrMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+sailing+yachts|title=The Golden Age of Yachting|date=2007|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-251-6|location=|pages=19\u201325|language=en}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 1739, England found itself in a series of wars\u2014a period that saw a decline in yachting. In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T.

The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of [[jib]] and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and [[trysail]] (in place of the [[mainsail]]).
