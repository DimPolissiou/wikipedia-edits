It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Lower Toarcian epicontinental black shales (Posidonia Shale, SW Germany): global versus regional control. Geobios 35, 13\u201320.</ref> The Black shales present in the Posidonia Formation are related to deposits present on Lithuania, Canada and several other countries & Continents. This suggests the presence of a general deposition of organic matter, driven by several global events and changes present on the surface. This caused changes on the bottom of the seas, with abundant deposition of organic matter. It\u00b4s related to a change in carbon-isotope excursion in marine and terrestrial life, and was probably a perturbator of the carbon cycle.<ref>Brumsack, H. J. (1991).

Waters interchange were on of the major effects on the paulatine de-oxygenation showed on most of the Lower Toarcian Layers around the word, with the connection with the Viking Corridor as one of the main effects, due to the arctic waters freshening and breaking the oceanic circulation.<ref>Dera, G., & Donnadieu, Y. (2012). Modeling evidences for global warming, Arctic seawater freshening, and sluggish oceanic circulation during the Early Toarcian anoxic event. Paleoceanography, 27(2).</ref> The effect was consequently negative on the German realm, where the environments expose a tropical fluctuation, with conditions similar to the modern [[Caribbean Sea]], which hosted a high variety of sea fauna, except on the bottom layers, where only a few genera where able to survive when oxygen conditions get slightly better. <ref>Dickson, A.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

Kingston is now a separate municipality from the County of Frontenac.\n\n==History==\n===Naming history and etymology===\n\nA number of origins of \"Cataraqui\", Kingston's original name, have been postulated.

In 1674, [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was appointed commandant of the fort. From this base, de La Salle explored west and south as far as the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name=\"kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca\"/> The fort was rebuilt several times and experienced periods of abandonment. The Iroquois siege of 1688 led to many deaths, after which the French destroyed the fort, but would rebuild it. The British destroyed the fort during the [[Battle of Fort Frontenac]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1758 and its ruins remained abandoned until the British took possession and partially reconstructed it in 1783. The fort was renamed T\u00eate-de-Pont Barracks in 1787. It was turned over to the Canadian military in 1870\u201371 and is still being used by the military.

Queen's University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen's Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation; therefore, Queen's lost the ability to renovate the interior and is considering its options.\n\nIn September 2013, after almost 180 years of housing prisoners, Kingston Penitentiary closed. The maximum security prison was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in February 1990 due to its history and reputation.

Support for this is found in a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote ''\"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\"''<ref name=\"queens\">{{cite web|title=Hockey night in Kingston |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 |accessdate=June 21, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between Queen's University and the Royal Military College of Canada. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada.

The first winner of the [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at [[Cataraqui Golf and Country Club]] (founded in 1917 and redesigned by [[Stanley Thompson]] in 1930). Green also helped design several courses in eastern Ontario, including Smiths Falls (1949), Glen Lawrence (1955), Rideau Lakes (1961), Amherstview (1971), Garrison (1971), Evergreen (1972), Belle Park Fairways (1975), Rivendell (1979), and Colonnade (1984). [[Matt McQuillan]], a professional player on the [[PGA Tour]] for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, was born and raised in Kingston, and developed his game at the [[Garrison Golf and Curling Club]]. McQuillan won the 2005 Telus [[Edmonton]] Open on the [[Canadian Professional Golf Tour]].\n\n===Curling===\nThree curling clubs are in the Kingston area: the Cataraqui Golf & Country Club, Garrison Golf & Curling Club, and the [[Royal Kingston Curling Club]].<ref>[http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston CurlingRink.ca \u2013 Kingston Curling Clubs and Rinks \u2013 Kingston, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174549/http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston |date=July 6, 2011 }} Retrieved March 2, 2011</ref> The Royal Kingston Curling Club (RKCC) was founded in 1820, and was granted Royal patronage in 1993.

The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at [[Twin Elm Rugby Park]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]].\n\n===Football===\nThe earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the [[Kingston Granites]] which played in the predecessor league to the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 8\u20130. Kingston also hosted the [[10th Grey Cup]] on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.\nMany notable football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nThe Kingston Volleyball Club (KVC) was founded in 2015.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

The resulting explosion spread the fire throughout the city's downtown area, destroying a large number of buildings, including the old city hall. To prevent similar incidents from occurring in future, the city began building with limestone or brick. This rebuilding phase was referred to as \"the Limestone Revolution\" and earned the city the nickname \"The Limestone City\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thewhig.com/2010/02/11/fire-and-gunpowder-explosions-demolished-kingstons-waterfront |title=Fire and gunpowder explosions demolished Kingston's waterfront |newspaper=Kingston Whig-Standard |date=February 8, 2010 |archive-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072604/http://www.thewhig.com/2010/02/11/fire-and-gunpowder-explosions-demolished-kingstons-waterfront|accessdate=December 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kingstonpublicmarket.ca/about/history Kingston Public Market History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619042910/http://www.kingstonpublicmarket.ca/about/history |date=June 19, 2015 }} Retrieved October 8, 2015</ref><ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;99</ref>\n\n===More recent developments===\n\nThe [[Canadian Locomotive Company]] was at one time the largest locomotive works in the British Empire and the Davis [[Tanning (leather)|Tannery]] was at one time the largest tannery in the British Empire.

Queen's University grew from about 2,000 students in the 1940s to its present size of over 28,000 students, more than 90 per cent of whom are from outside the Kingston area. The Kingston campus of [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]] was established in 1969, and the college has 6,700 full-time students. The Royal Military College of Canada was founded in 1876, and has about 1,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen's. The city's economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, military institutions, and prison installations.\n\nMunicipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding [[Township (Canada)|townships]], which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the City was amalgamated with Kingston Township and [[Pittsburgh, Kingston|Pittsburgh Township]] to form the new City of Kingston.

To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre.

{"title_page": "Anne de Chantraine", "text_new": "'''Anne de Chantraine''' ( March 19 1601 \u2013 18 October 1622) was one of the many people to be accused and burned for witchcraft in the Great Witch Hunts of the 17th century. At the age of 21 she was burned at the stake for witchcraft in the village of Waret-la-Chaussee in Belgium France. Just before being burned she was strangled by the executioner. <ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref>\n\n==Trial of Anne de Chantraine==\n\n===26 March 1620===\nThe sergeant of the court of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e arrested a young lady called Anne de Chantraine; she was 19 years old, she had come to live in the village with her father and was reputed to be a witch. Anne was a very beautiful girl, she has long red hair, people associated her hair with the flames of hell. There has been a lot of things going on in the village. The crops have been failing, the cows were not giving milk and the hens were laying sterile eggs, all this was deemed to be the workings of witchcraft. The person who denounced Anne a witch was none other than her neighbour, whose advances she refused. \n\nOn March 28, 1620, the accused was examined informally. She was brought before the mayor, Thomas Douclet, and the aldermen of the district. Fearing the instruments of the master of high works, she avoided torture by confessing freely to being a witch. She then made the most brazen avowals. \n\nBorn on March 19, 1601. in the town of Liege, to a traveling merchant father, her mother died when Anne was only 1 years old. Not long after the death of her mother, Anne's father placed her in the hospital of saint jean the Baptist in liege. Little Anne resided at the hospital for fifteen years, where she was fed and raised up, and along with other little girls was taught to read and write, also was taught about religion, and learned how to sew. Has heard that her father Jean de Chantraine is still alive and living in Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e. At the age of 17 she went to live in the house of one named Christine de la Ch\u00e9raille, to where Anne was taken and presented by a certain servant at the hospital named Catherine ; her having said that she knew how to sew well. Anne became a seamstress, her job was to sew, make new clothes, and sometimes mend old clothes. Catherine was Christine's daughter, she also had a son called Henry. One evening, Anne was asked by Christine if she wanted to go to a wedding celebration with her ? To which she agreed. And the same day, at midnight, she was woken by Christine, saying it was time to go to the party and being close to her she rubbed on some black grease down to her waist and encouraged the prisoner to do the same. To what To which she replied she didn\u2019t have scabies. Upon which Christine replied to her that she would be even more beautiful and afterwards Christine anointed her and having proffered the following words : \" kneel down, touch the ground, then straight, straight up ! \" flew up the chimney and then the prisoner did the same and was taken to a grand room where she found there to be many people amongst those other than Christine, the aforementioned CHAUMONT, with many others that she shall say upon afterwards, being all seated around a table where there were silver goblets and having taken a piece of meat in her mouth and smelling that it was foul she spat it from her mouth, saying also that the candles that were burning were black. And when the said prisoner asked of the said assembly where she had come to, it was said to her in reply that they had come to her wedding celebration, and having said \"well beautiful bride who shall be the groom,\" a young, beardless man with a black hat and cloven feet approached closely to her and asked her if she wanted to be married to him. And she having replied to him that she had not yet done any lovemaking. She replied to him that they were not accustomed to making love. And after having spent some time he asked her if he could be seated with her. She said \"Jesus Mary how have I came to do this\" ? And all of a sudden, the company and all who had been in the chamber disappeared and she found herself in a courtyard where she stayed some time. And at the breaking of the day, Christine, came to collect her and as she said that she could not go on foot, she took her under the arms and carried her to a river where she found a boat and two women who took her back and took two days to arrive in Li\u00e8ge. And after having been ill for a long time, Christine asked her if she wanted to give herself to the devil and that in doing so she would be cured. Her having refused to do so, Christine took up a knife threatening to cut her throat and after several moments, she finally gave in Christine who gave her some bread, having eaten of which she was cured. The same evening Christine, with Laurent, took her to the same room or chamber as before, or first to some handsome companions, the name of whom she has forgotten at present, the one who had feathers in his hat, the one who requested to get upon her. This which he did and has done many times since in fact every time she went to the dances that being three times a week, be it known on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Saying also that the member of her so-called demon was very cold and his semen hot, as it seemed to her, and as soon as he removed his member, under where it came out, according to her, something red has been there since. Confessing also that Laurent CHAUMONT had many affairs with her ; saying that his member was hot and twice as big as that of her demon's. During the dances here taking place there was a lame witch lying on her stomach, the whole length of the table, and with a black candle placed in the hole of her arse serving as a candlestick and that she danced around for a quarter of an hour, and when she had finished, all those of the assembly went and kissed the arse of a goat and worshipped it, each carrying a lit black candle, which they left upon the table. Then the goat burst into flames and was reduced to ashes, and these ashes were distributed amongst all the witches for their use, and just as they had been ordered to by their gallants. Saying also that the said goat, though having been burnt to ashes, stood upright as a man and distributed the said powder or ashes himself. And this done, each of the said gallants had relations with each witch just as they had had relations them with them previously at the dances. Laurent de Chamont, brother-in-law and lover of her mistress, he was the king of the witches in that region, he was the leader of the group. They entered people's houses at night by magic and stole money, jewelry, books, clothes, and food. It was Laurent de Chamont who shaved and cut hairs from his sexual organs, and armpits, placing them on the palm of his hand, he blew them into keyholes; for it was thus, by the help of the devil, that doors of houses and locks of chests were opened. But the gang of witches were finally caught. Anne denounced Christine, Laurent, Catherine, and henry witches, they were arrested and burned alive at the stake. She had resided with Christine in the space of one year, until She left Christine, because she and her children along with Laurent de Chaumont, brother-in-law of Christine were engaged in crime and they were so evil. Having left she went to live at La Seraille, a place she knew of because Christine was going to go there with a cart as she desired many goods and accoutrements belonging to the wife of the said Teraille ; the prisoner having warned the said wife which was the reason that she was received in the house having placed all her trust in the woman, the prisoner's job there was to wash the laundry, hanging the laundry out and ironing the laundry. Having left the said Teraille, she went to live with her godmother Agnes Le Pape, she lived there for the whole of winter. This Agnes gave her a bandeau. It was then that the prisoner was arrested. The prisoner's punishment was not to be tortured or executed like her accomplices, but she was to be banished from Liege. Leaving the principality of Liege, she was taken to her father, who had settled at War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, he had re married. Anne hired herself as a milkmaid to a farmer named Laurent Streignart, she milked his cows. She lived in Waret with her father for a whole year for 13 months. His new wife Marie Descry was very nice to her, Anne looked on her as the mother she never had. \n\nThese were the confessions of Anne de Chantraine. But the magistrate wanted to know more information. So that same day the tribunal decided to send one of its members to Liege to obtain more complete information. They will interrogate the prisoner to know more of her crimes and if she had any other accomplices now in Waret.\nGuilame BODART 1620\n\n===September 15, 1620===\nBecause of the number of cases under consideration, Anne's trial was put on hold. It ended up being for six months. A member of the tribunal has finally now been sent to Liege.\n\n===Enquiry held at Li\u00e8ge 15 September 1620===\nI the undersigned, deputy burgomaster of the High Court of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e, commissioner in this region, deputy of the Court by their ordinance laid down in certain words, containing the instruction to necessitate any enquiries or information to be given by the Mayor of Waret against, Anne de Chantraie, have, on the 15th of September 1620, left Namur and travelled to the city of Li\u00e8ge ; where upon arrival, on this day, today the 16th of the same month, after having taken leave of the parties, Mayors and deputy burgomasters of Li\u00e8ge, have provided the said necessary information as follows : \n\n1st Witness \n1. Gaspar Jose, brewer residing in Li\u00e8ge, aged 55,   \nexamined according to the content of our instruction, after having been sworn in, stated he had a very good acquaintance of Anne, she had stayed for six weeks in the house of the witness, and that he received her and upheld her by charity, given that she was a poor girl. Anne had freely admitted to him that she is a witch, and that the first time she found herself at the dance, she was taken there by one named Christine de la Ch\u00e9raille along with her daughter and her son, these with whom she lived with until she lived at the house of the witness. These, Christine and her daughter who anointed themselves with grease under their arms and also anointed each other; thus forthwith they left by the chimney and the devil carried them far away to beautiful rooms and a nuptial banquet where they found many people seated at the table, upon which table she says there was neither salt, nor knives, and that there she recognized Laurent Chaumont, who was serving at table. Saying that she went three times a week and Anne told him that they danced back to back and that just after the Devil appeared on a table in the form of a goat. He which she, along with all the others, went forward in worship and kissed its behind. Also it should be said that Laurent CHAUMONT shaved and cut the hairs of his shameful parts and under his arms to serve to open the gates. Anne told him that each time she went to the sabbath the devil would sometimes be in the form of a dog, cat, toad, snake. He would then change to his true form whenever he wants to. Upon the 4th article testified; that in her youth she was upheld by charity at the hospital of Saint Jean the Baptist in the place (#). Soon after, she was housed with the daughter of Christine, named Catherine to learn how to sew. The witness having, just after, received her in there house, as has been said, and this notwithstanding, she was still going there to sew. Inserted in the margin of line 4 (#) (and because her mother was dead and she was orphaned of her father) Here also testified, upon the 5th article, questioning to find a remedy for such unhappiness: the godmother of Anne would have her exorcized by a priest named LE COUSTRE, from Saint-Pierre. States that Anne was not imprisoned, or examined, otherwise produced as a witness at the request of the witness upon the crimes committed against them by Christine when she lived with her. And it is to this that he testifies, and after reading has confirmed and signed. \nSigned Gaspar Jose\n\n2nd Witness\n2. Anne de Chevron wife of Gaspar Jose residing in Li\u00e8ge, aged 50 years, \nafter being sworn in, the witness had offered to take the prisoner away to her own house in order for her to gain information and given that she had made this offer without having such intention, and not wishing to do so, really desiring saying as the prisoner soon after she left prison, she asked her if she could retire with her. She replied yes with difficulty, but said that her intention was and had been that if this happened she would denounce her immediately to the officers of justice at Li\u00e8ge, who greatly desired to have her in their power, in order to investigate the truth regarding the reputations of all witches. Also the hearsay of the witness is, Anne de Chantraine is a cunning and spiteful woman, she stole a silver-gilt ring from one of the witness\u2019s daughter's and sold it along with other ornaments.  \nThis is Anne de Chevron's testimony, and after reading, she has confirmed it. Signed Anne de Chevron\n\n3rd Witness\n3. Agnes LE Pape, godmother of Anne de Chantraine, residing in Li\u00e8ge, the age of Agn\u00e8s 27, \nafter being sworn in, has testified that Anne stayed with her for some time, after having stayed with Christine in her house, then with Gaspar Jose for six weeks, and since then with Agn\u00e8s for three months, and nonetheless being fed and assisted, was seen to be conversing normally in the house of Gaspar Jose during which time she frankly stated and confessed having lived with Christine and her daughter, these whom she says are witches and they took her to the dance with them. Also, has said that the devil slept with her while being in the house of Agnes. Having heard no hearsay that she should be accused before and in this she was never accused or imprisoned or examined. Also testifying, she told her that she stayed in her youth at the hospital of saint Jean, then after at the house of Christine, not knowing why she was taken out. Also testifying, questioning upon finding a way to remedy such unhappiness ; she was taken to the house of COUSTRE of Saint-Pierre where she was exorcized, being here made to kneel \u00bbin the presence of Agn\u00e8s, her godmother. Also testifying again, Agn\u00e8s particularly, that on the same day that Anne was exorcized, Agn\u00e8s urged her, in the evening, to pray to God and say that she shall give herself over to God and to the Virgin Mary. But instead of doing so, she said she had given herself to the devil, stating that whenever she wishes to say good things, he appears to her as his servant. And that she has never before known how to make the Sign of the Cross. Also testifying again, that at the time she stayed in the house of Agn\u00e8s, a child of Marie LE MESSAGIER, who lived in a room at the top of the house of Agn\u00e8s, became ill, and Agn\u00e8s took flight forthwith, the child languished and died ; for which people have a bad opinion of her. And this is Agnes's testimony, and after reading she has confirmed it. Signed Agnes le Pape\n\n4th witness \n4. Fran\u00e7ois Jamart, draper\u2019s merchant, residing in the market at Li\u00e8ge, aged 33 years old, \nexamined as were the previous witnesses, after being sworn in, has testified to having seen Anne, that she spent some time which she was in the house of Gaspar Jose, brewer, without residing anywhere else in a fixed manner apart from in his house or in the house of her godmother Agnes in which she lived at the time. Not thinking that she would be accused even though it is true she had been seen living in Christine's house being a witness amongst others in the house falling before the opinion of others, upon the existence of witches this which Anne said again and in as much that the said Anne stayed with the said Christine and her daughter, these being the women of the said LE ROUSSEAU ; she was asked by the witness if they were really witches, to which Anne replied that : yes, they were witches. Following which she was asked by the witness if she herself was a witch. And after several statements were given in this, she frankly and freely confessed that once, in the evening Christine asked her if she would like to go along to a party with her and her daughter. To which she agreed and then, they took a jar of unguent with which they anointed themselves and saying certain words they flew up the chimney and were carried for away in the air, where they found themselves in a beautiful room, found tables dressed and piled with all kinds of meat; but these were already sliced and at the table there were neither knives nor salt. And that at these said dances they would have recognized Laurent CHAUMONT, and several women, these which Laurent served at table with a serviette on his arm carrying pots and afterwards took to dancing with their backs against each other. And this done, each demon took his partner and each took a seat together. And at that instant, the devil in the form of a goat jumped onto a table and each of the witches went forward to worship and to kiss his behind.\nThis is Francois's testimony, and after reading, he has confirmed it.

They did spend a lot of time together, he did try lots of times to be with her, but her free spirit always got in the way. Now the boy had heard that people where talking about Anne with her strange ways, now he had seen her picking strange flowers.

The first said she knew the accused had the reputation of being a witch, and one day when she felt ill, she was convinced she had been bewitched by Anne. Accordingly she complained to the accused, and Anne prepared some pancakes for her. When she had eaten the first, she began to vomit and immediately felt better. The second witness was a friend of the accused and had received certain confidences from her which she made known to the tribunal-common- places about the Sabbath and the magic powders. She could give only one definite fact: one of her children had been poisoned and later on cured by Anne on the same day. The third witness declared on oath that the prisoner had healed two bewitched children by taking away a spell, but that she had also caused the death of a young girl who lived in the village. \nGuilame BODART 1620\n\nDecember 7, 1620. \nPresented by the said Mayor assisted by the advocate DARDENE the 7th December 1620.

And this was at the dance behind the court of the mayor.\n\nWho advised her to cure the said child and why had she treated it in such a way rather than otherwise ? \nSaid that her step-mother, to whom she had declared her deed, had asked her to find the said infant. And having been asked of her how she had done so ? Told us that she had asked earlier of the devil to give her leave to do so, saying in these terms : \"Satan, would you truly wish me to cure this child ? \". This which she repeated three times, and this said, she took up the infant under the arms, turned around with it, and thus he was cured. And asked her : who had taught her to do so ? Said that it had been Christine, adding having also cured Philippe's son Jamie using the same method as above.   \n\nHow does she know that Catherine Cigne had placed poison in the cinders in the house of the prisoner to poison her step-mother ? \nSaid that she had been at a dance another time and had seen that the devil gave the poison to the said Catherine to kill her step-mother. It was a black powder that came from a goat that was burned at the Sabbath. This poison which was placed by this Catharine in the cinders at the house with this intention. Knowing of this, the prisoner fearing that her step-mother should die, had taken it out, having her hand seriously burned. \n\nWas asked of her what she had done with the poison that she had taken away from her step-mother ?\nSaid she had thrown it onto the fire. \n\nWas asked what did she do with the poison that she took from the Marshall's child?\nSaid she had given it to a unknown girl who she came across.\n\nAnd after having made her read her responses as above she persisted in them.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk 1620\n\n10th of February 1621.\nPresented by the advocate DARDENNE, in the name of the said officer, on the 10th of February 1621, in the presence of Pierre DELVAULX ; LINCHAMPS and MORTEAUME magistrates of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e.

This poison was black, enveloped in paper. Before, Christine said upon taking the said poison : that she would do it. Said also that being on the street named upon Meuze in Li\u00e8ge, with Christine and seeing the wife of the said Leonard, Christine said to the prisoner : \"Wait, here is my friend, I am going to give to her that which Cain gave to me.\" And in fact approached her, saying : \"Good day, my friend \". And on saying this, she touched her hip with the powder that she had in her hand.\n\nBy which means does she know, and from whom, that the wife of the said L\u00e9onard JACQUE, must have rejected the poison that she had ?  \nSaid that Christine had taught her how to cure those that had been poisoned saying three times whenever someone was presented to them having been poisoned in order to be cured : \u00ab Satan do you wish me to take this away from them that you have made take the poison ? \u00bb And this question asked, made held them up under the arms, made them turn one turn, and again said the same words as above whilst touching the hand of the empoisoned, saying that there was more assurance of recovery by making them turn around, and that she had cured the wife of L\u00e9onard JACQUE.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk 1621\n\nOf the 15th of April, 1621. \nHaving today have appear before us Jean de Chantraine father of the prisoner, To which he declared when his wife died, his daughter was 1 years old.

And so he left the prisoner in the hospital of Saint-Jean the Baptist at Li\u00e8ge, he entrusted his daughter in the care of kindly nuns. When asked if upon the return of the prisoner to Waret, he had noticed anything about her or her behaviour? Said that several times she had fallen as if with a sickness, not really knowing what caused this in her, although he believed, that it was due to drink, to which she had taken to sometimes, or if the devil was tormenting her. Saying also that at no time had this happened upon her when she had not been drinking. And having, the witness, asked of his daughter from where this came upon her? Said nothing else, apart from this happened to her several times in two years, and that afterwards he pulled three hairs from his head, took salt and Holy Water and threw them over his head behind her. When asked also, if following this which we know having heard, as above, from the witness, the prisoner then did anything to him? He said that as she did not wish to obey, he beat her and struck her, after which she said, as she left the house, that she would do even worse. And at the same instant it seemed, to the witness, that he lost his sight or at least that it was blurred, and that instead of seeing one person he saw three or four of the same, and this not long after all this happened. \n\nHaving also had brought before us Marie Descry (the new) wife of Jean de Chantraine, She stated that she thought of Anne as her actual daughter, always spoke with her, got on very well with her. Told that on one day the prisoner having returned from milking her cows at work, she took a knife and afterwards gave it back to the witness, Marie saying if Anne had kept the knife she would have stabbed herself because she was in so much despair. Later that evening when Anne had gone to bed, Marie heard a moan coming from her room. Going in she surprised her by seeing Anne trying to strangle herself with the cords of her headdress. Fortunately they were not strong enough. Anne started crying, Marie rushed to her hugging her and reassuring her, she rocked Anne in her arms where she fell asleep with her tears. And being, the witness, asked if Anne had saved her from taken poison out of her drink, said yes and she confirmed what she had said that she had thrown it into the fire. She also said that Anne had told her that Catherine had poised the Marshal's child. To which her step-mother urged her to go to the child and hurry to cure it at once. Anne later on coming back home she assured her step-mother that she had saved the child, and the child was now fine. \nAnd after reading they both confirmed that above.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk That same day Anne was asked why she had given the poison to the girl who lives two leagues from Waret.

Having seen, Anne de Chantraine prisoner, previously examined upon whether she had given the poison mentioned in the two articles of this instruction of the said Master advisor to the girl therein mentioned: said she has no memory of this, to which she insisted.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621 \n\nSince then and at the time has confessed to it being veritable, that after having taken the poison from the child of the new marshal of the said Waret, in the presence of and assisted by the devil her gallant called Green-Bonnet, she had given the said poison, that consisted of a black powder that came from a goat that was ordinarily burnt at the dances, to a girl who passed behind Waret along the main road that goes from Namur to Hannut ; \u2026\u2026 asked touching with the hand in which she held the powder upon the back of the skirts of the said girl with the intention of killing her. Not knowing who she is, or where she lives, other than that she had afterwards been told by her gallant, that she was the daughter of a censor residing two leagues from the said Waret, without naming the name, or her residence, but that her father had the good means to support her. This which occurred not long before her imprisonment saying that on the day after her so-called gallant told her that the said girl was dead and that since then he told her she was not and that the devil was a liar. Not knowing of any other thing. And examined as to why she had until the present been secretive and had denied that above : said that she feared that we would have her done to death.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621\n \nOf the 9th of June 1621 \nAnne de Chantraine prisoner was interrogated upon which houses the crimes were committed in of which she spoke in her deposition of the said day and that Christine, Laurent de CHAUMONT and herself had stolen away.

And from a house in front of the Court they stole away a barrel of white wine. \nGuilame BODART \n\nOn June 15th 1621. \nfive witnesses came from Li\u00e8ge to testify on her morals. They were Conrad de Phencenal, from whom she had stolen many tin plates; , Anne de Chevron who had been robbed by her of linen and jewels; L\u00e9onard de Vaulx and his daughter, who brought a theft of 300 florins against her. A young merchant, Wautier Betoren, declared he had been her victim to the extent of a piece of linen, but that a friend of Anne, had given him twenty florins by way of indemnity.\n\nThe mayor of War\u00eat had a meeting at Namur, where the Provincial Council gave an authorisation for torture, in order to know if the accused might have any other accomplices in War\u00eat.\n\nJune 19th, 1621. \nThe torturer of Namur L\u00e9onard Balzat came to War\u00eat. It was decided that the accused should be submitted to the torture of water cure. \nTwo days later the torture was repeated, but this time the torturer poured very hot water through the funnel placed in her throat. It was a horrible scene, when the funnel was removed from her mouth, Anne was coughing, moaning, sobbing. However this still did not make her to reveal her accomplices, nothing more could be found out. She was in a very bad condition, she could not eat any food that evening. She refused to eat because of her throat. \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\nJuly 23rd, 1621. \nThe judges of Waret then turned to their superiors in Namur who opted for death. On July 23, the delegates of the Provincial Council condemned Anne de Chantraine to death, the sentence was made known to Anne on the 26th. She in a burst of despair, denied all her confessions.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\n===December 9, 1621===\nAnne de Chantraine was not executed. During the winter of 1621 the mayor made another visit to Namur. On December 9 he received an answer that \"in view of the inquiries held by a deputed commission since the sentence pronounced in the court of War\u00eat on July 26, the aldermen should see to it that the said sentence be carried into execution according to due form and tenor.\"  \n\n===December 14, 1621===\nThe undersigned clerk of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e certifies that on this day the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), at about six o\u2019clock in the morning, he has to be found at the gates of the prison, in which Anne de CHANTRAINE was imprisoned, where in the presence of Jacques de HERAUDE rag merchant, sentence was pronounced upon the prisoner obtained against her by the Mayor of Waret following the judgement made by My lords of the Council of Namur on the 9th of this month. After which announcement, the undersigned said to the prisoner that she should repent truly of all her sins so she would be able to properly give herself over to God. To which she made no reply. And that instantly father MONCEAU Jesuit and his companion came in, and after the sign of the cross having been made by MONCEAU he had asked of the prisoner how she fared, remonstrating with her, and that since she had been sentenced, that she should make a good and full confession. Upon which, the prisoner replied that she was happy to die for her sins but not for being a witch, which she twice reiterated to which father MONCEAU replied to her that a witch must die as a witch, a thief as a thief. Upon these words, the undersigned left to go and find the Lord Councillor BODART, leaving the Jesuits alone with the prisoner. Such was done the day and year above.  \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk to the Court \nOf the said Waret \n\nUpon this day, the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), Godefroid GAIFFIER, licensed in law and Jan de LOFFE magistrates of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e, were taken to the gaols of this town to Anne de CHANTRAINE prisoner, with effect to hear if she persists in her denials of events of witchcraft heretofore voluntarily confessed to by her, not only before those of the Court, but to the Lord Councillor BODART, and to question if the confessions made before, touching upon these events, were veritable. She replied no. And it was asked of her why she had accused herself as a witch for? To which Anne shouted that she does not know why she told people that she was a witch. And it was asked of her where she had learned of the events and that she could not have any knowledge of them if she was not truly a witch. Said she learned by hearsay, and that she dare not die upon the false confessions of these events. And was asked of her if she was resolved to die. Replied that yes, but only for her sins. And it was asked of her if her sins were other than those legally confessed to by her. Gave no reply apart from some ambiguous ones, not wanting to reply pertinently, even when pressed. This day, brother Jean Bartholom\u00e9, a religious of the order of Saint Francis, declared to us that he had heard the prisoner today in her confession. And that after this was ended, the prisoner told him that she wishes to restore the honor and good reputation that she had taken from all those she had accused in her legal confessions witches and that she doesn\u2019t know of badness in them and that they were good people like her and that she had decided to declare this in such a way publicly to the Judiciary. Outside the room, the clerk of the court was interested in the sanity of the prisoner, the jailer was asked if he had at anytime noticed anything abnormal about Anne, he said that \"the prisoner was stupid, did not understand what she said, though sometimes she seemed quite right in her mind\".\nBy ordonance. \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n\nAgain Anne de Chantraine was still not executed. She languished for sometime in the prison of Waret. In September 1622 on the 7th, the Council decided to re-examine the facts confessed by the accused. Two new councillors were appointed. Upon examining the said prisoner she acted like she was troubled in spirit. In order to facilitate the inquiry, it was decided to take the accused to Namur where she was imprisoned in the Tour de Bordial, on the bank of the Sambre, at the foot of the citadel.\nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n \n12th of September 1622. \nWas heard the commissioner\u2019s report upon what is required made law by them upon this day. Anne de Chantraine prisoner, has been advised that the first commissioner shall be informed by the jailer, his wife and others that the jailer shall name, upon whether during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner, they remarked that she was troubled in spirit and in judgement, as she demonstrated during the discourse held with the commissioners on this day, and on the 7th of the same month. They said that the prisoner was troubled in spirit. \n\nAnne was brought into the council at Namur, The jailer armed with scissors and razer cut Anne's hair and shaved her head. She was stripped of her shift, and dressed in a plain shift. Afterwards she had an exorcism performed on her by priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU.\nGuillaume BODART\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===28 September 1622===\nSummoned before us{{Who|date=March 2020}} is Jacques de HERAUD prison warder in this town, the same man heard and examined in conformity with the decree of the 12th of this month in order to know if during daily chats and conversations he, his wife or servants may have had with Anne de Chantraine, prisoner, if they noticed that she was troubled of spirit or in judgement ? Upon which, he replied to us under oath that he has not had any other conversation with the prisoner, apart from on the occasions when he checked up on her in prison and brought her something to eat or had it taken by his children, who he also accompanied, if then he had asked her at any time what she had done ? To which she had always responded well regarding this, never continuing on at any time from previous discourse, he remarked that he had not now noticed if she seemed troubled, or lacking in spirit, since the exorcism. Though by the hearsay of the priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU having visited her ; the prisoner was heavy-hearted and did not know what she was saying, and that going there to see her just after the witness, he found that she spoke and conversed as well as she had always been seen to do, saying \"if they make me say something enough I shall say it\", knowing that she is a witch, but that soon afterwards she revoked it. He told us also, that the prisoner's father came to see her. Where he made it heard that he blamed Anne his daughter for her actions, saying \"look well for yourselves, swear even that she has not done so\", and at that she replied, \"let us not speak of this at all father, if I have done something to you, I asked it of you\". The jailer also added that whilst she had been in prison, she had had a quarrel with two women (his) young nieces. Those who usually brought her something to eat, and this because they had not known soon enough, or well enough, what she desired upon which occasion, she menaced them and said they will pay for it. And in fact, sometimes having been near to the prisoner, they returned sick: spending water and foul stuff from their mouths, seeming to be ill enough to die. By which the jailer was overcame by emotion and trouble and accused the prisoner and harassed and menaced her, saying to her that if she did not cure them, there would be no other executioner than he to see her killed. Upon which she replied to him that she had not done anything to them, but that she could cure them fully, and having upon the instant brought the two girls towards her, he saw that she took them by the hand and started to say words which he cannot remember and that he began to run away, leaving behind with her the two girls, and forthwith and in an instant they returned to being all changed and healed just as they had been before, as was seen by several prisoners they were completely amazed and said, \"she must be a devil herself\". And as much the two girls have since been well, apart from one who seems to still feel the effects, as there may be no doubt. The hearsay of one of his nieces was, one time when she was taking Anne's food to her, she entered the room alone where Anne was languishing. Anne was sprawled on the straw. Her head in the corner made a light spot: the clarity was dull. when she gave the prisoner her food, Anne stared at her with a dead look. It was a terrible look. It seemed to the niece an accusation and a reproach. The niece was unable to bear it. She fled the room. The jailer states that the very first day the prisoner was brought to this prison, she had words and discourse with him pertaining to her doings and acts of witchcraft, circumstances and reasons and so surely that he was shocked and amazed by it all. Saying having had many witches on his hands, as many in Fernelmont as here, and that he has never heard any of them talk as much about witchcraft, nor none before, as does the prisoner. Upon which he insists. \nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\nOf the 5th of October 1622 before LINCHAMPS and de LOFFE. \nSummoned Marie de FODAU, wife of Jacques de HERAUDE (the jailer) aged seventy-two years. She after having sworn by oath, was examined upon whether if, during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner since she was in prison, had she noticed that she was troubled of spirit and judgement? Has stated not having any other conversation with the prisoner unless it was whilst bringing her food or having food brought to her by her two nieces, during which times they often conversed with her, not noticing in any way at all that she seemed troubled in spirit or in judgement. Given that she spoke and has always spoken and replied with assurance and good judgement, as she still does daily, without noticing any change from her since she has been in prison. Upon this she insists. \nNot having signed for not knowing how to write. \nB. de LINCHAMPS 1622  J. de LOFFE 1622 \n\nOctober 17, 1622, the definitive sentence was brought in: death by fire with preliminary strangulation. On that day Anne was brought back to War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, the place that would be fixed for her execution. During the following night L\u00e9onard Balzat and his assistant prepared the pyre, a huge heap of a hundred fagots bought in the village itself. In the centre, sheaves of straw were placed, and a hollow was made large enough in the straw to contain a stool. The prisoner had no idea that she was going to be executed the next day, nobody told her.\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===October 18, 1622===\nAt dawn Anne was awakened by the jailer, the clerk of the court, and a priest, who announced the fatal news to her. She said she was glad to die for her sins, but persisted in her denial of not being a witch. She was led out. The executioner was waiting with a cart, and the condemned girl climbed into it. When they reached the end of the village where the pyre was, L\u00e9onard Balzat took Anne out of the cart and walked her over to the stake. In a loud voice, Anne denied that she was a witch, admitted that she was a thief, and acknowledged that everything she did was wrong. Leonard Balzat helped her to climb the pyre, seated her on the stool among the straw, then with his own hands he abruptly strangled her. The executioner set fire to the stake. Smoke enveloped her, the crackling flames took her. The pyre burned for two days. On the third day the ashes were dispersed to the four winds. Anne de Chantraine was 21 years old when she was burned at the stake for being a witch.\nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n<ref>https://livres-mystiques.com/partieTEXTES/Etudes_satan/Satan.html#repression_appendice</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nAnne de Chantraine is a [[playable character]] in ''[[Nightmare (Atmosfear series)|Nightmare/Atmosfear]]'',<ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref><ref>[http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm Official Atmosfear website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308054916/http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm |date=March 8, 2008 }}</ref> a series of [[interactive]] [[board game]].

At the age of 21 she was burned at the stake for witchcraft in the village of Waret-la-Chaussee in Belgium France. Just before being burned she was strangled by the executioner. <ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref>\n\n==Trial of Anne de Chantraine==\n\n===26 March 1620===\nThe sergeant of the court of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e arrested a young lady called Anne de Chantraine; she was 19 years old, she had come to live in the village with her father and was reputed to be a witch. Anne was a very beautiful girl, she has long red hair, people associated her hair with the flames of hell. There has been a lot of things going on in the village. The crops have been failing, the cows were not giving milk and the hens were laying sterile eggs, all this was deemed to be the workings of witchcraft. The person who denounced Anne a witch was none other than her neighbour, whose advances she refused. \n\nOn March 28, 1620, the accused was examined informally. She was brought before the mayor, Thomas Douclet, and the aldermen of the district. Fearing the instruments of the master of high works, she avoided torture by confessing freely to being a witch. She then made the most brazen avowals. \n\nBorn on March 19, 1601. in the town of Liege, to a traveling merchant father, her mother died when Anne was only 1 years old. Not long after the death of her mother, Anne's father placed her in the hospital of saint jean the Baptist in liege. Little Anne resided at the hospital for fifteen years, where she was fed and raised up, and along with other little girls was taught to read and write, also was taught about religion, and learned how to sew. Has heard that her father Jean de Chantraine is still alive and living in Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e. At the age of 17 she went to live in the house of one named Christine de la Ch\u00e9raille, to where Anne was taken and presented by a certain servant at the hospital named Catherine ; her having said that she knew how to sew well. Anne became a seamstress, her job was to sew, make new clothes, and sometimes mend old clothes. Catherine was Christine's daughter, she also had a son called Henry. One evening, Anne was asked by Christine if she wanted to go to a wedding celebration with her ? To which she agreed. And the same day, at midnight, she was woken by Christine, saying it was time to go to the party and being close to her she rubbed on some black grease down to her waist and encouraged the prisoner to do the same. To what To which she replied she didn\u2019t have scabies. Upon which Christine replied to her that she would be even more beautiful and afterwards Christine anointed her and having proffered the following words : \" kneel down, touch the ground, then straight, straight up ! \" flew up the chimney and then the prisoner did the same and was taken to a grand room where she found there to be many people amongst those other than Christine, the aforementioned CHAUMONT, with many others that she shall say upon afterwards, being all seated around a table where there were silver goblets and having taken a piece of meat in her mouth and smelling that it was foul she spat it from her mouth, saying also that the candles that were burning were black. And when the said prisoner asked of the said assembly where she had come to, it was said to her in reply that they had come to her wedding celebration, and having said \"well beautiful bride who shall be the groom,\" a young, beardless man with a black hat and cloven feet approached closely to her and asked her if she wanted to be married to him. And she having replied to him that she had not yet done any lovemaking. She replied to him that they were not accustomed to making love. And after having spent some time he asked her if he could be seated with her. She said \"Jesus Mary how have I came to do this\" ? And all of a sudden, the company and all who had been in the chamber disappeared and she found herself in a courtyard where she stayed some time. And at the breaking of the day, Christine, came to collect her and as she said that she could not go on foot, she took her under the arms and carried her to a river where she found a boat and two women who took her back and took two days to arrive in Li\u00e8ge. And after having been ill for a long time, Christine asked her if she wanted to give herself to the devil and that in doing so she would be cured. Her having refused to do so, Christine took up a knife threatening to cut her throat and after several moments, she finally gave in Christine who gave her some bread, having eaten of which she was cured. The same evening Christine, with Laurent, took her to the same room or chamber as before, or first to some handsome companions, the name of whom she has forgotten at present, the one who had feathers in his hat, the one who requested to get upon her. This which he did and has done many times since in fact every time she went to the dances that being three times a week, be it known on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Saying also that the member of her so-called demon was very cold and his semen hot, as it seemed to her, and as soon as he removed his member, under where it came out, according to her, something red has been there since. Confessing also that Laurent CHAUMONT had many affairs with her ; saying that his member was hot and twice as big as that of her demon's. During the dances here taking place there was a lame witch lying on her stomach, the whole length of the table, and with a black candle placed in the hole of her arse serving as a candlestick and that she danced around for a quarter of an hour, and when she had finished, all those of the assembly went and kissed the arse of a goat and worshipped it, each carrying a lit black candle, which they left upon the table. Then the goat burst into flames and was reduced to ashes, and these ashes were distributed amongst all the witches for their use, and just as they had been ordered to by their gallants. Saying also that the said goat, though having been burnt to ashes, stood upright as a man and distributed the said powder or ashes himself. And this done, each of the said gallants had relations with each witch just as they had had relations them with them previously at the dances. Laurent de Chamont, brother-in-law and lover of her mistress, he was the king of the witches in that region, he was the leader of the group. They entered people's houses at night by magic and stole money, jewelry, books, clothes, and food. It was Laurent de Chamont who shaved and cut hairs from his sexual organs, and armpits, placing them on the palm of his hand, he blew them into keyholes; for it was thus, by the help of the devil, that doors of houses and locks of chests were opened. But the gang of witches were finally caught. Anne denounced Christine, Laurent, Catherine, and henry witches, they were arrested and burned alive at the stake. She had resided with Christine in the space of one year, until She left Christine, because she and her children along with Laurent de Chaumont, brother-in-law of Christine were engaged in crime and they were so evil. Having left she went to live at La Seraille, a place she knew of because Christine was going to go there with a cart as she desired many goods and accoutrements belonging to the wife of the said Teraille ; the prisoner having warned the said wife which was the reason that she was received in the house having placed all her trust in the woman, the prisoner's job there was to wash the laundry, hanging the laundry out and ironing the laundry. Having left the said Teraille, she went to live with her godmother Agnes Le Pape, she lived there for the whole of winter. This Agnes gave her a bandeau. It was then that the prisoner was arrested. The prisoner's punishment was not to be tortured or executed like her accomplices, but she was to be banished from Liege. Leaving the principality of Liege, she was taken to her father, who had settled at War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, he had re married. Anne hired herself as a milkmaid to a farmer named Laurent Streignart, she milked his cows. She lived in Waret with her father for a whole year for 13 months. His new wife Marie Descry was very nice to her, Anne looked on her as the mother she never had. \n\nThese were the confessions of Anne de Chantraine. But the magistrate wanted to know more information. So that same day the tribunal decided to send one of its members to Liege to obtain more complete information. They will interrogate the prisoner to know more of her crimes and if she had any other accomplices now in Waret.\nGuilame BODART 1620\n\n===September 15, 1620===\nBecause of the number of cases under consideration, Anne's trial was put on hold. It ended up being for six months.

The first said she knew the accused had the reputation of being a witch, and one day when she felt ill, she was convinced she had been bewitched by Anne. Accordingly she complained to the accused, and Anne prepared some pancakes for her. When she had eaten the first, she began to vomit and immediately felt better. The second witness was a friend of the accused and had received certain confidences from her which she made known to the tribunal-common- places about the Sabbath and the magic powders. She could give only one definite fact: one of her children had been poisoned and later on cured by Anne on the same day.

Told us that she had asked earlier of the devil to give her leave to do so, saying in these terms : \"Satan, would you truly wish me to cure this child ? \". This which she repeated three times, and this said, she took up the infant under the arms, turned around with it, and thus he was cured. And asked her : who had taught her to do so ? Said that it had been Christine, adding having also cured Philippe's son Jamie using the same method as above.   \n\nHow does she know that Catherine Cigne had placed poison in the cinders in the house of the prisoner to poison her step-mother ? \nSaid that she had been at a dance another time and had seen that the devil gave the poison to the said Catherine to kill her step-mother.

When asked if upon the return of the prisoner to Waret, he had noticed anything about her or her behaviour? Said that several times she had fallen as if with a sickness, not really knowing what caused this in her, although he believed, that it was due to drink, to which she had taken to sometimes, or if the devil was tormenting her. Saying also that at no time had this happened upon her when she had not been drinking. And having, the witness, asked of his daughter from where this came upon her? Said nothing else, apart from this happened to her several times in two years, and that afterwards he pulled three hairs from his head, took salt and Holy Water and threw them over his head behind her. When asked also, if following this which we know having heard, as above, from the witness, the prisoner then did anything to him? He said that as she did not wish to obey, he beat her and struck her, after which she said, as she left the house, that she would do even worse. And at the same instant it seemed, to the witness, that he lost his sight or at least that it was blurred, and that instead of seeing one person he saw three or four of the same, and this not long after all this happened. \n\nHaving also had brought before us Marie Descry (the new) wife of Jean de Chantraine, She stated that she thought of Anne as her actual daughter, always spoke with her, got on very well with her. Told that on one day the prisoner having returned from milking her cows at work, she took a knife and afterwards gave it back to the witness, Marie saying if Anne had kept the knife she would have stabbed herself because she was in so much despair. Later that evening when Anne had gone to bed, Marie heard a moan coming from her room. Going in she surprised her by seeing Anne trying to strangle herself with the cords of her headdress. Fortunately they were not strong enough. Anne started crying, Marie rushed to her hugging her and reassuring her, she rocked Anne in her arms where she fell asleep with her tears. And being, the witness, asked if Anne had saved her from taken poison out of her drink, said yes and she confirmed what she had said that she had thrown it into the fire. She also said that Anne had told her that Catherine had poised the Marshal's child. To which her step-mother urged her to go to the child and hurry to cure it at once. Anne later on coming back home she assured her step-mother that she had saved the child, and the child was now fine. \nAnd after reading they both confirmed that above.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk That same day Anne was asked why she had given the poison to the girl who lives two leagues from Waret. To which right then the prisoner declared that she don't remember saying that she gave the poison to some girl.\n\nOn the 16th of the same month of April (1621), before LINCHAMPS, de LOFFE, GAIFFIER and BOYEMANS. Having seen, Anne de Chantraine prisoner, previously examined upon whether she had given the poison mentioned in the two articles of this instruction of the said Master advisor to the girl therein mentioned: said she has no memory of this, to which she insisted.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621 \n\nSince then and at the time has confessed to it being veritable, that after having taken the poison from the child of the new marshal of the said Waret, in the presence of and assisted by the devil her gallant called Green-Bonnet, she had given the said poison, that consisted of a black powder that came from a goat that was ordinarily burnt at the dances, to a girl who passed behind Waret along the main road that goes from Namur to Hannut ; \u2026\u2026 asked touching with the hand in which she held the powder upon the back of the skirts of the said girl with the intention of killing her. Not knowing who she is, or where she lives, other than that she had afterwards been told by her gallant, that she was the daughter of a censor residing two leagues from the said Waret, without naming the name, or her residence, but that her father had the good means to support her. This which occurred not long before her imprisonment saying that on the day after her so-called gallant told her that the said girl was dead and that since then he told her she was not and that the devil was a liar. Not knowing of any other thing. And examined as to why she had until the present been secretive and had denied that above : said that she feared that we would have her done to death.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621\n \nOf the 9th of June 1621 \nAnne de Chantraine prisoner was interrogated upon which houses the crimes were committed in of which she spoke in her deposition of the said day and that Christine, Laurent de CHAUMONT and herself had stolen away. Has replied that the most they had taken away had been at la Theraille, where they had taken and stole away much money, sheets of lace, cloths and napkins. Item, in the house of L\u00e9onard de VAULX, they stole away : money, all at once, many sacks of oats, skirts, coats and cloaks. Item, in the house of Chenseval they stole away sheets of lace, and many other things, and also much money. At Cigne, upon le Goffe at Li\u00e8ge : wine in a bottle, only once. And said that when they returned they came with demons and said that all these crimes were carried out when they returned from the dances. Said that otherwise, said that they had stripped a house on the bridge to the Isle, the house known to belong to the Lady de la Theraille, and they took from this house : sheets for a skirt, money and silk. And from a house in front of the Court they stole away a barrel of white wine. \nGuilame BODART \n\nOn June 15th 1621. \nfive witnesses came from Li\u00e8ge to testify on her morals. They were Conrad de Phencenal, from whom she had stolen many tin plates; , Anne de Chevron who had been robbed by her of linen and jewels; L\u00e9onard de Vaulx and his daughter, who brought a theft of 300 florins against her. A young merchant, Wautier Betoren, declared he had been her victim to the extent of a piece of linen, but that a friend of Anne, had given him twenty florins by way of indemnity.\n\nThe mayor of War\u00eat had a meeting at Namur, where the Provincial Council gave an authorisation for torture, in order to know if the accused might have any other accomplices in War\u00eat.\n\nJune 19th, 1621. \nThe torturer of Namur L\u00e9onard Balzat came to War\u00eat. It was decided that the accused should be submitted to the torture of water cure. \nTwo days later the torture was repeated, but this time the torturer poured very hot water through the funnel placed in her throat. It was a horrible scene, when the funnel was removed from her mouth, Anne was coughing, moaning, sobbing. However this still did not make her to reveal her accomplices, nothing more could be found out. She was in a very bad condition, she could not eat any food that evening. She refused to eat because of her throat. \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\nJuly 23rd, 1621. \nThe judges of Waret then turned to their superiors in Namur who opted for death. On July 23, the delegates of the Provincial Council condemned Anne de Chantraine to death, the sentence was made known to Anne on the 26th. She in a burst of despair, denied all her confessions.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\n===December 9, 1621===\nAnne de Chantraine was not executed. During the winter of 1621 the mayor made another visit to Namur. On December 9 he received an answer that \"in view of the inquiries held by a deputed commission since the sentence pronounced in the court of War\u00eat on July 26, the aldermen should see to it that the said sentence be carried into execution according to due form and tenor.\"  \n\n===December 14, 1621===\nThe undersigned clerk of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e certifies that on this day the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), at about six o\u2019clock in the morning, he has to be found at the gates of the prison, in which Anne de CHANTRAINE was imprisoned, where in the presence of Jacques de HERAUDE rag merchant, sentence was pronounced upon the prisoner obtained against her by the Mayor of Waret following the judgement made by My lords of the Council of Namur on the 9th of this month. After which announcement, the undersigned said to the prisoner that she should repent truly of all her sins so she would be able to properly give herself over to God. To which she made no reply. And that instantly father MONCEAU Jesuit and his companion came in, and after the sign of the cross having been made by MONCEAU he had asked of the prisoner how she fared, remonstrating with her, and that since she had been sentenced, that she should make a good and full confession. Upon which, the prisoner replied that she was happy to die for her sins but not for being a witch, which she twice reiterated to which father MONCEAU replied to her that a witch must die as a witch, a thief as a thief. Upon these words, the undersigned left to go and find the Lord Councillor BODART, leaving the Jesuits alone with the prisoner. Such was done the day and year above.  \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk to the Court \nOf the said Waret \n\nUpon this day, the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), Godefroid GAIFFIER, licensed in law and Jan de LOFFE magistrates of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e, were taken to the gaols of this town to Anne de CHANTRAINE prisoner, with effect to hear if she persists in her denials of events of witchcraft heretofore voluntarily confessed to by her, not only before those of the Court, but to the Lord Councillor BODART, and to question if the confessions made before, touching upon these events, were veritable. She replied no. And it was asked of her why she had accused herself as a witch for? To which Anne shouted that she does not know why she told people that she was a witch. And it was asked of her where she had learned of the events and that she could not have any knowledge of them if she was not truly a witch. Said she learned by hearsay, and that she dare not die upon the false confessions of these events. And was asked of her if she was resolved to die. Replied that yes, but only for her sins. And it was asked of her if her sins were other than those legally confessed to by her. Gave no reply apart from some ambiguous ones, not wanting to reply pertinently, even when pressed. This day, brother Jean Bartholom\u00e9, a religious of the order of Saint Francis, declared to us that he had heard the prisoner today in her confession. And that after this was ended, the prisoner told him that she wishes to restore the honor and good reputation that she had taken from all those she had accused in her legal confessions witches and that she doesn\u2019t know of badness in them and that they were good people like her and that she had decided to declare this in such a way publicly to the Judiciary. Outside the room, the clerk of the court was interested in the sanity of the prisoner, the jailer was asked if he had at anytime noticed anything abnormal about Anne, he said that \"the prisoner was stupid, did not understand what she said, though sometimes she seemed quite right in her mind\".\nBy ordonance. \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n\nAgain Anne de Chantraine was still not executed. She languished for sometime in the prison of Waret. In September 1622 on the 7th, the Council decided to re-examine the facts confessed by the accused. Two new councillors were appointed. Upon examining the said prisoner she acted like she was troubled in spirit. In order to facilitate the inquiry, it was decided to take the accused to Namur where she was imprisoned in the Tour de Bordial, on the bank of the Sambre, at the foot of the citadel.\nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n \n12th of September 1622. \nWas heard the commissioner\u2019s report upon what is required made law by them upon this day. Anne de Chantraine prisoner, has been advised that the first commissioner shall be informed by the jailer, his wife and others that the jailer shall name, upon whether during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner, they remarked that she was troubled in spirit and in judgement, as she demonstrated during the discourse held with the commissioners on this day, and on the 7th of the same month. They said that the prisoner was troubled in spirit. \n\nAnne was brought into the council at Namur, The jailer armed with scissors and razer cut Anne's hair and shaved her head. She was stripped of her shift, and dressed in a plain shift. Afterwards she had an exorcism performed on her by priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU.\nGuillaume BODART\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===28 September 1622===\nSummoned before us{{Who|date=March 2020}} is Jacques de HERAUD prison warder in this town, the same man heard and examined in conformity with the decree of the 12th of this month in order to know if during daily chats and conversations he, his wife or servants may have had with Anne de Chantraine, prisoner, if they noticed that she was troubled of spirit or in judgement ? Upon which, he replied to us under oath that he has not had any other conversation with the prisoner, apart from on the occasions when he checked up on her in prison and brought her something to eat or had it taken by his children, who he also accompanied, if then he had asked her at any time what she had done ? To which she had always responded well regarding this, never continuing on at any time from previous discourse, he remarked that he had not now noticed if she seemed troubled, or lacking in spirit, since the exorcism. Though by the hearsay of the priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU having visited her ; the prisoner was heavy-hearted and did not know what she was saying, and that going there to see her just after the witness, he found that she spoke and conversed as well as she had always been seen to do, saying \"if they make me say something enough I shall say it\", knowing that she is a witch, but that soon afterwards she revoked it. He told us also, that the prisoner's father came to see her. Where he made it heard that he blamed Anne his daughter for her actions, saying \"look well for yourselves, swear even that she has not done so\", and at that she replied, \"let us not speak of this at all father, if I have done something to you, I asked it of you\". The jailer also added that whilst she had been in prison, she had had a quarrel with two women (his) young nieces. Those who usually brought her something to eat, and this because they had not known soon enough, or well enough, what she desired upon which occasion, she menaced them and said they will pay for it. And in fact, sometimes having been near to the prisoner, they returned sick: spending water and foul stuff from their mouths, seeming to be ill enough to die. By which the jailer was overcame by emotion and trouble and accused the prisoner and harassed and menaced her, saying to her that if she did not cure them, there would be no other executioner than he to see her killed. Upon which she replied to him that she had not done anything to them, but that she could cure them fully, and having upon the instant brought the two girls towards her, he saw that she took them by the hand and started to say words which he cannot remember and that he began to run away, leaving behind with her the two girls, and forthwith and in an instant they returned to being all changed and healed just as they had been before, as was seen by several prisoners they were completely amazed and said, \"she must be a devil herself\". And as much the two girls have since been well, apart from one who seems to still feel the effects, as there may be no doubt. The hearsay of one of his nieces was, one time when she entered the room alone where Anne was languishing. She was sprawled on the straw. Her head in the corner made a light spot: the clarity was dull. when she gave the said prisoner her food, Anne stared at her with a dead look. It was a terrible look. It seemed to the niece an accusation and a reproach. The niece was unable to bear it. She fled the room. The jailer states that the very first day the prisoner was brought to this prison, she had words and discourse with him pertaining to her doings and acts of witchcraft, circumstances and reasons and so surely that he was shocked and amazed by it all. Saying having had many witches on his hands, as many in Fernelmont as here, and that he has never heard any of them talk as much about witchcraft, nor none before, as does the prisoner. Upon which he insists. \nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\nOf the 5th of October 1622 before LINCHAMPS and de LOFFE. \nSummoned Marie de FODAU, wife of Jacques de HERAUDE (the jailer) aged seventy-two years. She after having sworn by oath, was examined upon whether if, during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner since she was in prison, had she noticed that she was troubled of spirit and judgement? Has stated not having any other conversation with the prisoner unless it was whilst bringing her food or having food brought to her by her two nieces, during which times they often conversed with her, not noticing in any way at all that she seemed troubled in spirit or in judgement. Given that she spoke and has always spoken and replied with assurance and good judgement, as she still does daily, without noticing any change from her since she has been in prison. Upon this she insists. \nNot having signed for not knowing how to write. \nB. de LINCHAMPS 1622  J. de LOFFE 1622 \n\nOctober 17, 1622, the definitive sentence was brought in: death by fire with preliminary strangulation. On that day Anne was brought back to War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, the place that would be fixed for her execution. During the following night L\u00e9onard Balzat and his assistant prepared the pyre, a huge heap of a hundred fagots bought in the village itself. In the centre, sheaves of straw were placed, and a hollow was made large enough in the straw to contain a stool. The prisoner had no idea that she was going to be executed the next day, nobody told her.\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===October 18, 1622===\nAt dawn Anne was awakened by the jailer, the clerk of the court, and a priest, who announced the fatal news to her. She said she was glad to die for her sins, but persisted in her denial of not being a witch. She was led out. The executioner was waiting with a cart, and the condemned girl climbed into it. When they reached the end of the village where the pyre was, L\u00e9onard Balzat took Anne out of the cart and walked her over to the stake. In a loud voice, Anne denied that she was a witch, admitted that she was a thief, and acknowledged that everything she did was wrong. Leonard Balzat helped her to climb the pyre, seated her on the stool among the straw, then with his own hands he abruptly strangled her. The executioner set fire to the stake. Smoke enveloped her, the crackling flames took her. The pyre burned for two days. On the third day the ashes were dispersed to the four winds. Anne de Chantraine was 21 years old when she was burned at the stake for being a witch.\nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n<ref>https://livres-mystiques.com/partieTEXTES/Etudes_satan/Satan.html#repression_appendice</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nAnne de Chantraine is a [[playable character]] in ''[[Nightmare (Atmosfear series)|Nightmare/Atmosfear]]'',<ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref><ref>[http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm Official Atmosfear website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308054916/http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm |date=March 8, 2008 }}</ref> a series of [[interactive]] [[board game]].
