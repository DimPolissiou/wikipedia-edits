The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.

He embarked on a solo career despite ill health and disillusionment with commercial success, and often worked in collaboration with [[Mick Ronson]], [[David Bowie]]'s sideman and arranger from ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' period.<ref name=Walker>{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Bruce |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004651/Ian-Hunter.html |title=Ian Hunter Biography |website=Musicianguide.com |accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nMott the Hoople achieved a certain level of commercial success, and attracted a small but devoted fan base. As a solo artist, Hunter charted with lesser-known but more wide-ranging works outside the rock mainstream. His best-known solo songs are \"[[Once Bitten, Twice Shy]]\", later covered by [[Great White]], and \"England Rocks\" , which was modified to \"[[Cleveland Rocks]]\" and then later covered by [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]], and became one of the theme songs used for the American TV series ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''.\n\n==Early years==\nHunter was born in [[Oswestry]], Shropshire, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/ian-hunter-mott-the-hoople-interview/|title=Ian Hunter (ex \u2013 Mott The Hoople) Interview|date=23 August 2012|website=Louderthanwar.com|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref> Due to the onset of war, the family moved to [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire]] to live with the family of his Scottish father.

Hunter soon left his home in Shrewsbury, transferred his apprenticeship from Sentinel/Rolls Royce to [[Timken Company#British Timken|British Timken]] in [[Northampton]], and joined The Apex Group on rhythm guitar. Hunter recalls jumping around like a lunatic on stage: \"Music affected me so much. The rest of them just stood there. It was funny, I had kids who came just to watch me do this, and I can't imagine what it looked like.\"<ref name=\"devine\"/>\n\nHunter left The Apex Group in 1958, just before they recorded their first single \"Yorkshire Relish, Caravan\" for John Lever Records.<ref name=\"Purington\">Purington</ref> Hunter played in a few local groups, but eventually his financial situation forced a change. \"I wasn't making my [[hire-purchase]] payments, and 'little jobs' were getting done and people were getting smacked. I was never in the middle of it, but I was always somewhere in the area.\"<ref name=\"devine\"/> He returned to Shrewsbury, ostensibly to become more responsible in his personal life, and settled down enough to have a steady girlfriend in Diane Coles. Outside of his day job, he and Tony Wardle formed a harmonica duo inspired by [[Morton Fraser's Harmonica Gang]], a local variety act.\n\nOnce out of debt and seemingly settled, Hunter returned to Northampton and The Apex Group. Diane followed and the two married and settled in St James End. Their first child, Stephen, was born there in 1962. Tensions were in the air though, both musically and in his personal life. While his wife attended to home life, Hunter resumed his wild ways with his Northampton mates.\n\nThe Apex Group had steady regional work at clubs and military bases, but Hunter bristled at the formality of the band, who wore matching stage jackets and were moving increasingly toward an R&B-like stage revue. In 1963, while still a group member, Hunter formed a band in direct competition to them: Hurricane Henry and the Shriekers, with Tony Marriott on drums and Julian Coulter on guitar. They worked steadily in Northampton, and attracted the attention of pianist [[Freddie 'Fingers' Lee]]. Lee took over as frontman in March 1964, and Hunter moved to bass. Frank Short eventually learned of Hunter's duplicity, and Hunter was kicked out of The Apex Group.\n\nIt was during this period \u2013 late 1963 or early 1964 \u2013 that The Apex recorded a second disc for John Lever records, released as The Apex Rhythm & Blues All Stars. The four-song [[extended play|EP]] included their own \"Tall Girl\", and covers of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"Reeling and A'Rocking\" and \"Down the Road A'piece\", and Jimmy Gilmer and The Fireballs' \"Sugar Shack\". Hunter probably does not appear on this record; the EP was recorded around the time Hunter left the group for the second time.<ref name=\"Purington\"/>\n\nAt Freddie Lee's suggestion, The Shriekers began taking jobs in the same German clubs where the Beatles had cut their teeth a few years earlier. In an interview taped in 2004, Hunter volunteers that Lee and their gigs in [[Hamburg]] were a major turning point, at which he first began to \"think maybe I could do this instead of working in factories.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, 2005\">Hunter, 2005</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Hunter moved to London, where he joined The Scenery with guitarist [[Miller Anderson (musician)|Miller Anderson]], drummer [[Dave Dufort]] and keyboard player Dante Smith. There Hunter met Mick Ronson, then guitarist of bands the Voice and The Rats, at the [[Flamingo Club (London)|Flamingo Club]] in London. According to Anderson, \"Mick was coming down the stairs ... and we were going up and I said, `Mick, this is my friend, Ian [Hunter] Patterson.'\"<ref>Devine, p. 41</ref> The Scenery, now with John Vernon Smith on drums, recorded tracks with Bill Farley at Regent Sound that were licensed for international release without their knowledge. Hunter and Anderson recall writing and recording \"To Make a Man Cry,\" but not the B-side, \"Thread of Time.\" John Vernon Smith appears on the picture sleeve, but Johnny Banks, of [[The Merseybeats]], played on the record. [[John Gustafson (musician)|Johnny Gustafson]] was also included in the session work. The songs were released on the Impact label, and it is unclear whether they originated from France or Belgium.<ref name=\"Purington\"/>\n\nHunter remained in the band after Anderson's early 1968 departure. Anderson and J.V. Smith were replaced by guitarist Chris Mayfield and drummer Pete Phillipps, and the group backed up Freddie Lee in 'At Last The 1958 Rock and Roll Show'. They got a regular booking at The Angel in Edmonton, and drew interest from both [[Chrysalis Records]] and NEMS but were signed by neither. With Miller Anderson back in place of Mayfield, the group released a single on CBS called \"I Can't Drive\". As the short-lived [[rock and roll]] revival waned, 'At Last the 1958 Rock and Roll Show' changed its name to 'Charlie Woolfe' and released a final single, \"Dance, Dance, Dance\". During Hunter's obscure early years, Hereford's Shakedown Sound, with future Mott members in their ranks, gigged in roughly the same circles but without any record company interest.<ref>Clayson</ref>\n\nHunter played with various other artists throughout the 1960s, including The Young Idea, [[Billy Fury]] and [[David McWilliams (musician)|David McWilliams]]. In late 1968 [[Mickie Most]] hired Hunter and Dufort to play in a band that was to be called 'The New Yardbirds', a name that [[Jimmy Page]] had been using for his post-[[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]] group before discarding it in favour of '[[Led Zeppelin]]'. This led confused fans to think that Hunter had been a member of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Explained Hunter: \"See: this is rubbish, but people read it and believe it.\"<ref>Hunter, 2003</ref> Hunter also worked as a journalist and staff songwriter for [[Francis, Day & Hunter Ltd.]], did road-digging for a local council, and reported for a [[local newspaper]].\n\n==Mott the Hoople years==\nBy 1969, Hunter had two children, but was still hoping for a return to making music full-time. Meanwhile, guitarist [[Mick Ralphs]] joined organist Verden Allen in [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s backing band, The Shakedown Sound. Eventually Ralphs, Allen, vocalist Stan Tippins, bassist Overend Watts, and drummer Dale Griffin united to become Silence, who auditioned for British impresario [[Guy Stevens]]. Silence renamed themselves after [[Willard Manus]]' 1966 novel, ''[[Mott the Hoople (novel)|Mott the Hoople]]''.<ref>Manus</ref> The band lacked a credible singer with stage presence, and the seasoned Hunter, who had by this time taken to wearing his trademark sunglasses, auditioned on a lark and was given the position. They were a critical success in the UK, where some of their most dedicated early fans included future members of the Clash.<ref>Gray</ref> However, they could not sustain their commercial appeal, and their American tours were slow in building a following. Mott released several LPs and attracted enthusiastic live audiences, but experienced dismal sales despite the svengali-like leadership and promotion of Stevens.<ref>Stevens</ref> After a 1972 concert in a \"gas cylinder\" in Switzerland, the band announced their end.\n\n[[File:Ian Hunter2009.jpg|thumb|Hunter fronting Mott the Hoople at a reunion gig, [[Hammersmith Apollo]], October 2009]]\nDavid Bowie, a fan of the band, then offered them a song he had just written. As Hunter recalled in a 2004 DVD interview, \"He offered us \"[[Suffragette City]]\", which I didn't think was good enough. And then he sat down on the floor, Regent Street it was, in a publisher's office, and plays '[[All the Young Dudes (song)|All The Young Dudes]]' on an acoustic guitar.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, 2005\"/> It reached No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and revived the band, who were appreciative of Bowie's rescue. Guitarist Ralphs relates that Bowie taught Mott studio tricks, but one of the best-known sounds during the period was a 'hand-clap-in-the-toilet' routine that relied more on Hunter's vision than it did on Bowie's clearly more experienced studio abilities.<ref>Tremlett</ref> Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson also significantly contributed to Mott's sound, a fact noticed by Hunter, who would later collaborate with Ronson a great deal.<ref>Devine</ref>\n\nThe post-Bowie Mott the Hoople had notable commercial success with the albums ''[[All the Young Dudes]]'' (1972, produced by Bowie); ''Mott'' (1973) and ''The Hoople'' (1974). The band experienced financial success with songs such as \"Roll Away The Stone\", \"Golden Age of Rock\u00b4n\u00b4Roll\", \"Honaloochie Boogie\", \"All The Way From Memphis\", \"Saturday Gigs\", and especially \"All The Young Dudes\". Hunter chronicled the highs and lows of touring in ''[[Diary of a Rock'n'Roll Star]]'', his journal of a chaotic five-week American tour in November\u2013December 1972.<ref>Hunter, 1974</ref> Ralphs left in 1973 to form [[Bad Company]], and Hunter began to play guitar until [[Luther Grosvenor]] took over. Hunter at the same time was increasingly pressured to write hits for the band.\n\nGrosvenor, aka Ariel Bender, was briefly replaced by Mick Ronson, formerly the leading member of Bowie's backing band [[The Spiders from Mars]], after the release of a live album following ''The Hoople''. Hunter left the band in December 1974. The remaining members carried on under the names Mott and British Lions.\n\nOn 16 January 2009, several sources, including Hunter's own website, announced that Mott the Hoople would reunite for two concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, on 2 and 3 October 2009. These two dates sold out, and three additional dates were added. In the end, Mott the Hoople played two warm up gigs in Monmouth, five nights at the Hammersmith Apollo, and made a final appearance at the Tartan Clefs Charity night at the Kelvin Hall that November. A further British tour in 2013, taking in Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Manchester (which was released on CD and DVD), culminated in a last night at [[The O2 arena (London)|The O2 arena]] on 18 November 2013.\n\n==Later career==\nIn March 1975, Hunter joined forces with [[Mick Ronson]], his most frequent collaborator until Ronson's death in 1993. Hunter's first single from his [[Ian Hunter (album)|eponymous solo album]] was the UK [[Top 40]] hit \"Once Bitten Twice Shy\". Hunter and Ronson then parted professionally, reportedly due to Hunter's refusal to deal with Ronson's manager, [[Tony DeFries]].\n\nHunter's second solo album, ''[[All American Alien Boy]]'' (1976), was a more [[soul music|soul]]-infused work which featured saxophonist [[David Sanborn]] and bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]]. [[Queen (band)|Queen]], once an opening act for Mott the Hoople, provided backing vocals on one track.\n\nHunter's next album, ''[[Overnight Angels]]'' (1977), was produced by [[Roy Thomas Baker]] and featured a heavier guitar sound courtesy of former Bowie sideman [[Earl Slick]]. Hunter's record label in America, [[Columbia Records]], refused to release the album in the US due to issues concerning Hunter's management: \"''Overnight Angels'' was not released in the US because I fired my manager, Fred Heller, during the English promotional tour \u2013 just before it was to be released in America. Columbia said they didn't want to release it until I had new management and that dragged on until it became too late.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianhunter.com/mouth006.shtml |title=The Official Ian Hunter Website \u2013 The Horse's Mouth |website=Ianhunter.com |issue=6 |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1978, Hunter produced [[Generation X (band)|Generation X's]] second LP ''[[Valley of the Dolls (album)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1979).<ref>{{cite book|title=Dancing with Myself|author=Billy Idol|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|date=2014|isbn=978-0857205605}}</ref>\n\nMick Ronson returned as producer and guitarist on Hunter's 1979 album, ''[[You're Never Alone with a Schizophrenic]]'', which also featured [[John Cale]] and several members of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s [[E Street Band]].

Primarily a live album, it also featured some original studio material. [[Todd Rundgren]] played lead guitar on Hunter's eleven-show 1980 US tour but does not appear on the live album.\n\nHunter's first studio album of the 1980s was ''[[Short Back 'n' Sides]]'' (1981), produced in collaboration with Ronson and [[The Clash|Clash]] guitarist [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]]. Ronson's input on Hunter's next album, ''[[All of the Good Ones Are Taken]]'' (1983), was restricted to playing guitar on a single track. The title track became a minor hit in the US, after MTV put the song's video into heavy rotation. In the same year, Ronson travelled to Canada to produce the [[Payolas]]' album ''Hammer on a Drum'', to which Hunter contributed backing vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickronson.com/MickRonson/mickwith%20others.htm|title=Mick's Work with Others|website=MickRonson.com|access-date=10 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021231035614/http://www.mickronson.com/MickRonson/mickwith%20others.htm|archive-date=31 December 2002}}</ref>\n\n''[[YUI Orta]]'' was released as a joint album by Hunter and Mick Ronson in 1990, and the pair performed alongside David Bowie and Queen at [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] in April 1992.

Hunter appeared on Ronson's posthumously-released solo album, ''[[Heaven and Hull]]'' (1994), and performed at the first Mick Ronson Memorial Concert in April 1994.\n\nIn 2000, Hunter played a handful of live dates in the UK and the US to promote the release of Sony's 2xCD anthology, ''Once Bitten Twice Shy''. For the UK dates, he used the same band as in 1999: Darrell Bath (guitar), Paul Cuddeford (guitar), Paul 'Trevor' Francis (bass), Ian Gibbons (keyboards), and Steve Holley (drums). For the lone US date, his band included Andy York (guitar), John Conte (bass), Tom Mandel (keyboards), and Steve Holley (drums).\n\nIn 2001, Hunter toured North America with [[Ringo Starr]] and his All-Starr Band as part of a line-up which included Ringo Starr, [[Sheila E.]], [[Greg Lake]], [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]], [[Roger Hodgson]], and [[Mark Rivera]]. Hunter's studio album ''[[Rant (Ian Hunter album)|Rant]]'', released the same year and was followed by two live albums: 2004's ''Strings Attached'' with a 20-piece orchestra, and 2005's ''The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nuthin' But The Truth'' with Mick Ralphs (and [[Brian May]] of Queen and [[Joe Elliott]] of Def Leppard on one song). Hunter won ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock Magazine]]'''s Songwriter Award in October 2005. His studio album, ''[[Shrunken Heads (album)|Shrunken Heads]]'', was accompanied by a three-song bonus CD, and was released in May 2007 by Jerkin' Crocus in Europe and Yep Roc Records in the US.

Hunter was a musician and songwriter before joining Mott the Hoople, and continued in this vein after he left the band. He embarked on a solo career despite ill health and disillusionment with commercial success, and often worked in collaboration with [[Mick Ronson]], [[David Bowie]]'s sideman and arranger from the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' period.<ref name=Walker>{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Bruce |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004651/Ian-Hunter.html |title=Ian Hunter Biography |website=Musicianguide.com |accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nMott the Hoople achieved a certain level of commercial success, and attracted a small but devoted fan base. As a solo artist, Hunter charted with lesser-known but more wide-ranging works outside the rock mainstream. His best-known solo songs are \"[[Once Bitten, Twice Shy]]\", later covered by [[Great White]], and \"England Rocks\" , which was modified to \"[[Cleveland Rocks]]\" and then later covered by [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]], and became one of the theme songs used for the American TV series ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''.\n\n==Early years==\nHunter was born in [[Oswestry]], Shropshire, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/ian-hunter-mott-the-hoople-interview/|title=Ian Hunter (ex \u2013 Mott The Hoople) Interview|date=23 August 2012|website=Louderthanwar.com|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref> Due to the onset of war, the family moved to [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire]] to live with the family of his Scottish father.

Hunter soon left his home in Shrewsbury, transferred his apprenticeship from Sentinel/Rolls Royce to [[Timken Company#British Timken|British Timken]] in [[Northampton]], and joined The Apex Group on rhythm guitar. Hunter recalls jumping around like a lunatic on stage: \"Music affected me so much. The rest of them just stood there. It was funny, I had kids who came just to watch me do this, and I can't imagine what it looked like.\"<ref name=\"devine\"/>\n\nHunter left The Apex Group in 1958, just before they recorded their first single \"Yorkshire Relish, Caravan\" for John Lever Records.<ref name=\"Purington\">Purington</ref> Hunter played in a few local groups, but eventually his financial situation forced a change. \"I wasn't making my [[hire-purchase]] payments, and 'little jobs' were getting done and people were getting smacked. I was never in the middle of it, but I was always somewhere in the area.\"<ref name=\"devine\"/> He returned to Shrewsbury, ostensibly to become more responsible in his personal life, and settled down enough to have a steady girlfriend in Diane Coles. Outside of his day job, he and Tony Wardle formed a harmonica duo inspired by [[Morton Fraser's Harmonica Gang]], a local variety act.\n\nOnce out of debt and seemingly settled, Hunter returned to Northampton and The Apex Group. Diane followed and the two married and settled in St James End. Their first child, Stephen, was born there in 1962. Tensions were in the air though, both musically and in his personal life. While his wife attended to home life, Hunter resumed his wild ways with his Northampton mates.\n\nThe Apex Group had steady regional work at clubs and military bases, but Hunter bristled at the formality of the band, who wore matching stage jackets and were moving increasingly toward an R&B-like stage revue. In 1963, while still a group member, Hunter formed a band in direct competition to them: Hurricane Henry and the Shriekers, with Tony Marriott on drums and Julian Coulter on guitar. They worked steadily in Northampton, and attracted the attention of pianist [[Freddie 'Fingers' Lee]]. Lee took over as frontman in March 1964, and Hunter moved to bass. Frank Short eventually learned of Hunter's duplicity, and Hunter was kicked out of The Apex Group.\n\nIt was during this period \u2013 late 1963 or early 1964 \u2013 that The Apex recorded a second disc for John Lever records, released as The Apex Rhythm & Blues All Stars. The four-song [[extended play|EP]] included their own \"Tall Girl\", and covers of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"Reeling and A'Rocking\" and \"Down the Road A'piece\", and Jimmy Gilmer and The Fireballs' \"Sugar Shack\". Hunter probably does not appear on this record; the EP was recorded around the time Hunter left the group for the second time.<ref name=\"Purington\"/>\n\nAt Freddie Lee's suggestion, The Shriekers began taking jobs in the same German clubs where the Beatles had cut their teeth a few years earlier. In an interview taped in 2004, Hunter volunteers that Lee and their gigs in [[Hamburg]] were a major turning point, at which he first began to \"think maybe I could do this instead of working in factories.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, 2005\">Hunter, 2005</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Hunter moved to London, where he joined The Scenery with guitarist [[Miller Anderson (musician)|Miller Anderson]], drummer [[Dave Dufort]] and keyboard player Dante Smith. There Hunter met Mick Ronson, then guitarist of bands the Voice and The Rats, at the [[Flamingo Club (London)|Flamingo Club]] in London. According to Anderson, \"Mick was coming down the stairs ... and we were going up and I said, `Mick, this is my friend, Ian [Hunter] Patterson.'\"<ref>Devine, p. 41</ref> The Scenery, now with John Vernon Smith on drums, recorded tracks with Bill Farley at Regent Sound that were licensed for international release without their knowledge. Hunter and Anderson recall writing and recording \"To Make a Man Cry,\" but not the B-side, \"Thread of Time.\" John Vernon Smith appears on the picture sleeve, but Johnny Banks, of [[The Merseybeats]], played on the record. [[John Gustafson (musician)|Johnny Gustafson]] was also included in the session work. The songs were released on the Impact label, and it is unclear whether they originated from France or Belgium.<ref name=\"Purington\"/>\n\nHunter remained in the band after Anderson's early 1968 departure. Anderson and J.V. Smith were replaced by guitarist Chris Mayfield and drummer Pete Phillipps, and the group backed up Freddie Lee in 'At Last The 1958 Rock and Roll Show'. They got a regular booking at The Angel in Edmonton, and drew interest from both [[Chrysalis Records]] and NEMS but were signed by neither. With Miller Anderson back in place of Mayfield, the group released a single on CBS called \"I Can't Drive\". As the short-lived [[rock and roll]] revival waned, 'At Last the 1958 Rock and Roll Show' changed its name to 'Charlie Woolfe' and released a final single, \"Dance, Dance, Dance\". During Hunter's obscure early years, Hereford's Shakedown Sound, with future Mott members in their ranks, gigged in roughly the same circles but without any record company interest.<ref>Clayson</ref>\n\nHunter played with various other artists throughout the 1960s, including The Young Idea, [[Billy Fury]] and [[David McWilliams (musician)|David McWilliams]]. In late 1968 [[Mickie Most]] hired Hunter and Dufort to play in a band that was to be called 'The New Yardbirds', a name that [[Jimmy Page]] had been using for his post-[[The Yardbirds|Yardbirds]] group before discarding it in favour of '[[Led Zeppelin]]'. This led confused fans to think that Hunter had been a member of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Explained Hunter: \"See: this is rubbish, but people read it and believe it.\"<ref>Hunter, 2003</ref> Hunter also worked as a journalist and staff songwriter for [[Francis, Day & Hunter Ltd.]], did road-digging for a local council, and reported for a [[local newspaper]].\n\n==Mott the Hoople years==\nBy 1969, Hunter had two children, but was still hoping for a return to making music full-time. Meanwhile, guitarist [[Mick Ralphs]] joined organist Verden Allen in [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s backing band, The Shakedown Sound. Eventually Ralphs, Allen, vocalist Stan Tippins, bassist Overend Watts, and drummer Dale Griffin united to become Silence, who auditioned for British impresario [[Guy Stevens]]. Silence renamed themselves after [[Willard Manus]]' 1966 novel, ''[[Mott the Hoople (novel)|Mott the Hoople]]''.<ref>Manus</ref> The band lacked a credible singer with stage presence, and the seasoned Hunter, who had by this time taken to wearing his trademark sunglasses, auditioned on a lark and was given the position. They were a critical success in the UK, where some of their most dedicated early fans included future members of the Clash.<ref>Gray</ref> However, they could not sustain their commercial appeal, and their American tours were slow in building a following. Mott released several LPs and attracted enthusiastic live audiences, but experienced dismal sales despite the svengali-like leadership and promotion of Stevens.<ref>Stevens</ref> After a 1972 concert in a \"gas cylinder\" in Switzerland, the band announced their end.\n\n[[File:Ian Hunter2009.jpg|thumb|Hunter fronting Mott the Hoople at a reunion gig, [[Hammersmith Apollo]], October 2009]]\nDavid Bowie, a fan of the band, then offered them a song he had just written. As Hunter recalled in a 2004 DVD interview, \"He offered us \"[[Suffragette City]]\", which I didn't think was good enough. And then he sat down on the floor, Regent Street it was, in a publisher's office, and plays '[[All the Young Dudes (song)|All The Young Dudes]]' on an acoustic guitar.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, 2005\"/> It reached No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and revived the band, who were appreciative of Bowie's rescue. Guitarist Ralphs relates that Bowie taught Mott studio tricks, but one of the best-known sounds during the period was a 'hand-clap-in-the-toilet' routine that relied more on Hunter's vision than it did on Bowie's clearly more experienced studio abilities.<ref>Tremlett</ref> Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson also significantly contributed to Mott's sound, a fact noticed by Hunter, who would later collaborate with Ronson a great deal.<ref>Devine</ref>\n\nThe post-Bowie Mott the Hoople had notable commercial success with the albums ''[[All the Young Dudes]]'' (1972, produced by Bowie); ''Mott'' (1973) and ''The Hoople'' (1974). The band experienced financial success with songs such as \"Roll Away The Stone\", \"Golden Age of Rock\u00b4n\u00b4Roll\", \"Honaloochie Boogie\", \"All The Way From Memphis\", \"Saturday Gigs\", and especially \"All The Young Dudes\". Hunter chronicled the highs and lows of touring in ''[[Diary of a Rock'n'Roll Star]]'', his journal of a chaotic five-week American tour in November\u2013December 1972.<ref>Hunter, 1974</ref> Ralphs left in 1973 to form [[Bad Company]], and Hunter began to play guitar until [[Luther Grosvenor]] took over. Hunter at the same time was increasingly pressured to write hits for the band.\n\nGrosvenor, aka Ariel Bender, was briefly replaced by Mick Ronson, formerly the leading member of Bowie's backing band [[The Spiders from Mars]], after the release of a live album following ''The Hoople''. Hunter left the band in December 1974. The remaining members carried on under the names Mott and British Lions.\n\nOn 16 January 2009, several sources, including Hunter's own website, announced that Mott the Hoople would reunite for two concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, on 2 and 3 October 2009. These two dates sold out, and three additional dates were added. In the end, Mott the Hoople played two warm up gigs in Monmouth, five nights at the Hammersmith Apollo, and made a final appearance at the Tartan Clefs Charity night at the Kelvin Hall that November. A further British tour in 2013, taking in Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Manchester (which was released on CD and DVD), culminated in a last night at [[The O2 arena (London)|The O2 arena]] on 18 November 2013.\n\n==Later career==\nIn March 1975, Hunter joined forces with [[Mick Ronson]], his most frequent collaborator until Ronson's death in 1993. Hunter's first single from his [[Ian Hunter (album)|eponymous solo album]] was the UK [[Top 40]] hit \"Once Bitten Twice Shy\". Hunter and Ronson then parted professionally, reportedly due to Hunter's refusal to deal with Ronson's manager, [[Tony DeFries]].\n\nHunter's second solo album, ''[[All American Alien Boy]]'' (1976), was a more [[soul music|soul]]-infused work which featured saxophonist [[David Sanborn]] and bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]]. [[Queen (band)|Queen]], once an opening act for Mott the Hoople, provided backing vocals on one track.\n\nHunter's next album, ''[[Overnight Angels]]'' (1977), was produced by [[Roy Thomas Baker]] and featured a heavier guitar sound courtesy of former Bowie sideman [[Earl Slick]]. Hunter's record label in America, [[Columbia Records]], refused to release the album in the US due to issues concerning Hunter's management: \"''Overnight Angels'' was not released in the US because I fired my manager, Fred Heller, during the English promotional tour \u2013 just before it was to be released in America. Columbia said they didn't want to release it until I had new management and that dragged on until it became too late.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianhunter.com/mouth006.shtml |title=The Official Ian Hunter Website \u2013 The Horse's Mouth |website=Ianhunter.com |issue=6 |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1978, Hunter produced [[Generation X (band)|Generation X's]] second LP ''[[Valley of the Dolls (album)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1979).<ref>{{cite book|title=Dancing with Myself|author=Billy Idol|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|date=2014|isbn=978-0857205605}}</ref>\n\nMick Ronson returned as producer and guitarist on Hunter's 1979 album, ''[[You're Never Alone with a Schizophrenic]]'', which also featured [[John Cale]] and several members of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s [[E Street Band]].

Primarily a live album, it also featured some original studio material. [[Todd Rundgren]] played lead guitar on Hunter's eleven-show 1980 US tour but does not appear on the live album.\n\nHunter's first studio album of the 1980s was ''[[Short Back 'n' Sides]]'' (1981), produced in collaboration with Ronson and [[The Clash|Clash]] guitarist [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]]. Ronson's input on Hunter's next album, ''[[All of the Good Ones Are Taken]]'' (1983), was restricted to playing guitar on a single track. The title track became a minor hit in the US, after MTV put the song's video into heavy rotation. In the same year, Ronson travelled to Canada to produce the [[Payolas]]' album ''Hammer on a Drum'', to which Hunter contributed backing vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickronson.com/MickRonson/mickwith%20others.htm|title=Mick's Work with Others|website=MickRonson.com|access-date=10 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021231035614/http://www.mickronson.com/MickRonson/mickwith%20others.htm|archive-date=31 December 2002}}</ref>\n\n''[[YUI Orta]]'' was released as a joint album by Hunter and Mick Ronson in 1990, and the pair performed alongside David Bowie and Queen at [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] in April 1992.

Hunter appeared on Ronson's posthumously-released solo album, ''[[Heaven and Hull]]'' (1994), and performed at the first Mick Ronson Memorial Concert in April 1994.\n\nIn 2000, Hunter played a handful of live dates in the UK and the US to promote the release of Sony's 2xCD anthology, ''Once Bitten Twice Shy''. For the UK dates, he used the same band as in 1999: Darrell Bath (guitar), Paul Cuddeford (guitar), Paul 'Trevor' Francis (bass), Ian Gibbons (keyboards), and Steve Holley (drums).

{"title_page": "Music of the African diaspora", "text_new": "'''Music of the African diaspora''' was mostly refined and developed during the period of slavery. Slaves did not have easy access to instruments, so vocal work took on new significance. Through chants and [[work songs]] people of African descent preserved elements of their African heritage while inventing new genres of music. The culmination of this great sublimation of musical energy into vocal work can be seen in genres as disparate as [[Gospel Music]] and [[Hip-Hop]]. The music of the African diaspora makes frequent use of [[ostinato]], a motif or phrase which is persistently repeated at the same pitch. The repeating idea may be a rhythmic pattern, part of a tune, or a complete melody.<ref>''The Ostinato Idea in Black Improvised Music: A Preliminary Investigation'' [[Wendell Logan]] The Black Perspective in o93-215 {{doi|10.2307/1215022}}</ref> The [[banjo]] is a direct decedent of the [[Akonting]] created by the [[Jola people]], found in [[Senegal]], [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]] in West Africa.  Hence, the melodic traditions of the African diaspora are probably most alive in [[Blues]] and [[Jazz]]. \n\n==Middle East==\n* [[Liwa (music)]] and [[Fann at-Tanbura]], performed in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. [[Mizmar (dance)]] is performed in the [[Hejaz]] and [[Tihamah]] regions of [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Caribbean==\n===Cuba and Latin music in the Caribbean===\nThe roots of most [[Cuba]]n music forms lie in the [[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]s, a form of social club among African slaves brought to the island. Traditional [[Afro-Cuban]] styles, include [[son (music)|son]], [[Bat\u00e1]] and [[Yuka (music)|yuka]] and [[Cuban Rumba|Rumba]]. The Cuban [[contradanza]], which became also known as the [[Contradanza|Habanera]], the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African rhythm pattern, gained international fame in the 19th century. The habanera \"El Arreglito\" composed by the Spanish musician [[Sebastian Yradier]], was adapted to become one of the most famous arias in [[Georges Bizet]]'s 1875 opera ''[[Carmen]]'', \"[[L'amour est un oiseau rebelle]]\".\n\n===Dominican Republic===\n[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]] is a popular guitar music that originated in the [[Dominican Republic]]. Having strong African and Spanish influences, it is therefore also considered to be [[music of Latin America]]. The subjects of bachata are often romantic with tales of heartbreak and sadness. The original term used to name the genre was amargue (\"bitterness\", \"bitter music\", or \"blues music\"), until the more neutral term bachata became popular. \n\n===Haiti and Francophone music in the Caribbean===\n[[Haiti]]an music is familiar to people in the English-speaking world as [[M\u00e9ringue]]. It developed during the early decades of the 19th century. When jazz became popular worldwide, [[mini-jazz]] (''mini-djaz'' in [[Haitian Creole]]) was created as Haiti's local variety. [[Cadence rampa|Kadans]], [[Haitian Creole]] for cadence, followed the mini-jazz era. Kadans had an influence on the development of [[Zouk]] in the French-speaking Antilles of the Caribbean. Haiti's most well-known modern music genre is [[compas]] music. It was first popularized in the 1950s by [[Nemours Jean-Baptiste]].\n\n====Zouk music====\n[[Zouk]] is a style of music originating in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] during the 1980s. It has many influences, from Haitian, [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[beguine]] and [[compas]]. The conventional zouk sound has a slow tempo, and it is sung in [[Antillean Creole]], although it also has varieties that have developed in francophone Africa. It is popular throughout the French-speaking world, including [[France]] and [[Quebec]].\n\n===Former British West Indies and the Lesser Antilles===\n====Jamaica====\nEarly forms of [[Afro-Caribbean]] music in [[Jamaica]] was [[Junkanoo]] (a type of [[folk music]] now more closely associated with [[The Bahamas]]), the [[quadrille]] (a European dance) and [[work song]]s were the primary forms of Jamaican music at the beginning of the 20th century. These were synthesized into [[mento]] music, which spread across the island. In the 20th century, influences from the United States were fused to create the uniquely Jamaican forms [[dancehall]] and [[ska]]. Subsequent styles include [[reggae]], [[rocksteady]] and [[ragga]]muffin. (Mical 1995)\n\n====Lesser Antilles====\nAs is the case throughout the Caribbean, [[Lesser Antilles|Lesser Antillean]] musical cultures are largely based on the music of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] brought by European traders and colonizers. The [[music of Africa|African music]]al elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous [[West Africa]]n tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from India.\n\n====Trinidad & Tobago====\n\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], whose [[calypso music|calypso]] style is an especially potent part of the music of the other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the [[Big Drum]] dance. Trinidadian folk calypso is found throughout the area, as are African-Caribbean religious music styles like the [[Shango]] music of Trinidad.<ref name=\"Manuel183\">Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', pgs. 183 - 211</ref> Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by [[Trinidadian]] slaves, including [[camboulay]] drumming and the music masquerade processions.<ref name=\"Manuel183\"/> In the 1970s, a calypso variant called [[Soca music|soca]] arose, characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism.

Slaves did not have easy access to instruments, so vocal work took on new significance. Through chants and [[work songs]] people of African descent preserved elements of their African heritage while inventing new genres of music. The culmination of this great sublimation of musical energy into vocal work can be seen in genres as disparate as [[Gospel Music]] and [[Hip-Hop]]. The music of the African diaspora makes frequent use of [[ostinato]], a motif or phrase which is persistently repeated at the same pitch. The repeating idea may be a rhythmic pattern, part of a tune, or a complete melody.<ref>''The Ostinato Idea in Black Improvised Music: A Preliminary Investigation'' [[Wendell Logan]] The Black Perspective in o93-215 {{doi|10.2307/1215022}}</ref> The [[banjo]] is a direct decedent of the [[Akonting]] created by the [[Jola people]], found in [[Senegal]], [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]] in West Africa.  Hence, the melodic traditions of the African diaspora are probably most alive in [[Blues]] and [[Jazz]]. \n\n==Middle East==\n* [[Liwa (music)]] and [[Fann at-Tanbura]], performed in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. [[Mizmar (dance)]] is performed in the [[Hejaz]] and [[Tihamah]] regions of [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Caribbean==\n===Cuba and Latin music in the Caribbean===\nThe roots of most [[Cuba]]n music forms lie in the [[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]s, a form of social club among African slaves brought to the island. Traditional [[Afro-Cuban]] styles, include [[son (music)|son]], [[Bat\u00e1]] and [[Yuka (music)|yuka]] and [[Cuban Rumba|Rumba]]. The Cuban [[contradanza]], which became also known as the [[Contradanza|Habanera]], the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African rhythm pattern, gained international fame in the 19th century. The habanera \"El Arreglito\" composed by the Spanish musician [[Sebastian Yradier]], was adapted to become one of the most famous arias in [[George Bizet]]'s 1875 opera ''[[Carmen]]'', \"[[L'amour est un oiseau rebelle]]\".\n\n===Dominican Republic===\n[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]] is a popular guitar music that originated in the [[Dominican Republic]]. Having strong African and Spanish influences, it is therefore also considered to be [[music of Latin America]]. The subjects of bachata are often romantic with tales of heartbreak and sadness. The original term used to name the genre was amargue (\"bitterness\", \"bitter music\", or \"blues music\"), until the more neutral term bachata became popular. \n\n===Haiti and Francophone music in the Caribbean===\n[[Haiti]]an music is familiar to people in the English-speaking world as [[M\u00e9ringue]]. It developed during the early decades of the 19th century. When jazz became popular worldwide, [[mini-jazz]] (''mini-djaz'' in [[Haitian Creole]]) was created as Haiti's local variety. [[Cadence rampa|Kadans]], [[Haitian Creole]] for cadence, followed the mini-jazz era. Kadans had an influence on the development of [[Zouk]] in the French-speaking Antilles of the Caribbean. Haiti's most well-known modern music genre is [[compas]] music. It was first popularized in the 1950s by [[Nemours Jean-Baptiste]].\n\n====Zouk music====\n[[Zouk]] is a style of music originating in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] during the 1980s. It has many influences, from Haitian, [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[beguine]] and [[compas]]. The conventional zouk sound has a slow tempo, and it is sung in [[Antillean Creole]], although it also has varieties that have developed in francophone Africa. It is popular throughout the French-speaking world, including [[France]] and [[Quebec]].\n\n===Former British West Indies and the Lesser Antilles===\n====Jamaica====\nEarly forms of [[Afro-Caribbean]] music in [[Jamaica]] was [[Junkanoo]] (a type of [[folk music]] now more closely associated with [[The Bahamas]]), the [[quadrille]] (a European dance) and [[work song]]s were the primary forms of Jamaican music at the beginning of the 20th century. These were synthesized into [[mento]] music, which spread across the island. In the 20th century, influences from the United States were fused to create the uniquely Jamaican forms [[dancehall]] and [[ska]]. Subsequent styles include [[reggae]], [[rocksteady]] and [[ragga]]muffin. (Mical 1995)\n\n====Lesser Antilles====\nAs is the case throughout the Caribbean, [[Lesser Antilles|Lesser Antillean]] musical cultures are largely based on the music of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] brought by European traders and colonizers. The [[music of Africa|African music]]al elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous [[West Africa]]n tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from India.\n\n====Trinidad & Tobago====\n\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], whose [[calypso music|calypso]] style is an especially potent part of the music of the other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the [[Big Drum]] dance. Trinidadian folk calypso is found throughout the area, as are African-Caribbean religious music styles like the [[Shango]] music of Trinidad.<ref name=\"Manuel183\">Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', pgs. 183 - 211</ref> Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by [[Trinidadian]] slaves, including [[camboulay]] drumming and the music masquerade processions.<ref name=\"Manuel183\"/> In the 1970s, a calypso variant called [[Soca music|soca]] arose, characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism. Soca has since spread across the Caribbean and abroad.<ref name=\"Manuel183\"/>\n\nSteel drums are a distinctively [[Trinidadian]] ensemble that evolved from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. Steel bands were banned by the British colonial authorities.

Spanish, German, French, and Italian commentators also called the matches at ringside. [[Lilian Garcia]] and [[Brandi Rhodes|Eden Stiles]] served as the ring announcers.\n\n=== Celebrities ===\n{{see also|List of celebrities involved with WrestleMania}}\nAs is tradition, WrestleMania featured numerous appearances by celebrity guests \u2013 such as ''[[E! News]]'' host [[Maria Menounos]], who served as a backstage interviewer. The pay-per-view broadcast was opened by [[Aloe Blacc]] performing \"[[America the Beautiful]]\". The event saw another musical performance as [[Skylar Grey]], [[Travis Barker]], and [[Kid Ink]] performed a medley of the two WrestleMania 31 theme songs \u2013 \"Rise\" and \"[[Money and the Power]]\". [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] also was featured at the event, first as part of the ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' themed grand entrance of [[Triple H]], and later being recognized as part of the 2015 [[WWE Hall of Fame]] class as a celebrity wing inductee.\n\n=== Pre-show ===\nTwo matches were contested on the WrestleMania Kickoff pre-show. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|fatal four-Way]] [[tag team]] match for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] between the champions [[Tyson Kidd and Cesaro]] (with [[Natalya (wrestler)|Natalya]]), [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Kofi Kingston]] and [[Big E Langston|Big E]]) (with [[Xavier Woods]]), [[Primo & Epico|Los Matadores]] ([[Primo (wrestler)|Diego]] and [[Epico|Fernando]]) (with [[Mascarita Dorada|El Torito]]), and [[The Usos]] (Jey and Jimmy Uso) (with [[Naomi (wrestler)|Naomi]]). Kidd and Cesaro retained their titles after Big E suffered a Samoan splash from Jimmy Uso, followed by Cesaro throwing Uso out of the ring and scoring the pin. Also of note, Jey Uso would suffer a shoulder injury during the match, putting him out of action for several months.\n\nThe second pre-show match was the second annual [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant#Legacy|Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal]]. [[Big Show]] won the 30-man contest by last eliminating [[Damien Sandow|Damien Mizdow]] after Mizdow had turned on and eliminated his tag team partner [[The Miz]].\n\n=== Preliminary matches ===\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the seven-man [[ladder match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] where champion [[Wade Barrett|Bad News Barrett]] defended the title against [[Daniel Bryan]], [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]], [[Dean Ambrose]], [[Luke Harper]], [[Dolph Ziggler]], and [[Cody Rhodes|Stardust]]. Bryan won the match after he and Ziggler exchanged headbutts at the top of the ladder, causing Ziggler to fall backward and allowing Bryan to claim his first Intercontinental Championship.\n\nNext, [[Seth Rollins]] faced [[Randy Orton]]. During the match, both men kicked out of their finishers. Orton eventually won the match after a second \"RKO\", which was given additional elevation as Orton countered Rollins' \"Curb Stomp\" by propelling Rollins up into the air.\n\n[[File:NWo WM31.jpg|thumb|left|[[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] members [[Kevin Nash]] (left), [[Hulk Hogan]] (center) and [[Scott Hall]] (right) making their way to the ring]]\nAfter that, [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Triple H]] competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|No Disqualification Match]]. This was Sting's first official match in WWE. Midway through the match, Sting locked Triple H in his [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Scorpion Death Lock]] submission hold, which prompted Triple H's [[D-Generation X]] (DX) allies to enter the ring and attempt to interfere in the match. Sting knocked down [[Billy Gunn]], [[Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]], countered Triple H's [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] and threw him to the outside, and then launched himself from the top rope onto all four men. Triple H then performed a Pedigree on Sting for a near-fall and retrieved a [[sledgehammer]] from under the ring, which prompted the three original [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) members ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]]) to interfere on Sting's behalf. The nWo members took out DX and Sting dropped Triple H with his [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Inverted DDT|Scorpion Death Drop]] for a near-fall. Sting then locked Triple H in another Scorpion Death Lock. Triple H tried to grab his sledgehammer, but Hogan pulled it out of his reach, causing another brawl between both factions while Triple H was still locked in Sting's submission hold. [[Shawn Michaels]] then appeared and executed [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Sting. Triple H went to pin Sting only for Sting to kick out. Triple H grabbed his sledgehammer from Gunn, while Hall tossed a [[Baseball Bat]] to Sting. A standoff ensued between Triple H and Sting as they both held weapons. Sting struck Triple H in the gut with his bat and struck Triple H's sledgehammer which snapped in half. Sting then trapped Triple H in the corner and landed his [[Professional wrestling attacks#Stinger splash|Stinger Splash]]. When Sting went for another Stinger Splash, however, Triple H struck Sting with the sledgehammer to win the match. After the match, Triple H and Sting shook hands in the ring while the commentary team speculated that the [[Monday Night Wars|rivalry between WWE and WCW]] had finally been put to rest.\n\nDaniel Bryan was then interviewed backstage by [[Maria Menounos]] regarding his Intercontinental Championship victory, and was joined in celebration by former Intercontinental Champions [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], [[Roddy Piper|\"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper]], [[Ricky Steamboat|Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Bret Hart]], who all congratulated Bryan by performing Bryan's \"Yes!\" chant together until [[Ron Simmons]] broke up the celebration with his Damn! catchphrase.\n\nIn the fourth match, [[The Bella Twins]] (Brie Bella and [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Champion]] Nikki Bella) faced [[AJ Lee]] and [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Paige and Nikki began the bout. Most of the match saw The Bellas isolating Paige and preventing her from tagging in Lee \u2013 who the Bellas would frequently knock off the ring apron onto the floor \u2013 until Paige landed a somersault plancha to both Bellas on the outside. Paige finally tagged in Lee, who applied her \"[[Professional wrestling holds#Octopus hold|Black Widow]]\" hold to Nikki, but Brie saved her sister from defeat. Paige then ran in with a big boot on Brie but was soon pushed outside the ring. Brie tripped Lee as she ran off the ropes, allowing Nikki to perform a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Forearm smash|Forearm Smash]] on her for a near-fall. In the climax, Paige slammed Brie into the ring steps, allowing Lee to apply the \"Black Widow\" on Nikki, who submitted.\n\nAfter the match, the 2015 [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] class was introduced; [[The Bushwhackers]], [[Larry Zbysko]], [[Madusa|Alundra Blayze]], [[Tatsumi Fujinami]], [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Kevin Nash]] were presented to the crowd, while posthumous inductees [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] and [[Connor Michalek|Connor \"The Crusher\" Michalek]] were represented by family members.\n\n[[File:Rock Rousey WM31.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (left) celebrating with [[Ronda Rousey]] (right) after clashing with [[Stephanie McMahon]] and [[Triple H]]]]\nAfter that [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]] [[Alexander Rusev|Rusev]] (accompanied by his manager [[Lana (wrestling)|Lana]]) defended his title against [[John Cena]]. Rusev dominated the majority of the match and overpowered Cena throughout, but Cena was able to make a comeback. The end of the match came when Lana climbed onto the ring apron and was accidentally knocked off by Rusev, who then suffered an \"[[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|Attitude Adjustment]]\" for Cena's pin and the title. This was Rusev's first pinfall loss in WWE since he debuted in the main roster in April 2014.\n\nIn the next segment, [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]] (Triple H and [[Stephanie McMahon]]) announced that WrestleMania had set a new Levi's Stadium attendance record of 76,976 and began to gloat about their accomplishments and Triple H's victory over Sting earlier in the night, which prompted [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] to enter the ring. After a verbal exchange, McMahon insulted the Rock and slapped him across the face, taunting that he wouldn't retaliate because he dare not hit a woman. Rock then brought [[UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship|UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion]] [[Ronda Rousey]] (who sat up front) into the ring. After Rousey told McMahon that she \"owns every ring she's in\" Rock attacked Triple H and Rousey then threw both McMahon and Triple H from the ring, first teasing an armbar on McMahon.\n\nIn the penultimate match, [[The Undertaker]] faced [[Bray Wyatt]]. This was Undertaker's first appearance since [[WrestleMania XXX]]. It was reported that Wyatt [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] injured his ankle earlier in the day while preparing for the match, resulting in both men working at a slow pace. While Wyatt largely controlled the offense, Undertaker was able to execute most of his signature moves such as \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Arm twist ropewalk chop|Old School]]\", the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|big boot]], and \"[[Professional wrestling throws#Snake Eyes|Snake Eyes]]\". Late in the match, Wyatt kicked out of a \"[[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Kneeling reverse piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]]\", while Undertaker kicked out of \"[[Facebuster#Swinging reverse STO|Sister Abigail]]\". In the end, Undertaker executed a second \"Tombstone Piledriver\" to win the match.\n\n=== Main event ===\n[[File:Seth Rollins WWE World Heavyweight Championship WrestleMania 31 2015.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=|[[Seth Rollins]] cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to walk out of WrestleMania 31 as  [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Champion]]]]\nIn the main event, [[Brock Lesnar]] defended the [[WWE World Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]]  against [[Roman Reigns]]. Within the first minute, Lesnar performed a [[German suplex]] and an [[Facebuster#Fireman's carry facebuster|F-5]] on Reigns,  Lesnar also suffered a minor cut to his face (and later on his chin), but went on to dominate the next ten minutes with knee strikes and various suplexes (fisherman, German, overhead belly-to-belly, vertical, snap), leading to Lesnar quipping, \"Suplex City, bitch!\" Lesnar performed a second F-5 on Reigns for a near-fall. Lesnar then removed his [[MMA gloves]], slapped Reigns and performed a German suplex and then third F-5 on Reigns for a near-fall. A turning point came around the 12-minute mark when the duo was outside the ring; Reigns shoved Lesnar into the ring post, causing Lesnar to bleed profusely from the head. After Lesnar barely avoided being counted out, Reigns performed three [[Superman punch]]es and two consecutive [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spears]], on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar countered another Superman punch with a fourth F-5 on Reigns but failed to follow up with a cover.\n\nWhile both men still were down, Seth Rollins ran down to the ring with his [[Money in the Bank (2014)|Money in the Bank briefcase]] and cashed in his contract, making the singles match a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] and the first time in history a Money In The Bank contract was cashed in during a match. Rollins kicked Reigns out of the ring and performed a Curb Stomp on Lesnar. Rollins went for a second Curb Stomp to Lesnar, who countered by lifting Rollins in preparation for an F-5, but Reigns performed a spear on Lesnar, which saved Rollins. As Lesnar rolled out of the ring, Rollins capitalized with a Curb Stomp to Reigns to win the title. Post-match, Rollins ran back up the entrance ramp and celebrated with the world championship title.<ref>[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/csonkas-wwe-wrestlemania-31-review-3-29-15/ Csonka's Wrestlemania 31 Review \u2013 411 Mania.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/general/eye-on-sports/25128925/wwe-wrestlemania-31-roundtable-review-recapping-sundays-show Wrestlemania 31 results \u2013 CBS Sports.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?41564 Powell's WrestleMania 31 results and review]</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nWWE claimed that the show was the highest-grossing WWE event ever at the time, drawing revenue of $12.6 million.

English commentators for the event were [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]], [[Jerry Lawler]], and [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]]. Spanish, German, French, and Italian commentators also called the matches at ringside. [[Lilian Garcia]] and [[Brandi Rhodes|Eden Stiles]] served as the ring announcers.\n\n=== Celebrities ===\n{{see also|List of celebrities involved with WrestleMania}}\nAs is tradition, WrestleMania featured numerous appearances by celebrity guests \u2013 such as ''[[E! News]]'' host [[Maria Menounos]], who served as a backstage interviewer. The pay-per-view broadcast was opened by [[Aloe Blacc]] performing \"[[America the Beautiful]]\". The event saw another musical performance as [[Skylar Grey]], [[Travis Barker]], and [[Kid Ink]] performed a medley of the two WrestleMania 31 theme songs \u2013 \"Rise\" and \"[[Money and the Power]]\". [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] also was featured at the event, first as part of the ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' themed grand entrance of [[Triple H]], and later being recognized as part of the 2015 [[WWE Hall of Fame]] class as a celebrity wing inductee.\n\n=== Pre-show ===\nTwo matches were contested on the WrestleMania Kickoff pre-show. The first was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|fatal four-Way]] [[tag team]] match for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] between the champions [[Tyson Kidd and Cesaro]] (with [[Natalya (wrestler)|Natalya]]), [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Kofi Kingston]] and [[Big E Langston|Big E]]) (with [[Xavier Woods]]), [[Primo & Epico|Los Matadores]] ([[Primo (wrestler)|Diego]] and [[Epico|Fernando]]) (with [[Mascarita Dorada|El Torito]]), and [[The Usos]] (Jey and Jimmy Uso) (with [[Naomi (wrestler)|Naomi]]). Kidd and Cesaro retained their titles after Big E suffered a Samoan splash from Jimmy Uso, followed by Cesaro throwing Uso out of the ring and scoring the pin. Also of note, Jey Uso would suffer a shoulder injury during the match, putting him out of action for several months.\n\nThe second pre-show match was the second annual [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant#Legacy|Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal]]. [[Big Show]] won the 30-man contest by last eliminating [[Damien Sandow|Damien Mizdow]] after Mizdow had turned on and eliminated his tag team partner [[The Miz]].\n\n=== Preliminary matches ===\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the seven-man [[ladder match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] where champion [[Wade Barrett|Bad News Barrett]] defended the title against [[Daniel Bryan]], [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]], [[Dean Ambrose]], [[Luke Harper]], [[Dolph Ziggler]], and [[Cody Rhodes|Stardust]]. Bryan won the match after he and Ziggler exchanged headbutts at the top of the ladder, causing Ziggler to fall backward and allowing Bryan to claim his first Intercontinental Championship.\n\nNext, [[Seth Rollins]] faced [[Randy Orton]]. During the match, both men kicked out of their finishers. Orton eventually won the match after a second \"RKO\", which was given additional elevation as Orton countered Rollins' \"Curb Stomp\" by propelling Rollins up into the air.\n\n[[File:NWo WM31.jpg|thumb|left|[[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] members [[Kevin Nash]] (left), [[Hulk Hogan]] (center) and [[Scott Hall]] (right) making their way to the ring]]\nAfter that, [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Triple H]] competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|No Disqualification Match]]. This was Sting's first official match in WWE. Midway through the match, Sting locked Triple H in his [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Scorpion Death Lock]] submission hold, which prompted Triple H's [[D-Generation X]] (DX) allies to enter the ring and attempt to interfere in the match. Sting knocked down [[Billy Gunn]], [[Road Dogg]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]], countered Triple H's [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] and threw him to the outside, and then launched himself from the top rope onto all four men. Triple H then performed a Pedigree on Sting for a near-fall and retrieved a [[sledgehammer]] from under the ring, which prompted the three original [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) members ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]]) to interfere on Sting's behalf. The nWo members took out DX and Sting dropped Triple H with his [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Inverted DDT|Scorpion Death Drop]] for a near-fall. Sting then locked Triple H in another Scorpion Death Lock. Triple H tried to grab his sledgehammer, but Hogan pulled it out of his reach, causing another brawl between both factions while Triple H was still locked in Sting's submission hold. [[Shawn Michaels]] then appeared and executed [[Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] on Sting. Triple H went to pin Sting only for Sting to kick out. Triple H grabbed his sledgehammer from Gunn, while Hall tossed a [[Baseball Bat]] to Sting. A standoff ensued between Triple H and Sting as they both held weapons. Sting struck Triple H in the gut with his bat and struck Triple H's sledgehammer which snapped in half. Sting then trapped Triple H in the corner and landed his [[Professional wrestling attacks#Stinger splash|Stinger Splash]]. When Sting went for another Stinger Splash, however, Triple H struck Sting with the sledgehammer to win the match. After the match, Triple H and Sting shook hands in the ring while the commentary team speculated that the [[Monday Night Wars|rivalry between WWE and WCW]] had finally been put to rest.\n\nDaniel Bryan was then interviewed backstage by [[Maria Menounos]] regarding his Intercontinental Championship victory, and was joined in celebration by former Intercontinental Champions [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], [[Roddy Piper|\"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper]], [[Ricky Steamboat|Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Bret Hart]], who all congratulated Bryan by performing Bryan's \"Yes!\" chant together until [[Ron Simmons]] broke up the celebration with his Damn! catchphrase.\n\nIn the fourth match, [[The Bella Twins]] (Brie Bella and [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Champion]] Nikki Bella) faced [[AJ Lee]] and [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Paige and Nikki began the bout. Most of the match saw The Bellas isolating Paige and preventing her from tagging in Lee \u2013 who the Bellas would frequently knock off the ring apron onto the floor \u2013 until Paige landed a somersault plancha to both Bellas on the outside. Paige finally tagged in Lee, who applied her \"[[Professional wrestling holds#Octopus hold|Black Widow]]\" hold to Nikki, but Brie saved her sister from defeat. Paige then ran in with a big boot on Brie but was soon pushed outside the ring. Brie tripped Lee as she ran off the ropes, allowing Nikki to perform a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Forearm smash|Forearm Smash]] on her for a near-fall. In the climax, Paige slammed Brie into the ring steps, allowing Lee to apply the \"Black Widow\" on Nikki, who submitted.\n\nAfter the match, the 2015 [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] class was introduced; [[The Bushwhackers]], [[Larry Zbysko]], [[Madusa|Alundra Blayze]], [[Tatsumi Fujinami]], [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Kevin Nash]] were presented to the crowd, while posthumous inductees [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] and [[Connor Michalek|Connor \"The Crusher\" Michalek]] were represented by family members.\n\n[[File:Rock Rousey WM31.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (left) celebrating with [[Ronda Rousey]] (right) after clashing with [[Stephanie McMahon]] and [[Triple H]]]]\nAfter that [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]] [[Alexander Rusev|Rusev]] (accompanied by his manager [[Lana (wrestling)|Lana]]) defended his title against [[John Cena]]. Rusev dominated the majority of the match and overpowered Cena throughout, but Cena was able to make a comeback. The end of the match came when Lana climbed onto the ring apron and was accidentally knocked off by Rusev, who then suffered an \"[[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|Attitude Adjustment]]\" for Cena's pin and the title. This was Rusev's first pinfall loss in WWE since he debuted in the main roster in April 2014.\n\nIn the next segment, [[The Authority (professional wrestling)|The Authority]] (Triple H and [[Stephanie McMahon]]) announced that WrestleMania had set a new Levi's Stadium attendance record of 76,976 and began to gloat about their accomplishments and Triple H's victory over Sting earlier in the night, which prompted [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] to enter the ring. After a verbal exchange, McMahon insulted the Rock and slapped him across the face, taunting that he wouldn't retaliate because he dare not hit a woman. Rock then brought [[UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship|UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion]] [[Ronda Rousey]] (who sat up front) into the ring. After Rousey told McMahon that she \"owns every ring she's in\" Rock attacked Triple H and Rousey then threw both McMahon and Triple H from the ring, first teasing an armbar on McMahon.\n\nIn the penultimate match, [[The Undertaker]] faced [[Bray Wyatt]]. This was Undertaker's first appearance since [[WrestleMania XXX]]. It was reported that Wyatt [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] injured his ankle earlier in the day while preparing for the match, resulting in both men working at a slow pace. While Wyatt largely controlled the offense, Undertaker was able to execute most of his signature moves such as \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Arm twist ropewalk chop|Old School]]\", the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|big boot]], and \"[[Professional wrestling throws#Snake Eyes|Snake Eyes]]\". Late in the match, Wyatt kicked out of a \"[[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Kneeling reverse piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]]\", while Undertaker kicked out of \"[[Facebuster#Swinging reverse STO|Sister Abigail]]\". In the end, Undertaker executed a second \"Tombstone Piledriver\" to win the match.\n\n=== Main event ===\n[[File:Seth Rollins WWE World Heavyweight Championship WrestleMania 31 2015.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=|[[Seth Rollins]] cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to walk out of WrestleMania 31 as  [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Champion]]]]\nIn the main event, [[Brock Lesnar]] defended the [[WWE World Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]]  against [[Roman Reigns]]. Within the first minute, Lesnar performed a [[German suplex]] and an [[Facebuster#Fireman's carry facebuster|F-5]] on Reigns,  Lesnar also suffered a minor cut to his face (and later on his chin), but went on to dominate the next ten minutes with knee strikes and various suplexes (fisherman, German, overhead belly-to-belly, vertical, snap), leading to Lesnar quipping, \"Suplex City, bitch!\" Lesnar performed a second F-5 on Reigns for a near-fall. Lesnar then removed his [[MMA gloves]], slapped Reigns and performed a German suplex and then third F-5 on Reigns for a near-fall. A turning point came around the 12-minute mark when the duo was outside the ring; Reigns shoved Lesnar into the ring post, causing Lesnar to bleed profusely from the head. After Lesnar barely avoided being counted out, Reigns performed three [[Superman punch]]es and two consecutive [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spears]], on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar countered another Superman punch with a fourth F-5 on Reigns but failed to follow up with a cover.\n\nWhile both men still were down, Seth Rollins ran down to the ring with his [[Money in the Bank (2014)|Money in the Bank briefcase]] and cashed in his contract, making the singles match a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] and the first time in history a Money In The Bank contract was cashed in during a match. Rollins kicked Reigns out of the ring and performed a Curb Stomp on Lesnar. Rollins went for a second Curb Stomp to Lesnar, who countered by lifting Rollins in preparation for an F-5, but Reigns performed a spear on Lesnar, which saved Rollins. As Lesnar rolled out of the ring, Rollins capitalized with a Curb Stomp to Reigns to win the title. Post-match, Rollins ran back up the entrance ramp and celebrated with the world championship title.<ref>[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/csonkas-wwe-wrestlemania-31-review-3-29-15/ Csonka's Wrestlemania 31 Review \u2013 411 Mania.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/general/eye-on-sports/25128925/wwe-wrestlemania-31-roundtable-review-recapping-sundays-show Wrestlemania 31 results \u2013 CBS Sports.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?41564 Powell's WrestleMania 31 results and review]</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nWWE claimed that the show was the highest-grossing WWE event ever at the time, drawing revenue of $12.6 million.

Lesnar responded by attacking Rollins, who escaped. Lesnar then attacked Rollins' cornermen J&J Security ([[Jamie Noble]] and [[Joey Mercury]]), a cameraman, and the broadcast announcers ([[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]], and [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]). As a result, Lesnar was fired and fined by [[Stephanie McMahon]] in storyline. [[Byron Saxton]] and [[Jerry Lawler]] immediately replaced them in the broken announce table. [[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] also replaced Michael Cole as lead announcer for two weeks on the following Thursday on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''. Rollins returned later during the show where [[Randy Orton]] declared a title shot request due to beating Rollins the night before. Orton and Rollins then had a steel cage match for the title at [[Extreme Rules (2015)|Extreme Rules]], where Rollins retained after interference from [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. Due to Rollins not winning cleanly, a fatal four-way match was scheduled for [[Payback (2015)|Payback]] where [[Roman Reigns]], [[Dean Ambrose]] and Orton went for the title. Ambrose and Reigns were given title shots after beating Rollins on consecutive ''Raw'' shows. Rollins then defended the title against Ambrose at [[Elimination Chamber (2015)|Elimination Chamber]] due to Ambrose stealing the title two weeks before the event. Rollins again retained at [[Money in the Bank (2015)|Money in the Bank]] after being demanded by The Authority to win without any form of assistance.
