The LaserDisc provided picture quality nearly double that of VHS tape and analog audio quality far superior to VHS.\n\nPhilips later teamed up with [[Sony]] to develop a new type of disc, the [[compact disc]] or CD. Introduced in 1982 in Japan (1983 in the U.S. and Europe), the CD is about {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter, and is single-sided. The format was initially designed to store digitized sound and proved to be a success in the music industry.\n\nA few years later, Philips decided to give CDs the ability to produce video, utilizing the same technology as its LaserDisc counterpart. This led to the creation of [[CD Video]] (CD-V) in 1987. However, the disc's small size significantly impeded the ability to store analog video; thus only 5 minutes of picture information could fit on the disc's surface (despite the fact that the audio was digital). Therefore, CD-V distribution was limited to featuring music videos, and it was soon discontinued by 1991.\n\nBy the early 1990s engineers were able to digitize and compress video signals, greatly improving storage efficiency.  Because this new format could hold 74/80 minutes of audio and video on a 650/700MB disc, releasing movies on compact discs finally became a reality. Extra capacity was obtained by sacrificing the [[error correction]] <!-- Mode 2 Form 2 recording ---> (it was believed that minor errors in the datastream would go unnoticed by the viewer). This format was named Video CD or VCD.\n\n[[File:Copy Protected VCD.jpg|thumb|\u201cCopy Protected\u201d logo on a VCD package produced in [[Hong Kong]].]]\nVCD enjoyed a brief period of success, with a few major feature films being released in the format (usually as a 2 disc set). However the introduction of the CD-R disc and associated recorders stopped the release of feature films in their tracks because the VCD format had no means of preventing unauthorized (and perfect) copies from being made.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, {{asof|lc=true|2013}} VCDs are still being released in several countries in Asia, but now with copy-protection.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe development of more sophisticated, higher capacity optical disc formats yielded the [[DVD]] format, released only a few years later with a copy protection mechanism. DVD players use lasers that are of shorter wavelength than those used on CDs, allowing the recorded pits to be smaller, so that more information can be stored. The DVD was so successful that it eventually pushed VHS out of the video market once suitable recorders became widely available. Nevertheless, VCDs made considerable inroads into developing nations, where they are still in use today due to their cheaper manufacturing and retail costs.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n== Technical specifications ==\n\n===Structure===\nVideo CDs comply with the [[CD-i Bridge]] format, and are [[Optical disc authoring|authored]] using tracks in [[CD-ROM XA]] mode. The first track of a VCD is in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 1, and stores metadata and menu information inside an [[ISO 9660]] [[filesystem]]. This track may also contain other non-essential files, and is shown by operating systems when loading the disc. This track can be absent from a VCD, which would still work but would not allow it to be properly displayed in computers.<ref name=\"mplayer\" />\n\nThe rest of the tracks are usually in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2 and contain video and audio [[Multiplexing#Video processing|multiplexed]] in an [[MPEG program stream]] (MPEG-PS) container, but [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]] tracks are also allowed.<ref name=\"mplayer\" /> Using Mode 2 Form 2 allows roughly 800 megabytes of VCD data to be stored on one 80 minute CD (versus 700 megabytes when using CD-ROM Mode 1).  This is achieved by sacrificing the error correction redundancy present in Mode 1.  It was considered that small errors in the video and audio stream pass largely unnoticed.  This, combined with the net bitrate of VCD video and audio, means that almost exactly 80 minutes of VCD content can be stored on an 80-minute CD, 74 minutes of VCD content on a 74-minute CD, and so on. This was done in part to ensure compatibility with existing CD drive technology, specifically the earliest \"1x\" speed CD drives.\n\n===Video===\n\nVideo specifications<ref name=\"icdia.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icdia.co.uk/cdprosupport/encoding/pink/mpeg1_specs.htm|title=MPEG1 Specifications|work=icdia.co.uk}}</ref>\n* Compression: [[MPEG-1]]\n* Resolution:\n** [[NTSC]]: 352\u00d7240\n** [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]]: 352\u00d7288\n* [[Aspect Ratio]]:\n** [[NTSC]]: 4:3\n** [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]]: 4:3\n* Framerate:\n** [[NTSC]]: 29.97 ''or'' 23.976 frames per second\n** [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]]: 25 frames per second\n* Bitrate: 1,150 [[kilobit]]s per second\n** Rate Control: [[constant bitrate]]\n\nAlthough many DVD video players support playback of VCDs, VCD video is only compatible with the [[DVD-Video]] standard if encoded at 29.97 frames per second or 25 frames per second. <!-- This statement refers to the video ONLY.  Incompatibilities caused by the 44,100 Hz audio are discussed in the audio section -->\n\nThe 352\u00d7240 and 352\u00d7288 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolutions were chosen because it is half the horizontal and vertical resolution of NTSC video, and half the horizontal resolution of PAL (the vertical resolution of PAL already being half of the 576 active lines). This is approximately half the resolution of an analog VHS tape which is ~330 horizontal and 480 vertical (NTSC) or 330\u00d7576 (PAL).\n\n===Audio===\n\nAudio specifications<ref name=\"icdia.co.uk\"/>\n* Compression: [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]]\n* Sample Frequency: 44,100 [[hertz]] (44.1&nbsp;kHz)\n* Output: Dual channel, [[stereo]], or Dolby Surround\n* Bitrate: 224 [[kilobit]]s per second\n** Rate Control: [[Constant bitrate]]\n\nAs with most CD-based formats, VCD audio is incompatible with the [[DVD-Video]] standard due to a difference in sampling frequency; DVDs require 48&nbsp;kHz, whereas VCDs use 44.1&nbsp;kHz.\n\n===Advantages of compression===\nBy compressing both the video and audio streams, a VCD is able to hold 74 minutes of picture and sound information, nearly the same duration as a standard 74 minute audio CD. The MPEG-1 compression used records mostly the differences between successive video frames, rather than write out each frame individually. Similarly, the audio frequency range is limited to those sounds most clearly heard by the human ear.\n\n===Other features===\n[[File:Return button on vcd player.JPG|thumb|PlayBack Control (PBC) added in VCD 2.0 requires a special 'Return' button]]\nThe VCD standard also features the option of DVD-quality still images/slide shows with audio, at resolutions of 704\u00d7480 (NTSC) or 704\u00d7576 (PAL/SECAM). Version 2.0 also adds the playback control (PBC), featuring a simple menu like DVD-Video.\n\n== Similar formats ==\n\n=== CD-i Digital Video ===\nShortly before the advent of White Book VCD, Philips started releasing movies in the [[Green Book (CD-interactive standard)|Green Book]] [[CD-i]] format, calling the subformat CD-i Digital Video (CD-i DV). While these used a similar format (MPEG-1), due to minor differences between the standards these discs are not compatible with VCD players. Philips' CD-i players with the Full Motion Video MPEG-1 decoder cartridge would play both formats. Only a few CD-i DV titles were released before the company switched to the current VCD format for publishing movies.\n\n=== XVCD ===\n'''XVCD''' (eXtended Video CD) is the name generally given to any format that stores MPEG-1 video on a compact disc in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2, but does not strictly follow the VCD standard in terms of the encoding of the video or audio.\n\nA normal VCD is encoded to MPEG-1 at a constant bit rate (CBR), so all scenes are required to use exactly the same data rate, regardless of complexity. However, video on an XVCD is typically encoded at a variable bit rate (VBR), so complex scenes can use a much higher data rate for a short time, while simpler scenes will use lower data rates. Some XVCDs use lower bitrates in order to fit longer videos onto the disc, while others use higher bitrates to improve quality. MPEG-2 may be used instead of MPEG-1.\n\nTo further reduce the data rate without significantly reducing quality, the size of the [[Group of pictures|GOP]] can be increased, a different MPEG-1 [[quantization (image processing)#Quantization matrices|quantization matrix]] can be used, the maximum data rate can be exceeded, and the bit rate of the MP2 audio can be reduced or even be swapped out completely for MP3 audio. These changes can be advantageous for those who want to either maximize video quality, or use fewer discs.\n\n=== KVCD ===\n'''KVCD''' (K Video Compression Dynamics) is an XVCD variant that requires the use of a [[software patent|proprietary]] [[quantization matrix]], available for non-commercial use. KVCD is notable because the specification recommends a non-standard resolution of 528\u00d7480 or 528\u00d7576. KVCDs encoded at this resolution are only playable by computers with CD-ROM drives, and a small number of DVD players.<ref>{{Citation | title = DVD Compatibility Chart | date= February 25, 2007 | url = http://www.kvcd.net/portal/articles.php?lng=en&pg=19 | accessdate = 2008-02-22 }}</ref>\n\n=== DVCD ===\n'''DVCD''' or Double VCD is a method to accommodate longer videos on a CD. A non-standard CD is [[overburn]]ed to include up to 100 minutes of video. However, some CD-ROM drives and players have problems reading these CDs, mostly because the groove spacing is outside specifications and the player's laser servo is unable to track it.\n\n=== DVI ===\n'''DVI''' ([[Digital Video Interactive]]) is a compression technique that stored 72 minutes of video on a [[CD-ROM]]. In 1998, [[Intel]] acquired the technology from [[RCA]]'s Sarnoff Research Labs. DVI never caught on.<ref>{{cite news|title=Definition of: DVI| url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,1237,t=DVI&i=42144,00.asp | work=PC Magazine}}</ref>\n\n===SVCD===\n[[Super Video CD]] is a format intended to be the successor of VCD, offering better quality of image and sound.\n\n== Adoption ==\n\n===In North America===\nVideo CDs were unable to gain acceptance as a mainstream format in North America, chiefly because the established VHS format was less expensive, offered comparable video quality, and could be recorded over.<ref name=\"NGen3\"/> The advent of [[CD-R|recordable CDs]], inexpensive recorders, and compatible DVD players spurred VCD acceptance in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref name=nytfoothold>{{cite news| first = Scot | last = Meyer | title =  Versatile Video CD's Get a Foothold in U.S. | date=April 26, 2001 |work= [[New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/26/technology/versatile-video-cd-s-get-a-foothold-in-us.html| accessdate = 2008-02-12 }}</ref> However, DVD burners and DVD-Video recorders were available by that time, and equipment and media costs for making DVD-Video fell rapidly.

Legal Video CDs can often be found in established video stores and major book outlets in most Asian countries.  They are typically packaged in jewel cases like commercial CDs, though higher-profile films may be released in [[keep case]]s, differentiated by the VCD logo.\n\nIn Asia, the use of VCDs as carriers for [[karaoke]] music is very common.

Producing video CDs involves stripping out high- and low-frequency sounds from the video, resulting in lower audio quality than VHS.<ref name=\"NGen4\"/> While both formats need fast-forwarding to find certain scenes, rewinding to the beginning upon reaching the end is not required in VCD. The resolution is just half below that of common VHS resolution.\n\nVideo CDs do not come with [[closed caption]]ing (on-screen text to aid viewers with hearing problems). When watching a film that exceeds 74 minutes (nearly 1\u00bc hours), which is the maximum video capacity of one disc, a viewer has to change the disc upon reaching halfway (unless the discs are played on a VCD changer that can hold multiple discs and play them automatically in succession), whereas a single VHS tape can hold 3\u00bd hours of continuous video (though as of 2014, 10-hour VHS tapes are available).\n\n==Compared with DVD==\n[[File:Three-disc VCD Title.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Films released on VCD can come on as many as 3 discs, depending on the length of the film. Cases of VCDs are shaped like those of audio CDs. DVD and Blu-ray cases, however, favor height over width.]]\nWhen playing a DVD, the viewer is brought to a main menu which gives them options (watch the feature film, view \"deleted scenes\", play some special applications, etc.). VCDs are usually straightforward, playing them often goes directly to the video with extras (mostly trailers and commercials) taking place before or after it, like on a VHS cassette.\n\nSubtitles are found on many Asian VCDs but cannot be removed, unlike DVDs. The subtitles are embedded on the video during the encoding process (\"[[hardsub]]bed\").  It is not uncommon to find a VCD with subtitles for two languages.\n\nThough the VCD technology can support it, most films carried on VCDs do not contain chapters, requiring the viewer to fast-forward to resume the program after playback has been stopped. This is mostly because VCD technology is able to start playback at a chapter point but there is nothing to signal the player that the chapter has changed during a program. This can be confusing for the user as the player will indicate that it is still playing chapter 1 when it has played through to chapter 2 or later. Pressing the Next button would cause playback from the beginning of chapter 2. However, preview material is sometimes stored in a separate chapter, followed by a single chapter for the film.\n\nVCDs are often bilingual. Because they feature stereo audio, disc players have an option to play only the left or right audio channel. On some films, they feature English on the left audio channel and Cantonese on the right; more commonly Hong Kong VCDs will feature Mandarin on one channel and Cantonese on the other. This is similar to selecting a language track on a DVD, except it is limited to 2 languages, due to there being only two audio channels (left and right). The audio track effectively becomes monaural.\n\nVCD's most noticeable disadvantage compared to DVD is image quality, due both to the more aggressive compression necessary to fit video into such a small capacity as well as the compression method used. Additionally, VCDs are available only in stereo, while DVDs are capable of six channels of discrete surround sound.  The audio compression of VCDs also suffers from not being able to pull off the [[Haas effect]] for matrixed surround sound.\n\n== Hardware and software support ==\n[[File:Round-Button Sega Saturn Console + Type-2 Controller.png|thumb|250px|right|A few consoles supported VCDs, like the [[Sega Saturn]].]]\nEarly devices supporting Video CD playback include the [[Philips CD-i]] systems and the [[Amiga CD-32]] (albeit via an optional decoder card).<ref name=\"NGen3\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Beginning of the End for Video CD? |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|pages=27\u201328}}</ref> Disc playback is also available both natively and as an option on some CD- and DVD-based video game consoles, including [[Sega Saturn]] (pictured), [[Sega Dreamcast]], and [[Sony PlayStation]] (only on the SCPH-5903 model).\n\n\nVideo CD is not popular in North America and Europe, so its support is limited among mainstream software. \n\n[[Windows Media Player]] prior to version 9 does not support playing VCD directly.

The LaserDisc provided picture quality nearly double that of VHS tape and analog audio quality far superior to VHS.\n\nPhilips later teamed up with [[Sony]] to develop a new type of disc, the [[compact disc]] or CD. Introduced in 1982 in Japan (1983 in the U.S. and Europe), the CD is about {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter, and is single-sided. The format was initially designed to store digitized sound and proved to be a success in the music industry.\n\nA few years later, Philips decided to give CDs the ability to produce video, utilizing the same technology as its LaserDisc counterpart. This led to the creation of [[CD Video]] (CD-V) in 1987. However, the disc's small size significantly impeded the ability to store analog video; thus only 5 minutes of picture information could fit on the disc's surface (despite the fact that the audio was digital). Therefore, CD-V distribution was limited to featuring music videos, and it was soon discontinued by 1991.\n\nBy the early 1990s engineers were able to digitize and compress video signals, greatly improving storage efficiency.  Because this new format could hold 74/80 minutes of audio and video on a 650/700MB disc, releasing movies on compact discs finally became a reality. Extra capacity was obtained by sacrificing the [[error correction]] <!-- Mode 2 Form 2 recording ---> (it was believed that minor errors in the datastream would go unnoticed by the viewer). This format was named Video CD or VCD.\n\n[[File:Copy Protected VCD.jpg|thumb|\u201cCopy Protected\u201d logo on a VCD package produced in [[Hong Kong]].]]\nVCD enjoyed a brief period of success, with a few major feature films being released in the format (usually as a 2 disc set). However the introduction of the CD-R disc and associated recorders stopped the release of feature films in their tracks because the VCD format had no means of preventing unauthorized (and perfect) copies from being made.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, {{asof|lc=true|2013}} VCDs are still being released in several countries in Asia, but now with copy-protection.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe development of more sophisticated, higher capacity optical disc formats yielded the [[DVD]] format, released only a few years later with a copy protection mechanism. DVD players use lasers that are of shorter wavelength than those used on CDs, allowing the recorded pits to be smaller, so that more information can be stored. The DVD was so successful that it eventually pushed VHS out of the video market once suitable recorders became widely available. Nevertheless, VCDs made considerable inroads into developing nations, where they are still in use today due to their cheaper manufacturing and retail costs.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n== Technical specifications ==\n\n===Structure===\nVideo CDs comply with the [[CD-i Bridge]] format, and are [[Optical disc authoring|authored]] using tracks in [[CD-ROM XA]] mode. The first track of a VCD is in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 1, and stores metadata and menu information inside an [[ISO 9660]] [[filesystem]]. This track may also contain other non-essential files, and is shown by operating systems when loading the disc. This track can be absent from a VCD, which would still work but would not allow it to be properly displayed in computers.<ref name=\"mplayer\" />\n\nThe rest of the tracks are usually in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2 and contain video and audio [[Multiplexing#Video processing|multiplexed]] in an [[MPEG program stream]] (MPEG-PS) container, but [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]] tracks are also allowed.<ref name=\"mplayer\" /> Using Mode 2 Form 2 allows roughly 800 megabytes of VCD data to be stored on one 80 minute CD (versus 700 megabytes when using CD-ROM Mode 1).  This is achieved by sacrificing the error correction redundancy present in Mode 1.  It was considered that small errors in the video and audio stream pass largely unnoticed.  This, combined with the net bitrate of VCD video and audio, means that almost exactly 80 minutes of VCD content can be stored on an 80-minute CD, 74 minutes of VCD content on a 74-minute CD, and so on. This was done in part to ensure compatibility with existing CD drive technology, specifically the earliest \"1x\" speed CD drives.\n\n===Video===\n\nVideo specifications<ref name=\"icdia.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icdia.co.uk/cdprosupport/encoding/pink/mpeg1_specs.htm|title=MPEG1 Specifications|work=icdia.co.uk}}</ref>\n* Compression: [[MPEG-1]]\n* Resolution:\n** [[NTSC]]: 352\u00d7240\n** [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]]: 352\u00d7288\n* [[Aspect Ratio]]:\n** [[NTSC]]: 4:3\n** [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]]: 4:3\n* Framerate:\n** [[NTSC]]: 29.97 ''or'' 23.976 frames per second\n** [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]]: 25 frames per second\n* Bitrate: 1,150 [[kilobit]]s per second\n** Rate Control: [[constant bitrate]]\n\nAlthough many DVD video players support playback of VCDs, VCD video is only compatible with the [[DVD-Video]] standard if encoded at 29.97 frames per second or 25 frames per second. <!-- This statement refers to the video ONLY.  Incompatibilities caused by the 44,100 Hz audio are discussed in the audio section -->\n\nThe 352\u00d7240 and 352\u00d7288 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolutions were chosen because it is half the horizontal and vertical resolution of NTSC video, and half the horizontal resolution of PAL (the vertical resolution of PAL already being half of the 576 active lines). This is approximately half the resolution of an analog VHS tape which is ~330 horizontal and 480 vertical (NTSC) or 330\u00d7576 (PAL).\n\n===Audio===\n\nAudio specifications<ref name=\"icdia.co.uk\"/>\n* Compression: [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]]\n* Sample Frequency: 44,100 [[hertz]] (44.1&nbsp;kHz)\n* Output: Dual channel, [[stereo]], or Dolby Surround\n* Bitrate: 224 [[kilobit]]s per second\n** Rate Control: [[Constant bitrate]]\n\nAs with most CD-based formats, VCD audio is incompatible with the [[DVD-Video]] standard due to a difference in sampling frequency; DVDs require 48&nbsp;kHz, whereas VCDs use 44.1&nbsp;kHz.\n\n===Advantages of compression===\nBy compressing both the video and audio streams, a VCD is able to hold 74 minutes of picture and sound information, nearly the same duration as a standard 74 minute audio CD. The MPEG-1 compression used records mostly the differences between successive video frames, rather than write out each frame individually. Similarly, the audio frequency range is limited to those sounds most clearly heard by the human ear.\n\n===Other features===\n[[File:Return button on vcd player.JPG|thumb|PlayBack Control (PBC) added in VCD 2.0 requires a special 'Return' button]]\nThe VCD standard also features the option of DVD-quality still images/slide shows with audio, at resolutions of 704\u00d7480 (NTSC) or 704\u00d7576 (PAL/SECAM). Version 2.0 also adds the playback control (PBC), featuring a simple menu like DVD-Video.\n\n== Similar formats ==\n\n=== CD-i Digital Video ===\nShortly before the advent of White Book VCD, Philips started releasing movies in the [[Green Book (CD-interactive standard)|Green Book]] [[CD-i]] format, calling the subformat CD-i Digital Video (CD-i DV). While these used a similar format (MPEG-1), due to minor differences between the standards these discs are not compatible with VCD players. Philips' CD-i players with the Full Motion Video MPEG-1 decoder cartridge would play both formats. Only a few CD-i DV titles were released before the company switched to the current VCD format for publishing movies.\n\n=== XVCD ===\n'''XVCD''' (eXtended Video CD) is the name generally given to any format that stores MPEG-1 video on a compact disc in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2, but does not strictly follow the VCD standard in terms of the encoding of the video or audio.\n\nA normal VCD is encoded to MPEG-1 at a constant bit rate (CBR), so all scenes are required to use exactly the same data rate, regardless of complexity. However, video on an XVCD is typically encoded at a variable bit rate (VBR), so complex scenes can use a much higher data rate for a short time, while simpler scenes will use lower data rates. Some XVCDs use lower bitrates in order to fit longer videos onto the disc, while others use higher bitrates to improve quality. MPEG-2 may be used instead of MPEG-1.\n\nTo further reduce the data rate without significantly reducing quality, the size of the [[Group of pictures|GOP]] can be increased, a different MPEG-1 [[quantization (image processing)#Quantization matrices|quantization matrix]] can be used, the maximum data rate can be exceeded, and the bit rate of the MP2 audio can be reduced or even be swapped out completely for MP3 audio. These changes can be advantageous for those who want to either maximize video quality, or use fewer discs.\n\n=== KVCD ===\n'''KVCD''' (K Video Compression Dynamics) is an XVCD variant that requires the use of a [[software patent|proprietary]] [[quantization matrix]], available for non-commercial use. KVCD is notable because the specification recommends a non-standard resolution of 528\u00d7480 or 528\u00d7576. KVCDs encoded at this resolution are only playable by computers with CD-ROM drives, and a small number of DVD players.<ref>{{Citation | title = DVD Compatibility Chart | date= February 25, 2007 | url = http://www.kvcd.net/portal/articles.php?lng=en&pg=19 | accessdate = 2008-02-22 }}</ref>\n\n=== DVCD ===\n'''DVCD''' or Double VCD is a method to accommodate longer videos on a CD. A non-standard CD is [[overburn]]ed to include up to 100 minutes of video. However, some CD-ROM drives and players have problems reading these CDs, mostly because the groove spacing is outside specifications and the player's laser servo is unable to track it.\n\n=== DVI ===\n'''DVI''' ([[Digital Video Interactive]]) is a compression technique that stored 72 minutes of video on a [[CD-ROM]]. In 1998, [[Intel]] acquired the technology from [[RCA]]'s Sarnoff Research Labs. DVI never caught on.<ref>{{cite news|title=Definition of: DVI| url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,1237,t=DVI&i=42144,00.asp | work=PC Magazine}}</ref>\n\n===SVCD===\n[[Super Video CD]] is a format intended to be the successor of VCD, offering better quality of image and sound.\n\n== Adoption ==\n\n===In North America===\nVideo CDs were unable to gain acceptance as a mainstream format in North America, chiefly because the established VHS format was less expensive, offered comparable video quality, and could be recorded over.<ref name=\"NGen3\"/> The advent of [[CD-R|recordable CDs]], inexpensive recorders, and compatible DVD players spurred VCD acceptance in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref name=nytfoothold>{{cite news| first = Scot | last = Meyer | title =  Versatile Video CD's Get a Foothold in U.S. | date=April 26, 2001 |work= [[New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/26/technology/versatile-video-cd-s-get-a-foothold-in-us.html| accessdate = 2008-02-12 }}</ref> However, DVD burners and DVD-Video recorders were available by that time, and equipment and media costs for making DVD-Video fell rapidly. DVD-Video, with its longer run time and much higher quality, quickly overshadowed VCD in areas that could afford it. In addition many early DVD players could not read recordable (CD-R) media,<ref>{{Citation|first=Hugh |last=Bennett |title=DVD-ROM and CD-R: the compatibility question answered - includes related article on reading mixed media |date=March 1998 |publisher=Emedia Professional |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FXG/is_n3_v11/ai_20324077 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712150805/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FXG/is_n3_v11/ai_20324077 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |accessdate=2008-04-26 }}</ref> and this limited the compatibility of home-made VCDs.

In many Asian countries, major Hollywood studios (and Asian home video distributors) have licensed companies to officially produce and distribute the VCDs, such as [[Music Corporation of America|MCA Home Video]] in [[Pakistan]], Intercontinental Video Ltd. of Hong Kong, Sunny Video in Malaysia, Vision Interprima Pictures in Indonesia, CVD International and Pacific Marketing and Entertainment Group in Thailand, Excel Home Video in India, Berjaya-HVN and InnoForm Media in both Malaysia and Singapore, Scorpio East Entertainment in Singapore, as well as VIVA Video, Magnavision Home Video, and C-Interactive Digital Entertainment in the Philippines. Legal Video CDs can often be found in established video stores and major book outlets in most Asian countries.  They are typically packaged in jewel cases like commercial CDs, though higher-profile films may be released in [[keep case]]s, differentiated by the VCD logo.\n\nIn Asia, the use of VCDs as carriers for [[karaoke]] music is very common.  One channel would feature a mono track with music and singing, another channel a pure instrumental version for karaoke singing.  Prior to this, karaoke music was carried on [[laserdisc]]s.\n\n===Worldwide trends===\nVCD's growth has slowed in areas that can afford [[DVD-Video]], which offers most of the same advantages, as well as better picture quality<ref>{{Citation | title = Low DVD Prices to Drive up Sales | date=September 5, 2001 | publisher = [[People's Daily]] | url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/200109/05/eng20010905_79358.html | accessdate = 2008-02-12 }}</ref>\n(higher resolution with fewer digital compression artifacts) due to its larger storage capacity. However, VCD has simultaneously seen significant new growth in emerging economies like [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[South America]] and [[Africa]] as a low-cost alternative to DVD.

Producing video CDs involves stripping out high- and low-frequency sounds from the video, resulting in lower audio quality than VHS.<ref name=\"NGen4\"/> While both formats need fast-forwarding to find certain scenes, rewinding to the beginning upon reaching the end is not required in VCD. The resolution is just half below that of common VHS resolution.\n\nVideo CDs do not come with [[closed caption]]ing (on-screen text to aid viewers with hearing problems). When watching a film that exceeds 74 minutes (nearly 1\u00bc hours), which is the maximum video capacity of one disc, a viewer has to change the disc upon reaching halfway (unless the discs are played on a VCD changer that can hold multiple discs and play them automatically in succession), whereas a single VHS tape can hold 3\u00bd hours of continuous video (though as of 2014, 10-hour VHS tapes are available).\n\n==Compared with DVD==\n[[File:Three-disc VCD Title.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Films released on VCD can come on as many as 3 discs, depending on the length of the film. Cases of VCDs are shaped like those of audio CDs. DVD and Blu-ray cases, however, favor height over width.]]\nWhen playing a DVD, the viewer is brought to a main menu which gives them options (watch the feature film, view \"deleted scenes\", play some special applications, etc.). VCDs are usually straightforward, playing them often goes directly to the video with extras (mostly trailers and commercials) taking place before or after it, like on a VHS cassette.\n\nSubtitles are found on many Asian VCDs but cannot be removed, unlike DVDs. The subtitles are embedded on the video during the encoding process (\"[[hardsub]]bed\").  It is not uncommon to find a VCD with subtitles for two languages.\n\nThough the VCD technology can support it, most films carried on VCDs do not contain chapters, requiring the viewer to fast-forward to resume the program after playback has been stopped. This is mostly because VCD technology is able to start playback at a chapter point but there is nothing to signal the player that the chapter has changed during a program. This can be confusing for the user as the player will indicate that it is still playing chapter 1 when it has played through to chapter 2 or later. Pressing the Next button would cause playback from the beginning of chapter 2. However, preview material is sometimes stored in a separate chapter, followed by a single chapter for the film.\n\nVCDs are often bilingual. Because they feature stereo audio, disc players have an option to play only the left or right audio channel. On some films, they feature English on the left audio channel and Cantonese on the right; more commonly Hong Kong VCDs will feature Mandarin on one channel and Cantonese on the other. This is similar to selecting a language track on a DVD, except it is limited to 2 languages, due to there being only two audio channels (left and right). The audio track effectively becomes monaural.\n\nVCD's most noticeable disadvantage compared to DVD is image quality, due both to the more aggressive compression necessary to fit video into such a small capacity as well as the compression method used. Additionally, VCDs are available only in stereo, while DVDs are capable of six channels of discrete surround sound.  The audio compression of VCDs also suffers from not being able to pull off the [[Haas effect]] for matrixed surround sound.\n\n== Hardware and software support ==\nEarly devices supporting Video CD playback include the [[Philips CD-i]] systems and the [[Amiga CD-32]] (albeit via an optional decoder card).<ref name=\"NGen3\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Beginning of the End for Video CD? |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|pages=27\u201328}}</ref> Disc playback is also available both natively and as an option on some CD- and DVD-based video game consoles, including [[Sega Saturn]] (pictured), [[Sega Dreamcast]], and [[Sony PlayStation]] (only on the SCPH-5903 model).\n\n[[File:Round-Button Sega Saturn Console + Type-2 Controller.png|thumb|250px|right|A few consoles supported VCDs, like the [[Sega Saturn]].]]\nVideo CD is not popular in North America and Europe, so its support is limited among mainstream software. [[Windows Media Player]] prior to version 9 and [[QuickTime Player]] do not support playing VCD directly, though they can play the .DAT files (stored under \\MPEGAV for video and audio data) reliably,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22480|title=Mac OS X 10.3: Playing Video Compact Disc (VCD) media|work=apple.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.4/en/mh1949.html|title=Official Apple Support|work=apple.com}}</ref> and [[plugins]] were available.

Older [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and HD-DVD players also retained support, as do CBHD players as well. However, most current Blu-ray players, most in-car infotainment with DVD/Blu-ray support, Xbox, and the Sony [[PlayStation 2]]/[[PlayStation 3|3]]/[[PlayStation 4|4]] cannot play VCDs; this is because while they have backwards playback compatibility with the DVD standard, these player can not read VCD data because the player software does not have support for MPEG-1 video and audio.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[LaserDisc]]\n* [[Super Video CD|SVCD]]\n* [[DVD]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://archive.is/20070826064200/http://www.ip.philips.com/licensing/licensingprogramshistory/history_videocdplayer_joint.html Patent History Video CD Player] - published by [[Philips]] 2003\n* [https://archive.is/20080930073157/http://www.ip.philips.com/licensing/licensingprogramshistory/history_videocddisc_joint.html Patent History Video CD Disc] - published by [[Philips]] 2003\n* [http://www.videohelp.com/vcd What is a VCD?]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050426132724/http://www.doom9.org/index.html?%2Fmpg%2Fvcdsvcd_faq.htm VCD / SVCD / miniDVD FAQ]\n\n{{CD}}\n{{Homevid}}\n{{Rainbow Books}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Video Cd}}\n[[Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1993]]\n[[Category:Compact disc]]\n[[Category:Video storage]]\n[[Category:Information technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:Information technology in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Japanese inventions]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in the Netherlands]]\n", "name_user": "JeffreyLoeber", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHardware and software support", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_CD"}

He ends up in a bar, getting caught by a staff named Mark for stealing a quarter. Mark calls the police while tricking David to stay by baiting him with a pizza. The police brings David to the police station while sharing a pizza Mark gave David before he left. David's father arrives to bring David home to his abusive mother, telling the police that David is just upset for not being allowed to ride his bicycle. David's teachers eventually contact the authorities, causing David to be put together with a social services worker named Ms. Gold. Before the trial of whether or not to permanently remove him from his mother's custody, David becomes confused about whether he may have deserved the treatment his mother gave him. Ms. Gold, on the other hand, assures him it had nothing to do with him, and that his mother is sick. David eventually tells the truth of his mother, and becomes a permanent ward of the court, escaping from the abuse of his mother.\n\nAfter the trial, he is put into a home under the care of a woman he calls Aunt Mary. He is admired by the other foster children as he has a skill of stealing, and is quite active and disruptive due to being cut off from normal household living and behavior for so long. He soon receives a visit from his mother and brothers. His mother asks how David was doing, calling him \"The Boy\", shocking Aunt Mary. While Aunt Mary answered a short phone call, his mother swears to David that she will get him back. David later meets his first 'permanent' foster parent---Lilian and Rudy Catanze. During his stay, David's mother pays him another visit and his brother,Stan, brought back David's bicycle, which was mistreated and broken. He is so distraught by the bike's condition that he cried for hours. He decides to earn money in order to fix the bicycle by cleaning the bathroom for thirty cents. After he has enough money, Tony, Lilian's son, brings David to the bicycle shop and helps David buy the right parts to fix his bicycle. One day, he decides to ride his bicycle and go down his old road where his old home is. His family sees him riding on the road, and contacts his foster family. .\n\nLater in the book,a person who he thinks is his friend, starts using him to do illegal things. One of those times is when they plan to set one of his teacher's classroom on fire. The fire gets out of control, and David tries to stop it. His \"friend\" later tells the teacher that it was all David. As a result, he is removed from his foster home, and sent to [[Juvenile Hall]]. While he is in Juvenile Hall, he remarks that the life in it is much easier than the life 'outside'. He eventually is released, and is placed in multiple foster homes across California.\n\nyea yea yea. In his sophomore year of [[high school]], he is placed into a class for slow learners. He then decides that he is more interested in earning money than school, because he will be out of foster care in less than a year. He also looks for his father, only to find out he lost his job at the fire station due to his alcoholism, but he gives David his fireman's badge as a proper goodbye present before he and David part ways.  When he is out of foster care, he enlists in the [[US Air Force]]. Surprisingly, his own mother knew the news and she congratulated him at his Air Force graduation. \n\nAs he talked to his mother and began to cry, he then hopes that his mother will say the three special words that he has always wanted her to say. \"I love you.\" It was not said and he believes she is just playing with his emotions, as he has longed for these three words for years. He believes that he wanted to see his mother but that was also not a good idea. He soon realizes that the mother's love that he has always been searching for was in the arms of his foster mother, Alice. One could argue that ''The Lost Boy'' is one boy's attempt to find a family that loves him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/the-lost-boy-pelzer/themes|title=The Lost Boy Themes (Dave Pelzer) - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref> The story ends with him beginning his career in the Air Force so he can learn how to treat others.

David's teachers eventually contact the authorities, causing David to be put together with a social services worker named Ms. Gold. Before the trial of whether or not to permanently remove him from his mother's custody, David becomes confused about whether he may have deserved the treatment his mother gave him. Ms. Gold, on the other hand, assures him it had nothing to do with him, and that his mother is sick. David eventually tells the truth of his mother, and becomes a permanent ward of the court, escaping from the abuse of his mother.\n\nAfter the trial, he is put into a home under the care of a woman he calls Aunt Mary. He is admired by the other foster children as he has a skill of stealing, and is quite active and disruptive due to being cut off from normal household living and behavior for so long. He soon receives a visit from his mother and brothers. His mother asks how David was doing, calling him \"The Boy\", shocking Aunt Mary. While Aunt Mary answered a short phone call, his mother swears to David that she will get him back. David later meets his first 'permanent' foster parent---Lilian and Rudy Catanze. During his stay, David's mother pays him another visit and his brother,Stan, brought back David's bicycle, which was mistreated and broken. He is so distraught by the bike's condition that he cried for hours. He decides to earn money in order to fix the bicycle by cleaning the bathroom for thirty cents. After he has enough money, Tony, Lilian's son, brings David to the bicycle shop and helps David buy the right parts to fix his bicycle. One day, he decides to ride his bicycle and go down his old road where his old home is. His family sees him riding on the road, and contacts his foster family. .\n\nLater in the book,a person who he thinks is his friend, starts using him to do illegal things. One of those times is when they plan to set one of his teacher's classroom on fire. The fire gets out of control, and David tries to stop it. His \"friend\" later tells the teacher that it was all David. As a result, he is removed from his foster home, and sent to [[Juvenile Hall]]. While he is in Juvenile Hall, he remarks that the life in it is much easier than the life 'outside'. He eventually is released, and is placed in multiple foster homes across California.\n\nIn his sophomore year of [[high school]], he is placed into a class for slow learners. He then decides that he is more interested in earning money than school, because he will be out of foster care in less than a year. He also looks for his father, only to find out he lost his job at the fire station due to his alcoholism, but he gives David his fireman's badge as a proper goodbye present before he and David part ways.  When he is out of foster care, he enlists in the [[US Air Force]]. Surprisingly, his own mother knew the news and she congratulated him at his Air Force graduation. \n\nAs he talked to his mother and began to cry, he then hopes that his mother will say the three special words that he has always wanted her to say. \"I love you.\" It was not said and he believes she is just playing with his emotions, as he has longed for these three words for years. He believes that he wanted to see his mother but that was also not a good idea. He soon realizes that the mother's love that he has always been searching for was in the arms of his foster mother, Alice. One could argue that ''The Lost Boy'' is one boy's attempt to find a family that loves him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/the-lost-boy-pelzer/themes|title=The Lost Boy Themes (Dave Pelzer) - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref> The story ends with him beginning his career in the Air Force so he can learn how to treat others.

Later it became known as the ancient [[Arameans|Aramean]] city of [[Sikkan]], the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] city of [[Rhesaina]], and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] city of Theodosiopolis.\n\nThe city fell to the Arabs in 640, was several times destroyed and rebuild, and in medieval times fiercely embattled between several Muslim [[dynasty|dynasties]]. It still remained an important site of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox Christians]], until [[Tamerlane]] sacked the city at the end of the 14th century. During the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] killed 80.000 Armenians in the infamous [[Ras al-Ayn camps]].\n\nDivided by the 1921 [[Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Ankara]], it was stripped off its northern neighborhoods, today's [[Ceylanp\u0131nar]], [[Turkey]]. In the [[Syrian Civil War]], Ras al-Ayn was engulfed by the long [[Battle of Ras al-Ayn]], until in July 2013 the Kurdish [[People's Protection Units|YPG]] forces took over control and expelled the [[jihadism|jihadists]].

Today's Ras al-Ayn can be traced back to a settlement existing since c. 2000 BC, which in the early 1st millennium BC became the ancient city of [[Sikkan]], part of the [[Aramaeans|Aramaean]] kingdom of [[Bit Bahiani]]. The archaeological site is located on the southern edge of the mound [[Tell Fekheriye]], around which today's Ras al-Ayn is built, just a few hundred meters south of the city center. During excavations in 1979, the famous [[Tell Fekheriye bilingual inscription]] was found. The nearby town of [[Tell Halaf]] is also a former site of an Aramean city.\n\n===Classical era===\nIn later times, the town became known as \"[[Rhesaina]]\", \"Ayn Warda\", and \"Theodosiopolis\", the latter named after the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Theodosius I]] who granted the settlement city rights.

The only [[Syria\u2013Turkey border#Border crossings|border crossing]] is located in the western outskirts of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nDuring the [[Syrian Civil War]], Ras al-Ayn was engulfed by the long [[Battle of Ras al-Ayn]]. In late November 2012 [[Syrian rebels|rebels]] of [[al-Nusra Front]] and the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) attacked positions of the [[Syrian Army]].

It still remained an important site of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox Christians]], until [[Tamerlane]] sacked the city at the end of the 14th century.
