Generally one anemone contains a 'harem', consisting of a large female, a smaller reproductive male, and even smaller non-reproductive males. If the female is removed, the reproductive male will change sex and the largest of the non-reproductive males will mature and become reproductive. It has been shown that fishing pressure can change when the switch from male to female occurs, since fishermen usually prefer to catch the larger fish. The populations are generally changing sex at a smaller size, due to [[natural selection]].\n* '''Protogyny''': Where the organism is born as a female, and then changes sex to a male.<ref name=barrows/>\n** Example: [[wrasse]]s (Family [[Labridae]]) are a group of reef fish in which protogyny is common. Wrasses also have an uncommon life history strategy, which is termed diandry (literally, two males). In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase male and a terminal phase male. Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial. They are, perhaps, female mimics (which is why they are found swimming in group with other females). Terminal phase males are territorial and have a distinctively bright coloration. Individuals are born as males or females, but if they are born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Females and initial phase males can become terminal phase males. Usually, the most dominant female or initial phase male replaces any terminal phase male when those males die or abandon the group.\n*'''Bidirectional Sex Changers''': where an organism has female and male reproductive organs, but act as either female or male during different stages in life.<ref name=barrows/>\n**Example: [[Lythrypnus dalli]] (Family [[Lythrypnus]]) are a group of [[coral reef fish]] in which bidirectional sex change occurs. Once a social hierarchy is established a fish changes sex according to its social status, regardless of the initial sex, based on a simple principle: if the fish expresses subordinate behavior then it changes its sex to female, and if the fish expresses dominant or not subordinate behavior then the fish changes its sex to male.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rodgers|first=E.W.|author2=Early, R.L. |author3=Grober, M.S. |title=Social status determines sexual phenotype in the bi-directional sex changing bluebanded goby Lythrypnus dalli|journal=J Fish Biol|year=2007|volume=70|issue=6|pages=1660\u20131668|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01427.x}}</ref>\nDichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, [[grouper]]s are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often [[aquacultured]].

Sexual material is exchanged between both animals via [[spermatophore]], which can then be stored in the [[spermatheca]]. After exchange of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], both animals will lay fertilized eggs after a period of gestation; then the eggs will proceed to hatch after a development period. Snails typically reproduce in early spring and late autumn.\n*[[:Banana slug]]s are one example of a hermaphroditic gastropod. Mating with a partner is more desirable biologically, as the genetic material of the resultant offspring is varied, but if mating with a partner is not possible, self-fertilization is practiced. The male sexual organ of an adult banana slug is quite large in proportion to its size, as well as compared to the female organ. It is possible for banana slugs, while mating, to become stuck together. If a substantial amount of wiggling fails to separate them, the male organ will be bitten off (using the slug's [[radula]]), see [[apophallation]]. If a banana slug has lost its male sexual organ, it can still mate as a female, making its hermaphroditic quality a valuable adaptation.\n* The species of colourful [[sea slugs]] ''[[Goniobranchus reticulatus]]'' is hermaphroditic, with both male and female organs active at the same time during copulation.  After mating, the external portion of the penis detaches, but is able to regrow within 24 hours.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21431678 | title = Sea slug's 'disposable penis' surprises | author = Rebecca Morelle | date = 12 February 2013 | work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2012.1150 | title = Disposable penis and its replenishment in a simultaneous hermaphrodite | year = 2013 | last1 = Sekizawa | first1 = A. | last2 = Seki | first2 = S. | last3 = Tokuzato | first3 = M. | last4 = Shiga | first4 = S. | last5 = Nakashima | first5 = Y. | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 20121150 | pmid=23407499 | pmc=3639767}}</ref>\n* [[Hamlet (fish)|Hamlets]], unlike other fish, seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self-fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights.\n* [[Earthworm]]s are another example of a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Although they possess ovaries and testes, they have a protective mechanism against self-fertilization. Sexual reproduction occurs when two worms meet and exchange [[gamete]]s, copulating on damp nights during warm seasons. Fertilized eggs are protected by a cocoon, which is buried on or near the surface of the ground.\n* The free-living hermaphroditic nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of approximately 1%.<ref name=\"pmid16005289\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Barri\u00e8re A, F\u00e9lix MA|title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

One possible pathophysiologic explanation of intersex in humans is a [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an [[X chromosome|X]] chromosome and the other carrying a [[Y chromosome|Y]] chromosome), the two [[zygote|fertilized ova]] are then [[Chimera (genetics)|fused together]] resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal ([[ovotestes]]) and [[Sex-determination system|genetic sex]]. Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the [[SRY]] from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during [[meiosis]]. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of [[testes]] in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of [[SOX9]], and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of [[ovarian]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s).

Generally one anemone contains a 'harem', consisting of a large female, a smaller reproductive male, and even smaller non-reproductive males. If the female is removed, the reproductive male will change sex and the largest of the non-reproductive males will mature and become reproductive. It has been shown that fishing pressure can change when the switch from male to female occurs, since fishermen usually prefer to catch the larger fish. The populations are generally changing sex at a smaller size, due to [[natural selection]].\n* '''Protogyny''': Where the organism is born as a female, and then changes sex to a male.<ref name=barrows/>\n** Example: [[wrasse]]s (Family [[Labridae]]) are a group of reef fish in which protogyny is common. Wrasses also have an uncommon life history strategy, which is termed diandry (literally, two males). In these species, two male morphs exists: an initial phase male and a terminal phase male. Initial phase males do not look like males and spawn in groups with other females. They are not territorial. They are, perhaps, female mimics (which is why they are found swimming in group with other females). Terminal phase males are territorial and have a distinctively bright coloration. Individuals are born as males or females, but if they are born males, they are not born as terminal phase males. Females and initial phase males can become terminal phase males. Usually, the most dominant female or initial phase male replaces any terminal phase male when those males die or abandon the group.\n*'''Bidirectional Sex Changers''': where an organism has female and male reproductive organs, but act as either female or male during different stages in life.<ref name=barrows/>\n**Example: [[Lythrypnus dalli]] (Family [[Lythrypnus]]) are a group of [[coral reef fish]] in which bidirectional sex change occurs. Once a social hierarchy is established a fish changes sex according to its social status, regardless of the initial sex, based on a simple principle: if the fish expresses subordinate behavior then it changes its sex to female, and if the fish expresses dominant or not subordinate behavior then the fish changes its sex to male.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rodgers|first=E.W.|author2=Early, R.L. |author3=Grober, M.S. |title=Social status determines sexual phenotype in the bi-directional sex changing bluebanded goby Lythrypnus dalli|journal=J Fish Biol|year=2007|volume=70|issue=6|pages=1660\u20131668|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01427.x}}</ref>\nDichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, [[grouper]]s are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often [[aquacultured]]. Since the adults take several years to change from female to male, the [[broodstock]] are extremely valuable individuals.\n\n===Simultaneous hermaphrodites===<!-- This section is linked from [[Gnathostomulid]] -->\n<!--\"Simultaneous hermaphrodite\" redirects here -->\n[[File:Mating Pseudobiceros bedfordi.png|thumb|[[Turbellaria]]ns mating by [[penis fencing]].

Sexual material is exchanged between both animals via [[spermatophore]], which can then be stored in the [[spermatheca]]. After exchange of [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], both animals will lay fertilized eggs after a period of gestation; then the eggs will proceed to hatch after a development period. Snails typically reproduce in early spring and late autumn.\n*[[:Banana slug]]s are one example of a hermaphroditic gastropod. Mating with a partner is more desirable biologically, as the genetic material of the resultant offspring is varied, but if mating with a partner is not possible, self-fertilization is practiced. The male sexual organ of an adult banana slug is quite large in proportion to its size, as well as compared to the female organ. It is possible for banana slugs, while mating, to become stuck together. If a substantial amount of wiggling fails to separate them, the male organ will be bitten off (using the slug's [[radula]]), see [[apophallation]]. If a banana slug has lost its male sexual organ, it can still mate as a female, making its hermaphroditic quality a valuable adaptation.\n* The species of colourful [[sea slugs]] ''[[Goniobranchus reticulatus]]'' is hermaphroditic, with both male and female organs active at the same time during copulation.  After mating, the external portion of the penis detaches, but is able to regrow within 24 hours.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21431678 | title = Sea slug's 'disposable penis' surprises | author = Rebecca Morelle | date = 12 February 2013 | work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2012.1150 | title = Disposable penis and its replenishment in a simultaneous hermaphrodite | year = 2013 | last1 = Sekizawa | first1 = A. | last2 = Seki | first2 = S. | last3 = Tokuzato | first3 = M. | last4 = Shiga | first4 = S. | last5 = Nakashima | first5 = Y. | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 20121150 | pmid=23407499 | pmc=3639767}}</ref>\n* [[Hamlet (fish)|Hamlets]], unlike other fish, seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self-fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights.\n* [[Earthworm]]s are another example of a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Although they possess ovaries and testes, they have a protective mechanism against self-fertilization. Sexual reproduction occurs when two worms meet and exchange [[gamete]]s, copulating on damp nights during warm seasons. Fertilized eggs are protected by a cocoon, which is buried on or near the surface of the ground.\n* The free-living hermaphroditic nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of approximately 1%.<ref name=\"pmid16005289\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Barri\u00e8re A, F\u00e9lix MA|title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

One possible pathophysiologic explanation of intersex in humans is a [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an [[X chromosome|X]] chromosome and the other carrying a [[Y chromosome|Y]] chromosome), the two [[zygote|fertilized ova]] are then [[Chimera (genetics)|fused together]] resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal ([[ovotestes]]) and [[Sex-determination system|genetic sex]]. Another common cause of being intersex is the crossing over of the [[SRY]] from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during [[meiosis]]. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of [[testes]] in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of [[SOX9]], and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of [[ovarian]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s). Thus, [[testicular]] and ovarian tissues will both be present in the same individual.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Margarit | first1 = E. \n| last2 = Coll | first2 = M.

This condition is seen in many common garden plants. A closer analogy to hermaphroditism in botany is the presence of separate male and female flowers on the same individual\u2014such plants are called [[monoecious]].

It was the first of his self-styled pi\u00e8ces grin\u00e7antes - i.e., 'grating' black comedies.\n\n==Plot==\n\nSet in 1912 \"or thereabouts\", the play concerns a family conference convened by the ageing General L\u00e9on Saint-P\u00e9 to discuss a romance entered into by his hunchbacked sister Ard\u00e8le. His other sister Liliane, a Countess, is accompanied by her husband Gaston (the Count) and her lover, Hector de Villardieu. All of them, especially the Countess, are scandalised by Ard\u00e8le's supposedly inappropriate passion for a fellow hunchback who has been engaged as tutor to the General's small son, Toto.\n\nTheir self-interested entreaties to her are communicated through her bedroom door, behind which she has locked herself and embarked on a three-day hunger-strike. The action culminates with the General's insane and apparently bed-ridden wife, Am\u00e9lie, erupting from her room at dead of night while Ard\u00e8le and her lover (neither of whom is ever properly seen) take drastic action.<ref>Jean Anouilh, ''Ard\u00e8le: A Play in Three Acts'', trans Lucienne Hill, Methuen & Co Ltd 1951</ref>\n\nOther characters include Nathalie, the General's daughter in law; Nicolas, his middle son; Marie-Christine, the Countess' ten-year-old daughter, and Ada, the General's maid/mistress.\n\n==French productions==\n\n''Ard\u00e8le'' was first presented in Paris at the [[Com\u00e9die des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 4 November 1948; directed by [[Roland Pi\u00e9tri]] and designed by Jean-Denis Malcl\u00e8s, it starred Marcel P\u00e9r\u00e8s as the General, Mary Morgan as the Countess and [[Jacques Castelot]] as the Count. (Because it was a relatively short play by Anouilh's standards, it was staged with a brief 'curtain-raiser' in the form of Anouilh's semi-autobiographical vignette ''Episode de la vie d'un auteur''.)<ref>http://www.regietheatrale.com/index/index/programmes/programmes.php?recordID=103&Ard%E8le%20ou%20la%20Marguerite-ANOUILH-1948</ref> Anouilh later developed the characters of the General and his wife in ''La Valse des tor\u00e9adors'' (''[[The Waltz of the Toreadors]]''), which opened at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-Elys\u00e9es in January 1952.<ref>http://www.regietheatrale.com/index/index/programmes/programmes.php?recordID=133&La Valse des Tor\u00e9adors-ANOUILH-1952</ref> Paris revivals of ''Ard\u00e8le'' itself followed in 1958, 1979 and 1998.
