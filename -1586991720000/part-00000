By the time of Classical Greek, this system was maintained largely in independent instances of the non-indicative moods and in the nonfinite forms.  But in the indicative, and in dependent clauses with the subjunctive and optative, the aspects took on temporal significance.  In this manner, the aorist was often used as an unmarked past tense, and the perfect came to develop a [[resultative]] use,<ref>{{cite book |last=Teffeteller |year=2006 |chapter=Ancient Greek |title=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics |edition=2nd |isbn=0-08-044299-4 }}</ref> which is why the term [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] is used for this meaning in modern languages. \n\nOther Indo-European languages lost the aorist entirely.

The  aorist indicative is also used to express things that happen in general, without asserting a time (the \"gnomic aorist\").  It can also be used of present and future<ref>Herbert Weir Smyth, ''Greek Grammar'', sect. 1934, citing Euripides, ''Alcestis'', 386 \"I am destroyed (aorist indicative) if you will leave me\".</ref> events; the aorist also has several specialized senses meaning present action.\n\nNon-indicative forms of the aorist (subjunctives, optatives, imperatives, infinitives) are usually purely aspectual, with certain exceptions including [[indirect speech]] constructions and the use of optative as part of the [[Sequence_of_tenses#Greek|sequence of tenses]] in dependent clauses.  There are aorist infinitives and imperatives that do not imply temporality at all.  For example, the [[Lord's Prayer]] in Matthew 6:11 uses the aorist imperative in \"'''Give''' (\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2 ''d\u00f3s'') us ''this day'' our daily bread\",<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%206:11&version=KJV Matthew 6:11, KJV].

Some of the disagreement applies to the history of the development of the various functions and forms. Most grammarians differentiate the aorist indicative from the non-indicative aorists.

The aorist has often been interpreted as making a strong statement about the aspect or even the time of an event, when, in fact, due to its being the [[markedness|unmarked]] (default) form of the Greek verb, such implications are often left to context. Thus, within New Testament [[hermeneutics]], it is considered an [[exegesis|exegetical]] [[fallacy]] to attach undue significance to uses of the aorist.<ref name=\"ExFal\"/> Although one may draw specific implications from an author's use of the imperfective or perfect, no such conclusions can, in general, be drawn from the use of the aorist, which may refer to an action \"without specifying whether the action is unique, repeated, ingressive, instantaneous, past, or accomplished.\"<ref name=\"ExFal\">[[D.

It retains its function entirely in the [[Eastern South Slavic]] languages, [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. However, in [[Western South Slavic]] languages it has become, along with the [[imperfect]] and [[pluperfect]], largely obsolete in daily parlance and mostly superseded by the [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[circumlocution]]. The aorist is part of the [[standard languages|standardized varieties]] of [[Serbo-Croatian]]; however it is no longer part of Standard [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. In both languages, the aorist appears mostly in older literature, scripture, religious services and legislation, and so carries an archaic tone; as such its use can be construed as pretentious and bombastic. Its use does not cause ambiguity as Slavic verbs have distinct [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|grammatical aspects]] which convey related yet distinct meanings.\n\nAorist was the most used past tense in Serbia until the [[communist]]s' rise to power in 1945, when its usage became stigmatized and excluded from official use.<ref>Aco Nevski, [http://nevgen.org/Past_Tenses_in_Serbian_Language.html 'Past Tenses in Serbian language and modern trends of their use']</ref> Even so, it is still widespread in rural areas of Serbia, especially among older and less educated part of population.<ref>\u0410\u0446\u043e \u041d\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438, [https://www.poreklo.rs/2018/06/04/aorist-kao-psovka/ '\u0410\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043e \u043f\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430'] (Serbian only)</ref> Aorist is used for witnessed actions in past, mostly with verbs of perfective aspect.\n\nIn modern forms of communication, the aorist has experienced something of a revival among younger speakers of Serbo-Croatian, as its forms are simpler and shorter to type out than the perfect.<ref>Dr Branko To\u0161ovi\u0107, ''[http://www.maticasrpska.org.rs/casopisi/slavistiku_71-72.pdf Zbornik Matice srpske za slavistiku, knjiga 71-72] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315164610/http://www.maticasrpska.org.rs/casopisi/slavistiku_71-72.pdf |date=March 15, 2012 }}'' (Serbian only)</ref>\n\nIn Bulgarian, which has produced a new regular formation, the aorist is used in [[indirect speech|indirect]] and presumptive quotations.<ref>''The Slavonic languages'' ed.

By the time of Classical Greek, this system was maintained largely in independent instances of the non-indicative moods and in the nonfinite forms.  But in the indicative, and in dependent clauses with the subjunctive and optative, the aspects took on temporal significance.

The  aorist indicative is also used to express things that happen in general, without asserting a time (the \"gnomic aorist\").  It can also be used of present and future<ref>Herbert Weir Smyth, ''Greek Grammar'', sect. 1934, citing Euripides, ''Alcestis'', 386 \"I am destroyed (aorist indicative) if you will leave me\".</ref> events; the aorist also has several specialized senses meaning present action.\n\nNon-indicative forms of the aorist (subjunctives, optatives, imperatives, infinitives) are usually purely aspectual, with certain exceptions including [[indirect speech]] constructions and the use of optative as part of the [[Sequence_of_tenses#Greek|sequence of tenses]] in dependent clauses.  There are aorist infinitives and imperatives that do not imply temporality at all.

Some of the disagreement applies to the history of the development of the various functions and forms. Most grammarians differentiate the aorist indicative from the non-indicative aorists.

The aorist has often been interpreted as making a strong statement about the aspect or even the time of an event, when, in fact, due to its being the [[markedness|unmarked]] (default) form of the Greek verb, such implications are often left to context. Thus, within New Testament [[hermeneutics]], it is considered an [[exegesis|exegetical]] [[fallacy]] to attach undue significance to uses of the aorist.<ref name=\"ExFal\"/> Although one may draw specific implications from an author's use of the imperfective or perfect, no such conclusions can, in general, be drawn from the use of the aorist, which may refer to an action \"without specifying whether the action is unique, repeated, ingressive, instantaneous, past, or accomplished.\"<ref name=\"ExFal\">[[D.

The central section, some 2&nbsp;km in length, is very rocky and the route along it requires [[scrambling]] ability. The slopes to each side are extremely dangerous, with steep grass and scree slopes hiding even steeper slopes which end in cliffs on both north and south sides of the ridge.\n\nThe Aonach Eagach is usually regarded as the most difficult horizontal 'scrambling' ridge in mainland [[Scotland]], though it vies with [[Liathach]] (and, in winter, [[An Teallach]]) for this title. In his book \"Scrambles in Lochaber\", local climber Noel Williams warns that there are no other ridges in the area that are \"so narrow and so difficult to escape from once committed. Some sections are extremely exposed. This makes it a difficult outing to grade, because the technical difficulties are not great\".<ref name=williams1996p88>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Noel|title=Scrambles in Lochaber|year=1996|publisher=Cicerone Press Ltd|location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria, UK|isbn=978-1-85284-234-5|page=88}}</ref> Williams settled on grade 2, implying it is easier than the (optional) grade 2/3 approach scramble up A'Chailleach, but added a further warning (in bold type) that \"there are no safe descents on the south side of the ridge\".<ref name=williams1996p90>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Noel|title=Scrambles in Lochaber|year=1996|publisher=Cicerone Press Ltd|location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria, UK|isbn=978-1-85284-234-5|page=90}}</ref>\n\n==Traverse of the ridge==\n\nThe Aonach Eagach is normally tackled from the Glen Coe (south) side in an east\u2013west traverse. The best parking for this scrambling route is located just off the A82 at grid reference NN 17333 56746.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aonach Eagach Scramble |url=https://www.ukscrambles.com/scotland-scrambles/aonach-eagach/ |website=UK Scrambles |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref> From Allt-na-reigh near the head of Glen Coe a good path ascends Am Bodach (a subsidiary [[Munro]] top) and continues westwards along the ridge to the first Munro proper, [[Meall Dearg (Aonach Eagach)|Meall Dearg]].\n\nFrom here the summit of Sgorr nam Fiannaidh lies only two kilometres to the west, but a number of pinnacles must be scrambled over, and it is not uncommon for parties to take more than two hours to cross this short distance. There are a couple of sections where the use of a [[rope]] may prove prudent.\n\nIn winter, the ridge is a fine expedition, though considerably harder than in summer ([[Scottish winter grade|Scottish Winter Grade]] I/II), and many parties will go roped for some sections. Because of the short winter days, benightment on the ridge or its approaches is also not infrequent.\n\n===Descent===\n\nCompetent summer scramblers have plenty of time to reverse the ridge and descend Am Bodach, saving a walk back up the glen.<ref name=\"williams1996p90\"/>\n\nFrom Sgorr nam Fiannaidh, the most direct descent is to head south by southwest, down a steep zig-zag [[Trail|path]] leading by the side of Clachaig [[gully]]. This 'path' is exceptionally steep and extremely loose in places, and has many small rock steps; it approaches close to the main gully in several places and so is potentially dangerous (fatal accidents have occurred here). A gentler alternative is to continue along the ridge, until reaching the [[Mountain pass|bealach]] between Sgorr nam Fiannaidh and the [[Pap of Glencoe]]. From here a track heads down the hillside, ending on the road just outside [[Glencoe, Scotland|Glencoe village]]. It is also possible to retreat approximately 200m  east from the summit of Sgorr nam Fiannaidh and descend directly down the scree slope to Loch Achtriochtan, taking care to avoid being drawn into gullies further down. This descent also requires care, particularly near the top, but is still far safer than the Clachaig Gully descent.\n\nAlternatively, the two Munros may be climbed individually by simply descending by the route of ascent. However it is for the [[Traverse (climbing)|traverse]] that the Aonach Eagach is best known.\n\n==Devil's Staircase==\n[[Image:West Highland Way 2005 Coe.jpg|Looking south from the summit of the Devil's Staircase towards [[Buachaille Etive M\u00f2r]], with [[Creise]] and [[Meall a' Bhuiridh]] beyond|thumb|right|300px]]\nA path known as the '''Devil's Staircase''' crosses the range about 6&nbsp;km east of Meall Dearg.

The central section, some 2&nbsp;km in length, is very rocky and the route along it requires [[scrambling]] ability. The slopes to each side are extremely dangerous, with steep grass and scree slopes hiding even steeper slopes which end in cliffs on both north and south sides of the ridge.\n\nThe Aonach Eagach is usually regarded as the most difficult horizontal 'scrambling' ridge in mainland [[Scotland]], though it vies with [[Liathach]] (and, in winter, [[An Teallach]]) for this title. In his book \"Scrambles in Lochaber\", local climber Noel Williams warns that there are no other ridges in the area that are \"so narrow and so difficult to escape from once committed. Some sections are extremely exposed. This makes it a difficult outing to grade, because the technical difficulties are not great\".<ref name=williams1996p88>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Noel|title=Scrambles in Lochaber|year=1996|publisher=Cicerone Press Ltd|location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria, UK|isbn=978-1-85284-234-5|page=88}}</ref> Williams settled on grade 2, implying it is easier than the (optional) grade 2/3 approach scramble up A'Chailleach, but added a further warning (in bold type) that \"there are no safe descents on the south side of the ridge\".<ref name=williams1996p90>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Noel|title=Scrambles in Lochaber|year=1996|publisher=Cicerone Press Ltd|location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria, UK|isbn=978-1-85284-234-5|page=90}}</ref>\n\n==Traverse of the ridge==\n\nThe Aonach Eagach is normally tackled from the Glen Coe (south) side in an east\u2013west traverse. The best parking for this scrambling route is located just off the A82 at grid reference NN 17333 56746<ref>{{cite web |title=Aonach Eagach Scramble |url=https://www.ukscrambles.com/scotland-scrambles/aonach-eagach/ |website=UK Scrambles |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>. From Allt-na-reigh near the head of Glen Coe a good path ascends Am Bodach (a subsidiary [[Munro]] top) and continues westwards along the ridge to the first Munro proper, [[Meall Dearg (Aonach Eagach)|Meall Dearg]].\n\nFrom here the summit of Sgorr nam Fiannaidh lies only two kilometres to the west, but a number of pinnacles must be scrambled over, and it is not uncommon for parties to take more than two hours to cross this short distance. There are a couple of sections where the use of a [[rope]] may prove prudent.\n\nIn winter, the ridge is a fine expedition, though considerably harder than in summer ([[Scottish winter grade|Scottish Winter Grade]] I/II), and many parties will go roped for some sections. Because of the short winter days, benightment on the ridge or its approaches is also not infrequent.\n\n===Descent===\n\nCompetent summer scramblers have plenty of time to reverse the ridge and descend Am Bodach, saving a walk back up the glen.<ref name=\"williams1996p90\"/>\n\nFrom Sgorr nam Fiannaidh, the most direct descent is to head south by southwest, down a steep zig-zag [[Trail|path]] leading by the side of Clachaig [[gully]]. This 'path' is exceptionally steep and extremely loose in places, and has many small rock steps; it approaches close to the main gully in several places and so is potentially dangerous (fatal accidents have occurred here). A gentler alternative is to continue along the ridge, until reaching the [[Mountain pass|bealach]] between Sgorr nam Fiannaidh and the [[Pap of Glencoe]]. From here a track heads down the hillside, ending on the road just outside [[Glencoe, Scotland|Glencoe village]]. It is also possible to retreat approximately 200m  east from the summit of Sgorr nam Fiannaidh and descend directly down the scree slope to Loch Achtriochtan, taking care to avoid being drawn into gullies further down. This descent also requires care, particularly near the top, but is still far safer than the Clachaig Gully descent.\n\nAlternatively, the two Munros may be climbed individually by simply descending by the route of ascent. However it is for the [[Traverse (climbing)|traverse]] that the Aonach Eagach is best known.\n\n==Devil's Staircase==\n[[Image:West Highland Way 2005 Coe.jpg|Looking south from the summit of the Devil's Staircase towards [[Buachaille Etive M\u00f2r]], with [[Creise]] and [[Meall a' Bhuiridh]] beyond|thumb|right|300px]]\nA path known as the '''Devil's Staircase''' crosses the range about 6&nbsp;km east of Meall Dearg.
