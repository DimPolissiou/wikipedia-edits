[[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] secular buildings in [[Great Britain|Britain]] were generally simple, constructed mainly using [[timber]] with [[thatch]] for roofing. No universally accepted example survives above ground.\n\nThere are, however, many remains of Anglo-Saxon church architecture. At least fifty churches are of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] origin with major Anglo-Saxon architectural features, with many more claiming to be, although in some cases the Anglo-Saxon part is small and much-altered. It is often impossible to reliably distinguish between pre- and post-Conquest 11th century work in buildings where most parts are later additions or alterations. The [[round-tower church]] and [[tower-nave church]] are distinctive Anglo-Saxon types.  All surviving churches, except [[Greensted Church|one timber church]], are built of stone or brick, and in some cases show evidence of re-used [[Roman architecture|Roman]] work.\n\nThe architectural character of Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical buildings range from Celtic influenced architecture in the early period; [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] [[basilica]] influenced architecture; and in the later Anglo-Saxon period, an architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings.  In the last decades of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom a more general [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style was introduced from the Continent, as in the now built-over additions to [[Westminster Abbey]] made from 1050 onwards, already influenced by [[Norman architecture|Norman style]].  In recent decades architectural historians have become less confident that all undocumented minor \"Romanesque\" features post-date the [[Norman Conquest]].  Although once common, it has been incorrect for several decades to use the plain term \"Saxon\" for anything Anglo-Saxon that is later than the initial period of settlement in Britain.\n\nEarly Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers or sited to serve as ports. In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth.<ref>[[History of York|York]] and [[History of London|London]] both offer examples of this trend.</ref>\n\n==Houses and other secular buildings==\n[[File:Saxon palace at Cheddar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Reconstruction of the Anglo-Saxon royal palace at Cheddar around 1000]]\nAnglo-Saxon secular buildings were normally rectangular post built structures, where timber posts were driven into the ground to form the framework of the walls upon which the thatched roofs were constructed.  Only ten of the hundreds of settlement sites that have been excavated in England from this period have revealed masonry domestic structures and confined to a few quite specific contexts. The usual explanation for the tendency of Anglo\u2013Saxons to build in timber is one of technological inferiority or incompetence. However it is now accepted that technology and materials were part of conscious choices indivisible from their social meaning. Le Goff, suggests<ref>Le Goff, J. (1988), Medieval Civilization 400\u20131500 (Oxford: Blackwell):203</ref> that the Anglo-Saxon period was defined by its use of wood, providing evidence for the care and craftsmanship that the Anglo\u2013Saxon invested into their wooden material culture, from cups to halls, and the concern for trees and timber in Anglo\u2013Saxon place\u2013names, literature and religion.<ref>Bintley, Michael DJ, and Michael G. Shapland, eds. Trees and Timber in the Anglo-Saxon World. Oxford University Press, 2013</ref> Michael Shapland suggests:\n\n{{quote|The stone buildings imposed on England by the Romans would have been 'startling' and 'exceptional', and following the collapse of Roman society in the fifth century there was a widespread return to timber building, a 'cultural shift' that it is not possible to explain by recourse to technological determinism.<ref>Shapland, Michael G. \"Meanings of Timber and Stone in Anglo-Saxon Building Practice.\" Trees and Timber in the Anglo-Saxon World (2013): 21.</ref>}}\n\nAnglo\u2013Saxon building forms were very much part of this general building tradition. Timber was 'the natural building medium of the age':<ref>Turner, H. L. (1970), Town Defences in England and Wales: An Architectural and Documentary Study A. D. 900\u20131500 (London: John Baker)</ref> the very Anglo\u2013Saxon word for 'building' is 'timbe'. Unlike in the Carolingian world, late Anglo\u2013Saxon royal halls continued to be of timber in the manner of Yeavering centuries before, even though the king could clearly have mustered the resources to build in stone.<ref>Higham, R. and Barker, P. (1992), Timber Castles (London: B. T. Batsford):193</ref> Their preference must have been a conscious choice, perhaps an expression of 'deeply\u2013embedded Germanic identity' on the part of the Anglo\u2013Saxon royalty.\n\nThough very little contemporary evidence survives, methods of construction, including examples of later buildings, can be compared with methods on the continent.  The major rural buildings were sunken-floor (''Grubenh\u00e4user'') or post-hole buildings, although Helena Hamerow suggest this distinction is less clear.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. Early medieval settlements: the archaeology of rural communities in Northwest Europe, 400\u2013900. Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref>  An excavated example is at [[Mucking excavation|Mucking]]. In addition to the sunken huts, vernacular buildings from the migration period found at Mucking included more substantial halls up to {{convert|50 |ft|m}} long and {{convert|25 |ft|m}} wide with entrances in the middle of both longer sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/heritage/content.php?page=factfiles_details&id=3|title=Thurrock Heritage factfile|website=thurrock.gov.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608220243/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/heritage/content.php?page=factfiles_details&id=3|archive-date=8 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEven the elite had simple buildings, with a central fire and a hole in the roof to let the smoke escape and the largest of which rarely had more than one floor, and one room. Buildings vary widely in size, most were square or rectangular, though some round houses have been found. Frequently these buildings have sunken floors; a shallow pit over which a plank floor was suspended. The pit may have been used for storage, but more likely was filled with straw for winter insulation. A variation on the sunken floor design is found in towns, where the \"basement\" may be as deep as 9 feet, suggesting a storage or work area below a suspended floor. Another common design was simple post framing, with heavy posts set directly into the ground, supporting the roof. The space between the posts was filled in with wattle and daub, or occasionally, planks. The floors were generally packed earth, though planks were sometimes used. Roofing materials varied, with thatch being the most common, though turf and even wooden shingles were also used.<ref>Hamerow</ref>\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries, fortifications ([[burh]]s) were constructed around towns to defend against Viking attacks. Almost no secular work remains above ground, although the [[Anglian Tower, York|Anglian Tower]] in York has been controversially dated to the seventh century. Recent evidence opens up the possibility that St George's Tower, Oxford, may be a surviving part of the defenses surrounding the Anglo-Saxon burh of Oxford.<ref name=\":0\" />   There is a reconstruction of an Anglo-Saxon settlement at [[West Stow#On exhibit at West Stow Anglo - Saxon Village|West Stow]], and contemporary illustrations of both secular and religious buildings are sometimes found in [[illuminated manuscript]]s.\n\n== Church architecture: historical context ==\nThe fall of [[Roman Britain]] at the beginning of the fifth century, according to [[Bede]], allowed an influx of invaders from northern Germany including the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]].\n[[File:Original Brixworth Plan.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed basilican plan of Brixworth church]]\nThe [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]] had [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|their own religion]], but [[Christianity]] was on its way. [[Saint Patrick|St Patrick]], a Romano-British man, converted [[Ireland]] to [[Christianity]], from where much of Western Scotland was converted and much of [[Northumbria]] was reconverted. Links were also established between the Christian communities in Ireland and those in [[Wales]] and the [[Dumnonia|West country]] at sites such as [[Perranzabuloe|St Piran's Oratory]] which represents some of the earliest Christian architecture extant on the British mainland. The architecture though was initially influenced by [[Coptic monasticism]].<ref>Pevsner, N. (1963) ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Harmondsworth</ref>\n \nExamples of this can be seen today in the  form of rectangular dry-stone [[corbelled]] structures such as at [[Gallarus Oratory]], [[Dingle]] and [[Castlegregory|Illauntannig]], [[Ireland]]. Christianity and Irish influence came to [[England]] through missionaries. In 635, a centre of [[Celtic Christianity]] was established at [[Lindisfarne]], [[Northumbria]], where [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|St Aidan]] founded a [[monastery]].\n\nIn 597, the mission of [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] from [[Rome]] came to [[England]] to convert the southern Anglo-Saxons, and founded the first [[cathedral]] and a [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] at [[Canterbury]]. These churches consisted of a [[nave]] with side chambers.\n\nIn 664 a [[Synod of Whitby|synod]] was held at [[Whitby]], Yorkshire, and leaders of both the [[Celtic Church|Celtic]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]] united the church throughout England. Larger churches developed in the form of [[basilica]]s, for example at [[Brixworth]].\n\nThe [[Britons (Celtic people)|Romano-British]] populations of [[History of Wales|Wales]], [[Dumnonia|the Westcountry]], and [[Cumbria]] experienced a degree of autonomy from Anglo-Saxon influence,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/explore/dark-ages/architecture/|title=- English Heritage|author=|date=|website=www.english-heritage.org.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> represented by distinct linguistic, liturgical and architectural traditions, having much in common with the [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Breton people|Breton]] cultures across the [[Celtic Sea]], and allying themselves with the [[Viking]] invaders. This was however, gradually elided by centuries of English dominance. Characteristically circular buildings<ref name=\"auto\">Medieval Devon & Cornwall; Shaping an Ancient Countryside, Ed.

Buildings including [[cathedrals]] were rebuilt, and the threat of conflict had an inevitable influence on the architecture of the time. During and after the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] (871-899), Anglo-Saxon towns ([[burh]]s) were fortified. Contemporary defensive banks and ditches can still be seen today as a result of this. [[Oxford]] is an example of one of these fortified towns, where the eleventh century stone tower of [[St Michael at the Northgate|St. Michael's church]] has prominent position beside the former site of the North gate. The building of church towers, replacing the [[basilica]]n [[narthex]] or West porch, can be attributed to this late period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] architecture.\n\n== 7th century ==\nIn contrast to secular buildings, stone was used from very early on to build churches, although a single wooden example has survived at [[Greensted Church]], which is now thought to be from the end of the period. Bede makes it clear in both his Ecclesiastical History and his Historiam Abbatum that the masonry construction of churches, including his own at Jarrow, was undertaken ''morem Romanorum'', \"in the manner of the Romans\", in explicit contrast to existing traditions of timber construction. Even at Canterbury, Bede believed that St Augustine's first cathedral had been 'repaired' or 'recovered' (recuperavit) from an existing Roman church, when in fact it had been newly constructed from Roman materials. The belief was \"the Christian Church was Roman therefore a masonry church was a Roman building\".\n\nThe earliest surviving Anglo-Saxon architecture dates from the 7th century, essentially beginning with [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in Kent from 597; for this he probably imported workmen from [[Francia|Frankish Gaul]].  The [[Canterbury Cathedral|cathedral and abbey in Canterbury]], together with churches in Kent at [[Minster, Swale|Minster in Sheppey]] (c.664) and [[St Mary's Church, Reculver|Reculver]] (669), and in Essex at the [[Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall]] at [[Bradwell-on-Sea]] (where only the nave survives), define the earliest type in southeast England. A simple [[nave]] without [[aisle]]s provided the setting for the main altar; east of this a chancel arch, perhaps a triple arch opening as at Reculver, separated off the [[apse]] for use by the clergy. However there is no surviving complete 7th-century church with an [[apse]].  Flanking the apse and east end of the nave were side chambers serving as sacristies; further [[porticus]] might continue along the nave to provide for burials and other purposes. Exceptions to this include the Old Minster, Winchester. \n\nChurch designs at the time differed between the [[North of England]], which are narrow with square ended chancels, rather than the apses of the south.  In Northumbria the early development of Christianity was influenced by the Irish mission, important churches being built in timber. Masonry churches became prominent from the late 7th century with the foundations of [[Wilfrid]] at [[Ripon]] and [[Hexham]], and of [[Benedict Biscop]] at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow. These buildings had long naves and small rectangular chancels; porticus sometimes surrounded the naves. Elaborate crypts are a feature of Wilfrid's buildings. The best preserved early Northumbrian church is [[Escomb Church]].<ref name=\"Wilkinson, David John 1964\">Wilkinson, David John, and Alan McWhirr.

A number of early Anglo-Saxon churches are based on a basilica with north and south ''[[porticus]]'' (projecting chambers) to give a cruciform plan. However cruciform plans for churches were used in other periods. Similarly, a chancel in the form of a rounded apse is often found in early Anglo-Saxon churches, but can be found in other periods as well.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Quoins at Stow, Lincolnshire.jpg|Quoin stones in the south transept of [[Stow Minster]], Lincolnshire\nFile:St Mary's Deerhurst - geograph.org.uk - 1733000.jpg|Double triangular windows at St. Mary's, Deerhurst\nImage:Corringham-detail.JPG|Herringbone stonework at [[Corringham, Essex]] parish church\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Anglo-Saxons#Architecture]]\n*[[History of Anglo-Saxon England]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation | editor1-last =Hamerow | editor1-first = Helena| editor2-last =Hinton | editor2-first =David A.| editor3-last =Crawford | editor3-first =Sally|year=2011|title=The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology. |publisher=OUP |publication-date=2011 |location=Oxford |isbn = 978-0-19-921214-9}}\n*[[Wikisource:Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'']]\n* Clapham, A.

The usual explanation for the tendency of Anglo\u2013Saxons to build in timber is one of technological inferiority or incompetence. However it is now accepted that technology and materials were part of conscious choices indivisible from their social meaning. Le Goff, suggests<ref>Le Goff, J. (1988), Medieval Civilization 400\u20131500 (Oxford: Blackwell):203</ref> that the Anglo-Saxon period was defined by its use of wood, providing evidence for the care and craftsmanship that the Anglo\u2013Saxon invested into their wooden material culture, from cups to halls, and the concern for trees and timber in Anglo\u2013Saxon place\u2013names, literature and religion.<ref>Bintley, Michael DJ, and Michael G. Shapland, eds. Trees and Timber in the Anglo-Saxon World. Oxford University Press, 2013</ref> Michael Shapland suggests:\n\n{{quote|The stone buildings imposed on England by the Romans would have been 'startling' and 'exceptional', and following the collapse of Roman society in the fifth century there was a widespread return to timber building, a 'cultural shift' that it is not possible to explain by recourse to technological determinism.<ref>Shapland, Michael G. \"Meanings of Timber and Stone in Anglo-Saxon Building Practice.\" Trees and Timber in the Anglo-Saxon World (2013): 21.</ref>}}\n\nAnglo\u2013Saxon building forms were very much part of this general building tradition. Timber was 'the natural building medium of the age':<ref>Turner, H. L. (1970), Town Defences in England and Wales: An Architectural and Documentary Study A. D. 900\u20131500 (London: John Baker)</ref> the very Anglo\u2013Saxon word for 'building' is 'timbe'. Unlike in the Carolingian world, late Anglo\u2013Saxon royal halls continued to be of timber in the manner of Yeavering centuries before, even though the king could clearly have mustered the resources to build in stone.<ref>Higham, R. and Barker, P. (1992), Timber Castles (London: B. T. Batsford):193</ref> Their preference must have been a conscious choice, perhaps an expression of 'deeply\u2013embedded Germanic identity' on the part of the Anglo\u2013Saxon royalty.\n\nThough very little contemporary evidence survives, methods of construction, including examples of later buildings, can be compared with methods on the continent.  The major rural buildings were sunken-floor (''Grubenh\u00e4user'') or post-hole buildings, although Helena Hamerow suggest this distinction is less clear.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. Early medieval settlements: the archaeology of rural communities in Northwest Europe, 400\u2013900. Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref>  An excavated example is at [[Mucking excavation|Mucking]]. In addition to the sunken huts, vernacular buildings from the migration period found at Mucking included more substantial halls up to {{convert|50 |ft|m}} long and {{convert|25 |ft|m}} wide with entrances in the middle of both longer sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/heritage/content.php?page=factfiles_details&id=3|title=Thurrock Heritage factfile|website=thurrock.gov.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608220243/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/heritage/content.php?page=factfiles_details&id=3|archive-date=8 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEven the elite had simple buildings, with a central fire and a hole in the roof to let the smoke escape and the largest of which rarely had more than one floor, and one room. Buildings vary widely in size, most were square or rectangular, though some round houses have been found. Frequently these buildings have sunken floors; a shallow pit over which a plank floor was suspended. The pit may have been used for storage, but more likely was filled with straw for winter insulation. A variation on the sunken floor design is found in towns, where the \"basement\" may be as deep as 9 feet, suggesting a storage or work area below a suspended floor. Another common design was simple post framing, with heavy posts set directly into the ground, supporting the roof. The space between the posts was filled in with wattle and daub, or occasionally, planks. The floors were generally packed earth, though planks were sometimes used. Roofing materials varied, with thatch being the most common, though turf and even wooden shingles were also used.<ref>Hamerow</ref>\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries, fortifications ([[burh]]s) were constructed around towns to defend against Viking attacks. Almost no secular work remains above ground, although the [[Anglian Tower, York|Anglian Tower]] in York has been controversially dated to the seventh century. Recent evidence opens up the possibility that St George's Tower, Oxford, may be a surviving part of the defenses surrounding the Anglo-Saxon burh of Oxford.<ref name=\":0\" />   There is a reconstruction of an Anglo-Saxon settlement at [[West Stow#On exhibit at West Stow Anglo - Saxon Village|West Stow]], and contemporary illustrations of both secular and religious buildings are sometimes found in [[illuminated manuscript]]s.\n\n== Church architecture: historical context ==\nThe fall of [[Roman Britain]] at the beginning of the fifth century, according to [[Bede]], allowed an influx of invaders from northern Germany including the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]].\n[[File:Original Brixworth Plan.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed basilican plan of Brixworth church]]\nThe [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]] had [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|their own religion]], but [[Christianity]] was on its way. [[Saint Patrick|St Patrick]], a Romano-British man, converted [[Ireland]] to [[Christianity]], from where much of Western Scotland was converted and much of [[Northumbria]] was reconverted. Links were also established between the Christian communities in Ireland and those in [[Wales]] and the [[Dumnonia|West country]] at sites such as [[Perranzabuloe|St Piran's Oratory]] which represents some of the earliest Christian architecture extant on the British mainland. The architecture though was initially influenced by [[Coptic monasticism]].<ref>Pevsner, N. (1963) ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Harmondsworth</ref>\n \nExamples of this can be seen today in the  form of rectangular dry-stone [[corbelled]] structures such as at [[Gallarus Oratory]], [[Dingle]] and [[Castlegregory|Illauntannig]], [[Ireland]]. Christianity and Irish influence came to [[England]] through missionaries. In 635, a centre of [[Celtic Christianity]] was established at [[Lindisfarne]], [[Northumbria]], where [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|St Aidan]] founded a [[monastery]].\n\nIn 597, the mission of [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] from [[Rome]] came to [[England]] to convert the southern Anglo-Saxons, and founded the first [[cathedral]] and a [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] at [[Canterbury]]. These churches consisted of a [[nave]] with side chambers.\n\nIn 664 a [[Synod of Whitby|synod]] was held at [[Whitby]], Yorkshire, and leaders of both the [[Celtic Church|Celtic]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]] united the church throughout England. Larger churches developed in the form of [[basilica]]s, for example at [[Brixworth]].\n\nThe [[Britons (Celtic people)|Romano-British]] populations of [[History of Wales|Wales]], [[Dumnonia|the Westcountry]], and [[Cumbria]] experienced a degree of autonomy from Anglo-Saxon influence,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/explore/dark-ages/architecture/|title=- English Heritage|author=|date=|website=www.english-heritage.org.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> represented by distinct linguistic, liturgical and architectural traditions, having much in common with the [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Breton people|Breton]] cultures across the [[Celtic Sea]], and allying themselves with the [[Viking]] invaders. This was however, gradually elided by centuries of English dominance. Characteristically circular buildings<ref name=\"auto\">Medieval Devon & Cornwall; Shaping an Ancient Countryside, Ed.

Buildings including [[cathedrals]] were rebuilt, and the threat of conflict had an inevitable influence on the architecture of the time. During and after the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] (871-899), Anglo-Saxon towns ([[burh]]s) were fortified. Contemporary defensive banks and ditches can still be seen today as a result of this. [[Oxford]] is an example of one of these fortified towns, where the eleventh century stone tower of [[St Michael at the Northgate|St. Michael's church]] has prominent position beside the former site of the North gate. The building of church towers, replacing the [[basilica]]n [[narthex]] or West porch, can be attributed to this late period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] architecture.\n\n== 7th century ==\nIn contrast to secular buildings, stone was used from very early on to build churches, although a single wooden example has survived at [[Greensted Church]], which is now thought to be from the end of the period. Bede makes it clear in both his Ecclesiastical History and his Historiam Abbatum that the masonry construction of churches, including his own at Jarrow, was undertaken ''morem Romanorum'', \"in the manner of the Romans\", in explicit contrast to existing traditions of timber construction. Even at Canterbury, Bede believed that St Augustine's first cathedral had been 'repaired' or 'recovered' (recuperavit) from an existing Roman church, when in fact it had been newly constructed from Roman materials. The belief was \"the Christian Church was Roman therefore a masonry church was a Roman building\".\n\nThe earliest surviving Anglo-Saxon architecture dates from the 7th century, essentially begining with [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in Kent from 597; for this he probably imported workmen from [[Francia|Frankish Gaul]].  The [[Canterbury Cathedral|cathedral and abbey in Canterbury]], together with churches in Kent at [[Minster, Swale|Minster in Sheppey]] (c.664) and [[St Mary's Church, Reculver|Reculver]] (669), and in Essex at the [[Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall]] at [[Bradwell-on-Sea]] (where only the nave survives), define the earliest type in southeast England. A simple [[nave]] without [[aisle]]s provided the setting for the main altar; east of this a chancel arch, perhaps a triple arch opening as at Reculver, separated off the [[apse]] for use by the clergy. However there is no surviving complete 7th-century church with an [[apse]].  Flanking the apse and east end of the nave were side chambers serving as sacristies; further [[porticus]] might continue along the nave to provide for burials and other purposes. Exceptions to this include the Old Minster, Winchester. \n\nChurch designs at the time differed between the [[North of England]], which are narrow with square ended chancels, rather than the apses of the south.  In Northumbria the early development of Christianity was influenced by the Irish mission, important churches being built in timber. Masonry churches became prominent from the late 7th century with the foundations of [[Wilfrid]] at [[Ripon]] and [[Hexham]], and of [[Benedict Biscop]] at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow. These buildings had long naves and small rectangular chancels; porticus sometimes surrounded the naves. Elaborate crypts are a feature of Wilfrid's buildings. The best preserved early Northumbrian church is [[Escomb Church]].<ref name=\"Wilkinson, David John 1964\">Wilkinson, David John, and Alan McWhirr.

[[Norman people|Norman]] workers may have been imported for Westminster Abbey through the Norman [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]].\n\nRecent arguments and recent archaeological discoveries have raised the possibility that the 11th-century [[St George's Tower]], Oxford, predates both the foundation of [[Oxford Castle]] and the Norman Conquest, and functioned as a gate tower commanding the western entrance into the pre-Conquest burh. If so, the tower was then incorporated into the Norman castle built on the site in the 1070s, instead of being constructed along with it as architectural historians have long assumed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The English Castle|last=Goodall|first=John|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780300110586|location=New Haven and London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/englishcastle1060000good/page/70 70]|url=https://archive.org/details/englishcastle1060000good/page/70}}</ref> It would thus be almost without parallel in England as a purely secular and defensive Anglo-Saxon structure (see below, [[Anglo-Saxon architecture#Secular architecture|Secular architecture]]).\n\n*[[Greensted Church]], [[Essex]] (1013 with oak palisade walls)\n*[[Stow Minster]], [[Lincolnshire]] (''c.'' 1040 with a small part surviving from 975)\n*[[St Bene't's Church]], [[Cambridge]] (''c.'' 1040)\n*[[St Michael at the Northgate]], [[Oxford]] (''c.'' 1040)\n*[[St Nicholas' Church, Worth]], [[West Sussex]] (''c.'' 950 - 1050)\n*[[Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting]], [[West Sussex]] (''c.'' 1050)\n*[[Odda's Chapel]], Deerhurst, Gloucestershire (1056)\n*[[St Matthew's Church, Langford]], [[Oxfordshire]] (formerly [[Berkshire]]) (after 1050)\n*The tower of Holy Trinity Church in [[Colchester]], [[Essex]] has a [[Norman conquest of England|pre-Conquest]] 11th century tower built out of Roman rubble<ref>Crummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Britain's first Roman town.

[[H.M.

Typical Anglo-Saxon features include:<ref>Pamela Cunnington ''How Old is that Church?'' (Marston House, reprinted 2001)</ref>\n* long-and-short [[quoin (architecture)|quoins]]\n* double triangular windows;\n* narrow, round-arched windows (often using Roman tile);\n* herringbone stone work\n* west porch ([[narthex]]).\n\nIt is rare for more than one of these features to be present in the same building. A number of early Anglo-Saxon churches are based on a basilica with north and south ''[[porticus]]'' (projecting chambers) to give a cruciform plan. However cruciform plans for churches were used in other periods. Similarly, a chancel in the form of a rounded apse is often found in early Anglo-Saxon churches, but can be found in other periods as well.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Quoins at Stow, Lincolnshire.jpg|Quoin stones in the south transept of [[Stow Minster]], Lincolnshire\nFile:St Mary's Deerhurst - geograph.org.uk - 1733000.jpg|Double triangular windows at St. Mary's, Deerhurst\nImage:Corringham-detail.JPG|Herringbone stonework at [[Corringham, Essex]] parish church\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Anglo-Saxons#Architecture]]\n*[[History of Anglo-Saxon England]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation | editor1-last =Hamerow | editor1-first = Helena| editor2-last =Hinton | editor2-first =David A.| editor3-last =Crawford | editor3-first =Sally|year=2011|title=The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology. |publisher=OUP |publication-date=2011 |location=Oxford |isbn = 978-0-19-921214-9}}\n*[[Wikisource:Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'']]\n* Clapham, A.

They represented a cheap but effective alternative to the [[portrait miniature]], and skilled specialist artists could cut a high-quality bust portrait, by far the most common style, in a matter of minutes, working purely by eye. Other artists, especially from about 1790, drew an outline on paper, then painted it in, which could be equally quick.\n\nFrom its original graphic meaning, the term ''silhouette'' has been extended to describe the sight or representation of a person, object or scene that is [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlit]], and appears dark against a lighter background. Anything that appears this way, for example, a figure standing backlit in a doorway, may be described as \"in silhouette\". Because a silhouette emphasises the outline, the word has also been used in the fields of [[fashion]] and [[physical fitness|fitness]] to describe the shape of a person's body or the shape created by wearing clothing of a particular style or period.\n\n==Etymology and origins==\nThe word ''silhouette'' is derived from the name of [[\u00c9tienne de Silhouette]], a French [[finance minister]] who, in 1759, was forced by France's credit crisis during the [[Seven Years' War]] to impose severe economic demands upon the French people, particularly the wealthy.<ref>McLynn pp. 64\u201365</ref> Because of de Silhouette's austere economies, his name became synonymous with anything done or made cheaply and so with these outline portraits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Teall|first=Gardner|title=Silhouettes Old and New|journal=House & Garden|date=Aug 1916|volume=30|pages=20}}</ref><ref>There is no mention of de Silhouette making silhouettes in his earliest record in 1834 edition ''Biographie universelle ou dictionnaire historique contenant la n\u00e9crologie des hommes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres'' Volume 5.

[[Pliny the Elder]], in his ''Natural History'' (circa 77\u201379&nbsp;AD) Books XXXIV and XXXV, recounts the origin of painting. In Chapter 5 of Book XXXV, he writes,\n\n\u201cWe have no certain knowledge as to the commencement of the art of painting, nor does this enquiry fall under our consideration. The Egyptians assert that it was invented among themselves, six thousand years before it passed into Greece; a vain boast, it is very evident. As to the Greeks, some say that it was invented at Sicyon, others at Corinth; but they all agree that it originated in tracing lines round the human shadow [...omnes umbra hominis lineis circumducta].\u201c. In Chapter 15, he tells the story of Butades of Corinth:\n\n:: \u201cButades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first who invented, at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in the earth which he used in his trade. It was through his daughter that he made the discovery; who, being deeply in love with a young man about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile of his face, as thrown upon the [[wall]] by the light of the lamp [''umbram ex facie eius ad lucernam in pariete lineis circumscripsit'']. Upon seeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clay upon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he then hardened by fire along with other articles of pottery.\u201d \n:: In accord with the myth, Greek [[Black-figure pottery]] painting,<ref>R.

For this reason profile portraits have been employed on [[coin]]age since the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era. The early Renaissance period saw a fashion for painted profile portraits and people such as [[Federico da Montefeltro]] and [[Ludovico Sforza]] were depicted in profile portraits. The profile portrait is strongly linked to the silhouette.\n\nRecent research at [[Stanford University]] indicates that where previous studies of face recognition have been based on frontal views, studies with silhouettes show humans are able to extract accurate information about gender and age from the silhouette alone.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070321181318.htm Science Daily], accessed November 2, 2008.</ref> This is an important concept for artists who design characters for visual media, because the silhouette is the most immediately recognisable and identifiable shape of the character.<ref>[http://aviary.com/bizblog/posts/good-design-lies-in-the-foundation Good design lies in the foundation], accessed August 18, 2009.</ref> \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Portrait\n | image1    = Mister Bethany and Patience Wright.jpg\n | width1    = 205\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = <center>\"Mister Bethany and [[Patience Wright]], Anonymous engraving\n | image2    = A man drawing the silhouette of a seated woman on translucen Wellcome V0049670.jpg\n | width2    = 140\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = <center>''Drawing a Silhouette'' by [[Johann Rudolph Schellenberg]] (1740\u20131806)</center>\n }}\n\n===Rise of popularity and development in the nineteenth century===\nA silhouette portrait can be painted or drawn. However, the traditional method of creating silhouette portraits is to cut them from lightweight black cardboard, and mount them on a pale (usually white) background. This was the work of specialist artists, often working out of booths at fairs or markets, whose trade competed with that of the more expensive [[Portrait miniature|miniaturists]] patronised by the wealthy. A traditional silhouette portrait artist would cut the likeness of a person, freehand, within a few minutes.<ref name=RA>Roving Artists [http://www.roving-artist.com/classic/index.html Classic portraits]</ref> Some modern silhouette artists also make silhouette portraits from photographs of people taken in profile.<ref name=KJ>[http://www.cutarts.com/catalog.php?category=4 Custom Silhouette Pictures by Karl Johnson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116020322/http://www.cutarts.com/catalog.php?category=4 |date=2009-01-16 }}, accessed November 2, 2008.</ref> These profile images are often head and shoulder length (bust), but can also be full length.<ref>[http://www.silhouettecutting.co.uk/p/gallery.html Silhouette Sarah]</ref>\n\nThe work of the [[Physiognomy|physiognomist]] [[Johann Caspar Lavater]], who used silhouettes to analyse facial types, is thought to have promoted the art.<ref>[http://www.silhouette.artist-art.com/silhouette-pages/silhouette-lavater.htm Lavater], accessed November 2, 2008.</ref> The 18th century silhouette artist [[August Edouart]] cut thousands of portraits in duplicate.

These pictures, known as \"paper cuts\", were often, but not necessarily, silhouette images.<ref>Traditional European paper cuts are different in this regard to traditional Oriental paper cuts which are often made of several layers of brightly coloured and patterned paper, and have many formal decorative elements such as flower petals.</ref> Among 19th century artists to work in this way was the author [[Hans Christian Andersen]].<ref>[http://www2.kb.dk/elib/mss/hcaklip/index-en.htm Hans Christian Andersen's Paper Cuts in the Royal Library], accessed November 2, 2008.</ref> The modern artist [[Robert Ryan (artist)|Robert Ryan]]<!---don't delete word in brackets---> creates intricate images by this technique, sometimes using them to produce [[Silk-screen printing|silk-screen print]]s.<ref>[http://www.misterrob.co.uk/ Mister Rob Ryan], accessed November 2, 2008.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century several illustrators employed designs of similar appearance for making book illustrations. Silhouette pictures could easily be printed by blocks that were cheaper to produce and longer lasting than detailed black and white illustrations.\n\nSilhouette pictures sometimes appear in books of the early 20th century in conjunction with colour plates. (The colour plates were expensive to produce and each one was glued into the book by hand.) Illustrators who produced silhouette pictures at this time include [[Arthur Rackham]] and [[William Heath Robinson]].

Illustrators of the late 20th century to work in silhouette include [[Jan Pienkowski]] and [[Jan Ormerod]]. In the early 1970s, French artist [[Philippe Derome]] uses the black cut silhouette in his portraits of black people. In the 21st century, American artist [[Kara Walker]] develops this use of silhouette to present racial issues in confronting images.<ref>Knipe, P. (2002).

In the Paris of the late 19th century, the shadow theatre was particularly associated with the cabaret ''[[Le Chat Noir]]'' where [[Henri Rivi\u00e8re (painter)|Henri Rivi\u00e8re]] was the designer.<ref>[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/in-the-musee-dorsay/exhibitions-in-the-musee-dorsay/article/le-cabaret-du-chat-noir-1881-1897-6768.html?cHash=8df4e47362/ Le Cabaret du Chat Noir (1881\u20131897)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215125043/http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/in-the-musee-dorsay/exhibitions-in-the-musee-dorsay/article/le-cabaret-du-chat-noir-1881-1897-6768.html?cHash=8df4e47362%2F |date=2017-02-15 }}, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris, 1992</ref>\n\n===Movies===\nSince their pioneering use by [[Lotte Reiniger]] in silent films, silhouettes have been used for a variety of iconic, graphic, emotional, or conversely for distancing, effects in many movies. These include many of the opening credit sequences of the [[James Bond]] films. The opening sequence of the television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' features a silhouetted profile of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] stepping into a [[caricature]]d outline of himself, and in his movie [[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]] the killer in the shower scene manifests as a terrifying silhouette. A scene from ''[[E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' showing the central characters on a flying bicycle silhouetted against the full moon became a well-known movie [[poster]]. ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' contains an animated sequence in silhouette illustrating a short story ''The Tale of the Three Brothers'' that is embedded in the film. The sequence was produced by [[Ben Hibon]] for Framestore, with artwork by [[Alexis Lidell]].\n\nSilhouettes have also been used by recording artists in [[music video]]s. One example is the video for \"Buttons\" by [[The Pussycat Dolls]], in which [[Nicole Scherzinger]] is seen in silhouette. [[Michael Jackson]] used his own distinctive silhouette both on stage and in videos such as \"[[You Rock My World]]\". Early [[iPod]] commercials portrayed silhouetted dancers wearing an iPod and earbuds.\n\nThe cult television program, [[Mystery Science Theater 3000]] features the three main characters of the series watching a movie as silhouettes at the bottom of the screen.\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Theatre, film and photography \n | image1    = ZP 05 Jin Jaswadi 00.jpg\n | width1    = 215\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = A [[Bali]]nese shadow show puppet and its shadow\n | image2    = Le chat noir.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = <center>Shadow theatre designed by [[Henri Rivi\u00e8re (painter)|Henri Rivi\u00e8re]] for [[Le Chat Noir]]</center>\n | image3    =  BigComboTrailer.jpg\n | width3    = 255\n | alt3      = \n | caption3  = Scene from the [[film noir]], ''[[The Big Combo]]'' (1955) filmed by [[John Alton]]\n }}\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe discipline of architecture that studies the shadows cast by or upon buildings is called [[Sciography]].\n\nThe play of shadows upon buildings was very much in vogue a thousand years ago as evidenced by the surviving examples of \"mukarnas\" art where the shadows of 3 dimensional ornamentation with stone masonry around the entrance of mosques form pictures. As outright pictures were avoided in Islam, tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, \"accidental\" silhouettes are a creative alternative.<ref>[https://www.google.no/webhp?hl=no#hl=no&q=ni%C4%9Fde+alaaddin+camii+kap%C4%B1s%C4%B1 google.no], Ni\u011fde Alaaddin Mosque where a Chiaroscuro drawing of a woman's face with crown and long hair appears at a specific time of the year.</ref><ref>[http://fotogaleri.haberler.com/divrigi-ulu-camii-nde-namaz-kilan-insan/ fotogaleri.haberler.com], ''Divri\u011fi Great Mosque and Hospital'' with the silhouette of a praying man that appears over the entrance door of the mosque part and changes pose as the sun moves.</ref>\n\n===Photography===\nMany photographers use the technique of photographing people, objects or landscape elements against the light, to achieve an image in silhouette. The background light might be natural, such as a cloudy or open sky, mist or fog, sunset or an open doorway (a technique known as [[contre-jour]]), or it might be contrived in a studio; see [[low-key lighting]]. Silhouetting requires that the exposure be adjusted so that there is no detail (underexposure) within the desired silhouette element, and overexposure for the background to render it bright; so a [[lighting ratio]] of 16:1 or greater is the ideal. The [[Zone System]]<ref>Adams, Ansel & Baker, Robert (1995). The camera (1st pbk. ed). Little, Brown, Boston</ref> was an aid to film photographers in achieving the required exposure ratios. High contrast film, adjustment of film development,<ref>Adams, Ansel & Baker, Robert (1981). The negative (1st ed).

Burlington, MA, USA Focal Press</ref>\n\n===In graphic design===\nIn media the term \"to silhouette\" is used for the process of separating or masking a portion of an image (such as the background) so that it does not show. Traditionally silhouettes have often been used in advertising, particularly in poster design, because they can be cheaply and effectively printed.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Advertising\n\n | image1    =   James Whitcomb Riley, house and sign painted advertisement, 1871.jpg\n | width1    = 255\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = An advertisement for [[James Whitcomb Riley]]'s business, 1871\n | image2    = Palais der Friedrichstadt Poster c1920.jpg\n | width2    = 228\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Poster for Palais der Friedrichstadt c. 1920\n | image3    = CALANCHI6aediz.jpg\n | width3    = 116\n | alt3      = \n | caption3  = <center>Poster for the Festival of Calanchi, [[San Marino]], by Bradipone (2008)</center>\n }}\n\n==Other uses==\n[[File:Coronet Corset Co.gif|thumb|left|upright|The fashionable silhouette of 1900]]\n\n===Fashion and fitness===\nThe word \"silhouette\", because it implies the outline of a form, has been used in both fashion and fitness to describe the outline shape of the body from a particular angle, as altered by clothing in fashion usage, and clothed or unclothed where fitness is concerned, [http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/pdf/research/dress_register/ADR3.3_historical_silhouettes.pdf (e.g. a usage applied here by the Powerhouse Museum]). Advertising for both these fields urges people, women in particular, to achieve a particular appearance, either by [[corsetry]], [[Dieting|diet]] or [[exercise]]. The term was in use in advertising by the early 20th century. Many [[gym]]s and fitness studios use the word \"silhouette\" either in their name or in their advertising.<ref>There are over 1,800,000 mentions of the word \"silhouette\" in conjunction with \"fitness\" online. There are many \"Silhouette Fitness\" studios and gymnasiums, e.g. [http://www.silhouettefitness.com/ in Halifax], [http://bendigo.ecityguide.com.au/directory/b958/ in Bendigo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005141800/http://bendigo.ecityguide.com.au/directory/b958/ |date=2011-10-05 }}, [http://www.silhouette.ch/default_eng.htm in Switzerland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026080032/http://www.silhouette.ch/default_eng.htm |date=2008-10-26 }} etc</ref>\n\nHistorians of [[costume]] also use the term when describing the effect achieved by the clothes of different periods, so that they might describe and compare the silhouette of the 1860s with that of the other decades of the 19th century. A desirable silhouette could be influenced by many factors. The invention of [[crinoline]] steel influenced the silhouette of women in the 1850s and 60s. The posture of the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] influenced the silhouette of English women in the [[Edwardian period]]. See advertisement left.\n\n===Identification===\nBecause silhouettes give a very clear image, they are often used in any field where the speedy identification of an object is necessary. Silhouettes have many practical applications. They are used for [[traffic signs]] (see pic below). They are used to identify towns or countries with silhouettes of monuments or maps. They are used to identify natural objects such as trees, insects and dinosaurs. They are used in [[forensic science]].<ref>[http://www.forensicentomology.com/IDdoc.htm Forensic entomology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510171443/http://www.forensicentomology.com/IDdoc.htm |date=2008-05-10 }}, accessed November 3, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Journalism===\nFor interviews, some individuals choose to be videotaped in silhouette to mask their facial features and protect their anonymity, typically accompanied by a dubbed voice.

They represented a cheap but effective alternative to the [[portrait miniature]], and skilled specialist artists could cut a high-quality bust portrait, by far the most common style, in a matter of minutes, working purely by eye. Other artists, especially from about 1790, drew an outline on paper, then painted it in, which could be equally quick.\n\nFrom its original graphic meaning, the term ''silhouette'' has been extended to describe the sight or representation of a person, object or scene that is [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlit]], and appears dark against a lighter background. Anything that appears this way, for example, a figure standing backlit in a doorway, may be described as \"in silhouette\". Because a silhouette emphasises the outline, the word has also been used in the fields of [[fashion]] and [[physical fitness|fitness]] to describe the shape of a person's body or the shape created by wearing clothing of a particular style or period.\n\n==Etymology and origins==\nThe word ''silhouette'' is derived from the name of [[\u00c9tienne de Silhouette]], a French [[finance minister]] who, in 1759, was forced by France's credit crisis during the [[Seven Years' War]] to impose severe economic demands upon the French people, particularly the wealthy.<ref>McLynn pp. 64\u201365</ref> Because of de Silhouette's austere economies, his name became synonymous with anything done or made cheaply and so with these outline portraits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Teall|first=Gardner|title=Silhouettes Old and New|journal=House & Garden|date=Aug 1916|volume=30|pages=20}}</ref><ref>There is no mention of de Silhouette making silhouettes in his earliest record in 1834 edition ''Biographie universelle ou dictionnaire historique contenant la n\u00e9crologie des hommes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres'' Volume 5. Furne, 1834. P. 2850</ref> Prior to the advent of photography, silhouette profiles cut from black card were the cheapest way of recording a person's appearance.<ref name=KJ/><ref>The family name Silhouette is a French form of a [[Basque Language|Basque]] surname, Ziloeta; Arnaud de Silhouette, \u00c9tienne's father, was from [[Biarritz]] in the [[French Basque Country]]; this surname, whose Standard Basque or [[Batua]] form is Zuloeta, contains the suffix ''-eta'' \"abundance of\" and ''zilo'', Batua ''zulo'', \"hole\".</ref>\n\nThe term ''silhouette'', although existing from the 18th century, was not applied to the art of portrait-making until the 19th century. In the 18th and early 19th century, \u201cprofiles\u201d or \u201cshades\u201d as they were called were made by one of three methods:\n# painted on ivory, plaster, paper, card, or in reverse on glass;\n# \u201chollow-cut\u201d where the negative image was traced and then cut away from light colored paper which was then laid atop a dark background; and\n# \u201ccut and paste\u201d where the figure was cut out of dark paper (usually free-hand) and then pasted onto a light background.<ref name=\"McClard\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Mythological origins===\n[[File:Terracotta neck-amphora of Panathenaic shape (jar) MET DP161828 white balanced white bg.png|right|thumb|Attic Greek Black-figure Neck Amphora attributed to the Princeton Painter, ca. 550\u2013540 BCE]]\nThe silhouette is closely tied in mythology to the origins of art. [[Pliny the Elder]], in his ''Natural History'' (circa 77\u201379&nbsp;AD) Books XXXIV and XXXV, recounts the origin of painting. In Chapter 5 of Book XXXV, he writes,\n\n\u201cWe have no certain knowledge as to the commencement of the art of painting, nor does this enquiry fall under our consideration. The Egyptians assert that it was invented among themselves, six thousand years before it passed into Greece; a vain boast, it is very evident. As to the Greeks, some say that it was invented at Sicyon, others at Corinth; but they all agree that it originated in tracing lines round the human shadow [...omnes umbra hominis lineis circumducta].\u201c. In Chapter 15, he tells the story of Butades of Corinth:\n\n:: \u201cButades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first who invented, at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in the earth which he used in his trade. It was through his daughter that he made the discovery; who, being deeply in love with a young man about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile of his face, as thrown upon the [[wall]] by the light of the lamp [''umbram ex facie eius ad lucernam in pariete lineis circumscripsit'']. Upon seeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clay upon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he then hardened by fire along with other articles of pottery.\u201d \n:: In accord with the myth, Greek [[Black-figure pottery]] painting,<ref>R.

The pots themselves exhibit strong forms in outline that are indicators of their purpose, as well as being decorative.<ref>Trendall, A. D.

For this reason profile portraits have been employed on [[coin]]age since the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era. The early Renaissance period saw a fashion for painted profile portraits and people such as [[Federico da Montefeltro]] and [[Ludovico Sforza]] were depicted in profile portraits. The profile portrait is strongly linked to the silhouette.\n\nRecent research at [[Stanford University]] indicates that where previous studies of face recognition have been based on frontal views, studies with silhouettes show humans are able to extract accurate information about gender and age from the silhouette alone.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070321181318.htm Science Daily], accessed November 2, 2008.</ref> This is an important concept for artists who design characters for visual media, because the silhouette is the most immediately recognisable and identifiable shape of the character.<ref>[http://aviary.com/bizblog/posts/good-design-lies-in-the-foundation Good design lies in the foundation], accessed August 18, 2009.</ref> \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Portrait\n | image1    = Mister Bethany and Patience Wright.jpg\n | width1    = 205\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = <center>\"Mister Bethany and [[Patience Wright]], Anonymous engraving\n | image2    = A man drawing the silhouette of a seated woman on translucen Wellcome V0049670.jpg\n | width2    = 140\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = <center>''Drawing a Silhouette'' by [[Johann Rudolph Schellenberg]] (1740\u20131806)</center>\n }}\n\n===Rise of popularity and development in the nineteenth century===\nA silhouette portrait can be painted or drawn. However, the traditional method of creating silhouette portraits is to cut them from lightweight black cardboard, and mount them on a pale (usually white) background. This was the work of specialist artists, often working out of booths at fairs or markets, whose trade competed with that of the more expensive [[Portrait miniature|miniaturists]] patronised by the wealthy. A traditional silhouette portrait artist would cut the likeness of a person, freehand, within a few minutes.<ref name=RA>Roving Artists [http://www.roving-artist.com/classic/index.html Classic portraits]</ref> Some modern silhouette artists also make silhouette portraits from photographs of people taken in profile.<ref name=KJ>[http://www.cutarts.com/catalog.php?category=4 Custom Silhouette Pictures by Karl Johnson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116020322/http://www.cutarts.com/catalog.php?category=4 |date=2009-01-16 }}, accessed November 2, 2008.</ref> These profile images are often head and shoulder length (bust), but can also be full length.<ref>[http://www.silhouettecutting.co.uk/p/gallery.html Silhouette Sarah]</ref>\n\nThe work of the [[Physiognomy|physiognomist]] [[Johann Caspar Lavater]], who used silhouettes to analyse facial types, is thought to have promoted the art.<ref>[http://www.silhouette.artist-art.com/silhouette-pages/silhouette-lavater.htm Lavater], accessed November 2, 2008.</ref> The 18th century silhouette artist [[August Edouart]] cut thousands of portraits in duplicate.

These pictures, known as \"paper cuts\", were often, but not necessarily, silhouette images.<ref>Traditional European paper cuts are different in this regard to traditional Oriental paper cuts which are often made of several layers of brightly coloured and patterned paper, and have many formal decorative elements such as flower petals.</ref> Among 19th century artists to work in this way was the author [[Hans Christian Andersen]].<ref>[http://www2.kb.dk/elib/mss/hcaklip/index-en.htm Hans Christian Andersen's Paper Cuts in the Royal Library], accessed November 2, 2008.</ref> The modern artist [[Robert Ryan (artist)|Robert Ryan]]<!---don't delete word in brackets---> creates intricate images by this technique, sometimes using them to produce [[Silk-screen printing|silk-screen print]]s.<ref>[http://www.misterrob.co.uk/ Mister Rob Ryan], accessed November 2, 2008.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century several illustrators employed designs of similar appearance for making book illustrations. Silhouette pictures could easily be printed by blocks that were cheaper to produce and longer lasting than detailed black and white illustrations.\n\nSilhouette pictures sometimes appear in books of the early 20th century in conjunction with colour plates. (The colour plates were expensive to produce and each one was glued into the book by hand.)

Illustrators of the late 20th century to work in silhouette include [[Jan Pienkowski]] and [[Jan Ormerod]]. In the early 1970s, French artist [[Philippe Derome]] uses the black cut silhouette in his portraits of black people.

These include many of the opening credit sequences of the [[James Bond]] films. The opening sequence of the television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' features a silhouetted profile of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] stepping into a [[caricature]]d outline of himself, and in his movie [[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]] the killer in the shower scene manifests as a terrifying silhouette. A scene from ''[[E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' showing the central characters on a flying bicycle silhouetted against the full moon became a well-known movie [[poster]]. ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' contains an animated sequence in silhouette illustrating a short story ''The Tale of the Three Brothers'' that is embedded in the film. The sequence was produced by [[Ben Hibon]] for Framestore, with artwork by [[Alexis Lidell]].\n\nSilhouettes have also been used by recording artists in [[music video]]s. One example is the video for \"Buttons\" by [[The Pussycat Dolls]], in which [[Nicole Scherzinger]] is seen in silhouette. [[Michael Jackson]] used his own distinctive silhouette both on stage and in videos such as \"[[You Rock My World]]\". Early [[iPod]] commercials portrayed silhouetted dancers wearing an iPod and earbuds.\n\nThe cult television program, [[Mystery Science Theater 3000]] features the three main characters of the series watching a movie as silhouettes at the bottom of the screen.\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Theatre, film and photography \n | image1    = ZP 05 Jin Jaswadi 00.jpg\n | width1    = 215\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = A [[Bali]]nese shadow show puppet and its shadow\n | image2    = Le chat noir.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = <center>Shadow theatre designed by [[Henri Rivi\u00e8re (painter)|Henri Rivi\u00e8re]] for [[Le Chat Noir]]</center>\n | image3    =  BigComboTrailer.jpg\n | width3    = 255\n | alt3      = \n | caption3  = Scene from the [[film noir]], ''[[The Big Combo]]'' (1955) filmed by [[John Alton]]\n }}\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe discipline of architecture that studies the shadows cast by or upon buildings is called [[Sciography]].\n\nThe play of shadows upon buildings was very much in vogue a thousand years ago as evidenced by the surviving examples of \"mukarnas\" art where the shadows of 3 dimensional ornamentation with stone masonry around the entrance of mosques form pictures. As outright pictures were avoided in Islam, tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, \"accidental\" silhouettes are a creative alternative.<ref>[https://www.google.no/webhp?hl=no#hl=no&q=ni%C4%9Fde+alaaddin+camii+kap%C4%B1s%C4%B1 google.no], Ni\u011fde Alaaddin Mosque where a Chiaroscuro drawing of a woman's face with crown and long hair appears at a specific time of the year.</ref><ref>[http://fotogaleri.haberler.com/divrigi-ulu-camii-nde-namaz-kilan-insan/ fotogaleri.haberler.com], ''Divri\u011fi Great Mosque and Hospital'' with the silhouette of a praying man that appears over the entrance door of the mosque part and changes pose as the sun moves.</ref>\n\n===Photography===\nMany photographers use the technique of photographing people, objects or landscape elements against the light, to achieve an image in silhouette. The background light might be natural, such as a cloudy or open sky, mist or fog, sunset or an open doorway (a technique known as [[contre-jour]]), or it might be contrived in a studio; see [[low-key lighting]]. Silhouetting requires that the exposure be adjusted so that there is no detail (underexposure) within the desired silhouette element, and overexposure for the background to render it bright; so a [[lighting ratio]] of 16:1 or greater is the ideal. The [[Zone System]]<ref>Adams, Ansel & Baker, Robert (1995). The camera (1st pbk. ed). Little, Brown, Boston</ref> was an aid to film photographers in achieving the required exposure ratios. High contrast film, adjustment of film development,<ref>Adams, Ansel & Baker, Robert (1981). The negative (1st ed). New York Graphic Society, Boston</ref> and/or high contrast photographic paper may be used in chemical-based photography to enhance the effect in the darkroom.<ref>Adams, Ansel & Baker, Robert (2003).

Burlington, MA, USA Focal Press</ref>\n\n===In graphic design===\nIn media the term \"to silhouette\" is used for the process of separating or masking a portion of an image (such as the background) so that it does not show. Traditionally silhouettes have often been used in advertising, particularly in poster design, because they can be cheaply and effectively printed.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Advertising\n\n | image1    =   James Whitcomb Riley, house and sign painted advertisement, 1871.jpg\n | width1    = 255\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = An advertisement for [[James Whitcomb Riley]]'s business, 1871\n | image2    = Palais der Friedrichstadt Poster c1920.jpg\n | width2    = 228\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Poster for Palais der Friedrichstadt c. 1920\n | image3    = CALANCHI6aediz.jpg\n | width3    = 116\n | alt3      = \n | caption3  = <center>Poster for the Festival of Calanchi, [[San Marino]], by Bradipone (2008)</center>\n }}\n\n==Other uses==\n[[File:Coronet Corset Co.gif|thumb|left|upright|The fashionable silhouette of 1900]]\n\n===Fashion and fitness===\nThe word \"silhouette\", because it implies the outline of a form, has been used in both fashion and fitness to describe the outline shape of the body from a particular angle, as altered by clothing in fashion usage, and clothed or unclothed where fitness is concerned, [http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/pdf/research/dress_register/ADR3.3_historical_silhouettes.pdf (e.g. a usage applied here by the Powerhouse Museum]). Advertising for both these fields urges people, women in particular, to achieve a particular appearance, either by [[corsetry]], [[Dieting|diet]] or [[exercise]]. The term was in use in advertising by the early 20th century. Many [[gym]]s and fitness studios use the word \"silhouette\" either in their name or in their advertising.<ref>There are over 1,800,000 mentions of the word \"silhouette\" in conjunction with \"fitness\" online. There are many \"Silhouette Fitness\" studios and gymnasiums, e.g. [http://www.silhouettefitness.com/ in Halifax], [http://bendigo.ecityguide.com.au/directory/b958/ in Bendigo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005141800/http://bendigo.ecityguide.com.au/directory/b958/ |date=2011-10-05 }}, [http://www.silhouette.ch/default_eng.htm in Switzerland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026080032/http://www.silhouette.ch/default_eng.htm |date=2008-10-26 }} etc</ref>\n\nHistorians of [[costume]] also use the term when describing the effect achieved by the clothes of different periods, so that they might describe and compare the silhouette of the 1860s with that of the other decades of the 19th century. A desirable silhouette could be influenced by many factors. The invention of [[crinoline]] steel influenced the silhouette of women in the 1850s and 60s. The posture of the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] influenced the silhouette of English women in the [[Edwardian period]]. See advertisement left.\n\n===Identification===\nBecause silhouettes give a very clear image, they are often used in any field where the speedy identification of an object is necessary. Silhouettes have many practical applications. They are used for [[traffic signs]] (see pic below). They are used to identify towns or countries with silhouettes of monuments or maps. They are used to identify natural objects such as trees, insects and dinosaurs. They are used in [[forensic science]].<ref>[http://www.forensicentomology.com/IDdoc.htm Forensic entomology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510171443/http://www.forensicentomology.com/IDdoc.htm |date=2008-05-10 }}, accessed November 3, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Journalism===\nFor interviews, some individuals choose to be videotaped in silhouette to mask their facial features and protect their anonymity, typically accompanied by a dubbed voice.

She was a potter and they married on 7 July 1923 in St Mary's Church, [[Frensham]].

In 1923 he began a ten-year psychoanalysis with [[James Strachey]], and in 1927 he began training as an analytic candidate. Strachey discussed Winnicott's case with his wife [[Alix Strachey]], apparently reporting that Winnicott's sex life was affected by his anxieties.<ref name=\"Kahr1996\"/> Winnicott's second analysis, beginning in 1936, was with [[Joan Riviere]].\n\nWinnicott rose to prominence as a psychoanalyst just as the followers of [[Anna Freud]] were in conflict with those of [[Melanie Klein]] for the right to be called [[Sigmund Freud]]'s \"true intellectual heirs\". Out of the [[Controversial discussions]] during [[World War II]], a compromise was reached with three more-or-less amicable groups within the psychoanalytic movement: the \"Freudians\", the \"Kleinians\", and the \"Middle Group\" of the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] (the latter being called the [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|\"Independent Group\"]]), to which Winnicott belonged, along with [[Ronald Fairbairn]], [[Michael Balint]], [[Masud Khan]], [[John Bowlby]], [[Marion Milner]], and [[Margaret Little]]. \n[[File:87 Chester Square London.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|The Winnicotts' home - Chester Square (Belgravia) 1951-1971]]\n\nDuring the Second World War, Winnicott served as consultant paediatrician to the [[evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|children's evacuation]] programme. During the war, he met and worked with Clare Britton, a psychiatric social worker who became his colleague in treating children displaced from their homes by wartime evacuation. Winnicott was lecturing after the war and [[Janet Quigley]] and [[Isa Benzie]] of the BBC asked him to give over sixty talks on the radio between 1943 and 1966. His first series of talks in 1943 was titled \"Happy Children.\" As a result of the success of these talks, Quigley offered him total control over the content of his talks but this soon became more consultative as Quigley advised him on the correct pitch.<ref name=\"RegulskaSmith2012\">{{cite book|author1=Joanna Regulska|author2=Bonnie G.

A keen observer of children as a social worker and a psychoanalyst in her own right, she had an important influence on the development of his theories and likely acted as midwife to his prolific publications after they met.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Face to face with children : the life and work of Clare Winnicott|last=Winnicott, Clare.

W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p. 17 and p. 44</ref> central to which was the mother's attentive holding of her child. \n\nWinnicott considered that the \"mother's technique of holding, of bathing, of feeding, everything she did for the baby, added up to the child's first idea of the mother\", as well as fostering the ability to experience the body as the place wherein one securely lives.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) pp. 86\u20137 and p. 194</ref> Extrapolating the concept of holding from mother to family and the outside world, Winnicott saw as key to healthy development \"the continuation of reliable holding in terms of the ever-widening circle of family and school and social life\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''Winnicott on the Child'' (Cambridge MA 2002) p. 238</ref>\n\nWinnicott was influential in viewing the work of the [[psychotherapist]] as offering a substitute holding environment based on the mother/infant bond.<ref>[[Dawn Freshwater]] and Chris Robertson, ''Emotions and Needs'' (Buckingham 2002) p. 26</ref> Winnicott wrote: \u201cA correct and well-timed interpretation in an analytic treatment gives a sense of being held physically that is more real...than if a real holding or nursing had taken place.

W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p. 228</ref> He considered antisocial behaviour as a cry for help, fuelled by a sense of loss of integrity, when the familial holding environment was inadequate or ruptured.<ref>Lisa Appignanesi, ''Mad, Bad and Sad'' (London 2008) p. 325</ref>\n\n==Play and the sense of being real==\nOne of the elements that Winnicott considered could be lost in childhood was what he called the sense of being{{snd}} for him, a primary element, of which a sense of doing is only a derivative.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 230 and p. 243</ref> The capacity for being{{snd}} the ability to feel genuinely alive inside, which Winnicott saw as essential to the maintenance of a [[True self and false self|true self]]{{snd}} was fostered in his view by the practice of childhood [[Play (activity)|play]].<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender: An introductory reader'' (London 1996) p. 114 and p. 122</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the emphasis in orthodox psychoanalysis upon generating insight into unconscious processes, Winnicott considered that playing was the key to emotional and psychological well-being. It is likely that he first came upon this notion from his collaboration in [[World War II|wartime]] with the psychiatric social worker, Clare Britton, (later a psychoanalyst and his second wife) who in 1945 published an article on the importance of play for children.<ref>[[Clare Winnicott|Britton, C.]] (1945). \"Children who cannot play\", ''Play and Mental Health''. London: New Educational Fellowship.</ref> By \"playing\", he meant not only the ways that children of all ages play, but also the way adults \"play\" through making art, or engaging in sports, hobbies, humour, meaningful conversation, et cetera. At any age, he saw play as crucial to the development of authentic selfhood, because when people play they feel real, spontaneous and alive, and keenly interested in what they're doing. He thought that insight in psychoanalysis was helpful when it came to the patient as a playful experience of creative, genuine discovery; dangerous when patients were pressured to comply with their analyst's authoritative interpretations, thus potentially merely reinforcing a patient's false self. Winnicott believed that it was only in playing that people are entirely their true selves, so it followed that for psychoanalysis to be effective, it needed to serve as a mode of playing.\n\nTwo of the techniques whereby Winnicott used play in his work with children were the squiggle game and the [[spatula]] game.  The first involved Winnicott drawing a shape for the child to play with and extend (or vice versa){{snd}} a practice extended by his followers into that of using partial interpretations as a 'squiggle' for a patient to make use of.<ref>Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 12</ref>\n\nThe second, more famous instance involved Winnicott placing a spatula (tongue depressor) within the child's reach for him to play with.<ref>Casement, Patrick. \"Learning from Life.\" Lecture presented in Seattle, WA 4 June 2011.</ref> Winnicott considered that \"if he is just an ordinary baby he will notice the attractive object...and he will reach for it....[then] in the course of a little while he will discover what he wants to do with it\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p. 75\u20136</ref> From the child's initial hesitation in making use of the spatula, Winnicott derived his idea of the necessary 'period of hesitation' in childhood (or analysis), which makes possible a true connection to the toy, interpretation or object presented for [[transference]].<ref>Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 95 and p. 184</ref>\n\nMany of Winnicott's writings show his efforts to understand what helps people to be able to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, \"Peek-a-boo!\" when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her.  Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that \"Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....[T]he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p.  146</ref> \"Potential space\" was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).<ref>Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 162</ref>\n\nPlaying can also be seen in the use of a [[transitional object]], Winnicott's term for an object, such as a teddy bear, that has a quality for a small child of being both real and made-up at the same time. Winnicott pointed out that no one demands that a toddler explain whether his Binky is a \"real bear\" or a creation of the child's own imagination, and went on to argue that it's very important that the child is allowed to experience the Binky as being in an undefined, \"transitional\" status between the child's imagination and the real world outside the child.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p.  169</ref> For Winnicott, one of the most important and precarious stages of development was in the first three years of life, when an infant grows into a child with an increasingly separate sense of self in relation to a larger world of other people. In health, the child learns to bring his or her spontaneous, real self into play with others; in a false self disorder, the child has found it unsafe or impossible to do so, and instead feels compelled to hide the true self from other people, and pretend to be whatever they want instead.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 241</ref> Playing with a transitional object can be an important early bridge between self and other, which helps a child develop the capacity to be genuine in relationships, and creative.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p.  170-2</ref>\n\nPlaying for Winnicott ultimately extended all the way up from earliest childhood experience to what he called \"the abstractions of politics and economics and philosophy and culture...this 'third area', that of cultural experience which is a derivative of play\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''Playing and Reality'' (Penguin 1971) p. 163 and p. 120</ref>\n\n==True self and false self==\n{{Main|True self and false self}}\nWinnicott wrote that \"a word like self...knows more than we do.\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Winnicott | first1 = D.

For example, where other psychoanalysts used the [[Freudian]] terminology of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] to describe different functions of a person's psychology, Winnicott at times used \"self\" to refer to both. For Winnicott, the self is a very important part of mental and emotional well-being which plays a vital role in creativity. He thought that people were born without a clearly developed self and had to \"search\" for an authentic sense of self as they grew.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, Playing and Reality. London: Routledge, 1971, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> \"For Winnicott, the sense of feeling real, feeling in touch with others and with one's own body and its processes was essential for living a life.\"<ref>Simon Grolnick, The Work and Play of Donald Winnicott. London: Aronson, 1990, pp. 31\u201332.</ref>\n\n===True self===\n\"Only the true self can be creative and only the true self can feel real.\"<ref>Winnicott, D. W. (1960). \"Ego Distortion in Terms of True and False Self,\" in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development''. New York: International UP Inc., 1965, pp. 140\u2013152.</ref> For Winnicott, the ''True Self'' is a sense of being alive and real in one's mind and body, having feelings that are spontaneous and unforced. This experience of aliveness is what allows people to be genuinely close to others, and to be creative.\n\nWinnicott thought that the \"True Self\" begins to develop in infancy, in the relationship between the baby and its primary caregiver (Winnicott typically refers to this person as \"the mother\"). One of the ways the mother helps the baby develop an authentic self is by responding in a welcoming and reassuring way to the baby's spontaneous feelings, expressions, and initiatives. In this way the baby develops a confidence that nothing bad happens when she expresses what she feels, so her feelings don't seem dangerous or problematic to her, and she doesn't have to put undue attention into controlling or avoiding them. She also gains a sense that she is real, that she exists and her feelings and actions have meaning.\n\nWinnicott thought that one of the developmental hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of [[omnipotence]], or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, Playing and Reality. London: Routledge, 1971.</ref>\n\n===False self===\nIn Winnicott's writing, the \"False Self\" is a defence, a kind of mask of behaviour that complies with others' expectations. Winnicott thought that in health, a False Self was what allowed one to present a \"polite and mannered attitude\"<ref>D. W. Winnicott, \"Ego distortion in terms of true and false self,\" in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development.'' New York: International UP Inc., 1965, pp. 140\u2013152.</ref> in public.\n\nBut he saw more serious emotional problems in patients who seemed unable to feel spontaneous, alive or real to themselves anywhere, in any part of their lives, yet managed to put on a successful \"show of being real\". Such patients suffered inwardly from a sense of being empty, dead or \"phoney\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, \"Ego distortion in terms of true and false self,\" in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development.'' New York: International UP Inc., 1965, p. 146.</ref>\n\nWinnicott thought that this more extreme kind of False Self began to develop in infancy, as a defence against an environment that felt unsafe or overwhelming because of a lack of reasonably attuned caregiving. He thought that parents did not need to be perfectly attuned, but just \"ordinarily devoted\" or \"good enough\" to protect the baby from often experiencing overwhelming extremes of discomfort and distress, emotional or physical. But babies who lack this kind of external protection, Winnicott thought, had to do their best with their own crude defences.<ref>Simon Grolnick, ''The Work & Play of Winnicott.'' New Jersey: Aronson, 1990, p. 44.</ref>\n\nOne of the main defences Winnicott thought a baby could resort to was what he called \"compliance\", or behaviour motivated by a desire to please others rather than spontaneously express one's own feelings and ideas. For example, if a baby's caregiver was severely depressed, the baby would anxiously sense a lack of responsiveness, would not be able to enjoy an illusion of omnipotence, and might instead focus his energies and attentions on finding ways to get a positive response from the distracted and unhappy caregiver by being a \"good baby\". The \"False Self\" is a defence of constantly seeking to anticipate others' demands and complying with them, as a way of protecting the \"True Self\" from a world that is felt to be unsafe.\n\nWinnicott thought that the \"False Self\" developed through a process of [[introjection]], (a concept developed early on by Freud) in or internalising one's experience of others. Instead of basing his personality on his own unforced feelings, thoughts, and initiatives, the person with a \"False Self\" disorder would essentially be imitating and internalising other people's behaviour{{snd}} a mode in which he could outwardly come to seem \"just like\" his mother, father, brother, nurse, or whoever had dominated his world, but inwardly he would feel bored, empty, dead, or \"phoney\". Winnicott saw this as an unconscious process: not only others but also the person himself would mistake his ''False Self'' for his real personality. But even with the appearance of success, and of social gains, he would feel unreal and lack the sense of  really being alive or happy.\n\nThe division of the True and False self roughly develops from Freud's (1923) notion of the Superego which compels the Ego to modify and inhibit libidinal Id impulses, possibly leading to excessive repression but certainly altering the way the environment is perceived and responded to. However it is not a close equation as the Id, Ego and Superego are complex and dynamic inter-related systems that do not fit well into such a dichotomy. The theory more closely resembles Carl Rogers simplified notions of the Real and Ideal self. According to Winnicott, in every person the extent of division between True and False Self can be placed on a continuum between the healthy and the pathological. The True Self, which in health gives the person a sense of being alive, real, and creative, will always be in part or in whole hidden; the False Self is a compliant adaptation to the environment, but in health it does not dominate the person's internal life or block him from feeling spontaneous feelings, even if he chooses not to express them. The healthy ''False Self'' feels that it is still being true to the ''True Self''. It can be compliant to expectations but without feeling that it has betrayed its \"True Self\".\n\n==Winnicott on C.G.Jung==\n{{Main|Carl Jung}}\nWinnicott's assessment of the other great pioneer of psychoanalysis, [[Carl Jung]], appeared when he published an extensive review of Jung\u2019s partially autobiographical work, ''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]''.<ref>\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections: By C. G. Jung\". London: Collins and Routledge, 1963</ref> In it Winnicott focuses on the first three chapters of the work that: {{quote|every psychoanalyst must read\u2019 and in particular the first chapter, \u2018First Years\u2019.

Winnicott described himself as a disturbed adolescent, reacting against his own self-restraining \"goodness\" acquired from trying to assuage the dark moods of his mother.<ref>{{cite book | last=Roazen|first=Paul | title=The Historiography of Psychoanalysis| publisher=Transaction | year=2001 | isbn=0-7658-0019-5}}</ref> These seeds of self-awareness became the basis of his interest in working with troubled young people.\n\nHe first thought of studying medicine while at [[The Leys School]], a boarding school in [[Cambridge]], after fracturing his clavicle and recording in his diary that he wished he could treat himself. He began pre-clinical studies at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] in 1914 but, with the onset of [[World War I]], his studies were interrupted when he was made a medical trainee at the temporary hospital in Cambridge. In 1917, he joined the [[Royal Navy]] as a medical officer on the [[Laforey-class destroyer (1913)|destroyer]] HMS Lucifer.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k0ZaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT52&lpg=PT52&dq=HMS+Lucifer+winnicott#v=onepage&q=HMS%20Lucifer%20winnicott&f=false|title=Tea with Winnicott|last=Kahr|first=Brett|date=2018-05-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780429905612|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, he began studies in clinical medicine at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]] in London. During this time, he learned from his mentor the art of listening carefully when taking medical histories from patients, a skill that he would later identify as foundational to his practice as a [[psychoanalyst]].\n\n==Career==\nWinnicott completed his medical studies in 1920, and in 1923, the same year as his marriage to the artist [[Alice Buxton Winnicott]] (born Taylor). She was a potter and they married on 7 July 1923 in St Mary's Church, [[Frensham]]. Alice had \"severe psychological difficulties\" and Winnicott arranged for her, and his own therapy, to address the difficulties this condition created.<ref name=\"Kahr1996\">{{cite book|author=Brett Kahr|title=D.W.

In 1923 he began a ten-year psychoanalysis with [[James Strachey]], and in 1927 he began training as an analytic candidate. Strachey discussed Winnicott's case with his wife [[Alix Strachey]], apparently reporting that Winnicott's sex life was affected by his anxieties.<ref name=\"Kahr1996\"/> Winnicott's second analysis, beginning in 1936, was with [[Joan Riviere]].\n\nWinnicott rose to prominence as a psychoanalyst just as the followers of [[Anna Freud]] were in conflict with those of [[Melanie Klein]] for the right to be called [[Sigmund Freud]]'s \"true intellectual heirs\". Out of the [[Controversial discussions]] during [[World War II]], a compromise was reached with three more-or-less amicable groups within the psychoanalytic movement: the \"Freudians\", the \"Kleinians\", and the \"Middle Group\" of the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] (the latter being called the [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|\"Independent Group\"]]), to which Winnicott belonged, along with [[Ronald Fairbairn]], [[Michael Balint]], [[Masud Khan]], [[John Bowlby]], [[Marion Milner]], and [[Margaret Little]]. \n[[File:87 Chester Square London.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|The Winnicotts' home - Chester Square (Belgravia) 1951-1971]]\n\nDuring the Second World War, Winnicott served as consultant paediatrician to the [[evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|children's evacuation]] programme. During the war, he met and worked with Clare Britton, a psychiatric social worker who became his colleague in treating children displaced from their homes by wartime evacuation. Winnicott was lecturing after the war and [[Janet Quigley]] and [[Isa Benzie]] of the BBC asked him to give over sixty talks on the radio between 1943 and 1966. His first series of talks in 1943 was titled \"Happy Children.\" As a result of the success of these talks, Quigley offered him total control over the content of his talks but this soon became more consultative as Quigley advised him on the correct pitch.<ref name=\"RegulskaSmith2012\">{{cite book|author1=Joanna Regulska|author2=Bonnie G.

Among contemporaries influenced by Winnicott was [[R. D.

A keen observer of children as a social worker and a psychoanalyst in her own right, she had an important influence on the development of his theories and likely acted as midwife to his prolific publications after they met.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Face to face with children : the life and work of Clare Winnicott|last=Winnicott, Clare.

Robert | title=Winnicott: Life and work | publisher=Perseus | year=2003}}</ref>\n\n==Concept of holding==\nWinnicott's paediatric work with children and their mothers led to the development of his influential concept concerning the \"holding environment\".<ref name=\"John Hunter Padel 1987 p. 273\">John Hunter Padel, in Richard L Gregory ed, ''The Oxford Companion to The Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 273</ref> Winnicott claimed that \"the foundations of health are laid down by the ordinary mother in her ordinary loving care of her own baby\",<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p. 17 and p. 44</ref> central to which was the mother's attentive holding of her child. \n\nWinnicott considered that the \"mother's technique of holding, of bathing, of feeding, everything she did for the baby, added up to the child's first idea of the mother\", as well as fostering the ability to experience the body as the place wherein one securely lives.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) pp. 86\u20137 and p. 194</ref> Extrapolating the concept of holding from mother to family and the outside world, Winnicott saw as key to healthy development \"the continuation of reliable holding in terms of the ever-widening circle of family and school and social life\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''Winnicott on the Child'' (Cambridge MA 2002) p. 238</ref>\n\nWinnicott was influential in viewing the work of the [[psychotherapist]] as offering a substitute holding environment based on the mother/infant bond.<ref>[[Dawn Freshwater]] and Chris Robertson, ''Emotions and Needs'' (Buckingham 2002) p. 26</ref> Winnicott wrote: \u201cA correct and well-timed interpretation in an analytic treatment gives a sense of being held physically that is more real...than if a real holding or nursing had taken place.

W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p. 228</ref> He considered antisocial behaviour as a cry for help, fuelled by a sense of loss of integrity, when the familial holding environment was inadequate or ruptured.<ref>Lisa Appignanesi, ''Mad, Bad and Sad'' (London 2008) p. 325</ref>\n\n==Play and the sense of being real==\nOne of the elements that Winnicott considered could be lost in childhood was what he called the sense of being{{snd}} for him, a primary element, of which a sense of doing is only a derivative.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 230 and p. 243</ref> The capacity for being{{snd}} the ability to feel genuinely alive inside, which Winnicott saw as essential to the maintenance of a [[True self and false self|true self]]{{snd}} was fostered in his view by the practice of childhood [[Play (activity)|play]].<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender: An introductory reader'' (London 1996) p. 114 and p. 122</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the emphasis in orthodox psychoanalysis upon generating insight into unconscious processes, Winnicott considered that playing was the key to emotional and psychological well-being. It is likely that he first came upon this notion from his collaboration in [[World War II|wartime]] with the psychiatric social worker, Clare Britton, (later a psychoanalyst and his second wife) who in 1945 published an article on the importance of play for children.<ref>[[Clare Winnicott|Britton, C.]] (1945). \"Children who cannot play\", ''Play and Mental Health''. London: New Educational Fellowship.</ref> By \"playing\", he meant not only the ways that children of all ages play, but also the way adults \"play\" through making art, or engaging in sports, hobbies, humour, meaningful conversation, et cetera. At any age, he saw play as crucial to the development of authentic selfhood, because when people play they feel real, spontaneous and alive, and keenly interested in what they're doing. He thought that insight in psychoanalysis was helpful when it came to the patient as a playful experience of creative, genuine discovery; dangerous when patients were pressured to comply with their analyst's authoritative interpretations, thus potentially merely reinforcing a patient's false self. Winnicott believed that it was only in playing that people are entirely their true selves, so it followed that for psychoanalysis to be effective, it needed to serve as a mode of playing.\n\nTwo of the techniques whereby Winnicott used play in his work with children were the squiggle game and the [[spatula]] game.  The first involved Winnicott drawing a shape for the child to play with and extend (or vice versa){{snd}} a practice extended by his followers into that of using partial interpretations as a 'squiggle' for a patient to make use of.<ref>Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 12</ref>\n\nThe second, more famous instance involved Winnicott placing a spatula (tongue depressor) within the child's reach for him to play with.<ref>Casement, Patrick. \"Learning from Life.\" Lecture presented in Seattle, WA 4 June 2011.</ref> Winnicott considered that \"if he is just an ordinary baby he will notice the attractive object...and he will reach for it....[then] in the course of a little while he will discover what he wants to do with it\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p. 75\u20136</ref> From the child's initial hesitation in making use of the spatula, Winnicott derived his idea of the necessary 'period of hesitation' in childhood (or analysis), which makes possible a true connection to the toy, interpretation or object presented for [[transference]].<ref>Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 95 and p. 184</ref>\n\nMany of Winnicott's writings show his efforts to understand what helps people to be able to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, \"Peek-a-boo!\" when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her.  Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that \"Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....[T]he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p.  146</ref> \"Potential space\" was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).<ref>Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 162</ref>\n\nPlaying can also be seen in the use of a [[transitional object]], Winnicott's term for an object, such as a teddy bear, that has a quality for a small child of being both real and made-up at the same time. Winnicott pointed out that no one demands that a toddler explain whether his Binky is a \"real bear\" or a creation of the child's own imagination, and went on to argue that it's very important that the child is allowed to experience the Binky as being in an undefined, \"transitional\" status between the child's imagination and the real world outside the child.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p.  169</ref> For Winnicott, one of the most important and precarious stages of development was in the first three years of life, when an infant grows into a child with an increasingly separate sense of self in relation to a larger world of other people. In health, the child learns to bring his or her spontaneous, real self into play with others; in a false self disorder, the child has found it unsafe or impossible to do so, and instead feels compelled to hide the true self from other people, and pretend to be whatever they want instead.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 241</ref> Playing with a transitional object can be an important early bridge between self and other, which helps a child develop the capacity to be genuine in relationships, and creative.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Middlesex 1973) p.  170-2</ref>\n\nPlaying for Winnicott ultimately extended all the way up from earliest childhood experience to what he called \"the abstractions of politics and economics and philosophy and culture...this 'third area', that of cultural experience which is a derivative of play\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''Playing and Reality'' (Penguin 1971) p. 163 and p. 120</ref>\n\n==True self and false self==\n{{Main|True self and false self}}\nWinnicott wrote that \"a word like self...knows more than we do.\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Winnicott | first1 = D.

For example, where other psychoanalysts used the [[Freudian]] terminology of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] to describe different functions of a person's psychology, Winnicott at times used \"self\" to refer to both. For Winnicott, the self is a very important part of mental and emotional well-being which plays a vital role in creativity. He thought that people were born without a clearly developed self and had to \"search\" for an authentic sense of self as they grew.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, Playing and Reality. London: Routledge, 1971, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> \"For Winnicott, the sense of feeling real, feeling in touch with others and with one's own body and its processes was essential for living a life.\"<ref>Simon Grolnick, The Work and Play of Donald Winnicott. London: Aronson, 1990, pp. 31\u201332.</ref>\n\n===True self===\n\"Only the true self can be creative and only the true self can feel real.\"<ref>Winnicott, D. W. (1960). \"Ego Distortion in Terms of True and False Self,\" in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development''. New York: International UP Inc., 1965, pp. 140\u2013152.</ref> For Winnicott, the ''True Self'' is a sense of being alive and real in one's mind and body, having feelings that are spontaneous and unforced. This experience of aliveness is what allows people to be genuinely close to others, and to be creative.\n\nWinnicott thought that the \"True Self\" begins to develop in infancy, in the relationship between the baby and its primary caregiver (Winnicott typically refers to this person as \"the mother\"). One of the ways the mother helps the baby develop an authentic self is by responding in a welcoming and reassuring way to the baby's spontaneous feelings, expressions, and initiatives. In this way the baby develops a confidence that nothing bad happens when she expresses what she feels, so her feelings don't seem dangerous or problematic to her, and she doesn't have to put undue attention into controlling or avoiding them. She also gains a sense that she is real, that she exists and her feelings and actions have meaning.\n\nWinnicott thought that one of the developmental hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of [[omnipotence]], or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, Playing and Reality. London: Routledge, 1971.</ref>\n\n===False self===\nIn Winnicott's writing, the \"False Self\" is a defence, a kind of mask of behaviour that complies with others' expectations. Winnicott thought that in health, a False Self was what allowed one to present a \"polite and mannered attitude\"<ref>D. W. Winnicott, \"Ego distortion in terms of true and false self,\" in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development.'' New York: International UP Inc., 1965, pp. 140\u2013152.</ref> in public.\n\nBut he saw more serious emotional problems in patients who seemed unable to feel spontaneous, alive or real to themselves anywhere, in any part of their lives, yet managed to put on a successful \"show of being real\". Such patients suffered inwardly from a sense of being empty, dead or \"phoney\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, \"Ego distortion in terms of true and false self,\" in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development.'' New York: International UP Inc., 1965, p. 146.</ref>\n\nWinnicott thought that this more extreme kind of False Self began to develop in infancy, as a defence against an environment that felt unsafe or overwhelming because of a lack of reasonably attuned caregiving. He thought that parents did not need to be perfectly attuned, but just \"ordinarily devoted\" or \"good enough\" to protect the baby from often experiencing overwhelming extremes of discomfort and distress, emotional or physical. But babies who lack this kind of external protection, Winnicott thought, had to do their best with their own crude defences.<ref>Simon Grolnick, ''The Work & Play of Winnicott.'' New Jersey: Aronson, 1990, p. 44.</ref>\n\nOne of the main defences Winnicott thought a baby could resort to was what he called \"compliance\", or behaviour motivated by a desire to please others rather than spontaneously express one's own feelings and ideas. For example, if a baby's caregiver was severely depressed, the baby would anxiously sense a lack of responsiveness, would not be able to enjoy an illusion of omnipotence, and might instead focus his energies and attentions on finding ways to get a positive response from the distracted and unhappy caregiver by being a \"good baby\". The \"False Self\" is a defence of constantly seeking to anticipate others' demands and complying with them, as a way of protecting the \"True Self\" from a world that is felt to be unsafe.\n\nWinnicott thought that the \"False Self\" developed through a process of [[introjection]], (a concept developed early on by Freud) in or internalising one's experience of others. Instead of basing his personality on his own unforced feelings, thoughts, and initiatives, the person with a \"False Self\" disorder would essentially be imitating and internalising other people's behaviour{{snd}} a mode in which he could outwardly come to seem \"just like\" his mother, father, brother, nurse, or whoever had dominated his world, but inwardly he would feel bored, empty, dead, or \"phoney\". Winnicott saw this as an unconscious process: not only others but also the person himself would mistake his ''False Self'' for his real personality. But even with the appearance of success, and of social gains, he would feel unreal and lack the sense of  really being alive or happy.\n\nThe division of the True and False self roughly develops from Freud's (1923) notion of the Superego which compels the Ego to modify and inhibit libidinal Id impulses, possibly leading to excessive repression but certainly altering the way the environment is perceived and responded to. However it is not a close equation as the Id, Ego and Superego are complex and dynamic inter-related systems that do not fit well into such a dichotomy. The theory more closely resembles Carl Rogers simplified notions of the Real and Ideal self. According to Winnicott, in every person the extent of division between True and False Self can be placed on a continuum between the healthy and the pathological. The True Self, which in health gives the person a sense of being alive, real, and creative, will always be in part or in whole hidden; the False Self is a compliant adaptation to the environment, but in health it does not dominate the person's internal life or block him from feeling spontaneous feelings, even if he chooses not to express them. The healthy ''False Self'' feels that it is still being true to the ''True Self''. It can be compliant to expectations but without feeling that it has betrayed its \"True Self\".\n\n==Winnicott on C.G.Jung==\n{{Main|Carl Jung}}\nWinnicott's assessment of the other great pioneer of psychoanalysis, [[Carl Jung]], appeared when he published an extensive review of Jung\u2019s partially autobiographical work, ''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]''.<ref>\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections: By C. G. Jung\". London: Collins and Routledge, 1963</ref> In it Winnicott focuses on the first three chapters of the work that: {{quote|every psychoanalyst must read\u2019 and in particular the first chapter, \u2018First Years\u2019. Winnicott<ref>{{cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-collected-works-of-d-w-winnicott-9780199399338|title= The Collected Works of D. W.

He goes on to comment on the relationship between [[Freud]] and Jung. He also discusses the Jungian [[Collective unconscious|\u2018unconscious\u2019]] and Jung\u2019s concept of the [[Self (Jung)|\u2018self\u2019]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-collected-works-of-d-w-winnicott-9780199399338|title= The Collected Works of D.

His view of the environment and use of accessible everyday language, addressing the parent community, as opposed to just the Kleinian psychoanalytic community, may account in part for the distancing and making him somewhat \"niche\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Abram, Jan|title=The Survival of the Object: does Winnicott's work constitute a paradigm shift in psychoanalysis?|url=https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/6528/1/Abram.phd.pdf|date=2004|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\nWinnicott has also been accused of identifying himself in his theoretical stance with an idealised mother, in the tradition of mother (Madonna) and child.<ref>Peter Lomas, ''The Limits of Interpretation'' (Penguin 1987) p. 88</ref><ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p.  61-4</ref> Related is his downplaying of the importance of the erotic in his work, as well as the [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworthian Romanticism]] of his cult of childhood play (exaggerated still further in some of his followers).<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender: An introductory reader'' (London 1996) p. 131</ref><ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 162</ref>\n\nHis theories of the true/false self may have been over-influenced by his own childhood experience of caring for a depressed mother, which resulted in the development of a prematurely mature self which he was only subsequently able to undo.<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender: An introductory reader'' (London 1996) p. 134</ref><ref>Adam Phillips, ''Going Sane'' (London 2005) p. 95</ref>  \n\nNevertheless, Winnicott remains one of the few twentieth-century analysts who, in stature, breadth, minuteness of observations, and theoretical fertility can legitimately be compared to Sigmund Freud.<ref>Patrick Casement, ''On Learning from the Patient'' (London 1995) p. x</ref>\n\nAlong with [[Jacques Derrida]], Winnicott is a fundamental resource for philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler|Bernard Stiegler's]] ''What Makes Life Worth Living: On Pharmacology'' (2010).\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Clinical Notes on Disorders of Childhood'' (London: [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]], 1931)\n*   [[Clare Winnicott|C.
