Manetho links himself directly to Pharaoh Ptolemy II.|337x337px]]\nIf the mention of someone named Manetho in the ''Hibeh Papyri'', dated to 241/240 BC, is in fact the celebrated author of the ''Aegyptiaca'', then Manetho may well have been working during the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] (246\u2013222 BC) as well but at a very advanced age. Though the historicity of Manetho of Sebennytus was taken for granted by Josephus and later authors the question as to whether he actually existed remains problematic. The Manetho of the ''Hibeh Papyri'' has no title and this letter deals with affairs in Upper Egypt not Lower Egypt where our Manetho is thought to have functioned as a chief priest. The name Manetho is rare but there is no reason ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' to assume that the Manetho of the ''Hibeh Papyri'' is the historian from Sebennytus who is thought to have authored the ''Aegyptiaca'' for Ptolemy Philadelphus.\n\nManetho is described as a native Egyptian and Egyptian would have been his mother tongue. Though the topics he supposedly wrote about dealt with Egyptian matters, he is said to have written exclusively in the Greek language for a Greek-speaking audience. Other literary works attributed to him include ''Against [[Herodotus]]'', ''The Sacred Book'', ''On Antiquity and Religion'', ''On Festivals'', ''On the Preparation of [[Kyphi]]'', and the ''Digest of Physics''. The treatise ''[[Book of Sothis]]'' has also been attributed to Manetho. It is important to note that not one of these works are actually attested during the Ptolemaic period when Manetho of Sebennytus is said to have lived. In fact, they are not mentioned in any source prior to the 1st century AD. This would be a gap of three centuries between the time the ''Aegyptiaca'' was supposedly composed and its first attestation. The gap is even larger for the other works attributed to Manetho such as ''The Sacred Book'' which is mentioned for the very first time by [[Eusebius]] in the 4th century AD.<ref>Waddell (1940), pp. 188-189.</ref>\n\nIf Manetho of Sebennytus was an historical figure he was probably a priest of the [[Solar deity|sun-god]] [[Ra]] at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] (according to [[George Syncellus]], he was the chief priest). He was considered by Plutarch to be an authority on the cult of [[Serapis]] (a derivation of [[Osiris]] and [[Apis (god)|Apis]]). Serapis itself was a Greco-Macedonian version of the Egyptian cult, probably started after [[Alexander the Great]]'s establishment of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt. A statue of the god was imported in 286 BC by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (or in 278 BC by Ptolemy II Philadelphus) as [[Tacitus]] and [[Plutarch]] attest.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' 4.83; Plutarch, ''De Iside et Osiride'' 28.</ref> There was also a tradition in antiquity that [[Timotheus of Athens]] (an authority on [[Demeter]] at [[Eleusis]]) directed the project together with Manetho, but the source of this information is not clear and it may originate from one of the literary works attributed to Manetho, in which case it has no independent value and does not corroborate the historicity of Manetho the priest-historian of the early 3rd century BC.\n\n==''Aegyptiaca''==\nThe ''Aegyptiaca'' ({{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac}}, ''Aigyptiaka''), the \"History of Egypt\", may have been Manetho's largest work, and certainly the most important. It was organised chronologically and divided into three volumes, and his division of rulers into dynasties was an innovation. However, he did not use the term in the modern sense, by bloodlines, but rather, introduced new dynasties whenever he detected some sort of discontinuity whether geographical ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty IV]] from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty V]] from [[Elephantine]]), or genealogical (especially in [[First dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty I]], he refers to each successive Pharaoh as the \"son\" of the previous to define what he means by \"continuity\"). Within the superstructure of a genealogical table, he fills in the gaps with substantial narratives of the Pharaonic kings.\n\nSome have suggested that ''Aegyptiaca'' was written as a competing account to [[Herodotus]]' ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]],'' to provide a national history for Egypt that did not exist before. From this perspective, ''Against Herodotus'' may have been an abridged version or just a part of ''Aegyptiaca'' that circulated independently. Unfortunately, neither survives in its original form today.\n\n===Transmission and reception===\nThe problem with a close study of Manetho, despite the reliance of Egyptologists on him for their reconstructions of the Egyptian dynasties, is that not only was ''Aegyptiaca'' not preserved as a whole, but it also became involved in a rivalry between advocates of Egyptian, Jewish, and Greek histories in the form of supporting [[polemic]]s. During this period, disputes raged concerning the oldest civilizations, and so Manetho's account was probably excerpted during this time for use in this argument with significant alterations. Material similar to Manetho's has been found in Lysimakhos of Alexandria, a brother of [[Philo]], and it has been suggested{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} that this was inserted into Manetho. We do not know when this might have occurred, but scholars{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} specify a [[wiktionary:terminus ante quem|''terminus ante quem'']] at the 1st century AD, when Josephus began writing.\n\nThe earliest surviving attestation to Manetho is that of Josephus' ''[[Contra Apionem]]'' (\"Against Apion\") nearly four centuries after ''Aegyptiaca'' was composed. Even here, it is clear that Josephus did not have the originals, and constructed a [[polemic]] against Manetho without them. [[Avaris]] and [[Osarseph]] are both mentioned twice (1.78, 86\u201387; 238, 250). ''Apion'' 1.95\u201397 is merely a list of kings with no narratives until 1.98, while running across two of Manetho's dynasties without mention ([[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasties XVIII]] and [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|XIX]]).\n\nContemporaneously or perhaps after Josephus wrote, an ''[[Epitome]]'' of Manetho's work must have been circulated. This would have involved preserving the outlines of his dynasties and a few details deemed significant. For the first ruler of the first Dynasty, [[Menes]], we learn that \"he was snatched and killed by a [[hippopotamus]]\". The extent to which the epitome preserved Manetho's original writing is unclear, so caution must be exercised. Nevertheless, the epitome was preserved by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]. Because Africanus predates Eusebius, his version is usually considered more reliable, but there is no assurance that this is the case. Eusebius in turn was preserved by [[Jerome]] in his Latin translation, an [[Armenian language|Armenian]] translation, and by [[George Syncellus]]. Syncellus recognized the similarities between Eusebius and Africanus, so he placed them side by side in his work, ''Ecloga Chronographica''.\n\nThese last four copies are what remains of the epitome of Manetho. Other significant fragments include [[Malalas]]'s ''Chronographia'' and ''Excerpta Latina Barbari'' (\"Excerpts in Bad Latin\").\n\n===Sources and methods===\nManetho's methods involved the use of king-lists to provide a structure for his history. There were precedents to his writing available in Egypt (plenty of which have survived to this day), and his [[Hellenistic]] and Egyptian background would have been influential in his writing. Josephus records him admitting to using \"nameless oral tradition\" (1.105) and \"myths and legends\" (1.229) for his account, and there is no reason to doubt this, as admissions of this type were common among historians of that era. His familiarity with Egyptian legends is indisputable, but how he came to know Greek is more open to debate. He must have been familiar with Herodotus, and in some cases, he even attempted to synchronize Egyptian history with Greek (for example, equating King [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] with [[Amenophis]], and Armesis with [[Danaos]]). This suggests he was also familiar with the Greek [[Epic Cycle]] (for which the Ethiopian Memnon is slain by [[Achilles]] during the [[Trojan War]]) and the history of Argos (in [[Aeschylus]]'s ''Suppliants''). However, it has also been suggested that these were later [[interpolation]]s, particularly when the epitome was being written, so these guesses are at best tentative. At the very least, he wrote in fluent [[Koine|''Koin\u00ea'']] Greek.\n\n====King lists====\nThe king-list that Manetho had access to is unknown to us, but of the surviving king-lists, the one most similar to his is the [[Turin Royal Canon]] (or ''Turin Papyrus''). The oldest source with which we can compare to Manetho are the ''[[Old Kingdom]] Annals'' (c. 2500-2200 BC). From the [[New Kingdom]] are the [[Karnak king list|list at Karnak]] (constructed by order of [[Thutmose III|Thutmose]]), two at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] (by [[Seti I]] and [[Ramesses II]]&mdash; the latter a duplicate but updated version of the former), and the [[Saqqara King List|Saqqara list]] by the priest Tenry.\n\nThe provenance of the ''Old Kingdom Annals'' is unknown, surviving as the [[Palermo stone|Palermo Stone]]. The differences between the ''Annals'' and Manetho are great. The ''Annals'' only reach to the fifth dynasty, but its pre-dynastic rulers are listed as the kings of [[Lower Egypt]] and kings of [[Upper Egypt]]. By contrast, Manetho lists several Greek and Egyptian gods beginning with [[Hephaistos]] and [[Helios]]. Secondly, the ''Annals'' give annual reports of the activities of the kings, while there is little probability that Manetho would have been able to go into such detail.\n\nThe New Kingdom lists are each selective in their listings: that of [[Seti I]], for instance, lists seventy-six kings from Dynasties I to XIX omitting the [[Hyksos]] rulers and those associated with the [[heresy|heretic]] [[Akhenaten]]. The [[Saqqara King List|Saqqara list]], contemporaneous with [[Ramesses II]], has fifty-eight names, with similar omissions. If Manetho used these lists at all, he would have been unable to get all of his information from them alone, due to the selective nature of their records. Verbrugghe and Wickersham argue:\n\n{{quote|[...] The purpose of these lists was to cover the walls of a sacred room in which the reigning Pharaoh (or other worshiper, as in the case of Tenry and his Saqqara list) made offerings or prayers to his or her predecessors, imagined as ancestors. Each royal house had a particular traditional list of these \"ancestors,\" different from that of the other houses. The purpose of these lists is not historical but religious. It is not that they are trying and failing to give a complete list. They are not trying at all. Seti and Ramesses did not wish to make offerings to [[Akhenaten]], [[Tutankhamen]], or [[Hatshepsut]], and that is why they are omitted, not because their existence was unknown or deliberately ignored in a broader historical sense. For this reason, the Pharaonic king-lists were generally wrong for Manetho's purposes, and we should commend Manetho for not basing his account on them (2000:105).}}\n\nThese large ''[[stelae]]'' stand in contrast to the Turin Royal Canon (like Saqqara, contemporaneous with Ramesses II), written in [[hieratic]] script. Like Manetho, it begins with the gods, and seems to be an epitome very similar in spirit and style to Manetho. Interestingly, the opposite side of the papyrus includes government records. Verbrugghe and Wickersham suggest that a comprehensive list like this would be necessary for a government office \"to date contracts, leases, debts, titles, and other instruments (2000:106)\" and so could not have been selective the way the king-lists in temples were. Despite numerous differences between the Turin Canon and Manetho, the format must have been available to him. As a priest (or chief priest), he would have had access to practically all written materials in the temple.\n\nWhile the precise origins for Manetho's king-list are unknown, it was certainly a Northern [[Lower Egypt]]ian one. This can be deduced most noticeably from his selection of the kings for the [[Third Intermediate Period]]. Manetho consistently includes the [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanite]] [[Dynasty 21]] and [[Dynasty 22]] lineage in his ''Epitome'' such as [[Psusennes I]], [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]] and even such short-lived kings like [[Amenemnisu]] (5 years) and [[Osochor]] (6 years). In contrast, he ignores the existence of [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] kings such as [[Osorkon III]], [[Takelot III]], [[Harsiese A]] and [[Pinedjem I]] and kings from [[Middle Egypt]] like [[Peftjaubast]] of [[Herakleopolis]]. This implies that Manetho derived the primary sources for his ''Epitome'' from a local city's temple library in the region of the River [[Nile Delta]] which was controlled by the Tanite-based Dynasty 21 and Dynasty 22 kings. The Middle and Upper Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s did not have any effect upon this specific region of the Delta; hence their exclusion from Manetho's king-list.\n\n====Transcriptions of Pharaonic names====\nBy the Middle Kingdom, Egyptian kings each had [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|five different names]], the \"Horus\" name; the \"Two Ladies\" name; the \"Gold Horus\" name; the ''praenomen'' or \"throne name\"; and a ''nomen'', the personal name given at birth (also called a \"Son of Ra\" name as it was preceded by ''Sa Re&#39;''). Some Pharaohs also had multiple examples within these names, such as [[Ramesses II]] who used six Horus names at various times.  Because Manetho's transcriptions agree with many king-lists, it is generally accepted that he was reliant on one or more such lists, and it is not clear to what extent he was aware of the different pharaonic names of rulers long past (and he had alternate names for some). Not all the different names for each king have been uncovered.\n\nManetho did not choose consistently from the five different types of names, but in some cases, a straightforward transcription is possible.  Egyptian ''Men'' or ''Meni'' (Son of Ra and king-list names) becomes ''Menes'' (officially, this is Pharaoh I.1 [[Narmer]]&mdash;\"I\" represents Dynasty I, and \"1\" means the first king of that dynasty), while ''Menkauhor''/''Menkahor'' (Throne and king-list names, the Horus names is ''Menkhau'' and the Son of Ra name is \"Kaiu Horkaiu&#91;...&#93;\") is transcribed as ''Menkheres'' (V.7 [[Menkauhor]]). Others involve a slight abbreviation, such as ''A'akheperen-Re&#39;'' (Throne and king-list names) becoming ''Khebron'' (XVIII.4 [[Thutmose II]]). A few more have consonants switched for unknown reasons, as for example ''Tausret'' becoming ''Thouoris'' (XIX.6 Twosre/[[Tausret]]). One puzzle is in the conflicting names of some early dynastic kings&mdash; though they did not have all five titles, they still had multiple names. I.3/4 [[Djer]], whose Son of Ra name is ''Itti'' is considered the basis for Manetho's I.2 Athothis. I.4 Oenephes then is a puzzle unless it is compared with Djer's Gold Horus name, ''Ennebu''. It may be that Manetho duplicated the name or he had a source for a name unknown to us. Finally, there are some names where the association is a complete mystery to us. V.6 Rhathoures/Niuserre's complete name was ''Set-ib-tawi Set-ib-Nebty Netjeri-bik-nebu Ni-user-Re' Ini Ni-user-Re&#39;'', but Manetho writes it as Rhathoures. It may be that some pharaohs were known by names other than even just the five official ones.\n\nThus, how Manetho transcribed these names varies, and as such we cannot reconstruct the original Egyptian forms of the names. However, because of the simplicity with which Manetho transcribed long names (see above), they were preferred until original king-lists began to be uncovered in Egyptian sites, translated, and corroborated. Manetho's division of dynasties, however, is still used as a basis for all Egyptian discussions.\n\n===Content===\n'''Volume 1''' begins from the earliest times, listing gods and [[demigods]] as kings of Egypt. Stories of [[Isis]], Osiris, [[Set (mythology)|Set]], or [[Horus]] might have been found here. Manetho does not transliterate either, but gives the [[Interpretatio graeca|Greek equivalents by a convention]] that predates him: (Egyptian) Ptah = (Greek) Hephaistos; Isis = Demeter; Thoth = Hermes; Horus = Apollo; Seth = Typhon; etc. This is one of the clues as to how [[syncretism]] developed between seemingly disparate religions. He then proceeds to Dynastic Egypt, from Dynasty I to [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|XI]]. This would have included the Old Kingdom, the First Intermediate Period, and the early Middle Kingdom.\n\n'''Volume 2''' covers [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasties XII]]\u2013[[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|XIX]], which includes the end of the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period (XV\u2013XVII&mdash;the [[Hyksos]] invasion), and then their expulsion and the establishment of the New Kingdom (XVIII onward). The Second Intermediate Period was of particular interest to Josephus, where he equated the Hyksos or \"shepherd-kings\" as the ancient [[Israel]]ites who eventually made their way out of Egypt (''Apion'' 1.82\u201392). He even includes a brief etymological discussion of the term \"Hyksos\".\n\n'''Volume 3''' continues with [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XX]] and concludes with Dynasty [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|XXX]] (or XXXI, see below). The [[Sais, Egypt|Saite]] Renaissance occurs in [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XXVI]], while Dynasty [[Twenty-seventh dynasty of Egypt|XXVII]] involves the [[Achaemenid]] interruption of Egyptian rule. Three more local dynasties are mentioned, though they must have overlapped with [[Persia]]n rule. Dynasty [[Thirty-first dynasty of Egypt|XXXI]] consisted of three Persian rulers, and some have suggested that this was added by a continuator. Both [[Moses of Chorene]] and [[Saint Jerome|Jerome]] end at [[Nectanebo II]] (\"last king of the Egyptians\" and \"destruction of the Egyptian monarchy\" respectively), but Dynasty XXXI fits within Manetho's schemata of demonstrating power through the ''dynasteia'' well. The Thirty-second dynasty would have been the [[Ptolemies]].\n\n===Similarities with Berossos===\nMost of the ancient witnesses group him together with [[Berossos]], and treat the pair as similar in intent, and it is not a coincidence that those who preserved the bulk of their writing are largely the same (Josephus, Africanus, Eusebius, and Syncellus). Certainly, both wrote about the same time, and both adopted the historiographical approach of the Greek historians Herodotus and [[Hesiod]], who preceded them. While the subjects of their history are different, the form is similar, using chronological royal genealogies as the structure for the narratives. Both extend their histories far into the mythic past, to give the [[deity|gods]] rule over the earliest ancestral histories.\n\nSyncellus goes so far as to insinuate that the two copied each other:\n\n{{quote|If one carefully examines the underlying chronological lists of events, one will have full confidence that the design of both is false, as both Berossos and Manetho, as I have said before, want to glorify each his own nation, Berossos the [[Chaldea]]n, Manetho the Egyptian. One can only stand in amazement that they were not ashamed to place the beginning of their incredible story in each in one and the same year.<ref>''Ecloga Chronographica'', 30</ref>}}\n\nWhile this does seem an incredible coincidence, the reliability of the report is unclear. The reasoning for assuming they started their histories in the same year involved some considerable contortions. Berossos dated the period before the [[Deluge (mythology)|Flood]] to 120 ''saroi'' (3,600 year periods), giving an estimate of 432,000 years before the Flood. This was unacceptable to later Christian commentators, so it was assumed he meant solar days. 432,000 divided by 365 days gives a rough figure of 1,183\u00bd years before the Flood. For Manetho, even more numeric contortions ensued. With no flood mentioned, they assumed that Manetho's first era describing the gods represented the ante-diluvian age. Secondly, they took the spurious ''[[Book of Sothis]]'' for a chronological count. Six dynasties of gods totalled 11,985 years, while the nine dynasties with demigods came to 858 years. Again, this was too long for the Biblical account, so two different units of conversion were used. The 11,985 years were considered to be months of 29\u00bd days each (a conversion used in antiquity, for example by [[Diodorus Siculus]]), which comes out to 969 years. The latter period, however, was divided into seasons, or quarters of a year, and reduces to 214\u00bd years (another conversion attested to by Diodorus). The sum of these comes out to 1,183\u00bd years, equal to that of Berossos. Syncellus rejected both Manetho's and Berossos' incredible time-spans, as well as the efforts of other commentators to harmonise their numbers with the [[Bible]]. Ironically as we see, he also blamed them for the synchronicity concocted by later writers.\n\n===Effect of ''Aegyptiaca''===\nIt is speculated that Manetho wrote at the request of [[Ptolemy I]] or [[Ptolemy II|II]] to give an account of the history of Egypt to the Greeks from a native's perspective. However, there is no evidence for this hypothesis. If such were the case, ''Aegyptiaca'' was a failure, since Herodotus' ''Histories'' continued to provide the standard account in the Hellenistic world. It may also have been that some nationalistic sentiments in Manetho provided the impetus for his writing, but that again is conjecture. It is clear, however, that when it was written, it would have proven to be the authoritative account of the history of Egypt, superior to Herodotus in every way. The completeness and systematic nature in which he collected his sources was unprecedented. \nSyncellus similarly recognised its importance when recording Eusebius and Africanus, and even provided a separate witness from the ''Book of Sothis''.  Unfortunately, this material is likely to have been a forgery or hoax of unknown date. Every king in ''Sothis'' after [[Menes]] is irreconcilable with the versions of Africanus and Eusebius. Manetho should not be judged on the factuality of his account, but on the method he used to record history, and in this, he was as successful as Herodotus and Hesiod.\n\nFinally, in modern times, the effect is still visible in the way Egyptologists divide the dynasties of the pharaohs. The French explorer and Egyptologist, [[Jean-Francois Champollion|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]], reportedly held a copy of Manetho's lists in one hand as he attempted to decipher the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] he encountered (though it probably gave him more frustration than joy, considering the way Manetho transcribed the names). Most modern scholarship that mentions the names of the pharaohs will render both the modern transcription and Manetho's version, and Manetho's names are even preferred to more authentic ones in some cases. Today, his division of dynasties is used universally, and this has permeated the study of nearly all royal genealogies by the conceptualization of succession in terms of dynasties or houses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Egypt}}\n*[[Berossus]]\n*[[History of Ancient Egypt]]\n*[[List of lists of ancient kings]]\n*[[Plutarch]]\n*[[Ptolemaic dynasty]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Barclay, John M.G., 2011.

Manetho links himself directly to Pharaoh Ptolemy II.|337x337px]]\nIf the mention of someone named Manetho in the ''Hibeh Papyri'', dated to 241/240 BC, is in fact the celebrated author of the ''Aegyptiaca'', then Manetho may well have been working during the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] (246\u2013222 BC) as well but at a very advanced age. Though the historicity of Manetho of Sebennytus was taken for granted by Josephus and later authors the question as to whether he actually existed remains problematic. The Manetho of the ''Hibeh Papyri'' has no title and this letter deals with affairs in Upper Egypt not Lower Egypt where our Manetho is thought to have functioned as a chief priest. The name Manetho is rare but there is no reason ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' to assume that the Manetho of the ''Hibeh Papyri'' is the historian from Sebennytus who is thought to have authored the ''Aegyptiaca'' for Ptolemy Philadelphus.\n\nManetho is described as a native Egyptian and Egyptian would have been his mother tongue. Though the topics he supposedly wrote about dealt with Egyptian matters, he is said to have written exclusively in the Greek language for a Greek-speaking audience. Other literary works attributed to him include ''Against [[Herodotus]]'', ''The Sacred Book'', ''On Antiquity and Religion'', ''On Festivals'', ''On the Preparation of [[Kyphi]]'', and the ''Digest of Physics''. The treatise ''[[Book of Sothis]]'' has also been attributed to Manetho. It is important to note that not one of these works are actually attested during the Ptolemaic period when Manetho of Sebennytus is said to have lived. In fact, they are not mentioned in any source prior to the 1st century AD. This would be a gap of three centuries between the time the ''Aegyptiaca'' was supposedly composed and its first attestation. The gap is even larger for the other works attributed to Manetho such as ''The Sacred Book'' which is mentioned for the very first time by [[Eusebius]] in the 4th century AD.<ref>Waddell (1940), pp. 188-189.</ref>\n\nIf Manetho of Sebennytus was an historical figure he was probably a priest of the [[Solar deity|sun-god]] [[Ra]] at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] (according to [[George Syncellus]], he was the chief priest). He was considered by Plutarch to be an authority on the cult of [[Serapis]] (a derivation of [[Osiris]] and [[Apis (god)|Apis]]). Serapis itself was a Greco-Macedonian version of the Egyptian cult, probably started after [[Alexander the Great]]'s establishment of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt. A statue of the god was imported in 286 BC by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (or in 278 BC by Ptolemy II Philadelphus) as [[Tacitus]] and [[Plutarch]] attest.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' 4.83; Plutarch, ''De Iside et Osiride'' 28.</ref> There was also a tradition in antiquity that [[Timotheus of Athens]] (an authority on [[Demeter]] at [[Eleusis]]) directed the project together with Manetho, but the source of this information is not clear and it may originate from one of the literary works attributed to Manetho, in which case it has no independent value and does not corroborate the historicity of Manetho the priest-historian of the early 3rd century BC.\n\n==''Aegyptiaca''==\nThe ''Aegyptiaca'' ({{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac}}, ''Aigyptiaka''), the \"History of Egypt\", may have been Manetho's largest work, and certainly the most important. It was organised chronologically and divided into three volumes, and his division of rulers into dynasties was an innovation. However, he did not use the term in the modern sense, by bloodlines, but rather, introduced new dynasties whenever he detected some sort of discontinuity whether geographical ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty IV]] from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty V]] from [[Elephantine]]), or genealogical (especially in [[First dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty I]], he refers to each successive Pharaoh as the \"son\" of the previous to define what he means by \"continuity\"). Within the superstructure of a genealogical table, he fills in the gaps with substantial narratives of the Pharaonic kings.\n\nSome have suggested that ''Aegyptiaca'' was written as a competing account to [[Herodotus]]' ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]],'' to provide a national history for Egypt that did not exist before. From this perspective, ''Against Herodotus'' may have been an abridged version or just a part of ''Aegyptiaca'' that circulated independently. Unfortunately, neither survives in its original form today.\n\n===Transmission and reception===\nThe problem with a close study of Manetho, despite the reliance of Egyptologists on him for their reconstructions of the Egyptian dynasties, is that not only was ''Aegyptiaca'' not preserved as a whole, but it also became involved in a rivalry between advocates of Egyptian, Jewish, and Greek histories in the form of supporting [[polemic]]s. During this period, disputes raged concerning the oldest civilizations, and so Manetho's account was probably excerpted during this time for use in this argument with significant alterations. Material similar to Manetho's has been found in Lysimakhos of Alexandria, a brother of [[Philo]], and it has been suggested{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} that this was inserted into Manetho. We do not know when this might have occurred, but scholars{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} specify a [[wiktionary:terminus ante quem|''terminus ante quem'']] at the 1st century AD, when Josephus began writing.\n\nThe earliest surviving attestation to Manetho is that of Josephus' ''[[Contra Apionem]]'' (\"Against Apion\") nearly four centuries after ''Aegyptiaca'' was composed. Even here, it is clear that Josephus did not have the originals, and constructed a [[polemic]] against Manetho without them. [[Avaris]] and [[Osarseph]] are both mentioned twice (1.78, 86\u201387; 238, 250). ''Apion'' 1.95\u201397 is merely a list of kings with no narratives until 1.98, while running across two of Manetho's dynasties without mention ([[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasties XVIII]] and [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|XIX]]).\n\nContemporaneously or perhaps after Josephus wrote, an ''[[Epitome]]'' of Manetho's work must have been circulated. This would have involved preserving the outlines of his dynasties and a few details deemed significant. For the first ruler of the first Dynasty, [[Menes]], we learn that \"he was snatched and killed by a [[hippopotamus]]\". The extent to which the epitome preserved Manetho's original writing is unclear, so caution must be exercised. Nevertheless, the epitome was preserved by [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]. Because Africanus predates Eusebius, his version is usually considered more reliable, but there is no assurance that this is the case. Eusebius in turn was preserved by [[Jerome]] in his Latin translation, an [[Armenian language|Armenian]] translation, and by [[George Syncellus]]. Syncellus recognized the similarities between Eusebius and Africanus, so he placed them side by side in his work, ''Ecloga Chronographica''.\n\nThese last four copies are what remains of the epitome of Manetho. Other significant fragments include [[Malalas]]'s ''Chronographia'' and ''Excerpta Latina Barbari'' (\"Excerpts in Bad Latin\").\n\n===Sources and methods===\nManetho's methods involved the use of king-lists to provide a structure for his history. There were precedents to his writing available in Egypt (plenty of which have survived to this day), and his [[Hellenistic]] and Egyptian background would have been influential in his writing. Josephus records him admitting to using \"nameless oral tradition\" (1.105) and \"myths and legends\" (1.229) for his account, and there is no reason to doubt this, as admissions of this type were common among historians of that era. His familiarity with Egyptian legends is indisputable, but how he came to know Greek is more open to debate. He must have been familiar with Herodotus, and in some cases, he even attempted to synchronize Egyptian history with Greek (for example, equating King [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] with [[Amenophis]], and Armesis with [[Danaos]]). This suggests he was also familiar with the Greek [[Epic Cycle]] (for which the Ethiopian Memnon is slain by [[Achilles]] during the [[Trojan War]]) and the history of Argos (in [[Aeschylus]]'s ''Suppliants''). However, it has also been suggested that these were later [[interpolation]]s, particularly when the epitome was being written, so these guesses are at best tentative. At the very least, he wrote in fluent [[Koine|''Koin\u00ea'']] Greek.\n\n====King lists====\nThe king-list that Manetho had access to is unknown to us, but of the surviving king-lists, the one most similar to his is the [[Turin Royal Canon]] (or ''Turin Papyrus''). The oldest source with which we can compare to Manetho are the ''[[Old Kingdom]] Annals'' (c. 2500-2200 BC). From the [[New Kingdom]] are the [[Karnak king list|list at Karnak]] (constructed by order of [[Thutmose III|Thutmose]]), two at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] (by [[Seti I]] and [[Ramesses II]]&mdash; the latter a duplicate but updated version of the former), and the [[Saqqara King List|Saqqara list]] by the priest Tenry.\n\nThe provenance of the ''Old Kingdom Annals'' is unknown, surviving as the [[Palermo stone|Palermo Stone]]. The differences between the ''Annals'' and Manetho are great. The ''Annals'' only reach to the fifth dynasty, but its pre-dynastic rulers are listed as the kings of [[Lower Egypt]] and kings of [[Upper Egypt]]. By contrast, Manetho lists several Greek and Egyptian gods beginning with [[Hephaistos]] and [[Helios]]. Secondly, the ''Annals'' give annual reports of the activities of the kings, while there is little probability that Manetho would have been able to go into such detail.\n\nThe New Kingdom lists are each selective in their listings: that of [[Seti I]], for instance, lists seventy-six kings from Dynasties I to XIX omitting the [[Hyksos]] rulers and those associated with the [[heresy|heretic]] [[Akhenaten]]. The [[Saqqara King List|Saqqara list]], contemporaneous with [[Ramesses II]], has fifty-eight names, with similar omissions. If Manetho used these lists at all, he would have been unable to get all of his information from them alone, due to the selective nature of their records. Verbrugghe and Wickersham argue:\n\n{{quote|[...] The purpose of these lists was to cover the walls of a sacred room in which the reigning Pharaoh (or other worshiper, as in the case of Tenry and his Saqqara list) made offerings or prayers to his or her predecessors, imagined as ancestors. Each royal house had a particular traditional list of these \"ancestors,\" different from that of the other houses. The purpose of these lists is not historical but religious. It is not that they are trying and failing to give a complete list. They are not trying at all. Seti and Ramesses did not wish to make offerings to [[Akhenaten]], [[Tutankhamen]], or [[Hatshepsut]], and that is why they are omitted, not because their existence was unknown or deliberately ignored in a broader historical sense. For this reason, the Pharaonic king-lists were generally wrong for Manetho's purposes, and we should commend Manetho for not basing his account on them (2000:105).}}\n\nThese large ''[[stelae]]'' stand in contrast to the Turin Royal Canon (like Saqqara, contemporaneous with Ramesses II), written in [[hieratic]] script. Like Manetho, it begins with the gods, and seems to be an epitome very similar in spirit and style to Manetho. Interestingly, the opposite side of the papyrus includes government records. Verbrugghe and Wickersham suggest that a comprehensive list like this would be necessary for a government office \"to date contracts, leases, debts, titles, and other instruments (2000:106)\" and so could not have been selective the way the king-lists in temples were. Despite numerous differences between the Turin Canon and Manetho, the format must have been available to him. As a priest (or chief priest), he would have had access to practically all written materials in the temple.\n\nWhile the precise origins for Manetho's king-list are unknown, it was certainly a Northern [[Lower Egypt]]ian one. This can be deduced most noticeably from his selection of the kings for the [[Third Intermediate Period]]. Manetho consistently includes the [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanite]] [[Dynasty 21]] and [[Dynasty 22]] lineage in his ''Epitome'' such as [[Psusennes I]], [[Amenemope (pharaoh)|Amenemope]] and even such short-lived kings like [[Amenemnisu]] (5 years) and [[Osochor]] (6 years). In contrast, he ignores the existence of [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] kings such as [[Osorkon III]], [[Takelot III]], [[Harsiese A]] and [[Pinedjem I]] and kings from [[Middle Egypt]] like [[Peftjaubast]] of [[Herakleopolis]]. This implies that Manetho derived the primary sources for his ''Epitome'' from a local city's temple library in the region of the River [[Nile Delta]] which was controlled by the Tanite-based Dynasty 21 and Dynasty 22 kings. The Middle and Upper Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s did not have any effect upon this specific region of the Delta; hence their exclusion from Manetho's king-list.\n\n====Transcriptions of Pharaonic names====\nBy the Middle Kingdom, Egyptian kings each had [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|five different names]], the \"Horus\" name; the \"Two Ladies\" name; the \"Gold Horus\" name; the ''praenomen'' or \"throne name\"; and a ''nomen'', the personal name given at birth (also called a \"Son of Ra\" name as it was preceded by ''Sa Re&#39;''). Some Pharaohs also had multiple examples within these names, such as [[Ramesses II]] who used six Horus names at various times.  Because Manetho's transcriptions agree with many king-lists, it is generally accepted that he was reliant on one or more such lists, and it is not clear to what extent he was aware of the different pharaonic names of rulers long past (and he had alternate names for some). Not all the different names for each king have been uncovered.\n\nManetho did not choose consistently from the five different types of names, but in some cases, a straightforward transcription is possible.  Egyptian ''Men'' or ''Meni'' (Son of Ra and king-list names) becomes ''Menes'' (officially, this is Pharaoh I.1 [[Narmer]]&mdash;\"I\" represents Dynasty I, and \"1\" means the first king of that dynasty), while ''Menkauhor''/''Menkahor'' (Throne and king-list names, the Horus names is ''Menkhau'' and the Son of Ra name is \"Kaiu Horkaiu&#91;...&#93;\") is transcribed as ''Menkheres'' (V.7 [[Menkauhor]]). Others involve a slight abbreviation, such as ''A'akheperen-Re&#39;'' (Throne and king-list names) becoming ''Khebron'' (XVIII.4 [[Thutmose II]]). A few more have consonants switched for unknown reasons, as for example ''Tausret'' becoming ''Thouoris'' (XIX.6 Twosre/[[Tausret]]). One puzzle is in the conflicting names of some early dynastic kings&mdash; though they did not have all five titles, they still had multiple names. I.3/4 [[Djer]], whose Son of Ra name is ''Itti'' is considered the basis for Manetho's I.2 Athothis. I.4 Oenephes then is a puzzle unless it is compared with Djer's Gold Horus name, ''Ennebu''. It may be that Manetho duplicated the name or he had a source for a name unknown to us. Finally, there are some names where the association is a complete mystery to us. V.6 Rhathoures/Niuserre's complete name was ''Set-ib-tawi Set-ib-Nebty Netjeri-bik-nebu Ni-user-Re' Ini Ni-user-Re&#39;'', but Manetho writes it as Rhathoures. It may be that some pharaohs were known by names other than even just the five official ones.\n\nThus, how Manetho transcribed these names varies, and as such we cannot reconstruct the original Egyptian forms of the names. However, because of the simplicity with which Manetho transcribed long names (see above), they were preferred until original king-lists began to be uncovered in Egyptian sites, translated, and corroborated. Manetho's division of dynasties, however, is still used as a basis for all Egyptian discussions.\n\n===Content===\n'''Volume 1''' begins from the earliest times, listing gods and [[demigods]] as kings of Egypt. Stories of [[Isis]], Osiris, [[Set (mythology)|Set]], or [[Horus]] might have been found here. Manetho does not transliterate either, but gives the [[Interpretatio graeca|Greek equivalents by a convention]] that predates him: (Egyptian) Ptah = (Greek) Hephaistos; Isis = Demeter; Thoth = Hermes; Horus = Apollo; Seth = Typhon; etc. This is one of the clues as to how [[syncretism]] developed between seemingly disparate religions. He then proceeds to Dynastic Egypt, from Dynasty I to [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|XI]]. This would have included the Old Kingdom, the First Intermediate Period, and the early Middle Kingdom.\n\n'''Volume 2''' covers [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasties XII]]\u2013[[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|XIX]], which includes the end of the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period (XV\u2013XVII&mdash;the [[Hyksos]] invasion), and then their expulsion and the establishment of the New Kingdom (XVIII onward). The Second Intermediate Period was of particular interest to Josephus, where he equated the Hyksos or \"shepherd-kings\" as the ancient [[Israel]]ites who eventually made their way out of Egypt (''Apion'' 1.82\u201392). He even includes a brief etymological discussion of the term \"Hyksos\".\n\n'''Volume 3''' continues with [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XX]] and concludes with Dynasty [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|XXX]] (or XXXI, see below). The [[Sais, Egypt|Saite]] Renaissance occurs in [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XXVI]], while Dynasty [[Twenty-seventh dynasty of Egypt|XXVII]] involves the [[Achaemenid]] interruption of Egyptian rule. Three more local dynasties are mentioned, though they must have overlapped with [[Persia]]n rule. Dynasty [[Thirty-first dynasty of Egypt|XXXI]] consisted of three Persian rulers, and some have suggested that this was added by a continuator. Both [[Moses of Chorene]] and [[Saint Jerome|Jerome]] end at [[Nectanebo II]] (\"last king of the Egyptians\" and \"destruction of the Egyptian monarchy\" respectively), but Dynasty XXXI fits within Manetho's schemata of demonstrating power through the ''dynasteia'' well. The Thirty-second dynasty would have been the [[Ptolemies]].\n\n===Similarities with Berossos===\nMost of the ancient witnesses group him together with [[Berossos]], and treat the pair as similar in intent, and it is not a coincidence that those who preserved the bulk of their writing are largely the same (Josephus, Africanus, Eusebius, and Syncellus). Certainly, both wrote about the same time, and both adopted the historiographical approach of the Greek historians Herodotus and [[Hesiod]], who preceded them. While the subjects of their history are different, the form is similar, using chronological royal genealogies as the structure for the narratives. Both extend their histories far into the mythic past, to give the [[deity|gods]] rule over the earliest ancestral histories.\n\nSyncellus goes so far as to insinuate that the two copied each other:\n\n{{quote|If one carefully examines the underlying chronological lists of events, one will have full confidence that the design of both is false, as both Berossos and Manetho, as I have said before, want to glorify each his own nation, Berossos the [[Chaldea]]n, Manetho the Egyptian. One can only stand in amazement that they were not ashamed to place the beginning of their incredible story in each in one and the same year.<ref>''Ecloga Chronographica'', 30</ref>}}\n\nWhile this does seem an incredible coincidence, the reliability of the report is unclear. The reasoning for assuming they started their histories in the same year involved some considerable contortions. Berossos dated the period before the [[Deluge (mythology)|Flood]] to 120 ''saroi'' (3,600 year periods), giving an estimate of 432,000 years before the Flood. This was unacceptable to later Christian commentators, so it was assumed he meant solar days. 432,000 divided by 365 days gives a rough figure of 1,183\u00bd years before the Flood. For Manetho, even more numeric contortions ensued. With no flood mentioned, they assumed that Manetho's first era describing the gods represented the ante-diluvian age. Secondly, they took the spurious ''[[Book of Sothis]]'' for a chronological count. Six dynasties of gods totalled 11,985 years, while the nine dynasties with demigods came to 858 years. Again, this was too long for the Biblical account, so two different units of conversion were used. The 11,985 years were considered to be months of 29\u00bd days each (a conversion used in antiquity, for example by [[Diodorus Siculus]]), which comes out to 969 years. The latter period, however, was divided into seasons, or quarters of a year, and reduces to 214\u00bd years (another conversion attested to by Diodorus). The sum of these comes out to 1,183\u00bd years, equal to that of Berossos. Syncellus rejected both Manetho's and Berossos' incredible time-spans, as well as the efforts of other commentators to harmonise their numbers with the [[Bible]]. Ironically as we see, he also blamed them for the synchronicity concocted by later writers.\n\n===Effect of ''Aegyptiaca''===\nIt is speculated that Manetho wrote at the request of [[Ptolemy I]] or [[Ptolemy II|II]] to give an account of the history of Egypt to the Greeks from a native's perspective. However, there is no evidence for this hypothesis. If such were the case, ''Aegyptiaca'' was a failure, since Herodotus' ''Histories'' continued to provide the standard account in the Hellenistic world. It may also have been that some nationalistic sentiments in Manetho provided the impetus for his writing, but that again is conjecture. It is clear, however, that when it was written, it would have proven to be the authoritative account of the history of Egypt, superior to Herodotus in every way. The completeness and systematic nature in which he collected his sources was unprecedented. \nSyncellus similarly recognised its importance when recording Eusebius and Africanus, and even provided a separate witness from the ''Book of Sothis''.  Unfortunately, this material is likely to have been a forgery or hoax of unknown date. Every king in ''Sothis'' after [[Menes]] is irreconcilable with the versions of Africanus and Eusebius. Manetho should not be judged on the factuality of his account, but on the method he used to record history, and in this, he was as successful as Herodotus and Hesiod.\n\nFinally, in modern times, the effect is still visible in the way Egyptologists divide the dynasties of the pharaohs. The French explorer and Egyptologist, [[Jean-Francois Champollion|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]], reportedly held a copy of Manetho's lists in one hand as he attempted to decipher the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] he encountered (though it probably gave him more frustration than joy, considering the way Manetho transcribed the names). Most modern scholarship that mentions the names of the pharaohs will render both the modern transcription and Manetho's version, and Manetho's names are even preferred to more authentic ones in some cases. Today, his division of dynasties is used universally, and this has permeated the study of nearly all royal genealogies by the conceptualization of succession in terms of dynasties or houses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Egypt}}\n*[[Berossus]]\n*[[History of Ancient Egypt]]\n*[[List of lists of ancient kings]]\n*[[Plutarch]]\n*[[Ptolemaic dynasty]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Barclay, John M.G., 2011.

Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''UTC(NPL)'' in the UTC form, where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  The TAI form may be denoted ''TAI(NPL)''.  The latter is not to be confused with ''TA(NPL)'', which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.\n\nThe clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.<ref name=\"Time n.d.\"/>  This combined time scale is published monthly in \"Circular T\",<ref name=\"Circular T\"/> and is the [[canonical form|canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC \u2212 UTC(''k'') (equivalent to TAI \u2212 TAI(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.  The same circular also gives tables of TAI \u2212 TA(''k''), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.\n\nErrors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T, the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight, it is possible to discover errors in TAI and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Since the published circulars are definitive, better estimates do not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).\n\n==History==\nEarly atomic time scales consisted of [[quartz clock]]s with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)]]. It was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] and to establish a time scale, called Greenwich Atomic (GA). The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale on 13 September 1956, using an [[Atomichron]] commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the [[National Bureau of Standards]], [[Boulder, Colorado]] on 9 October 1957.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=199\u2013200}}\n\nThe [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T<sub>m</sub> or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[VLF]] radio signals. The BIH scale, A.1, and NBS-A were defined by an [[Epoch (date reference)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958{{efn|They were set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant. However, each observatory used its own value of UT2.{{sfn|Guinot|2000|page=181}}}} The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: \"A3\" in 1964<ref>{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Steve |title=The epoch of TAI is 1961-01-01T20:00:00 UT2 |url=https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/taiepoch.html |publisher=UCO/Lick Observatory |quote=By 1964 BIH realized that some atomic chronometers were much better than others, and they constructed A3 based on the best 3}}</ref> and \"TA(BIH)\" in 1969.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=200\u2013201}}\n\nThe SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967. From 1971 to 1975 the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] made a series of decisions which designated the BIPM time scale International Atomic Time (TAI).{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=203\u2013204}} \n\nIn the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale, therefore, corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the [[geoid]]).  Because the clocks were, on average, well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about one part in a trillion.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=215}}\n\nThe instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brumberg|first1=V.A.|last2=Kopeikin|first2=S.M.|title=Relativistic time scales in the solar system|journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy]]|issn=0923-2958|volume=48|issue=1|pages=23\u201344|date=March 1990|doi=10.1007/BF00050674|bibcode=1990CeMDA..48...23B}}</ref>  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.{{efn|The 32.184 second offset is to provide continuity with the older [[ephemeris time]].}} TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&nbsp;s.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=218&ndash;219}}\n\nThe continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated, \"In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |title=CCTF 09-27 \n |url=http://www.bipm.org/cc/CCTF/Allowed/18/CCTF_09-27_note_on_UTC-ITU-R.pdf \n |date=3 September 2007 \n |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures \n |access-date=24 September 2016 \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316100907/http://www.bipm.org/cc/CCTF/Allowed/18/CCTF_09-27_note_on_UTC-ITU-R.pdf \n |archive-date=16 March 2012 \n |url-status=live \n |df=dmy-all \n}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Relation to UTC==\nUTC is a [[discontinuous]] time scale. It is regularly adjusted by leap seconds. Between these adjustments, it is composed of segments that are linear transformations of atomic time. From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971, the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated [[UT2]].  Afterwards, these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate [[UT1]].  This was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale; the post-1971 more linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally. The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=227&ndash;229}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Clock synchronization]]\n* [[Network Time Protocol]]\n* [[Precision Time Protocol]]\n* [[Time and frequency transfer]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web\n|title=History of TAI\u2212UTC\n|url=ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat\n|publisher=Time Service Dept., United States Naval Observatory\n|date=2009\n|accessdate=4 January 2010\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719193539/http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat\n|archive-date=19 July 2011\n|url-status=dead\n}}\n* {{cite web \n|title=International Atomic Time \n|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html \n|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] \n|accessdate=24 January 2020\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110113226/http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html \n|archive-date=10 January 2011 \n|url-status=live \n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{ cite book \n| ref = harv \n| last = Guinot\n| first = B\n| chapter = History of the Bureau International de l'Heure\n| title = Polar Motion: Historical and Scientific Problems\n| series = ASP Conference Series, Vol. 208\n| isbn = 1-58381-039-0\n| date = 2000\n| bibcode = 2000pmhs.conf..175G \n}}\n* {{Cite book \n|ref=harv |title=Time: From Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics \n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7NdrK4e77CIC \n|authorlink=Dennis D.

TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.\n\n==Operation==\nTAI is a [[weighted average]] of the time kept by over 400 [[atomic clock]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://iag.dgfi.tum.de/fileadmin/IAG-docs/Travaux2013/08_BIPM.pdf |title=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) Time Department |publisher=Report of the International Association of Geodesy 2011-2013 |date= |accessdate=11 April 2017 }}</ref> in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.<ref name=\"Time n.d.\">{{cite web \n|title = Time\n|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/ \n|publisher = International Bureau of Weights and Measures \n|access-date = 22 May 2013 \n}}</ref> The majority of the clocks involved are [[caesium clock]]s; the [[International System of Units]] (SI) definition of the [[second]] is based on [[caesium]].{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=207, 214}} The clocks are compared using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signals and [[two-way satellite time and frequency transfer]].<ref name=\"Circular T\">{{citation |title=Circular T |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] |url=ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/  |access-date=2017-09-05}}</ref>  Due to the [[signal averaging]] TAI is an [[order of magnitude]] more stable than its best constituent clock.\n\nThe participating institutions each broadcast, in [[real-time data|real time]], a frequency signal with [[timecode]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''UTC(NPL)'' in the UTC form, where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  The TAI form may be denoted ''TAI(NPL)''.  The latter is not to be confused with ''TA(NPL)'', which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.\n\nThe clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.<ref name=\"Time n.d.\"/>  This combined time scale is published monthly in \"Circular T\",<ref name=\"Circular T\"/> and is the [[canonical form|canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC \u2212 UTC(''k'') (equivalent to TAI \u2212 TAI(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.  The same circular also gives tables of TAI \u2212 TA(''k''), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.\n\nErrors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T, the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight, it is possible to discover errors in TAI and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Since the published circulars are definitive, better estimates do not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).\n\n==History==\nEarly atomic time scales consisted of [[quartz clock]]s with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)]]. It was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] and to establish a time scale, called Greenwich Atomic (GA). The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale on 13 September 1956, using an [[Atomichron]] commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the [[National Bureau of Standards]], [[Boulder, Colorado]] on 9 October 1957.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=199\u2013200}}\n\nThe [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T<sub>m</sub> or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[VLF]] radio signals. The BIH scale, A.1, and NBS-A were defined by an [[Epoch (date reference)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958{{efn|They were set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant. However, each observatory used its own value of UT2.{{sfn|Guinot|2000|page=181}}}} The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: \"A3\" in 1964<ref>{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Steve |title=The epoch of TAI is 1961-01-01T20:00:00 UT2 |url=https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/taiepoch.html |publisher=UCO/Lick Observatory |quote=By 1964 BIH realized that some atomic chronometers were much better than others, and they constructed A3 based on the best 3}}</ref> and \"TA(BIH)\" in 1969.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=200\u2013201}}\n\nThe SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967. From 1971 to 1975 the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] and the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] made a series of decisions which designated the BIPM time scale International Atomic Time (TAI).{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|pages=203\u2013204}} \n\nIn the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale, therefore, corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the [[geoid]]).  Because the clocks were, on average, well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about one part in a trillion.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=215}}\n\nThe instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brumberg|first1=V.A.|last2=Kopeikin|first2=S.M.|title=Relativistic time scales in the solar system|journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy]]|issn=0923-2958|volume=48|issue=1|pages=23\u201344|date=March 1990|doi=10.1007/BF00050674|bibcode=1990CeMDA..48...23B}}</ref>  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.{{efn|The 32.184 second offset is to provide continuity with the older [[ephemeris time]].}} TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&nbsp;s.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=218&ndash;219}}\n\nThe continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated, \"In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |title=CCTF 09-27 \n |url=http://www.bipm.org/cc/CCTF/Allowed/18/CCTF_09-27_note_on_UTC-ITU-R.pdf \n |date=3 September 2007 \n |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures \n |access-date=24 September 2016 \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316100907/http://www.bipm.org/cc/CCTF/Allowed/18/CCTF_09-27_note_on_UTC-ITU-R.pdf \n |archive-date=16 March 2012 \n |url-status=live \n |df=dmy-all \n}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Relation to UTC==\nUTC is a [[discontinuous]] time scale. It is regularly adjusted by leap seconds. Between these adjustments, it is composed of segments that are linear transformations of atomic time. From its beginning in 1961 through December 1971, the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated [[UT2]].  Afterwards, these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate [[UT1]].  This was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale; the post-1971 more linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally. The fact that it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of UTC.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=227&ndash;229}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Clock synchronization]]\n* [[Network Time Protocol]]\n* [[Precision Time Protocol]]\n* [[Time and frequency transfer]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web\n|title=History of TAI\u2212UTC\n|url=ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat\n|publisher=Time Service Dept., United States Naval Observatory\n|date=2009\n|accessdate=4 January 2010\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719193539/http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat\n|archive-date=19 July 2011\n|url-status=dead\n}}\n* {{cite web \n|title=International Atomic Time \n|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html \n|publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] \n|accessdate=24 January 2020\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110113226/http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html \n|archive-date=10 January 2011 \n|url-status=live \n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{ cite book \n| ref = harv \n| last = Guinot\n| first = B\n| chapter = History of the Bureau International de l'Heure\n| title = Polar Motion: Historical and Scientific Problems\n| series = ASP Conference Series, Vol. 208\n| isbn = 1-58381-039-0\n| date = 2000\n| bibcode = 2000pmhs.conf..175G \n}}\n* {{Cite book \n|ref=harv |title=Time: From Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics \n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7NdrK4e77CIC \n|authorlink=Dennis D.
