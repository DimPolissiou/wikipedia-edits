From 1896, at the age of 23, he served in the public service as a legal intern at the Prime Minister's Office. From 1911 he was appointed as ministerial adviser in the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]] appointed Skerlecz head of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] crown land in 1913, shortly before [[World War I]].\n\nOn August 18, 1913, shortly after his appointment as Ban of Croatia, [[Stjepan Doj\u010di\u0107]] attempted an assassination on Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz in Zagreb, however Skerlecz was only lightly injured on his right arm. \n\nWhile Croatia-Slavonia was not the site of any battles, Croatian troops, fighting under the Croatian Home Guard took part in the fighting, much of it in neighbouring [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. Skerlecz managed to reconvene the Croatian [[Sabor]] (parliament) in [[Zagreb]] by 1915. The Croats made further demands for local authority, as well as unification of Croatia-Slavonia with [[Dalmatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[Stefan Sarkoti\u0107]], Austria-Hungary's commander in Bosnia and Herzegovina also sought unification of their provinces. However, Austria-Hungary's outdated political system made any shifts between areas under Hungarian or Austrian spheres of influence difficult. Skerlecz could only support the Croatians in acting autonomously. As the war progressed more Croats found the formation of a South Slav state a potentially beneficial possibility.\n\nHe resigned from his post on June 29, 1917 after his friend PM Istv\u00e1n Tisza was ousted from power, leaving the country in no better state than when he had arrived. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was formed the following year. Skerlecz became [[persona non grata]] in Kingdom of Yugoslavia, because he was known as an ardent opponent of the involvement of Croatia in the newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Skerlecz had to move to Hungary. Thereafter he lived in his family villa at [[Andr\u00e1ssy Avenue]].

In water rescue applications, they are referred to as 'rescue water craft' (RWC). This began in the late 1970s through the efforts of Kawasaki Motors Corporation U.S.A. The origin of water rescue using PWC's is attributed to these founding fathers:  Brad Southworth and Ronny Kling.  Former Vietnam Veterans and racers whom were asked by Chuck Koontz to provide a rescue application using stand up Jet Skis for the United States Jet Ski Association, which later became the International Jet Sports Boating Association. In 1985 Brad and Ronny began using the 'Fun Tech Wedge' on stand ups, a plastic form that fit around the circumference of the craft making it a more stable rescue platform.  From the Fun Tech Wedge, backboards, litters, modified paddle, body boards, and lines taken to victims and survivors were utilized as transport devices. In the late 1980s [[rescue]] board designs adapted to the changing hull designs when two to three-seater craft became available. This became common use for extrication of patients.\n\nThe first agencies to receive [[Jet Skis]] were [[Long Beach]] and [[Huntington Beach]] City Lifeguard departments in [[California]].  Brad Southworth and Steve Strickland were hired by Kawasaki on a 'Tropical Tan Tour' to go to lifeguard agencies on the East and West coasts for the purpose of using them on their beaches.  Few agencies during this time applied the stands ups to actual rescue safety applications, but the product was given exposure at local beaches to the public.\n\nThe pioneering agencies who have the longest standing tradition of PWC in the United States are Kill Devil Hills Lifeguard Beach Service from [[North Carolina]] on the Outer Banks and Taft-Nelson-Delake (TND) Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad out of Lincoln City, [[Oregon]], USA. Both began in the late 1970s and have the distinction of the origins of our PWC rescue heritage.  TND incorporated into 'North Lincoln Fire and Rescue' and both agencies are still using Personal Water Craft in 2010 for operations, over 30 years. In the late 1980s the feasibility of using Jet Skis for rescues began to take on interest from [[lifeguards]] and law enforcement.  In 1989 Shawn Alladio began teaching under the name 'Watercraft Awareness Safety Program', after a 10-year development of training concepts and to preserve local riding areas in Southern California. Due to the rapid growth of PWC, her professional development was launched as the product sales increased. This program was eventually named K38 Water Safety. In 1990, the Personal Watercraft Industry Association created the 'Wave Rangers' program to expose law enforcement to these boats in the United States, this lasted a few seasons.\n\nIn 2008 Shawn Alladio was invited onto the [http://www.PWCoffshore.com PWCoffshore.com] point-to-point personal water craft endurance race team competing on long distance races called [[offshore powerboat racing]] under [[American Power Boat Association]] sanctioning.

In water rescue applications, they are referred to as 'rescue water craft' (RWC). This began in the late 1970s through the efforts of Kawasaki Motors Corporation U.S.A. The origin of water rescue using PWC's is attributed to these founding fathers:  Brad Southworth and Ronny Kling.  Former Vietnam Veterans and racers whom were asked by Chuck Koontz to provide a rescue application using stand up Jet Skis for the United States Jet Ski Association, which later became the International Jet Sports Boating Association. In 1985 Brad and Ronny began using the 'Fun Tech Wedge' on stand ups, a plastic form that fit around the circumference of the craft making it a more stable rescue platform.  From the Fun Tech Wedge, backboards, litters, modified paddle, body boards, and lines taken to victims and survivors were utilized as transport devices. In the late 1980s [[rescue]] board designs adapted to the changing hull designs when two to three-seater craft became available. This became common use for extrication of patients.\n\nThe first agencies to receive [[Jet Skis]] were [[Long Beach]] and [[Huntington Beach]] City Lifeguard departments in [[California]].  Brad Southworth and Steve Strickland were hired by Kawasaki on a 'Tropical Tan Tour' to go to lifeguard agencies on the East and West coasts for the purpose of using them on their beaches.  Few agencies during this time applied the stands ups to actual rescue safety applications, but the product was given exposure at local beaches to the public.\n\nThe pioneering agencies who have the longest standing tradition of PWC in the United States are Kill Devil Hills Lifeguard Beach Service from [[North Carolina]] on the Outer Banks and Taft-Nelson-Delake (TND) Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad out of Lincoln City, [[Oregon]], USA. Both began in the late 1970s and have the distinction of the origins of our PWC rescue heritage.  TND incorporated into 'North Lincoln Fire and Rescue' and both agencies are still using Personal Water Craft in 2010 for operations, over 30 years. In the late 1980s the feasibility of using Jet Skis for rescues began to take on interest from [[lifeguards]] and law enforcement.  In 1989 Shawn Alladio began teaching under the name 'Watercraft Awareness Safety Program', after a 10-year development of training concepts and to preserve local riding areas in Southern California. Due to the rapid growth of PWC, her professional development was launched as the product sales increased. This program was eventually named K38 Water Safety. In 1990, the Personal Watercraft Industry Association created the 'Wave Rangers' program to expose law enforcement to these boats in the United States, this lasted a few seasons.\n\nIn 2008 Shawn Alladio was invited onto the [http://www.PWCoffshore.com PWCoffshore.com] point-to-point personal water craft endurance race team competing on long distance races called [[offshore powerboat racing]] under [[American Power Boat Association]] sanctioning.
