His use and development of [[Music of Norway|Norwegian folk music]] in his own compositions brought the music of Norway to international consciousness, as well as helping to develop a [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|national identity]], much as [[Jean Sibelius]] did in [[Finland]] and [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]] did in [[Bohemia]], respectively.<ref name=\"isbn1-84383-210-0\">{{cite book |author=Daniel M.

He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study. An exception was the [[organ (music)|organ]], which was mandatory for piano students. About his study in the conservatory, he wrote to his biographer, [[Hans Aimar Mow Gr\u00f8nvold|Aimar Gr\u00f8nvold]], in 1881: \"I must admit, unlike [[Johan Svendsen|Svendsen]], that I left Leipzig Conservatory just as stupid as I entered it.

Throughout his life, Grieg's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine. He suffered from numerous respiratory infections, and ultimately developed combined lung and heart failure.

In 1862, he finished his studies in Leipzig and held his first concert in his home town,<ref>[http://griegmuseum.no/en/about-grieg Grieg Museum]</ref> where his programme included [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata.\n\n[[File:Edvard en Nina Grieg 1899.jpg|right|thumb| Edvard Grieg and [[Nina Grieg|Nina Hagerup]] (Grieg's wife and first cousin) in 1899]]\nIn 1863, Grieg went to [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, and stayed there for three years. He met the Danish composers [[Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann|J. P. E. Hartmann]] and [[Niels Gade]]. He also met his fellow Norwegian composer [[Rikard Nordraak]] (composer of the [[Ja, vi elsker dette landet|Norwegian national anthem]]), who became a good friend and source of inspiration. Nordraak died in 1866, and Grieg composed a [[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak|funeral march]] in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Edvard_Grieg |title=Edvard Grieg|publisher=Store norske leksikon|author=Rune J.

The next year, their only child, Alexandra, was born. Alexandra died in 1869 from [[meningitis]]. In the summer of 1868, Grieg wrote his [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] while on holiday in Denmark. [[Edmund Neupert]] gave the concerto its premiere performance on 3&nbsp;April 1869 in the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen. Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://nbl.snl.no/Nina_Grieg|title=Nina Grieg|publisher= Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Inger Elisabeth Haavet|accessdate= September 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, [[Franz Liszt]], who had not yet met Grieg, wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education, which led to Grieg's obtaining a travel grant. The two men met in [[Rome]] in 1870. On Grieg's first visit, they went over Grieg's Violin Sonata No. 1, which pleased Liszt greatly. On his second visit in April, Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto, which Liszt proceeded to sightread (including the orchestral arrangement). Liszt's rendition greatly impressed his audience, although Grieg gently pointed out to him that he played the first movement too quickly. Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on [[orchestration]] (for example, to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet).<ref>{{cite web |url=  http://www.mnc.net/norway/grieg.htm |title=  Edvard Grieg (1843\u20131907) |publisher=  Norwegian State Academy of Music in Oslo |author=  Harald Herresthal |accessdate=  September 1, 2017 |url-status=  dead |archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20051214011056/http://www.mnc.net/norway/GRIEG.HTM |archivedate=  14 December 2005 |df=  dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1874\u201376, Grieg composed [[incidental music]] for the premiere of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', at the request of the author.\n\nGrieg had close ties with the [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]] (Harmonien), and later became Music Director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882.

In the spring of 1903, Grieg made nine 78-rpm [[gramophone record]]ings of his piano music in Paris. All of these discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs, despite limited fidelity. Grieg recorded [[player piano]] music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and [[Welte-Mignon]] reproducing system, all of which survive and can be heard today. He also worked with the [[Aeolian Company]] for its 'Autograph Metrostyle' piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces.\n\nIn 1899, Grieg cancelled his concerts in France in protest of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], an anti-semitic scandal that was then roiling French politics. Regarding this scandal, Grieg had written that he hoped that the French might, \"Soon return to the spirit of 1789, when the French republic declared that it would defend basic human rights.\" As a result of his position on the affair, he became the target of much French [[hate mail]] of that day.<ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2007/02/27/493382.html \"Grieg the Humanist Brought to Light\"], ''[[Dagbladet]]''</ref><ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/books/i-have-no-desire-to-appear-before-a-french-audience-1.47656 \"I Have No Desire...\"] ''[[Haaretz]]''.

Grainger was a great admirer of Grieg's music and a strong empathy was quickly established. In a 1907 interview, Grieg stated: \"I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.\"<ref>John Bird, ''Percy Grainger'', Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 133\u2013134.</ref>\n\nEdvard Grieg died at the Municipal Hospital in Bergen, Norway, on 4 September 1907 at age 64 from [[heart failure]]. He had suffered a long period of illness. His last words were \"Well, if it must be so.\"\n\nThe funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people to the streets of his home town to honor him. Following his wish, his own ''[[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak]]'' was played with orchestration by his friend [[Johan Halvorsen]], who had married Grieg's niece. In addition, the ''Funeral March'' movement from [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2]] was played.

In this piece of music, the adventures of the anti-hero, Peer Gynt, are related, including the episode in which he steals a bride at her wedding. The angry guests chase him, and Peer falls, hitting his head on a rock. He wakes up in a mountain surrounded by trolls. The music of \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" represents the angry trolls taunting Peer and gets louder each time the theme repeats. The music ends with Peer escaping from the mountain.\n\nIn an 1874 letter to his friend [[Frants Beyer]], Grieg expressed his unhappiness with Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter, one of the movements he composed for ''Peer Gynt'', writing \"I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King \u2013 something that I literally can't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies, exaggerated Norwegian nationalism, and trollish self-satisfaction!

He disliked the discipline of the conservatory course of study. An exception was the [[organ (music)|organ]], which was mandatory for piano students. About his study in the conservatory, he wrote to his biographer, [[Hans Aimar Mow Gr\u00f8nvold|Aimar Gr\u00f8nvold]], in 1881: \"I must admit, unlike [[Johan Svendsen|Svendsen]], that I left Leipzig Conservatory just as stupid as I entered it.

Throughout his life, Grieg's health was impaired by a destroyed left lung and considerable deformity of his thoracic spine. He suffered from numerous respiratory infections, and ultimately developed combined lung and heart failure.

He met the Danish composers [[Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann|J. P. E. Hartmann]] and [[Niels Gade]]. He also met his fellow Norwegian composer [[Rikard Nordraak]] (composer of the [[Ja, vi elsker dette landet|Norwegian national anthem]]), who became a good friend and source of inspiration. Nordraak died in 1866, and Grieg composed a [[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak|funeral march]] in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Edvard_Grieg |title=Edvard Grieg|publisher=Store norske leksikon|author=Rune J.

The next year, their only child, Alexandra, was born. Alexandra died in 1869 from [[meningitis]]. In the summer of 1868, Grieg wrote his [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] while on holiday in Denmark. [[Edmund Neupert]] gave the concerto its premiere performance on 3&nbsp;April 1869 in the Casino Theatre in Copenhagen. Grieg himself was unable to be there due to conducting commitments in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://nbl.snl.no/Nina_Grieg|title=Nina Grieg|publisher= Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Inger Elisabeth Haavet|accessdate= September 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, [[Franz Liszt]], who had not yet met Grieg, wrote a testimonial for him to the Norwegian Ministry of Education, which led to Grieg's obtaining a travel grant. The two men met in [[Rome]] in 1870. On Grieg's first visit, they went over Grieg's Violin Sonata No. 1, which pleased Liszt greatly. On his second visit in April, Grieg brought with him the manuscript of his Piano Concerto, which Liszt proceeded to sightread (including the orchestral arrangement). Liszt's rendition greatly impressed his audience, although Grieg gently pointed out to him that he played the first movement too quickly. Liszt also gave Grieg some advice on [[orchestration]] (for example, to give the melody of the second theme in the first movement to a solo trumpet).<ref>{{cite web |url=  http://www.mnc.net/norway/grieg.htm |title=  Edvard Grieg (1843\u20131907) |publisher=  Norwegian State Academy of Music in Oslo |author=  Harald Herresthal |accessdate=  September 1, 2017 |url-status=  dead |archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20051214011056/http://www.mnc.net/norway/GRIEG.HTM |archivedate=  14 December 2005 |df=  dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1874\u201376, Grieg composed [[incidental music]] for the premiere of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', at the request of the author.\n\nGrieg had close ties with the [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]] (Harmonien), and later became Music Director of the orchestra from 1880 to 1882.

In the spring of 1903, Grieg made nine 78-rpm [[gramophone record]]ings of his piano music in Paris. All of these discs have been reissued on both LPs and CDs, despite limited fidelity. Grieg recorded [[player piano]] music rolls for the Hupfeld Phonola piano-player system and [[Welte-Mignon]] reproducing system, all of which survive and can be heard today. He also worked with the [[Aeolian Company]] for its 'Autograph Metrostyle' piano roll series wherein he indicated the tempo mapping for many of his pieces.\n\nIn 1899, Grieg cancelled his concerts in France in protest of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], an anti-semitic scandal that was then roiling French politics. Regarding this scandal, Grieg had written that he hoped that the French might, \"Soon return to the spirit of 1789, when the French republic declared that it would defend basic human rights.\" As a result of his position on the affair, he became the target of much French [[hate mail]] of that day.<ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2007/02/27/493382.html \"Grieg the Humanist Brought to Light\"], ''[[Dagbladet]]''</ref><ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/books/i-have-no-desire-to-appear-before-a-french-audience-1.47656 \"I Have No Desire...\"] ''[[Haaretz]]''.

Grainger was a great admirer of Grieg's music and a strong empathy was quickly established. In a 1907 interview, Grieg stated: \"I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.\"<ref>John Bird, ''Percy Grainger'', Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 133\u2013134.</ref>\n\nEdvard Grieg died at the Municipal Hospital in Bergen, Norway, on 4 September 1907 at age 64 from [[heart failure]]. He had suffered a long period of illness. His last words were \"Well, if it must be so.\"\n\nThe funeral drew between 30,000 and 40,000 people to the streets of his home town to honor him. Following his wish, his own ''[[Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak]]'' was played with orchestration by his friend [[Johan Halvorsen]], who had married Grieg's niece. In addition, the ''Funeral March'' movement from [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2]] was played. Grieg was [[cremate]]d, and his ashes were entombed in a mountain crypt near his house, [[Troldhaugen]].

There is a large statue of Grieg in [[Seattle]], while one of the largest hotels in Bergen (his hometown) is named Quality Hotel Edvard Grieg (with over 370 rooms), and a large crater on the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is named after Grieg.\n\n==Music==\nSome of Grieg's early works include a [[symphony]] (which he later suppressed) and a [[Piano Sonata (Grieg)|piano sonata]].

In this piece of music, the adventures of the anti-hero, Peer Gynt, are related, including the episode in which he steals a bride at her wedding. The angry guests chase him, and Peer falls, hitting his head on a rock. He wakes up in a mountain surrounded by trolls. The music of \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" represents the angry trolls taunting Peer and gets louder each time the theme repeats. The music ends with Peer escaping from the mountain.\n\nIn an 1874 letter to his friend [[Frants Beyer]], Grieg expressed his unhappiness with Dance of the Mountain King's Daughter, one of the movements he composed for ''Peer Gynt'', writing \"I have also written something for the scene in the hall of the mountain King \u2013 something that I literally can't bear listening to because it absolutely reeks of cow-pies, exaggerated Norwegian nationalism, and trollish self-satisfaction!

Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], Henrik Ibsen, [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and others. Russian composer [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]] used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet. Norwegian pianist [[Eva Knardahl]] recorded the composer's complete piano music on 13 LPs for [[BIS Records]] from 1977 to 1980. The recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs, also on [[BIS Records]].

This holistic Jewish code of conduct encompasses a wide swathe of rituals, worship practices, God{{endash}}man and interpersonal relationships, from [[Kashrut|dietary laws]] to [[Sabbath]] and festival observance to marital relations, agricultural practices, and civil claims and damages.\n\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the Oral Torah was passed down orally in an unbroken chain from generation to generation until its contents were finally committed to writing following the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, when Jewish civilization was faced with an existential threat, by virtue of the dispersion of the Jewish people.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=%22dual+torah%22+%22Oral+Torah%22+%22Torah+she-be-al-peh%22+%22Written+Torah%22+%22Torah+she-bikhtav%22+%22Torah+she-be-%60al+peh%22+Moses+God+the+explanations&btnG= Howard Schwartz, ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 2004. p lv]</ref>\n\nThe major repositories of the Oral Torah are the ''[[Mishnah]]'', compiled between 200\u2013220 CE by [[Yehudah haNasi|Rabbi Yehudah haNasi]], and the ''[[Gemara]]'', a series of running commentaries and debates concerning the Mishnah, which together form the ''[[Talmud]]'', the preeminent text of Rabbinic Judaism. In fact, two \"versions\" of the Talmud exist: one produced in the [[Galilee]] {{circa}} 300\u2013350 CE (the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]), and a second, more extensive Talmud compiled in [[Babylonia]] {{circa}} 450\u2013500 CE (the [[Talmud#Babylonian Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]).\n\nBelief that at least portions of the Oral Torah were transmitted orally from God to [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai]] during the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt is a fundamental tenet of faith of [[Orthodox Judaism]], and was recognized as one of the [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|Thirteen Principles of Faith]] by [[Maimonides]]. However, not all branches of Rabbinic Judaism accept the literal Sinaitic provenance of the Oral Torah, characterizing it as the product of a historical process of continuing interpretation.\n\nThere have also been historical dissenters to the Oral Torah in its entirety, including the ancient [[Sadducees]] and adherents to modern  [[Karaite Judaism]], who attempt to derive their religious practice strictly from the Written Torah, using Scripture's most natural meaning to form their basis of Jewish law.  Karaites often look to traditions of interpretation but, unlike Rabbinic Jews, do not ascribe to those traditions authoritative or normative parity with the Written Torah.\n\n==Components of the Oral Torah==\n{{See also|Halakha#Sources and process|l1=Halakha #Sources and process}}\n\nThe term \"Oral Torah\" should not be understood as a monolith. The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' divides the Oral Torah into eight categories, ranked according to the relative level of authoritativeness, which are found within the Talmud, the [[Tosefta]] and the halakhic [[Midrash]]im.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\">{{cite book |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |chapter=Oral Law (\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05e4\u05d4) |chapterurl=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11750-oral-law |date=1906 |accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref>\n# Explanations of those laws of the written law, which are not fully intelligible without the explanations, and therefore presuppose an oral interpretation. Such explanations are connected in some artificial way with Scripture.\n# Ancient [[halakhot]] which have no connection with Scripture and can not be connected with it, thus deriving their authority only from the tradition which ascribes them [[Law given to Moses at Sinai|to Moses on Sinai]]. (In the case of these two groups, it is impossible to ascertain which elucidations and rules were really given to Moses on Sinai, and which were added later.)\n# Laws found in [[Tanakh|the prophetic books]]. Some of these originated at the time of the Prophets; but others are much older, perhaps having been transmitted orally, and committed to writing by the Prophets. They are called also ''\"Dibre \u1e32abbalah\"'' (Words of Tradition).\n# Interpretations and regulations defining many written laws, as well as new laws, formulated by the early scribes, beginning with the time of [[Ezra]]. These are called also ''\"Dibre Soferim\"'' (Words of the Scribes).\n# Interpretations and regulations covering the written law, as well as new halakhot, which the [[Tannaim]] deduced from Scripture by means of [[Talmudic hermeneutics|hermeneutic rules]] or by logical conclusions. There are differences of opinion among the scholars in regard to most of these explanations and definitions; but they are of equal weight with the written law, and are called also ''\"Debar Torah\"'' (Regulation of the Torah).\n# Customs and observances (''\"[[Takkanah|ta\u1e33\u1e33anot]]\"'') which were introduced at various times by different scholars. They are ascribed partly to [[Moses]], partly to [[Joshua]], but chiefly to the members of the Great Synagogue or the ''Soferim ''(\"Scribes\"), and are called also ''\"Dibre Soferim\"'' (\"Words of the Scribes\").\n# Statutes and decisions (''\"[[Gezerah|gezerot]]\"'') decreed by the [[Sanhedrin]] or court, and generally accepted. Such laws could be abrogated only by another court greater than the first one in numbers and scholarship.\n# Statutes and regulations for which the scholars had no tradition or allusion in Scripture, but which they accepted as standards after deriving them from the customs and laws of the country in which they were living. These are called ''\"Hilkhot Medinah\"'' (Statutes of the Country).\n\nThe laws in the last three groups were not considered equal in validity to the written law (''\"[[List of Talmudic principles#De'oraita and derabanan|De'oraita]]\"''), but were regarded merely as rabbinical regulations (''\"[[List of Talmudic principles#De'oraita and derabanan|de-rabbanan]]\"'').<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\" />\n\n==Historical development==\n\n===Source and transmission===\nAccording to modern scholarship, the traditions embodied in what later became known as the \"Oral Torah\" developed over generations among the inhabitants of [[Judea]] and were passed down through various modes of [[cultural transmission]], including but not restricted to oral transmission. It is hypothesized that, sometime prior to the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] of 586-530 BCE, in applying the Mosaic code to daily life and Temple worship, \"a multitude of usages arising out of practical necessity or convenience or experience became part of the routine of observance of the code, and, in the course of time, shared the sanctity and authority which were inherent in the divinely inspired code itself.\"<ref name=Danby />\n\nSuch practices experienced exponential growth from the time of [[Ezra]] to the Romans' destruction of the [[Second Temple]] due to the changing social and religious conditions experienced by inhabitants of Judea.<ref name=Danby /> Many of these practices were advocated by the [[Pharisees]], a sect of largely lower- and middle-class Jews who stood in opposition to the [[Sadducees]], the priestly caste who dominated the Temple cult.<ref name=Magness>{{cite book|last=Magness|first=Jodi|title=Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls|year=2003|publisher=Wm.

On the other hand, the Pharisees became the progenitor of the rabbinic class, who formalized the traditions of their predecessors. Following the fall of the Temple, it appears that the Pharisaic leader [[Johanan ben Zakkai]] (30-90 CE) settled in [[Yavneh]], where he established a school that came to be regarded by fellow Jews as the successors of the Jerusalem [[Sanhedrin]].<ref name=Danby /> Upon this [[Council of Jamnia|Council of Jabneh]] fell the duty of administering and interpreting religious law, conserving tradition, and solving problems that arose by the past dependence of numerous observances on the existence of the Temple and priesthood.<ref name=Danby /> Thus, from 70 to 130 CE, when the Bar Kochba revolt further decimated the Jewish community, the Oral Law experienced a significant period of development and an unprecedented level of legal and religious authority among the populace.\n\n===Codification===\n\n====The Mishnah====\nThe destruction of the Second Temple and the [[destruction of Jerusalem|fall of Jerusalem]] in the 1st and early 2nd Centuries CE devastated the Jewish community. The [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] of 66\u201373 CE and the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] cost hundreds of thousands of Jewish lives, the destruction of leading [[Yeshiva|yeshivot]], and thousands of scholars and students.<ref name=Telushkin>{{cite book|last=Telushkin|first=Joseph|title=Jewish Literacy: Revised Edition|year=2001|publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc.|location=New York, USA|isbn=0-688-08506-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/jewishliteracy00telu/page/146 146\u2013152]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/jewishliteracy00telu/page/146}}</ref> At that point, it became apparent that the Hebrew community and its learning were threatened, and that publication was the only way to ensure that the law could be preserved.<ref name=Telushkin /><ref>Tosefta Eduyot 1:1 \"''When the Sages went to Yavneh they said: The time will come that a man will seek a matter in the Torah but will not find it.

Both Rabbinic tradition and scholarship ascribe this effort to Rabbi [[Judah HaNasi]]. The product of this effort, the [[Mishnah]], is generally considered the first work of [[rabbinic literature]].\n\n\"Mishnah\" is the name given to the sixty-three tractates that HaNasi systematically codified, which in turn are divided into six \"orders.\" Unlike the Torah, in which, for example, laws of the Sabbath are scattered throughout the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], all the Mishnaic laws of the Sabbath are located in a single tractate called ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' (Hebrew for \"Sabbath\").<ref name=Telushkin /> Moreover, the laws contained in the twenty-four chapters that make up that tractate are far more extensive than those contained in the Torah, reflecting the extensiveness of the Oral Law.<ref name=Telushkin /> Some authority suggests HaNasi made use of as many as 13 separate collections of [[Halachah|Halakhot]] from different schools and time periods, and reassembled that material into a coherent whole, arranged it systematically, summarized discussions, and in some cases rendered his own rulings where alternative traditions existed.<ref name=Danby />\n\nThe Mishnah does far more than expound upon and organize the Biblical commandments. Rather, important topics covered by the Mishnah \"rest on no scriptural foundations whatsoever,\" such as portions of the civil law tractates of ''[[Bava Kamma]]'', ''[[Bava Metzia]]'' and ''[[Bava Batra]]''.<ref name=Neusner>{{cite book|last=Neusner|first=Jacob|title=The Perfect Torah: Volume 13 of The Brill Reference Library of Ancient Judaism|year=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004130333|pages=2\u20134}}</ref> In other words, \"To perfect the [Written] Torah, the Oral tradition had to provide for a variety of transactions left without any law at all in Scripture.\"<ref name=Neusner /> Just as portions of the Torah reflect (according to the [[documentary hypothesis]]) the agenda of the Levite priesthood in centralizing worship in the Temple in Jerusalem and legitimizing their exclusive authority over the sacrificial cult, so too can the Mishnah be seen as reflecting the unique \"program\" of the [[Tannaim]] and their successors to develop an egalitarian form of Judaism with an emphasis on social justice and an applicability throughout the Jewish diaspora.<ref name=Neusner /><ref>{{cite book|last=Ska|first=Jean-Louis|title=Introduction to reading the Pentateuch|year=2006|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-122-1}}</ref> As a result, the Talmud often finds the rabbis combing scripture for textual support to justify existing religious practice, rather than deriving the practice organically from the language of scripture.<ref name=Neusner />\n\n====The Gemara====\nHaNasi's method of codification, in which he often included minority viewpoints and citation by name to rabbis who championed different viewpoints, became a template for the [[Gemara]], a compendium of discussions and commentaries on the Mishnah's laws by generations of leading rabbis during the next four centuries in the two centers of Jewish life, Judea and [[Sassanid Empire|Babylonia]].<ref name=Telushkin /> The Gemara with the Mishnah came to be edited together into compilations known as the [[Talmud]]. Both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] and the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] have been transmitted in written form to the present day, although the more extensive Babylonian Talmud is widely considered to be more authoritative.<ref name=Telushkin />\n\nThe Talmud's discussions follow the order of the Mishnah, although not all tractates are discussed. Generally, a law from the Mishnah is cited, which is followed by a rabbinic deliberation on its meaning. The discussion often, but not always, results in a decision regarding the more persuasive or authoritative position based on available sources or anecdotal evidence.<ref name=Telushkin />\n\n==In Jewish tradition==\n\n===Orthodox Judaism===\nRabbinic Judaism holds the Oral Law to be of divine origin. The divinity and authoritativeness of the Oral Law as transmitted from God to Moses on Mount Sinai, continues to be universally accepted by Orthodox and [[Haredi Judaism]] as a fundamental precept of Judaism.<ref name=Gaventa>{{cite book|last=Gaventa|first=William|title=Jewish Perspectives on Theology and the Human Experience of Disability|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45351-9|pages=109\u2013112}}</ref> The Oral Law was the basis for nearly all subsequent rabbinic literature. It is therefore intricately related to the development of [[Halacha]]. As such, despite codification, interpretation of the Oral Law is likewise required.\n\n====Divine source and transmission====\nRabbis of the Talmudic era conceived of the Oral Torah in two distinct ways.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Oral Law and the Jurisprudence of a Textless Text|last=Dane|first=Perry|date=Winter 1991|journal=S'vara: A Journal of Philosophy, Law, and Judaism|volume=2|page=11|ssrn=1718700}}</ref> First, Rabbinic tradition saw the Oral Torah as an unbroken chain of transmission. The distinctive feature of this view was that Oral Torah was \"conveyed by word of mouth and memorized.\"<ref>Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, ''The Orality of Rabbinic Writing'', in The Cambridge Companion to the Talmud, ed. Martin Jaffee, 2007. p. 39. This is attested to in numerous sources, such as Mishnah Avot 1:1. The manner of teaching and memorization is described in B. Eruvin 54b.</ref> Second, the Rabbis also viewed the Oral Torah as an interpretive tradition, and not merely as memorized traditions. They saw the written Torah as containing many levels of interpretation. It was left to later generations, who were steeped in the ''oral tradition'' of interpretation, to discover those (\"hidden\") interpretations not revealed by Moses.<ref>In rabbinic literature this view is exemplified by the story of Rabbi Akiva who expounded heaps and heaps of laws from the scriptural crowns of the letters in the written Torah.\n\nAccording to traditional Judaism, the laws transmitted to Moses contained in the Written [[Torah]] (or [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]]) were written down on scrolls, but God enjoined Moses from writing down the explanation of these laws. Indeed, the Talmud relays that Moses himself would not understand all of these interpretations, nevertheless, these are also called [[Law given to Moses at Sinai]]. B Menahot 29b. See, Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, op cit.</ref> Instead, Moses was obligated to impart the explanations orally to students, children, and fellow adults. It was thus forbidden to write and publish the Oral Torah.<ref>See BT Temurah 14b, and, BT Gittin 60b. Also, Y Meggila 4:1</ref>\n\nJewish tradition identifies the unbroken historical chain of individuals who were entrusted with passing down the Oral Law from Moses to the early rabbinic period: \"Moses received the Torah and handed it down to Joshua; Joshua to the Elders; the Elders to the prophets; and the prophets handed it down to the men of the Great Assembly.\"<ref>Mishna, Avot 1:1; the remainder of chapter 1 identifies further individuals in the chain</ref><ref name=Fackenheim>{{cite book|last=Fackenheim|first=Emil L.|title=What is Judaism?: An Interpretation for the Present Age|year=1999|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-0623-9|pages=68\u201371}}</ref> Similarly, [[Maimonides]] provides a generation by generation account of the names of all those in the direct line that transmitted this tradition, beginning with [[Moses]] up until [[Ravina I|Ravina]] and [[Rav Ashi]], the rabbis who compiled the Babylonian Talmud.<ref>[https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/901656/jewish/Introduction-to-Mishneh-Torah.htm Introduction to Mishneh Torah]</ref>\n\n====The interplay of the Oral and Written Law====\nAccording to traditional Judaism, the Oral Law must have been disseminated at the same time as the Written Torah because certain Torah commandments would be indecipherable without a separate explanatory codex (and, presumably, God would not demand adherence to commandments that could not be understood). Many terms used in the Torah are left undefined, such as the word ''totafot'', usually translated as \"frontlets,\" which is used three times in the Pentateuch (in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 13:9 and [[Deuteronomy]] 6:8 and 11:18) but only identified with [[tefillin]] in the Mishnah (see [[Menachot]] 3:7).\n\nSimilarly, many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions, or assume familiarity on the part of the reader.<ref>David Charles Kraemer, ''The Mind of the Talmud'', Oxford University Press, 1990. pp 157\u2013159</ref><ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\" /><ref>Rabbi [[Gil Student]]: [http://www.aishdas.org/student/oral.htm Proofs for the Oral Torah]</ref> For example, the discussion of ''[[shechita]]'' ([[kosher]] slaughter) in [[Deuteronomy]] 12 states \"you shall kill of your herd and of your flock which God Lord has given you, ''as I have commanded you'',\" without any clear indication of what had been \"commanded\"; only in the Oral Torah are the various requirements of ritual slaughter explicated. Similarly, Deuteronomy 24 discusses the laws of [[divorce]] in passing; these laws are set forth with great specificity in the Mishnah and Gemara. Another example: the blue string of [[tekhelet]] on the [[tzitzit]] is to be dyed with an extraction from what scholars believe to be a snail; a detail only spoken of in the oral Torah.<ref>See http://www.tekhelet.com Ptil Tekhelet</ref> For other examples and further discussion here see ''[[Kuzari]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/khz/khz03.htm 3:35].  \n\nMoreover, according to the traditional view, without an Oral Law, blind adherence to the plain text of certain Torah commandments would lead to unethical acts, or would cause the practitioner to violate a commandment elsewhere in the Torah. Neither of these results could have been intended by God; and thus, ''a priori'', a set of supplementary \"instructions\" must have been provided. A classic example involves the phrase \"[[An eye for an eye]], a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot\" {{bibleverse||Ex|21:22\u201327|131}} is held in the oral tradition to imply monetary compensation \u2013 as opposed to a literal ''[[Lex talionis]]''.<ref>The Talmud explains this concept entails monetary compensation in [[tort]] cases. The [[Torah]]'s first mention of the phrase \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot\" appears in {{bibleverse||Ex|21:22\u201327|131}}. The [[Talmud]] (in ''[[Nezikin|Bava Kamma]]'', 84a), based upon a critical interpretation of the original [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew text]], explains that this biblical concept entails monetary compensation in [[tort]] cases. (Additionally, this law cannot be carried out in practice, for both practical and ethical reasons; see also [[Emor#Leviticus chapter 24|parashat Emor]]). Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted literally; it would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders.</ref> \nRegardless, the interpretation as \u201cmonetary compensation\u201d is the only one consistent with {{bibleverse||Num|35:30\u201331|131}}; this relationship paralleling the logic of the preceding paragraph.\n\nFinally, and similarly, the Oral Torah is needed to explain actions of biblical actors, seemingly discordant with other verses. For example, the marriage of [[Boaz]], a member of the [[tribe of Judah]] to Ruth, a [[Moab]]itess, as described in the [[Book of Ruth]], appears on its face to contradict the prohibition of {{bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|23:3\u20134|HE}} against marrying Moabites; however, the Oral Torah explains that this prohibition is limited to Moabite ''men''. Similarly, the [[Counting of the Omer#The count|rabbinic practice]] for the [[Counting of the Omer]] ({{bibleverse-lb||Leviticus|23:15\u201316|HE}}) is at odds with the [[Counting of the Omer#Karaite Practice|Karaite practice]], which appears to accord with a more literal reading of these verses, but is in fact borne out by {{bibleverse-lb||Joshua|5:10\u201312|HE}}.<ref>Tim Hegg: [http://www.torahresource.com/EnglishArticles/CountingTheOmer.pdf \"Counting the Omer: An Inquiry into the Divergent Methods of the 1st Century Judaisms\"].</ref> \nNote that the 1st century [[Targum Onkelos]] is largely consistent with the oral tradition as recorded in the [[midrash]], redacted into writing only in the 3rd or 4th century.<ref>See: prof. A Segal [http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/TalmudMap/MG/MGOnkelos.html Targum \"Onkelos\" to the Torah]; Rabbi G. Student: [http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2005/11/onkelos-and-oral-torah.html Onkelos and the Oral Torah].</ref> \nSimilarly, much Talmudic analysis demonstrates how the Mishnah's rulings, or disputes, derive from interpretations of Biblical texts; see [[Gemara #Biblical exposition]].\n\nComplementary to the above textual and [[internal evidence]], [[archaeologist]]s have uncovered various physical evidence relating to religious rituals and practices which were current prior to the codification of the Mishnah; from which it can be inferred that Judah HaNasi and his contemporaries recorded, rather than innovated, normative Judaism as practiced during the 1st century CE and prior. For example, excavations at [[Qumran]] ([[Dead Sea Scrolls #Caves 4a and 4b|Cave 4]]) have yielded specimens of ''[[tefillin]]'' and [[Tefillin#Parchment scrolls|parchment scrolls]]; these reflecting later Talmudic discussion.<ref>See for example, [[Yigal Yadin]]: [http://dailydaf.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/teffilin-from-qumran-yigal-yadin.pdf Tefilin from Qumran].</ref> Likewise, the structure and placement of [[Mikvah|ritual baths]] at [[Masada]] appears to be consistent with the [[Mikvah#Requirements of a mikveh|rabbinic requirements]] per the Mishnaic tractate ''[[Mikvaot]]'', although they were constructed approximately 120 years before the Mishnah was compiled.<ref>Rabbi Yosef Back: [http://torahtourguide.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/southern-mikveh-on-masada/ \"Southern mikveh on Masada\"].</ref> \nA [[Seal (emblem)#Ancient Near East|clay seal]] discovered in Jerusalem in 2011 is consistent with the tradition recorded in tractate ''[[Shekalim (Talmud)|Shekalim]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A9%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%94 chapter 5].<ref>See references under [http://bennypowersisraeltours.wordpress.com/tag/mishna/ \"Clay Seal Confirms Ancient Temple Service: Archaeologists\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313125747/https://bennypowersisraeltours.wordpress.com/tag/mishna/ |date=2016-03-13 }}.</ref> The [[Elephantine papyri]] include a \"Passover letter\" (419 BCE) which already included many of the [[Passover|Pesach observances]] of today,<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence.

The Qumran [[4QMMT|''Halachic Letter'']],<ref>''Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah''/ Qumran Cave 4</ref> which records approximately a dozen disputes regarding the application of halakha, also testifies to the evolutionary process of the Oral Law.\n\n====In rabbinic literature and commentary====\nThis section, discusses the Rabbinic treatment of the Written Law in light of the Oral Law, and the consequent overlap of the oral and written, and is not a general discussion of rabbinic Literature, ''[[Per se (terminology)|per se]]''. \n\nAs above, the Oral Law is recorded in the Midrash and Talmud, while later rabbinic literature builds on these works. \nHere, it is important to note that these source, \"oral\", documents, are nevertheless intimately connected to the written. \nThus, the [[midrash]] provides a verse by verse discussion of the entire (written) Tanakh, per the oral Torah. \nSimilarly, the Talmud, although applying a different framework, discusses and analyses the written Torah\u2014both from an [[aggadic]] and [[halakhic]] perspective\u2014drawing from (and recording) the oral tradition; here the discussion is organized around the Mishnah, and the discussion does not proceed verse-wise as with the Midrash.\n\n[[Image:Sapirstein Rashi.jpg|thumb|200px|A modern translation of Rashi's commentary on the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]], published by [[Artscroll]]]]\nThe era of the ''[[Rishonim]]'' sees the Oral Law incorporated into the first formal [[Torah commentaries]], where the biblical text is discussed and / or analysed based on the various Midrashic and Talmudic traditions.

It has given rise to numerous counter- (e.g., [[Nahmanides#Commentary on the Torah|Ramban]]) and super-commentaries (e.g., [[Elijah Mizrachi#Works|Mizrachi]]), all similarly drawing on the Oral Torah, and widely studied to this day (see ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'').\n\n[[Image:HaKsav VeHaKabalah.jpg|thumb|150px|Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg's ''Haketav VeHaKabbalah'' deals with the relationship between the written and oral Torah]]\nIn more recent times, ''[[Acharonim|Acharonic]]'' times, several ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]) commentaries have been produced, which, in some sense, ''reverse'' the direction of the analysis.

Hoffmann also authored a Torah commentary addressing some of the same issues  as those mentioned.)\n* ''Matteh Dan'' (or ''[[Kuzari]] Hasheini''; London 1714) written by Rabbi [[David Nieto]] demonstrates the authority of the Oral Law, and defends the tradition against attacks by [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] and skeptics.\n*Several works by Rabbi [[Immanuel Aboab]], especially his ''Nomologia'', defend the traditional law and discuss its chronology.\nOther well known works here, if perhaps less modern in orientation, include [[Maimonides]]' (Rambam's) [[Maimonides#Judaic and philosophical works|''Introduction to the Mishnah'']]\u2014dealing with the nature of the Oral Law, the distinction between the prophet and the sage, and the organizational structure of the Mishnah\u2014as well as [[Isaiah Horowitz]]'s (\"The Shelah\") ''Introduction to the Oral Torah'' in part 2 of his [[Isaiah Horowitz#Works|''Shenei Luchot HaBerit'']]\n\nFinally, other major works discussing the Bible as based on the Oral Torah include the following.\n* [[Menasseh Ben Israel#Writings|''El Conciliador'']] (\"The Conciliator\"), by Rabbi [[Menasseh Ben Israel]], a work written to reconcile the apparent contradictions in numerous passages throughout the Bible by utilizing \u201can astounding range of sources\", primarily the Talmud and the classic Jewish commentaries.

In fact, two \"versions\" of the Talmud exist: one produced in the [[Galilee]] {{circa}} 300\u2013350 CE (the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]), and a second, more extensive Talmud compiled in [[Babylonia]] {{circa}} 450\u2013500 CE (the [[Talmud#Babylonian Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]).\n\nBelief that at least portions of the Oral Torah were transmitted orally from God to [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai]] during the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt is a fundamental tenet of faith of [[Orthodox Judaism]], and was recognized as one of the [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|Thirteen Principles of Faith]] by [[Maimonides]]. However, not all branches of Rabbinic Judaism accept the literal Sinaitic provenance of the Oral Torah, characterizing it as the product of a historical process of continuing interpretation.\n\nThere have also been historical dissenters to the Oral Torah in its entirety, including the ancient [[Sadducees]] and adherents to modern  [[Karaite Judaism]], who attempt to derive their religious practice strictly from the Written Torah, using Scripture's most natural meaning to form their basis of Jewish law.

(In the case of these two groups, it is impossible to ascertain which elucidations and rules were really given to Moses on Sinai, and which were added later.)\n# Laws found in [[Tanakh|the prophetic books]]. Some of these originated at the time of the Prophets; but others are much older, perhaps having been transmitted orally, and committed to writing by the Prophets. They are called also ''\"Dibre \u1e32abbalah\"'' (Words of Tradition).\n# Interpretations and regulations defining many written laws, as well as new laws, formulated by the early scribes, beginning with the time of [[Ezra]]. These are called also ''\"Dibre Soferim\"'' (Words of the Scribes).\n# Interpretations and regulations covering the written law, as well as new halakhot, which the [[Tannaim]] deduced from Scripture by means of [[Talmudic hermeneutics|hermeneutic rules]] or by logical conclusions. There are differences of opinion among the scholars in regard to most of these explanations and definitions; but they are of equal weight with the written law, and are called also ''\"Debar Torah\"'' (Regulation of the Torah).\n# Customs and observances (''\"[[Takkanah|ta\u1e33\u1e33anot]]\"'') which were introduced at various times by different scholars. They are ascribed partly to [[Moses]], partly to [[Joshua]], but chiefly to the members of the Great Synagogue or the ''Soferim ''(\"Scribes\"), and are called also ''\"Dibre Soferim\"'' (\"Words of the Scribes\").\n# Statutes and decisions (''\"[[Gezerah|gezerot]]\"'') decreed by the [[Sanhedrin]] or court, and generally accepted. Such laws could be abrogated only by another court greater than the first one in numbers and scholarship.\n# Statutes and regulations for which the scholars had no tradition or allusion in Scripture, but which they accepted as standards after deriving them from the customs and laws of the country in which they were living. These are called ''\"Hilkhot Medinah\"'' (Statutes of the Country).\n\nThe laws in the last three groups were not considered equal in validity to the written law (''\"[[List of Talmudic principles#De'oraita and derabanan|De'oraita]]\"''), but were regarded merely as rabbinical regulations (''\"[[List of Talmudic principles#De'oraita and derabanan|de-rabbanan]]\"'').<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\" />\n\n==Historical development==\n\n===Source and transmission===\nAccording to modern scholarship, the traditions embodied in what later became known as the \"Oral Torah\" developed over generations among the inhabitants of [[Judea]] and were passed down through various modes of [[cultural transmission]], including but not restricted to oral transmission. It is hypothesized that, sometime prior to the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] of 586-530 BCE, in applying the Mosaic code to daily life and Temple worship, \"a multitude of usages arising out of practical necessity or convenience or experience became part of the routine of observance of the code, and, in the course of time, shared the sanctity and authority which were inherent in the divinely inspired code itself.\"<ref name=Danby />\n\nSuch practices experienced exponential growth from the time of [[Ezra]] to the Romans' destruction of the [[Second Temple]] due to the changing social and religious conditions experienced by inhabitants of Judea.<ref name=Danby /> Many of these practices were advocated by the [[Pharisees]], a sect of largely lower- and middle-class Jews who stood in opposition to the [[Sadducees]], the priestly caste who dominated the Temple cult.<ref name=Magness>{{cite book|last=Magness|first=Jodi|title=Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls|year=2003|publisher=Wm.

On the other hand, the Pharisees became the progenitor of the rabbinic class, who formalized the traditions of their predecessors. Following the fall of the Temple, it appears that the Pharisaic leader [[Johanan ben Zakkai]] (30-90 CE) settled in [[Yavneh]], where he established a school that came to be regarded by fellow Jews as the successors of the Jerusalem [[Sanhedrin]].<ref name=Danby /> Upon this [[Council of Jamnia|Council of Jabneh]] fell the duty of administering and interpreting religious law, conserving tradition, and solving problems that arose by the past dependence of numerous observances on the existence of the Temple and priesthood.<ref name=Danby /> Thus, from 70 to 130 CE, when the Bar Kochba revolt further decimated the Jewish community, the Oral Law experienced a significant period of development and an unprecedented level of legal and religious authority among the populace.\n\n===Codification===\n\n====The Mishnah====\nThe destruction of the Second Temple and the [[destruction of Jerusalem|fall of Jerusalem]] in the 1st and early 2nd Centuries CE devastated the Jewish community.

Both Rabbinic tradition and scholarship ascribe this effort to Rabbi [[Judah HaNasi]]. The product of this effort, the [[Mishnah]], is generally considered the first work of [[rabbinic literature]].\n\n\"Mishnah\" is the name given to the sixty-three tractates that HaNasi systematically codified, which in turn are divided into six \"orders.\" Unlike the Torah, in which, for example, laws of the Sabbath are scattered throughout the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], all the Mishnaic laws of the Sabbath are located in a single tractate called ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' (Hebrew for \"Sabbath\").<ref name=Telushkin /> Moreover, the laws contained in the twenty-four chapters that make up that tractate are far more extensive than those contained in the Torah, reflecting the extensiveness of the Oral Law.<ref name=Telushkin /> Some authority suggests HaNasi made use of as many as 13 separate collections of [[Halachah|Halakhot]] from different schools and time periods, and reassembled that material into a coherent whole, arranged it systematically, summarized discussions, and in some cases rendered his own rulings where alternative traditions existed.<ref name=Danby />\n\nThe Mishnah does far more than expound upon and organize the Biblical commandments. Rather, important topics covered by the Mishnah \"rest on no scriptural foundations whatsoever,\" such as portions of the civil law tractates of ''[[Bava Kamma]]'', ''[[Bava Metzia]]'' and ''[[Bava Batra]]''.<ref name=Neusner>{{cite book|last=Neusner|first=Jacob|title=The Perfect Torah: Volume 13 of The Brill Reference Library of Ancient Judaism|year=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004130333|pages=2\u20134}}</ref> In other words, \"To perfect the [Written] Torah, the Oral tradition had to provide for a variety of transactions left without any law at all in Scripture.\"<ref name=Neusner /> Just as portions of the Torah reflect (according to the [[documentary hypothesis]]) the agenda of the Levite priesthood in centralizing worship in the Temple in Jerusalem and legitimizing their exclusive authority over the sacrificial cult, so too can the Mishnah be seen as reflecting the unique \"program\" of the [[Tannaim]] and their successors to develop an egalitarian form of Judaism with an emphasis on social justice and an applicability throughout the Jewish diaspora.<ref name=Neusner /><ref>{{cite book|last=Ska|first=Jean-Louis|title=Introduction to reading the Pentateuch|year=2006|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-122-1}}</ref> As a result, the Talmud often finds the rabbis combing scripture for textual support to justify existing religious practice, rather than deriving the practice organically from the language of scripture.<ref name=Neusner />\n\n====The Gemara====\nHaNasi's method of codification, in which he often included minority viewpoints and citation by name to rabbis who championed different viewpoints, became a template for the [[Gemara]], a compendium of discussions and commentaries on the Mishnah's laws by generations of leading rabbis during the next four centuries in the two centers of Jewish life, Judea and [[Sassanid Empire|Babylonia]].<ref name=Telushkin /> The Gemara with the Mishnah came to be edited together into compilations known as the [[Talmud]]. Both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] and the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] have been transmitted in written form to the present day, although the more extensive Babylonian Talmud is widely considered to be more authoritative.<ref name=Telushkin />\n\nThe Talmud's discussions follow the order of the Mishnah, although not all tractates are discussed. Generally, a law from the Mishnah is cited, which is followed by a rabbinic deliberation on its meaning. The discussion often, but not always, results in a decision regarding the more persuasive or authoritative position based on available sources or anecdotal evidence.<ref name=Telushkin />\n\n==In Jewish tradition==\n\n===Orthodox Judaism===\nRabbinic Judaism holds the Oral Law to be of divine origin. The divinity and authoritativeness of the Oral Law as transmitted from God to Moses on Mount Sinai, continues to be universally accepted by Orthodox and [[Haredi Judaism]] as a fundamental precept of Judaism.<ref name=Gaventa>{{cite book|last=Gaventa|first=William|title=Jewish Perspectives on Theology and the Human Experience of Disability|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45351-9|pages=109\u2013112}}</ref> The Oral Law was the basis for nearly all subsequent rabbinic literature. It is therefore intricately related to the development of [[Halacha]]. As such, despite codification, interpretation of the Oral Law is likewise required.\n\n====Divine source and transmission====\nRabbis of the Talmudic era conceived of the Oral Torah in two distinct ways.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Oral Law and the Jurisprudence of a Textless Text|last=Dane|first=Perry|date=Winter 1991|journal=S'vara: A Journal of Philosophy, Law, and Judaism|volume=2|page=11|ssrn=1718700}}</ref> First, Rabbinic tradition saw the Oral Torah as an unbroken chain of transmission. The distinctive feature of this view was that Oral Torah was \"conveyed by word of mouth and memorized.\"<ref>Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, ''The Orality of Rabbinic Writing'', in The Cambridge Companion to the Talmud, ed. Martin Jaffee, 2007. p. 39. This is attested to in numerous sources, such as Mishnah Avot 1:1. The manner of teaching and memorization is described in B. Eruvin 54b.</ref> Second, the Rabbis also viewed the Oral Torah as an interpretive tradition, and not merely as memorized traditions. They saw the written Torah as containing many levels of interpretation. It was left to later generations, who were steeped in the ''oral tradition'' of interpretation, to discover those (\"hidden\") interpretations not revealed by Moses.<ref>In rabbinic literature this view is exemplified by the story of Rabbi Akiva who expounded heaps and heaps of laws from the scriptural crowns of the letters in the written Torah.\n\nAccording to traditional Judaism, the laws transmitted to Moses contained in the Written [[Torah]] (or [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]]) were written down on scrolls, but God enjoined Moses from writing down the explanation of these laws. Indeed, the Talmud relays that Moses himself would not understand all of these interpretations, nevertheless, these are also called [[Law given to Moses at Sinai]]. B Menahot 29b. See, Elizabeth Shanks Alexander, op cit.</ref> Instead, Moses was obligated to impart the explanations orally to students, children, and fellow adults. It was thus forbidden to write and publish the Oral Torah.<ref>See BT Temurah 14b, and, BT Gittin 60b. Also, Y Meggila 4:1</ref>\n\nJewish tradition identifies the unbroken historical chain of individuals who were entrusted with passing down the Oral Law from Moses to the early rabbinic period: \"Moses received the Torah and handed it down to Joshua; Joshua to the Elders; the Elders to the prophets; and the prophets handed it down to the men of the Great Assembly.\"<ref>Mishna, Avot 1:1; the remainder of chapter 1 identifies further individuals in the chain</ref><ref name=Fackenheim>{{cite book|last=Fackenheim|first=Emil L.|title=What is Judaism?: An Interpretation for the Present Age|year=1999|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-0623-9|pages=68\u201371}}</ref> Similarly, [[Maimonides]] provides a generation by generation account of the names of all those in the direct line that transmitted this tradition, beginning with [[Moses]] up until [[Ravina I|Ravina]] and [[Rav Ashi]], the rabbis who compiled the Babylonian Talmud.<ref>[https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/901656/jewish/Introduction-to-Mishneh-Torah.htm Introduction to Mishneh Torah]</ref>\n\n====The interplay of the Oral and Written Law====\nAccording to traditional Judaism, the Oral Law must have been disseminated at the same time as the Written Torah because certain Torah commandments would be indecipherable without a separate explanatory codex (and, presumably, God would not demand adherence to commandments that could not be understood). Many terms used in the Torah are left undefined, such as the word ''totafot'', usually translated as \"frontlets,\" which is used three times in the Pentateuch (in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 13:9 and [[Deuteronomy]] 6:8 and 11:18) but only identified with [[tefillin]] in the Mishnah (see [[Menachot]] 3:7).\n\nSimilarly, many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions, or assume familiarity on the part of the reader.<ref>David Charles Kraemer, ''The Mind of the Talmud'', Oxford University Press, 1990. pp 157\u2013159</ref><ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\" /><ref>Rabbi [[Gil Student]]: [http://www.aishdas.org/student/oral.htm Proofs for the Oral Torah]</ref> For example, the discussion of ''[[shechita]]'' ([[kosher]] slaughter) in [[Deuteronomy]] 12 states \"you shall kill of your herd and of your flock which God Lord has given you, ''as I have commanded you'',\" without any clear indication of what had been \"commanded\"; only in the Oral Torah are the various requirements of ritual slaughter explicated. Similarly, Deuteronomy 24 discusses the laws of [[divorce]] in passing; these laws are set forth with great specificity in the Mishnah and Gemara. Another example: the blue string of [[tekhelet]] on the [[tzitzit]] is to be dyed with an extraction from what scholars believe to be a snail; a detail only spoken of in the oral Torah.<ref>See http://www.tekhelet.com Ptil Tekhelet</ref> For other examples and further discussion here see ''[[Kuzari]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/khz/khz03.htm 3:35].  \n\nMoreover, according to the traditional view, without an Oral Law, blind adherence to the plain text of certain Torah commandments would lead to unethical acts, or would cause the practitioner to violate a commandment elsewhere in the Torah. Neither of these results could have been intended by God; and thus, ''a priori'', a set of supplementary \"instructions\" must have been provided. A classic example involves the phrase \"[[An eye for an eye]], a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot\" {{bibleverse||Ex|21:22\u201327|131}} is held in the oral tradition to imply monetary compensation \u2013 as opposed to a literal ''[[Lex talionis]]''.<ref>The Talmud explains this concept entails monetary compensation in [[tort]] cases. The [[Torah]]'s first mention of the phrase \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot\" appears in {{bibleverse||Ex|21:22\u201327|131}}. The [[Talmud]] (in ''[[Nezikin|Bava Kamma]]'', 84a), based upon a critical interpretation of the original [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew text]], explains that this biblical concept entails monetary compensation in [[tort]] cases. (Additionally, this law cannot be carried out in practice, for both practical and ethical reasons; see also [[Emor#Leviticus chapter 24|parashat Emor]]). Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable, the phrase cannot be interpreted literally; it would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders.</ref> \nRegardless, the interpretation as \u201cmonetary compensation\u201d is the only one consistent with {{bibleverse||Num|35:30\u201331|131}}; this relationship paralleling the logic of the preceding paragraph.\n\nFinally, and similarly, the Oral Torah is needed to explain actions of biblical actors, seemingly discordant with other verses. For example, the marriage of [[Boaz]], a member of the [[tribe of Judah]] to Ruth, a [[Moab]]itess, as described in the [[Book of Ruth]], appears on its face to contradict the prohibition of {{bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|23:3\u20134|HE}} against marrying Moabites; however, the Oral Torah explains that this prohibition is limited to Moabite ''men''. Similarly, the [[Counting of the Omer#The count|rabbinic practice]] for the [[Counting of the Omer]] ({{bibleverse-lb||Leviticus|23:15\u201316|HE}}) is at odds with the [[Counting of the Omer#Karaite Practice|Karaite practice]], which appears to accord with a more literal reading of these verses, but is in fact borne out by {{bibleverse-lb||Joshua|5:10\u201312|HE}}.<ref>Tim Hegg: [http://www.torahresource.com/EnglishArticles/CountingTheOmer.pdf \"Counting the Omer: An Inquiry into the Divergent Methods of the 1st Century Judaisms\"].</ref> \nNote that the 1st century [[Targum Onkelos]] is largely consistent with the oral tradition as recorded in the [[midrash]], redacted into writing only in the 3rd or 4th century.<ref>See: prof.

For example, excavations at [[Qumran]] ([[Dead Sea Scrolls #Caves 4a and 4b|Cave 4]]) have yielded specimens of ''[[tefillin]]'' and [[Tefillin#Parchment scrolls|parchment scrolls]]; these reflecting later Talmudic discussion.<ref>See for example, [[Yigal Yadin]]: [http://dailydaf.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/teffilin-from-qumran-yigal-yadin.pdf Tefilin from Qumran].</ref> Likewise, the structure and placement of [[Mikvah|ritual baths]] at [[Masada]] appears to be consistent with the [[Mikvah#Requirements of a mikveh|rabbinic requirements]] per the Mishnaic tractate ''[[Mikvaot]]'', although they were constructed approximately 120 years before the Mishnah was compiled.<ref>Rabbi Yosef Back: [http://torahtourguide.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/southern-mikveh-on-masada/ \"Southern mikveh on Masada\"].</ref> \nA [[Seal (emblem)#Ancient Near East|clay seal]] discovered in Jerusalem in 2011 is consistent with the tradition recorded in tractate ''[[Shekalim (Talmud)|Shekalim]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A9%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%94 chapter 5].<ref>See references under [http://bennypowersisraeltours.wordpress.com/tag/mishna/ \"Clay Seal Confirms Ancient Temple Service: Archaeologists\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313125747/https://bennypowersisraeltours.wordpress.com/tag/mishna/ |date=2016-03-13 }}.</ref> The [[Elephantine papyri]] include a \"Passover letter\" (419 BCE) which already included many of the [[Passover|Pesach observances]] of today,<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence.

The Qumran [[4QMMT|''Halachic Letter'']],<ref>''Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah''/ Qumran Cave 4</ref> which records approximately a dozen disputes regarding the application of halakha, also testifies to the evolutionary process of the Oral Law.\n\n====In rabbinic literature and commentary====\nThis section, discusses the Rabbinic treatment of the Written Law in light of the Oral Law, and the consequent overlap of the oral and written, and is not a general discussion of rabbinic Literature, ''[[Per se (terminology)|per se]]''. \n\nAs above, the Oral Law is recorded in the Midrash and Talmud, while later rabbinic literature builds on these works. \nHere, it is important to note that these source, \"oral\", documents, are nevertheless intimately connected to the written. \nThus, the [[midrash]] provides a verse by verse discussion of the entire (written) Tanakh, per the oral Torah. \nSimilarly, the Talmud, although applying a different framework, discusses and analyses the written Torah\u2014both from an [[aggadic]] and [[halakhic]] perspective\u2014drawing from (and recording) the oral tradition; here the discussion is organized around the Mishnah, and the discussion does not proceed verse-wise as with the Midrash.\n\n[[Image:Sapirstein Rashi.jpg|thumb|200px|A modern translation of Rashi's commentary on the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]], published by [[Artscroll]]]]\nThe era of the ''[[Rishonim]]'' sees the Oral Law incorporated into the first formal [[Torah commentaries]], where the biblical text is discussed and / or analysed based on the various Midrashic and Talmudic traditions. The chief of these is perhaps [[Rashi]]'s [[Rashi#Commentary on the Tanakh|commentary on Tanakh]]. This work clarifies the \"simple\" meaning of the text, by addressing questions implied<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/bonchek/intro.htm|title=What's Bothering Rashi?|author=|date=|website=www.shemayisrael.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> by the wording or verse or paragraph structure, by drawing on the Midrashic, Talmudic and Aggadic literature. It has given rise to numerous counter- (e.g., [[Nahmanides#Commentary on the Torah|Ramban]]) and super-commentaries (e.g., [[Elijah Mizrachi#Works|Mizrachi]]), all similarly drawing on the Oral Torah, and widely studied to this day (see ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'').\n\n[[Image:HaKsav VeHaKabalah.jpg|thumb|150px|Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg's ''Haketav VeHaKabbalah'' deals with the relationship between the written and oral Torah]]\nIn more recent times, ''[[Acharonim|Acharonic]]'' times, several ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]) commentaries have been produced, which, in some sense, ''reverse'' the direction of the analysis.

These included:\n* [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss#His Dor Dor we-Dorshaw|''Dor Dor v'Dor'shav'']] (\"Each generation and its Scholars\"), by Rabbi [[Isaac Hirsch Weiss]], a five volume history of the Oral Law, Halakha and Aggada, from [[Biblical]] times until the composition of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''.\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes#Works|''Mevo Hatalmud'']] (\"Introduction to the Talmud\") and ''Torat Neviim'' (\"Teachings of the Prophets\"), by Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]].

The second, treatises on the authority of Talmudic tradition, and on the organic structure and methodology of the Talmud. \n*[[David_Zvi_Hoffmann#Writings|''Die Erste Mishna'']] (The First Mishna), a historical and linguistic analysis of the Mishna by [[David Zvi Hoffmann]], positing an early, uniform, undisputed, and therefore authoritative collection of the Oral Law.\n* ''Matteh Dan'' (or ''[[Kuzari]] Hasheini''; London 1714) written by Rabbi [[David Nieto]] demonstrates the authority of the Oral Law, and defends the tradition against attacks by [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] and skeptics.\n*Several works by Rabbi [[Immanuel Aboab]], especially his ''Nomologia'', defend the traditional law and discuss its chronology.\nOther well known works here, if perhaps less modern in orientation, include [[Maimonides]]' (Rambam's) [[Maimonides#Judaic and philosophical works|''Introduction to the Mishnah'']]\u2014dealing with the nature of the Oral Law, the distinction between the prophet and the sage, and the organizational structure of the Mishnah\u2014as well as [[Isaiah Horowitz]]'s (\"The Shelah\") ''Introduction to the Oral Torah'' in part 2 of his [[Isaiah Horowitz#Works|''Shenei Luchot HaBerit'']]\n\nFinally, other major works discussing the Bible as based on the Oral Torah include the following.\n* [[Menasseh Ben Israel#Writings|''El Conciliador'']] (\"The Conciliator\"), by Rabbi [[Menasseh Ben Israel]], a work written to reconcile the apparent contradictions in numerous passages throughout the Bible by utilizing \u201can astounding range of sources\", primarily the Talmud and the classic Jewish commentaries. It was written in Spanish, in Amsterdam, 1632, primarily to strengthen the faith of the [[Marranos]].\n* Weiss' ''Dor Dor v'Dor'shav'' similarly discusses apparent divergencies in the Pentateuch and the various books of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]].\n* ''[[Me'am Lo'ez]]'', begun by Rabbi [[Yaakov Culi]] in 1730, a detailed explanation of each chapter of the Torah, explaining it from \"countless approaches\", especially according to the [[Midrash]] and [[Talmud]]; also discusses the relevant ''[[Halacha]]'' as based on the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' and ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''.

Rather, the branches of modern Judaism differ more in their views regarding the divinity and immutability of the Oral Torah than they do in their belief in the importance of an interpretive tradition as exemplified in the Talmud.<ref>For more detail from a general perspective, see Rabbi Nathan Cardozo, ''The Infinite Chain: Torah, Masorah, and Man'' ({{ISBN|0-944070-15-9}}), and Rabbi [[Gil Student]], [http://www.aishdas.org/student/oral.htm ''Proofs for the Oral Torah''].

In many respects, this led to a more severe observance than that of the Pharisees especially as regards purity laws and [[temple]] practice.

It hosts 16.209 migrants on its island and 33.650 migrants on the mainland, most of whom are women and children. Because of lack of water, medical care and security protection witnessed by the Euro- Med monitor team- especially with the arrival of winter, they are at risk of serious deterioration in health, mostly children and pregnant women. 1,500 refugees were, accordingly, moved into other places since their camps were deluged with snow, but relocation of the refugees always came too late after they lived without electricity and heating devices for too long. It also showed that there is a lack of access to legal services and security protection to the refugees and migrants in the camps; there is no trust between the resident and the protection offices, paving a path for some people to report crimes and illegal acts in the camps. In addition, the migrants are subject to regular xenophobic attacks, fascist violence, forced strip searches at the hands of residents and police and detention. The women living in the Athens settlements and the [[Vasilika refugee camp|Vasilika]], [[Softex]] and [[Diavata]] camps feel worried about their children as they may be subjected to sexual abuse, trafficking and drug use. As a result, some of the refugees and migrants commit suicide, burn property and protest. Finally, it clarified the difficulties the refugees face when entering into Greece; more than 16,000 people are trapped while waiting for deportation on the Greek islands of [[Lesbos|Lesvos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], [[Leros]] and [[Kos]], and the number of residents is double the capacity of the five islands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1703/Asylum-seekers-attempt-suicide-daily-as-they-face-desperate-circumstances-in-Greece|title=Asylum seekers attempt suicide daily as they face desperate circumstances in Greece|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|language=en|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2017 dozens of Afghani asylum seekers made a demonstration in a square in Stockholm against their pending deportations.

[[President of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] responded with force and consequently, more protests were triggered nationwide against the Assad regime. By July 2011, hundreds of thousands of people were protesting against President Assad. An early violent crackdown was implemented to try to mitigate these uprisings\u2014however, these measures were met with more unrest. By [[Arab Spring|May 2011]], thousands of people had already fled the country and the first refugee camps opened in Turkey. In March 2012, the UNHCR decided to appoint a Regional Refugee Coordinator for Syrian Refugees\u2014recognising the growing concerns surrounding the crisis. Just a year later, in March 2013, the number of Syrian refugees reached 1,000,000. By December 2017, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] counted 1,000,000 asylum applications for Syrian refugees in the European Union.

Since then, the nation has faced fluctuating levels of [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|civil war]] amidst unending unrest. The increase in refugee numbers has been credited primarily to the [[Taliban]] presence within Afghanistan. Their retreat in 2001, led to nearly 6 million Afghan refugees returning to their homeland.

The greatest number of applications were from Syria, Afghanistan and Nigeria, giving a clear indication of the current nodes of this crisis. However, the number of Syrians and Afghans continued to be less than that of the same time in 2016, suggesting that perhaps, the peak of this crisis has passed. Initially looking at the noticeably fewer number of both migrants and applications indicates that this crisis may be on the decline. But the increasing number of illegal immigrants from Africa simply suggests that the direction of the crisis is changing. While Germany recorded the highest number of first time applicants (over 49,000), Spain saw a 30 percent increase in the number of asylum seekers, along with Cyprus and Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Asylum quarterly report\" />\n\n=== Illegal border crossings ===\n[[File:Migrants in Hungary 2015 Aug 003.jpg|thumb|Migrants along the Western Balkan route crossing from Serbia into Hungary, 24 August 2015]]\nIn September 2015, Europol estimated there were 30 000 suspected migrant smugglers, which rose to 55 000 in 2016 and a further 10 000 more in 2017.

Named the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), the system sought to address three key problems which consisted of asylum shopping, differing outcomes in different EU Member States for those seeking asylum, and differing social benefits in different EU Member States for those seeking asylum.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mjilonline.org/the-common-european-asylum-system-its-history-content-and-shortcomings/|title=The Common European Asylum System: Its History, Content, and Shortcomings \u2013 The Michigan Journal of International Law|last=Raithel|first=Silvia|date=2016-02-09|work=The Michigan Journal of International Law|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to address these issues, the European Commission created five components that sought to fulfill minimum standards for asylum:<ref name=\":03\" />\n* The Asylum Procedures Directive\n* The Receptions Conditions Directive\n* The Qualification Directive\n* The Dublin regulation\n* The Eurodac Regulation\nCompleted in 2005, the Common European Asylum System sought to protect the rights those seeking asylum.

Due to this divided asylum system and problems with the Dublin system, the European Commission proposed a reform of the Common European Asylum System in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-migration-and-asylum-european-union|title=The EU Has a Solidarity Crisis.

It hosts 16.209 migrants on its island and 33.650 migrants on the mainland, most of whom are women and children. Because of lack of water, medical care and security protection witnessed by the Euro- Med monitor team- especially with the arrival of winter, they are at risk of serious deterioration in health, mostly children and pregnant women. 1,500 refugees were, accordingly, moved into other places since their camps were deluged with snow, but relocation of the refugees always came too late after they lived without electricity and heating devices for too long. It also showed that there is a lack of access to legal services and security protection to the refugees and migrants in the camps; there is no trust between the resident and the protection offices, paving a path for some people to report crimes and illegal acts in the camps. In addition, the migrants are subject to regular xenophobic attacks, fascist violence, forced strip searches at the hands of residents and police and detention. The women living in the Athens settlements and the [[Vasilika refugee camp|Vasilika]], [[Softex]] and [[Diavata]] camps feel worried about their children as they may be subjected to sexual abuse, trafficking and drug use. As a result, some of the refugees and migrants commit suicide, burn property and protest. Finally, it clarified the difficulties the refugees face when entering into Greece; more than 16,000 people are trapped while waiting for deportation on the Greek islands of [[Lesbos|Lesvos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], [[Leros]] and [[Kos]], and the number of residents is double the capacity of the five islands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1703/Asylum-seekers-attempt-suicide-daily-as-they-face-desperate-circumstances-in-Greece|title=Asylum seekers attempt suicide daily as they face desperate circumstances in Greece|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|language=en|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2017 dozens of Afghani asylum seekers made a demonstration in a square in Stockholm against their pending deportations.

[[President of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] responded with force and consequently, more protests were triggered nationwide against the Assad regime. By July 2011, hundreds of thousands of people were protesting against President Assad. An early violent crackdown was implemented to try to mitigate these uprisings\u2014however, these measures were met with more unrest. By [[Arab Spring|May 2011]], thousands of people had already fled the country and the first refugee camps opened in Turkey. In March 2012, the UNHCR decided to appoint a Regional Refugee Coordinator for Syrian Refugees\u2014recognising the growing concerns surrounding the crisis.

The majority have resettled in Pakistan and Iran, but it is becoming increasingly common to migrate further west to the European Union. Afghanistan has faced nearly 40 years of conflict dating back to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion in 1979]]. Since then, the nation has faced fluctuating levels of [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|civil war]] amidst unending unrest. The increase in refugee numbers has been credited primarily to the [[Taliban]] presence within Afghanistan. Their retreat in 2001, led to nearly 6 million Afghan refugees returning to their homeland. However, after [[Taliban insurgency|civil unrest and fighting alongside the Taliban's return]], nearly 2.5 million refugees have fled Afghanistan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rescue.org/article/afghanistan-what-you-need-know-about-one-worlds-longest-refugee-crises|title=Afghanistan: What you need to know about one of the world's longest refugee crises|date=2016-09-08|work=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref> Most Afghan refugees, however, seek refuge in the neighboring nation of Pakistan.

The greatest number of applications were from Syria, Afghanistan and Nigeria, giving a clear indication of the current nodes of this crisis. However, the number of Syrians and Afghans continued to be less than that of the same time in 2016, suggesting that perhaps, the peak of this crisis has passed. Initially looking at the noticeably fewer number of both migrants and applications indicates that this crisis may be on the decline. But the increasing number of illegal immigrants from Africa simply suggests that the direction of the crisis is changing. While Germany recorded the highest number of first time applicants (over 49,000), Spain saw a 30 percent increase in the number of asylum seekers, along with Cyprus and Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Asylum quarterly report\" />\n\n=== Illegal border crossings ===\n[[File:Migrants in Hungary 2015 Aug 003.jpg|thumb|Migrants along the Western Balkan route crossing from Serbia into Hungary, 24 August 2015]]\nIn September 2015, Europol estimated there were 30 000 suspected migrant smugglers, which rose to 55 000 in 2016 and a further 10 000 more in 2017.
