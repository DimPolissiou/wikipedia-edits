It also borders the municipalities of [[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija|San Isidro]] and [[San Antonio, Nueva Ecija|San Antonio]] in the province of [[Nueva Ecija]]; the municipalities of [[Magalang, Pampanga|Magalang]], [[Candaba, Pampanga|Candaba]] and [[Arayat, Pampanga|Arayat]] in [[Pampanga]] province; and to its north-west is the municipality of [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]] in [[Tarlac]] province.\n\nThe land area is flat-bounded river with abundant fertile soil; very ideal for cultivation.

The abundance of sugar during the pre-Spanish era is evident in a wide area of kabyaw including the area going to the foot of Mount Arayat. The kabyawan became familiar to the neighboring places due to the concentration of kabyawan in the place where it was located and was identified as Kabyawan and later shortened to \"Kabyaw\" and eventually altered the spelling due to the influence of the foreign alphabet letters. The used of kabyawan then is prevalent among the natives constituting mainly the ancient tribes of tagalogs that hails from Bulacan and capampangan of which they came in waves of migration from mainland Malay origin as evident from their language similarity.\nThe Kabyawan tools might have been brought by the exploring Malays and later improved by the natives settling in the island of Luzon however there are findings that most of the antiquated wooden kabyawan tools at present can be found in Ilocos where the early Sumatran and Melanesian explorers had embarked earlier than the Malays. Similarly, during that period, the natives of the mountain province whose origin is from mainland China might have been the one responsible in introducing the said crushing tools which we know now as the KABYAWAN. The settlement that has been known as Sinipit, Palasinan, Pantalan, Pinaglamoan, Kandumpa, Kambabalo, Longalong, Mayayade, Tinalan, Makabaklay, Saklang and Palanas were words and terms taken from Malay and the tribal dialect in existence during that period.\nCabiao as termed today was a just balangay of the once prosperous of empire of the campampangan settlement named Candaba, as it was discovered by the exploring Spanish conquistadores in 1590. The visita of Cabiao was perhaps established somewhere between 1765 and 1767 by the Jesuit Missionary before they were sent back to Spain under the order of King Charles III of Spain to recall all the Society of Jesus religious order to return to Spain thereby banishing them from all the Spanish dominions. Cabiao gain its full township of Pampanga in 1797 under the term of Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar y Ponce de Leon* with the recommendation of the returning order of the Augustinian in the Province of Pampanga and elevates the Visita of St. John Nepomucene that was established by the Jesuits into a regular Parish Church. It was established as one of the municipality of Nueva Ecija on February 9, 1848 upon the order issued by Governor General Narciso Claveria Y Zaldua and upon the recommendation made by the Governor General Marcelino Oraa. \nThe growth of Cabiao during that time maybe attributed to its vast marsh and inland water that serves as inland fishery of the area. The Poblacion comprising the three pillars of Spanish governance of the Spaniard namely the Casa Municipal, Casa dela Iglesia and Casa Judicial were erected in 1838 under the term of Don Josef Kabigting as the Gobernadorcillo (the present location of the church, the central school and the intervening residential area between the central school and the church).\n\nThe desire of the populace of Cabiao to be free from Spanish domination and tyranny resulted in the uprising on September 2, 1896. Numbering around 700 men (461 listed in the Tablet of Heroes in the Municipal Compound), the townsfolk of Cabiao and the Cabiao Brass Band under the leadership of their Capitan Municipal Mariano Nu\u00f1ez Llanera together with the people of the neighboring towns of Arayat, Deliquente (San Antonio) & Jaen led the siege against the colonizing Spaniards stationed at the Factoria of San Isidro. This event was marked as the First Cry of Nueva Ecija. It did not take too long that the Spanish Colonial Government, succumbed to cede the Archipelago of Philippines to the United States on December 10, 1898 that brought about the Treaty of Paris, and once again the Philippines was under colonial rule this time by the American. In the last days of the Spanish occupation, the Cabiao heroes participated in the declaration of Philippine Republic in Malolos on January 23, 1899.\nDuring the Philippine\u2013American War, Cabiao was one of the fiercely battled terrains of the American forces in pursuit of General Aguinaldo\u2019s Forces however most of the populated areas of Cabiao have been saved from the encounter. General Pio del Pilar hold out in the marshes of San Vicente and Santa Rita to delay the intruding Forces of General Elwell Stephen Otis under the command of General Henry Ware Lawton.\n\nIn 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as a medium of instructions. Pedro Oreta was elected as the first chief executive of the town under American civil regime followed by the then Mun. President Jose Crespo who established and organized the Presidencia (township hierarchy and organizational plan) constituting the different executive department of the municipality. American occupation in Cabiao has not been as cruel as their Spanish predecessor, however, the people of Cabiao were already afraid to trust the new colonizer. Thomasites missionaries arrived in Cabiao in the early part of 1902 as a part of educating the people of Cabiao and in 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as the medium of instruction. Some rural folks used to study individually in the Spanish methods of learning on arithmetic and reading in their native tongue Tagalog.\n\nFrom 1907-1909, Cabiao was placed under jurisdiction of San Isidro and the executive power was then held by the Municipal President of San Isidro. It was in the term of Office of Municipal President Gonzalo Del Leon that the seat of Municipal Town Hall was erected on the land donated by the Romero family. It was during the term of Jose Lapuz that Judge Bonifacio Ysip was elected as delegate to the constitutional convention held in Manila.\n\nAfter almost three decades of peace, Japan invaded the Philippines, and the people of Cabiao once again play an important role in the liberation of our country, HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) or People\u2019s Anti-Japanese Army, was then established in Sitio Bawit, San Julian, Cabiao on March 29, 1942. When the Allies between the combined U.S. and Filipino troops finally liberated the Philippines and as soon as the Central Government was established in Manila, Mariano Guevarra was appointed Mayor of Cabiao.  He was the chief executive of the town in 1945.  Prudencio Ortiz Luis succeeded Guevarra who occupies the position for only a few months.  In later part of 1945 after the liberation, most of the people of Cabiao were still in the far flung areas of Cambabalu, Saclang Capampangan, Saclang Tagalog and Dumanas and it was during this time that the mayor of this town has been appointed by then President Manuel Roxas by the name of Ambrosio Aligada. He was appointed as the Chief Executive of the town from 1945-1947. The town of Cabiao was placed under the military government under Pablo Aligada.  It was also during the time of Aligada that the Sitio of Palasinan (presently San Gregorio) comprising the property owned by Don Ramon Fernandez were repopulated by the people coming from said the places whereas the area of Bagong Silang were repopulate by the people coming from Buliran, Guyong-guyong, Luyos of which most of them are Tagalogs. The people of Cabiao were governed by Aligada through coercive and dictatorial rule that is being manifested by the force labor construction of the Cabiao High School which is the monumental relic of his tenure. Isaias Manalastas seated as the progressive mayor through the support HUKBALAHAPs that during that time is at its height from which they fielded their party named Prente Popular however it did not last long due to the suspicion of the military of an imminent grabbing of power where these party is the political front of the Huks. Nieves Pablo, a woman, was the fourth appointed mayor in that same year.\n\nIt was also the time when the height of the Huk uprising began when the entire town was the seat of the rebellion, where the 50,000 armed group was inducted in Bawit and in Pasong Diablo only to be captured en masse by the then late General Ismael Lapus through the order of Secretary Magsaysay and the clearing of the entire forested area of Bagong Sikat and Santa Isabel had begun purposely to eliminate the lair of the Huk rebels. The health center were constructed through the financial support of Defense Secretary Castelo Justice Secretary Hermogenes Concepcion and Do\u00f1a Maria Romero Buencamino (who was at that time the richest family and the most influential).\n\nYear 1950, when the 1st tenure of then Paterno Santiano began, the towns public market was constructed through the support of the national government since the towns income cannot at that time support such huge amount of expenditures.\n \nIt was the 1st tenure of Gregorio T. Crespo, when the old town hall was renovated and the original Cabiao Central School Building has been restored. The gravelling of Sinipit -San Roque Road was made. Mayor Paterno Santiano reassumed his post as a mayor after a very much contested election results.\n\nIn 1960, Crespo reassumed his post as Mayor of Cabiao, and Pedro T. Wycoco was appointed as the Chief of Police. The Gapan- Arayat Road, Cabiao Section were constructed by Golangco Construction and Development Corp. in 1963.\n\nIn 1979 the town's Public Market was rehabilitated through the help of the member of the Parliament Angel Concepcion for which main building was constructed contiguously from the previous two small one. The town of Cabiao was governed by Mayor Crespo for almost three decades bringing together town folks of Cabiao to be one living in peace and serves as the legacy for which Mayor Crespo was known.\n\nThe EDSA Revolution of 1986, was the year when Mayor Crespo was dislodged by the appointment of Atty. Antonio Ll. Lapuz as Officer in Charge of Cabiao. During his tenure, the inception of the municipal development planning were made, and listing of priority projects were categorized, however fundings for these infrastructure were no longer made in his tenure because it had lasted only for two and half years.\n\nAtty. Lapuz was succeeded by Eng\u2019r. Ireneo Manahan, who bested in the three-way election fight during that time, followed the pattern and plans which Atty. Lapuz had laid before he left office. He continued in building roads, barangay health, and brgy. hall including the renovation of the municipal town hall. It was also during that time, that the Santa Isabel- Bagong Sikat Bridge has been initially built however due to the insufficiency of funds the said bridge has not been finished during his tenure. He had also built a community under his name which later name as Manahan Village.\n\nIn his last term of office, mayor Manahan endorsed councilor Gloria Baby Crespo Congco as his successor, the eldest daughter of former Mayor Gregorio Crespo and was elected mayor of the municipality in 1998.  She is the youngest and the first woman to be elected chief executive of the town.  She was also re-elected in the elections of 2001 and 2004.\n\nThe incumbent mayor is Ramil B. Rivera who defeated Gloria Crespo Congco during the 2016 election.\n\nDuring their term, economic performance of Cabiao become robust and rapidly growth. He received Certipicate of Most Outstanding Mayors of the Philippines 2017 and 2018. Golden Globe awards for Cosmopolitan Filipino Achiever of Civil Service 2018. Certipicate of Good Local Governance 2017 and 2018.\n\n==Economy==\nCabiao's economy is one of the fastest growing in the province of [[Nueva Ecija]] and lead as one of the most competitive municipalities in entire [[Central Luzon]] region according to the [[National Competitiveness Council (Philippines)]]Cities/Municipalities Competitiveness Index 2018.

The abundance of sugar during the pre-Spanish era is evident in a wide area of kabyaw including the area going to the foot of Mount Arayat. The kabyawan became familiar to the neighboring places due to the concentration of kabyawan in the place where it was located and was identified as Kabyawan and later shortened to \"Kabyaw\" and eventually altered the spelling due to the influence of the foreign alphabet letters. The used of kabyawan then is prevalent among the natives constituting mainly the ancient tribes of tagalogs that hails from Bulacan and capampangan of which they came in waves of migration from mainland Malay origin as evident from their language similarity.\nThe Kabyawan tools might have been brought by the exploring Malays and later improved by the natives settling in the island of Luzon however there are findings that most of the antiquated wooden kabyawan tools at present can be found in Ilocos where the early Sumatran and Melanesian explorers had embarked earlier than the Malays. Similarly, during that period, the natives of the mountain province whose origin is from mainland China might have been the one responsible in introducing the said crushing tools which we know now as the KABYAWAN. The settlement that has been known as Sinipit, Palasinan, Pantalan, Pinaglamoan, Kandumpa, Kambabalo, Longalong, Mayayade, Tinalan, Makabaklay, Saklang and Palanas were words and terms taken from Malay and the tribal dialect in existence during that period.\nCabiao as termed today was a just balangay of the once prosperous of empire of the campampangan settlement named Candaba, as it was discovered by the exploring Spanish conquistadores in 1590. The visita of Cabiao was perhaps established somewhere between 1765 and 1767 by the Jesuit Missionary before they were sent back to Spain under the order of King Charles III of Spain to recall all the Society of Jesus religious order to return to Spain thereby banishing them from all the Spanish dominions. Cabiao gain its full township of Pampanga in 1797 under the term of Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar y Ponce de Leon* with the recommendation of the returning order of the Augustinian in the Province of Pampanga and elevates the Visita of St. John Nepomucene that was established by the Jesuits into a regular Parish Church. It was established as one of the municipality of Nueva Ecija on February 9, 1848 upon the order issued by Governor General Narciso Claveria Y Zaldua and upon the recommendation made by the Governor General Marcelino Oraa. \nThe growth of Cabiao during that time maybe attributed to its vast marsh and inland water that serves as inland fishery of the area. The Poblacion comprising the three pillars of Spanish governance of the Spaniard namely the Casa Municipal, Casa dela Iglesia and Casa Judicial were erected in 1838 under the term of Don Josef Kabigting as the Gobernadorcillo (the present location of the church, the central school and the intervening residential area between the central school and the church).\n\nThe desire of the populace of Cabiao to be free from Spanish domination and tyranny resulted in the uprising on September 2, 1896. Numbering around 700 men (461 listed in the Tablet of Heroes in the Municipal Compound), the townsfolk of Cabiao and the Cabiao Brass Band under the leadership of their Capitan Municipal Mariano Nu\u00f1ez Llanera together with the people of the neighboring towns of Arayat, Deliquente (San Antonio) & Jaen led the siege against the colonizing Spaniards stationed at the Factoria of San Isidro. This event was marked as the First Cry of Nueva Ecija. It did not take too long that the Spanish Colonial Government, succumbed to cede the Archipelago of Philippines to the United States on December 10, 1898 that brought about the Treaty of Paris, and once again the Philippines was under colonial rule this time by the American. In the last days of the Spanish occupation, the Cabiao heroes participated in the declaration of Philippine Republic in Malolos on January 23, 1899.\nDuring the Philippine\u2013American War, Cabiao was one of the fiercely battled terrains of the American forces in pursuit of General Aguinaldo\u2019s Forces however most of the populated areas of Cabiao have been saved from the encounter. General Pio del Pilar hold out in the marshes of San Vicente and Santa Rita to delay the intruding Forces of General Elwell Stephen Otis under the command of General Henry Ware Lawton.\n\nIn 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as a medium of instructions. Pedro Oreta was elected as the first chief executive of the town under American civil regime followed by the then Mun. President Jose Crespo who established and organized the Presidencia (township hierarchy and organizational plan) constituting the different executive department of the municipality. American occupation in Cabiao has not been as cruel as their Spanish predecessor, however, the people of Cabiao were already afraid to trust the new colonizer. Thomasites missionaries arrived in Cabiao in the early part of 1902 as a part of educating the people of Cabiao and in 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as the medium of instruction. Some rural folks used to study individually in the Spanish methods of learning on arithmetic and reading in their native tongue Tagalog.\n\nFrom 1907-1909, Cabiao was placed under jurisdiction of San Isidro and the executive power was then held by the Municipal President of San Isidro. It was in the term of Office of Municipal President Gonzalo Del Leon that the seat of Municipal Town Hall was erected on the land donated by the Romero family. It was during the term of Jose Lapuz that Judge Bonifacio Ysip was elected as delegate to the constitutional convention held in Manila.\n\nAfter almost three decades of peace, Japan invaded the Philippines, and the people of Cabiao once again play an important role in the liberation of our country, HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) or People\u2019s Anti-Japanese Army, was then established in Sitio Bawit, San Julian, Cabiao on March 29, 1942. When the Allies between the combined U.S. and Filipino troops finally liberated the Philippines and as soon as the Central Government was established in Manila, Mariano Guevarra was appointed Mayor of Cabiao.  He was the chief executive of the town in 1945.  Prudencio Ortiz Luis succeeded Guevarra who occupies the position for only a few months.  In later part of 1945 after the liberation, most of the people of Cabiao were still in the far flung areas of Cambabalu, Saclang Capampangan, Saclang Tagalog and Dumanas and it was during this time that the mayor of this town has been appointed by then President Manuel Roxas by the name of Ambrosio Aligada. He was appointed as the Chief Executive of the town from 1945-1947. The town of Cabiao was placed under the military government under Pablo Aligada.  It was also during the time of Aligada that the Sitio of Palasinan (presently San Gregorio) comprising the property owned by Don Ramon Fernandez were repopulated by the people coming from said the places whereas the area of Bagong Silang were repopulate by the people coming from Buliran, Guyong-guyong, Luyos of which most of them are Tagalogs. The people of Cabiao were governed by Aligada through coercive and dictatorial rule that is being manifested by the force labor construction of the Cabiao High School which is the monumental relic of his tenure. Isaias Manalastas seated as the progressive mayor through the support HUKBALAHAPs that during that time is at its height from which they fielded their party named Prente Popular however it did not last long due to the suspicion of the military of an imminent grabbing of power where these party is the political front of the Huks. Nieves Pablo, a woman, was the fourth appointed mayor in that same year.\n\nIt was also the time when the height of the Huk uprising began when the entire town was the seat of the rebellion, where the 50,000 armed group was inducted in Bawit and in Pasong Diablo only to be captured en masse by the then late General Ismael Lapus through the order of Secretary Magsaysay and the clearing of the entire forested area of Bagong Sikat and Santa Isabel had begun purposely to eliminate the lair of the Huk rebels. The health center were constructed through the financial support of Defense Secretary Castelo Justice Secretary Hermogenes Concepcion and Do\u00f1a Maria Romero Buencamino (who was at that time the richest family and the most influential).\n\nYear 1950, when the 1st tenure of then Paterno Santiano began, the towns public market was constructed through the support of the national government since the towns income cannot at that time support such huge amount of expenditures.\n \nIt was the 1st tenure of Gregorio T. Crespo, when the old town hall was renovated and the original Cabiao Central School Building has been restored. The gravelling of Sinipit -San Roque Road was made. Mayor Paterno Santiano reassumed his post as a mayor after a very much contested election results.\n\nIn 1960, Crespo reassumed his post as Mayor of Cabiao, and Pedro T. Wycoco was appointed as the Chief of Police. The Gapan- Arayat Road, Cabiao Section were constructed by Golangco Construction and Development Corp. in 1963.\n\nIn 1979 the town's Public Market was rehabilitated through the help of the member of the Parliament Angel Concepcion for which main building was constructed contiguously from the previous two small one. The town of Cabiao was governed by Mayor Crespo for almost three decades bringing together town folks of Cabiao to be one living in peace and serves as the legacy for which Mayor Crespo was known.\n\nThe EDSA Revolution of 1986, was the year when Mayor Crespo was dislodged by the appointment of Atty. Antonio Ll. Lapuz as Officer in Charge of Cabiao. During his tenure, the inception of the municipal development planning were made, and listing of priority projects were categorized, however fundings for these infrastructure were no longer made in his tenure because it had lasted only for two and half years.\n\nAtty. Lapuz was succeeded by Eng\u2019r. Ireneo Manahan, who bested in the three-way election fight during that time, followed the pattern and plans which Atty. Lapuz had laid before he left office. He continued in building roads, barangay health, and brgy. hall including the renovation of the municipal town hall. It was also during that time, that the Santa Isabel- Bagong Sikat Bridge has been initially built however due to the insufficiency of funds the said bridge has not been finished during his tenure. He had also built a community under his name which later name as Manahan Village.\n\nIn his last term of office, mayor Manahan endorsed councilor Gloria Baby Crespo Congco as his successor, the eldest daughter of former Mayor Gregorio Crespo and was elected mayor of the municipality in 1998.  She is the youngest and the first woman to be elected chief executive of the town.  She was also re-elected in the elections of 2001 and 2004.\n\nThe incumbent mayor is Ramil B. Rivera who defeated Gloria Crespo Congco during the 2016 election.\n\nDuring their term, economic performance of Cabiao become robust and rapidly growth. He received Certipicate of Most Outstanding Mayors of the Philippines 2017 and 2018. Golden Globe awards for Cosmopolitan Filipino Achiever of Civil Service 2018.

It has separate internasal and prefrontal scales.<ref name=\"ref 2\" /> No gular scales occur between the posterior chin shields. Each maxilla has 9\u201312 small teeth. The single hemipenis has a forked sulcus spermaticus and three large basal spines. Adult males have ridges on the body scales that are dorsal to the anal plate. The young of this species are always much darker than the parent; then during the second year they  change from a dark gray to the brown of the adult specimen.<ref name=\"Graham rocks\"/> ''C. a. amoenus''  is almost exclusively an earthworm predator, but has also been known to consume other prey, from slugs to small salamanders. Due to human activities, ''C. a. amoenus'' is becoming rare in some areas. It is currently protected as threatened in [[Massachusetts]] and as a species of special concern in [[Rhode Island]].<ref name=\"ref 2\" />\n\n==Geographic range==\nIt is found in southern [[Connecticut]], southwestern Massachusetts, southeastern New York, [[New Jersey]], southeastern [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], eastern [[West Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], South Carolina, northern Georgia and Alabama, and in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]].<ref name=\"boogers\">[[Albert Hazen Wright|Wright, A.H.]] and A.A.

Some have found them active in every month but February on the coastal plain of South Carolina. Farther north, the worm snake is active from March\u2013April to October- November. Few are active above ground in the summer, but a second, lesser period of activity occurs in the fall. To escape overheating or desiccation, it has adopted a fossorial lifestyle and it usually spends most of the year underground or in rotting logs.<ref name=\"ref 2\" /> They are normally found in forests with high leaf litter and canopy cover.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, WB. |author2=Wang, Y |author3=Schweitzer, CJ |title=Habitat relationships of reptiles in pine beetle disturbed forests of Alabama, USA with guidelines for a modified drift-fence sampling method|url=http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/35853|journal=Current Zoology|volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=411\u2013420 |year=2010}}</ref> They generally remain inactive during extreme temperatures.

Worm snakes release a foul-smelling liquid from their vents when handled, but they are completely harmless to humans and rarely even attempt to bite.<ref name=\"georgia\"/> ''C. a. amoenus'' is very shy and mild-mannered. The normal behavior of the snake when handled is to twist, then try to crawl between the fingers, probe the hand with its tail spine, and emit the strong-smelling liquid.<ref name=\"ref 2\" />\n\n== Reproduction ==\nCourtship and mating probably occur in the spring;  the sexes are most often found together between late April and June. Then, the developing eggs can be seen through the translucent venter of the female in late May and June. Oviposition takes place between early June and mid-July, 5 June to 15 July in northern Virginia. Eggs are laid in late June or early July, two to eight per clutch. The eggs are smooth and elongated, {{convert|16|\u2013|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|7|\u2013|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. Often, one end of an egg is wider than the other. Hatching occurs in August or early September. Hatchlings are about {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} in total length.<ref name=\"boogers\"/> They are darker than adults.<ref name=\"doggie doo\"/>  The  clutches of eggs are found in depressions under rocks, in cavities in the rotting wood of logs and stumps, and in old sawdust piles; and rodent burrows are probably also used for nesting. A female was nearby or with the eggs in 75% of the cases.<ref name=\"ref 2\" />\n\n==Populations==\nWorm snakes may occur in large numbers where the habitat is ideal. C. Ernst and his students collected 108 individuals from beneath rocks and debris in 100 m along a hillside overlooking the Kentucky River in one hour on an April afternoon. It is the most common snake in northern Virginia, and one site had densities over 200/ha. The 1.88:1.00 sex ratio of a juvenile population in South Carolina significantly favored males (64) over females (34), though the ratio of adults caught in northern Virginia was not significantly different from 1:1.<ref name=\"ref 2\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=RDB>{{NRDB species|genus=Carphophis |species=amoenus |accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Thomas Say|Say T]] (1825). \"Descriptions of three new species of C{{small|OLUBER}}, inhabiting the United States\".

It is much smaller than the Eurasian Griffon. It has a white neck ruff. The adult's whitish back, rump, and underwing coverts contrast with the otherwise dark plumage. The body is black and the secondaries are silvery grey. The head is tinged in pink and bill is silvery with dark ceres. The nostril openings are slit-like. Juveniles are largely dark and take about four or five years to acquire the adult plumage. In flight, the adults show a dark leading edge of the wing and has a white wing-lining on the underside. The undertail coverts are black.<ref name=\"RasmussenAnderton2005\" />\n\nIt is the smallest of the ''[[Gyps]]'' vultures, but is still a very large bird.

The preferred nesting trees were [[Ficus benghalensis|Banyan]], [[sacred fig|Peepul]], [[Terminalia arjuna|Arjun]], and [[Neem]]. The main nesting period was November to March with eggs being laid mainly in January. Several pairs nest in the vicinity of each other and isolated nests tend to be those of younger birds. Nests are nearly 3 feet in diameter and half a foot in thickness, and are lined with green leaves.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> Solitary nests are not used regularly and are sometimes taken over by the red-headed vulture and large owls such as ''[[Bubo coromandus]]''. The male initially brings twigs and arranges them to form the nest. During courtship the male bills the female's head, back and neck. The female invites copulation, and the male mounts and hold the head of the female in his bill.<ref name=Sharma /> Usually, the female lays a single egg, which is white with a tinge of bluish-green. Female birds destroy the nest on loss of an egg. They are usually silent but make hissing and roaring sounds at the nest or when jostling for food.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> The eggs hatch after about 30 to 35 days of incubation. The young chick is covered with grey down. The parents feed them with bits of meat from a carcass. The young birds remain for about three months in the nest.<ref name=Sharma>{{cite journal|first=I.

It is much smaller than the Eurasian Griffon. It has a white neck ruff. The adult's whitish back, rump, and underwing coverts contrast with the otherwise dark plumage. The body is black and the secondaries are silvery grey. The head is tinged in pink and bill is silvery with dark ceres. The nostril openings are slit-like. Juveniles are largely dark and take about four or five years to acquire the adult plumage. In flight, the adults show a dark leading edge of the wing and has a white wing-lining on the underside. The undertail coverts are black.<ref name=\"RasmussenAnderton2005\" />\n\nIt is the smallest of the ''[[Gyps]]'' vultures, but is still a very large bird.

The preferred nesting trees were [[Ficus benghalensis|Banyan]], [[sacred fig|Peepul]], [[Terminalia arjuna|Arjun]], and [[Neem]]. The main nesting period was November to March with eggs being laid mainly in January. Several pairs nest in the vicinity of each other and isolated nests tend to be those of younger birds. Nests are nearly 3 feet in diameter and half a foot in thickness, and are lined with green leaves.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> Solitary nests are not used regularly and are sometimes taken over by the red-headed vulture and large owls such as ''[[Bubo coromandus]]''. The male initially brings twigs and arranges them to form the nest. During courtship the male bills the female's head, back and neck. The female invites copulation, and the male mounts and hold the head of the female in his bill.<ref name=Sharma /> Usually, the female lays a single egg, which is white with a tinge of bluish-green. Female birds destroy the nest on loss of an egg. They are usually silent but make hissing and roaring sounds at the nest or when jostling for food.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> The eggs hatch after about 30 to 35 days of incubation. The young chick is covered with grey down. The parents feed them with bits of meat from a carcass. The young birds remain for about three months in the nest.<ref name=Sharma>{{cite journal|first=I.

Behavior analysis adopts the viewpoint of [[radical behaviorism]], treating thoughts, emotions, and other covert activity as behavior that is subject to the same rules as overt responses.

In 1965, Lovaas published a series of articles that outlined his system for coding observed behaviors, described a pioneering investigation of the antecedents and consequences that maintained a problem behavior,<ref name=\"Lovaas\">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=T|author2=Eikseth|title=S|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=14 December 2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=375\u2013378|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1162-0|pmid=21153872}}</ref> and relied upon the methods of [[errorless learning]] that was initially devised by [[Charles Ferster]] to teach nonverbal children to speak. Lovaas also described how to use social (secondary) reinforcers, teach children to imitate, and what interventions (including electric shocks) may be used to reduce aggression and life-threatening self-injury.<ref name=\"Lovaas\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Lovaas published the study, \"Behavioral Treatment and Normal Educational and Intellectual Functioning in Young Autistic Children\".<ref name=lovaas/> The experimental group in this study received up to 40-hours per week in a 1:1 teaching setting using errorless [[discrete trial training]] (DTT). The treatment is done at home with parents involved in every aspect of treatment, and the curriculum is highly individualized with a heavy emphasis on teaching eye contact and language. ABA principles were used to motivate learning and reduce non-desired behaviors. The outcome of this study indicated 47% of the experimental group (9/19) went on to lose their autism diagnosis and were described as indistinguishable from their typical adolescent peers. This included passing regular education without assistance, making and maintaining friends, and becoming self-sufficient as adults. These gains were maintained as reported in the 1993 study, \"Long-Term Outcome for Children With Autism Who Received Early Intensive Behavioral Treatment\". Lovaas\u2019 work went on to be recognized by the US Surgeon General in 1999, and his research outcomes were replicated in university and private settings. The \"Lovaas Method\" went on to become known as early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), or DTT for 30 to 40 hours per week.\n\nOver the years, \"behavior analysis\" gradually superseded \"behavior modification\";  that is, from simply trying to alter problematic behavior, behavior analysts sought to understand the function of that behavior, what antecedents promote and maintain it, and how it can be replaced by successful behavior.<ref name=JEAB/> This analysis is based on careful initial assessment of a behavior's function and a testing of methods that produce changes in behavior.\n\nWhile ABA seems to be intrinsically linked to autism intervention, it is also used in a broad range of other situations.

For example, a non-applied researcher may study eating behavior because this research helps to clarify metabolic processes, whereas the applied researcher may study eating behavior in individuals who eat too little or too much, trying to change such behavior so that it is more acceptable to the persons involved.\n* '''Behavioral''':  ABA is pragmatic; it asks how it is possible to get an individual to do something effectively. To answer this question, the behavior itself must be objectively measured. Verbal descriptions are treated as behavior in themselves, and not as substitutes for the behavior described.\n* '''Analytic''':  Behavior analysis is successful when the analyst understands and can manipulate the events that control a target behavior. This may be relatively easy to do in the lab, where a researcher is able to arrange the relevant events, but it is not always easy, or ethical, in an applied situation.<ref name=BWR>{{cite journal |author1=Baer, D.M. |author2=Wolf, M.M. |author3=Risley, T.R. |year=1968 |title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 91\u201397 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91 |pmc=1310980 |pmid=16795165}}</ref> Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the intervention is removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The intervention is effective to the extent that the behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations.  The multiple baseline method may be used for behaviors that seem irreversible. Here, several behaviors are measured and then the intervention is applied to each in turn. The effectiveness of the intervention is revealed by changes in just the behavior to which the intervention is being applied. \n* '''Technological''':  The description of analytic research must be clear and detailed, so that any competent researcher can repeat it accurately.<ref name=BWR/>  Cooper et al. describe a good way to check this: Have a person trained in applied behavior analysis read the description and then act out the procedure in detail. If the person makes any mistakes or has to ask any questions then the description needs improvement.<ref name=CooperHeron2007/><ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=17}}</ref>\n* '''Conceptually Systematic''':  Behavior analysis should not simply produce a list of effective interventions.  Rather, to the extent possible, these methods should be grounded in behavioral principles. This is aided by the use of theoretically meaningful terms, such as \"secondary reinforcement\" or \"errorless discrimination\" where appropriate.\n* '''Effective''':  Though analytic methods should be theoretically grounded, they must be effective. If an intervention does not produce a large enough effect for practical use, then the analysis has failed\n* '''Generality''':  Behavior analysts should aim for interventions that are generally applicable; the methods should work in different environments, apply to more than one specific behavior, and have long-lasting effects.\n\n===Other proposed characteristics===\n\nIn 2005, Heward et al. suggested that the following five characteristics should be added:<ref name=Heward>{{cite book |editor=Heward, W.L. |year=2005 |title=Focus on behavior analysis in education: Achievements, challenges, and opportunities |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall/Merrill |isbn=978-0-13-111339-8|display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n* '''Accountable''': To be accountable means that ABA must be able to demonstrate that its methods are effective. This requires the repeatedly measuring the success of interventions, and, if necessary, making changes that improve their effectiveness.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Stokes, Trevor |author2=Budd, Karen S. |title=A small matter of proof: the legacy of Donald M. Baer |publisher=Context Press |location=Reno, NV |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-878978-43-1}}</ref>\n* '''Public''': The methods, results, and theoretical analyses of ABA must be published and open to scrutiny. There are no hidden treatments or mystical, metaphysical explanations.\n* '''Doable''': To be generally useful, interventions should be available to a variety of individuals, who might be teachers, parents, therapists, or even those who wish to modify their own behavior. With proper planning and training, many interventions can be applied by almost anyone willing to invest the effort.<ref name=Heward1>Heward, 205 p. 322</ref>\n* '''Empowering''': ABA provides tools that give the practitioner feedback on the results of interventions. These allow clinicians to assess their skill level and build confidence in their effectiveness.<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=19}}</ref>\n* '''Optimistic''': According to several leading authors, behavior analysts have cause to be optimistic that their efforts are socially worthwhile, for the following reasons:\n** The behaviors impacted by behavior analysis are largely determined by learning and controlled by manipulable aspects of the environment.\n** Practitioners can improve performance by direct and continuous measurements.\n** As a practitioner uses behavioral techniques with positive outcomes, they become more confident of future success.\n** The literature provides many examples of success in teaching individuals considered previously unteachable.\n\n==Concepts==\n\n===Behavior===\n{{Main|Behavior}}\n\nBehavior refers to the movement of some part of an organism that changes some aspect of the environment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=James M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993a |title=Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum Associates |page=23 |isbn=978-0-8058-0905-3}}</ref> Often, the term behavior refers to a class of responses that share physical dimensions or functions, and in that case a ''response'' is a single instance of that behavior.<ref name=CooperHeron2007/><ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=26}}</ref> If a group of responses have the same function, this group may be called a response class. \"Repertoire\" refers to the various responses available to an individual; the term may refer to responses that are relevant to a particular situation, or it may refer to everything a person can do.\n\n====Operant conditioning====\n{{Main|Operant conditioning}}\n\nOperant behavior is the so-called \"voluntary\" behavior that is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. Specifically, operant conditioning refers to the [[three-term contingency]] that uses [[stimulus control]], in particular an antecedent contingency called the discriminative stimulus (SD) that influences the strengthening or weakening of behavior through such consequences as [[reinforcement]] or [[punishment]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=33}}</ref> The term is used quite generally, from reaching for a candy bar, to turning up the heat to escape an aversive chill, to studying for an exam to get good grades.\n\n====Respondent (classical) conditioning====\n{{Main|Classical conditioning}}\n\nRespondent (classical) conditioning is based on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not ''produce'' a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food ''because'' it salivates).\n\n===Environment===\n\nThe environment is the entire constellation of stimuli in which an organism exists.<ref name=\"Michael, J. 2004\">Michael, J. (2004). ''Concepts and principles of behavior analysis'' (rev. ed.) Kalamazoo, MI: Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis.</ref> This includes events both inside and outside of an organism, but only real physical events are included.  A stimulus is an \"energy change that affects an organism through its receptor cells\".<ref name=\"Michael, J. 2004\"/>\n\n'''A stimulus can be described''':\n* '''Topographically''' by its physical features.\n* '''Temporally''' by when it occurs.\n* '''Functionally''' by its effect on behavior.\n\n===Reinforcement===\n[[File:ABA 2.png|thumb|A drawing showing examples of punishments and rewards. The use of punishments, especially those that [[aversives|inflict sensory or physical pain]], is an area of controversy.]]\n{{Main|Reinforcement}}\n\nReinforcement is the key element in operant conditioning<ref>{{cite book |author=Flora, S.R. |title=The power of reinforcement |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2004 }}</ref> and in most behavior change programs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-527 |author1=Northup, J. |author2=Vollmer, T.R. |author3=Serret, K. |year=1993 |title=Publication trends in 25 years of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |journal= Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=527\u201337 |pmid=16795803 |pmc=1297882}}</ref> It is the process by which behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement.<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=27}}</ref> There are multiple [[schedules of reinforcement]] that affect the future probability of behavior.\n\n===Punishment===\n{{Main|Punishment (psychology)}}\n\nPunishment is a process by which a consequence immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of that behavior. As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added ([[positive punishment]]) or removed ([[negative punishment]]). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of aversive stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out').<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=355}}</ref> Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects.<ref>{{cite book |author=Reese E.P. |title=The analysis of human operant behavior |publisher=Brown |location=Dubuque IA |year=1966 }}</ref> Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it.\n\n===Extinction===\n{{Main|Extinction (psychology)}}\n\nExtinction is the technical term to describe the procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of that behavior.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 102.</ref> The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 104.</ref> Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression\u2014the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability\u2014the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] procedures.\n\n===Discriminated operant and three-term contingency===\n\nIn addition to a relation being made between behavior and its consequences, operant conditioning also establishes relations between antecedent conditions and behaviors. This differs from the S\u2013R formulations (If-A-then-B), and replaces it with an AB-because-of-C formulation. In other words, the relation between a behavior (B) and its context (A) is because of consequences (C), more specifically, this relationship between AB because of C indicates that the relationship is established by prior consequences that have occurred in similar contexts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moxley, R.A. |year=2004 |title=Pragmatic selectionism.

A behavior which occurs more frequently in the presence of an antecedent condition than in its absence is called a discriminated operant. The antecedent stimulus is called a discriminative stimulus (S<sup>D</sup>). The fact that the discriminated operant occurs only in the presence of the discriminative stimulus is an illustration of [[stimulus control]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=41}}</ref> More recently behavior analysts have been focusing on conditions that occur prior to the circumstances for the current behavior of concern that increased the likelihood of the behavior occurring or not occurring. These conditions have been referred to variously as \"Setting Event\", \"Establishing Operations\", and \"Motivating Operations\" by various researchers in their publications.\n\n===Verbal behavior===\n{{Main|Verbal Behavior}}\n\n[[B.F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner's]] classification system of behavior analysis has been applied to treatment of a host of communication disorders.<ref>Peterson, P. (2007). Promoting generalization and maintenance of skills learned via natural language teaching. ''SPL-ABA'' 1(4)\u20132(1), 97\u2013138</ref> Skinner's system includes:\n* [[Tact (psychology)]] \u2013 a verbal response evoked by a non-verbal antecedent and maintained by generalized conditioned reinforcement.\n* [[Mand (psychology)]] \u2013 behavior under control of motivating operations maintained by a characteristic reinforcer.\n* Intraverbals \u2013 verbal behavior for which the relevant antecedent stimulus was other verbal behavior, but which does not share the response topography of that prior verbal stimulus (e.g., responding to another speaker's question).\n* [[Autoclitic]] \u2013 secondary verbal behavior which alters the effect of primary verbal behavior on the listener. Examples involve quantification, grammar, and qualifying statements (e.g., the differential effects of \"I think...\" vs. \"I know...\")\n\nFor assessment of verbal behavior from Skinner's system see [[Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills]].\n\n==Measuring behavior==\n\nWhen measuring behavior, there are both dimensions of behavior and quantifiable measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the quantifiable measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=J.M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993b |title=Readings for Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |edition=2nd |location=Hillsdale, HF |publisher=Erlbaum |isbn=978-0-8058-0906-0}}</ref>\n\n===Repeatability===\n\nResponse classes occur repeatedly throughout time\u2014i.e., how many times the behavior occurs.\n* '''Count''' is the number of occurrences in behavior.\n* '''Rate/frequency''' is the number of instances of behavior per unit of time.\n* '''Celeration''' is the measure of how the rate changes over time.\n\n===Temporal extent===\n\nThis dimension indicates that each instance of behavior occupies some amount of time\u2014i.e., how long the behavior occurs.\n* '''Duration''' is the period of time over which the behavior occurs.\n\n===Temporal locus===\n\nEach instance of behavior occurs at a specific point in time\u2014i.e., when the behavior occurs.\n* '''Response latency''' is the measure of elapsed time between the onset of a stimulus and the initiation of the response.\n* '''Interresponse time''' is the amount of time that occurs between two consecutive instances of a response class.\n\n===Derivative measures===\n\nDerivative measures are unrelated to specific dimensions:\n* '''Percentage''' is the ratio formed by combining the same dimensional quantities.\n* '''Trials-to-criterion''' are the number of response opportunities needed to achieve a predetermined level of performance.\n\n==Analyzing behavior change==\n\n===Experimental control===\n\nIn applied behavior analysis, all experiments should include the following:<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=422}}</ref>\n* At least one participant\n* At least one behavior (dependent variable)\n* At least one setting\n* A system for measuring the behavior and ongoing visual analysis of data\n* At least one treatment or intervention condition\n* Manipulations of the independent variable so that its effects on the dependent variable may be quantitatively or qualitatively analyzed\n* An intervention that will benefit the participant in some way<ref>[[Behavioral Cusp]]</ref>\n\n==Functional analysis (psychology)==\n{{main|Functional analysis (psychology)}}\n\n===History of functional analysis===\n\nPrior to the seminal article on functional analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology available to them at the time. Instead of treating the function of the disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead ''pre-assume'' consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, [[B.F. Skinner]]) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.\n\nIn 1977, Dr. Edward Carr, PhD, a professor of psychology at Dept. of Psychology at [[Stony Brook University]] and a New York State Certified psychologist, published a paper on potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors. In the paper, Dr. Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) [[negative reinforcement]] in the form of removal of an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.\n\nIn 1982, Dr. Brian A.Iwata, Ph.D.(an American psychologist and now Distinguished professor at the Psychology Department at the University of Florida) and colleagues including of Dr. Michael Dorsey, Ph.D. in Psychology, Dr. Keith J. Slifer, Ph.D. a child clinical psychologist with special interest in pediatric psychology, and Director, Pediatric Psychology Consultation Program, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, conducted the first experimental analysis of the maintaining variables for self-injurious behavior. In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions to examine whether or not the behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Functional behavior assessment (FBA)===\nFunctional assessment of behavior provides hypotheses about the relationships between specific environmental events and behaviors. Decades of research have established that both desirable and undesirable behaviors are learned and maintained through interactions with the social and physical environment. Functional behavior assessments are used to identify controlling variables for challenging behaviors as the basis for intervention efforts designed to decrease the occurrence of these behaviors.\n\n===Functions of behavior===\n\nBehavior serves two major functions for an individual: (1) to obtain desired events, or (2) to escape/avoid undesired events. Put another way, individuals engage in behavior to get something or to get out of something.  When trying to identify the function of a behavior, it is often helpful to think, \"What purpose is this behavior serving the individual?\" Described below are the common functions of behavior.\n\n==== Obtain socially mediated events ====\n\n''Access to attention (positive reinforcement: social)'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior to obtain attention from another person. For example, a child throws a toy because it characteristically results in a parent's attention. (If this behavior results in a parent looking at child and giving them lots of attention\u2014even if they're saying \"NO\"\u2014he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get a parent's attention.) Common forms of attention include, but are not limited to, hugs, kisses, reprimands, frowns, smiles, etc.\n\n''Access to tangibles (positive reinforcement: tangible/activity)'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior to obtain a specific item or engage in a specific activity from another person. For example, a child hits their parent because they want the toy they are holding. (If this behavior results in a parent giving the child the toy, they will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get a parent's attention.) Common forms of tangible items include, but are not limited to, food, toys, movies, video games, etc.\n\n''Automatic positive reinforcement'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior because the response-produced stimulation possesses reinforcing characteristics. In other words, engaging in the behavior produces reinforcing stimulation unique to the specific context. For example, a child hits their eyes because it produces the specific stimulation of various colors and effects. Another example includes a child spinning a bowl on a table to produce the specific auditory stimulation unique to that object. Common forms of automatic stimulation include, but are not limited to, auditory stimulation, visual stimulation, endorphin release, etc.\n\n==== Escape/avoid undesirable events (negative reinforcement) ====\n\n===== Escape/avoid socially mediated events =====\n\n''Escape/removal of attention'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive socially mediated attention. Put another way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring. For example, a child hits the teacher to avoid talking in front of the class. Common forms of aversive social situations include, but are not limited to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc.\n\n''Escape/removal of tasks or activities'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, when a child is told to take a bath, they begin to cry, so their mother tells them that they no longer have to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a set of worksheets, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principal's office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing the worksheets. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, etc.\n\n===== Escape/avoid specific stimulation =====\n\n''Automatic negative reinforcement'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging in the behavior decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs their head against the wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching their arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.\n\n=== Function versus topography ===\n\nAs previously stated function refers to the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from their parent. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies that are likely to be effective.\n\n=== Method of identifying functions of behavior ===\n\n'''FBA methods can be classified into three types''':\n* Indirect assessment\n* Descriptive assessment\n* Functional (experimental) analysis\n\n==== Indirect FBA ====\n\nThis method uses structured interviews, checklists, rating scales, or questionnaires to obtain information from persons who are familiar with the person exhibiting the behavior to identify possible conditions or events in the natural environment that correlate with the problem behavior. They are referred to as \"indirect\" because they do not involve direct observation of the behavior, but rather they solicit information based on others' recollections of the behavior. This form of assessment typically yields the least reliable information about the function of behavior, but can provide insight as to possible functions of the behavior to be tested in the future, the form of the behaviors (e.g. screaming, hitting, etc.), and environments in which the behavior typically occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.). This type of assessment should be performed as the initial step of any functional behavior assessment to gather relevant information to complete more direct assessments.\n\n==== Descriptive FBA ====\n\nUnlike the indirect methods of FBAs, descriptive functional behavior assessment employs direct observation of behavior. These observations occur in the environment in which the behavior naturally occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.) therefore there is no direct manipulation of the environment.\nThe most common form of descriptive assessment involves recording the antecedents and consequences that naturally occur when the individual emits the behavior. This is referred to as ABC data collection, in which (A) represents the common antecedent, (B) represents the behavior of interest, and (C) represents the immediate consequences that occur following the behavior. ABC data collection is used to identify the naturally occurring consequences delivered in the environment in which the behavior occurs. ABC data collection can be conducted by a wide array of individuals who have received appropriate training on how to record the data.\nAnother form of descriptive FBA is called a scatterplot. In this assessment, staff record the time and setting in which the behavior of interest occurs over a series of days. The data are plotted on a visual scale to indicate whether there are any patterns in the behavior (for example, if the behavior occurs more frequently during math instruction than it does during lunchtime). Although this assessment does not indicate the consequences maintaining the behavior, it can be used to identify some of the antecedent conditions that typically precede the behavior of interest.\n\n==== Functional (experimental) analysis ====\n\nA functional analysis is the most direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects on the behavior of interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a functional analysis, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) it can be said that there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://autism.outreach.psu.edu/sites/omcphplive.outreach.psu.edu.drpms.autismconference/files/42%20and%2055%20Presentation.pdf | title=Functional Analysis of Problem Behavior: the Basics | date=2010 | author=Brian A.

After that initial instruction, the experimenter pretends to act busy and ignores all bids for attention from the individual. If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the experimenter provides the individual with attention (commonly in the form of a reprimand). Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be attention maintained.\n\n===== Escape =====\n\nIn this condition, the experimenter instructs the individual that it is time to work. After the initial instruction, the experimenter delivers a series of demands that the individual is typically required to complete (e.g. math problems, cleaning up, etc.). If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the demand is removed and the child is allowed to take a break. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be escape maintained.\n\n===== Alone =====\nIn this condition, the child is left alone with a variety of items to engage with. If the child engages in the behavior of interest, no programmed consequences are delivered. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be automatically maintained.\n\n===== Control (play) =====\n\nIn this condition, the child is allowed to engage with a variety of items during the session. No demands are placed on the child throughout the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.\n\n===Conducting a functional behavior assessment===\n\nFunctional behavior assessments are rarely limited to only one of the methods described above. The most common, and most preferred, method for identifying the function of behavior can be seen as a four-part processes.\n# The gathering of information via indirect and descriptive assessment.\n# Interpretation of information from indirect and descriptive assessment and formulation of a hypothesis about the purpose of problem behavior.\n# Testing of a hypothesis using a functional analysis.\n# Developing intervention options based on the function of problem behavior.\n\n==Technologies developed through ABA research==\n\n===Task analysis===\n\n[[Task analysis]] is a process in which a task is analyzed into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: [[forward chaining]], [[Backward chaining (applied behavior analysis)|backward chaining]] and total task presentation.

For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or school and ''generalize'' the skill in these more natural environments with other materials.

If the student engages with a dog by hitting it, then they could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which they touch the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior.

Behavior analysis adopts the viewpoint of [[radical behaviorism]], treating thoughts, emotions, and other covert activity as behavior that is subject to the same rules as overt responses. This represents a shift away from methodological behaviorism, which restricts behavior-change procedures to behaviors that are overt, and was the conceptual underpinning of [[behavior modification]].\n\nBehavior analysts also emphasize that the science of behavior must be a ''natural'' science as opposed to a ''social'' science.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marr |first1=M |title=The natural selection: behavior analysis as a natural science |journal=European Journal of Behavior Analysis |date=2009 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=103\u2013118 |url=http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034739/http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |doi=10.1080/15021149.2009.11434313 }}</ref> As such, behavior analysts focus on the observable relationship of behavior with the environment, including [[antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedents]] and consequences, without resort to [[Subfields of psychology|\"hypothetical constructs\"]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thompson, T. |doi=10.1901/jeab.1984.41-211 |pmc=1348034 |year=1984 |title=The examining magistrate for nature: a retrospective review of Claude Bernard's An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=2 |issue=41 |pages=212\u201313}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Radical behaviorism|Experimental analysis of behavior|Behavior modification|Operant conditioning|B.F.

In 1965, Lovaas published a series of articles that outlined his system for coding observed behaviors, described a pioneering investigation of the antecedents and consequences that maintained a problem behavior,<ref name=\"Lovaas\">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=T|author2=Eikseth|title=S|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=14 December 2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=375\u2013378|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1162-0|pmid=21153872}}</ref> and relied upon the methods of [[errorless learning]] that was initially devised by [[Charles Ferster]] to teach nonverbal children to speak. Lovaas also described how to use social (secondary) reinforcers, teach children to imitate, and what interventions (including electric shocks) may be used to reduce aggression and life-threatening self-injury.<ref name=\"Lovaas\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Lovaas published the study, \"Behavioral Treatment and Normal Educational and Intellectual Functioning in Young Autistic Children\".<ref name=lovaas/> The experimental group in this study received up to 40-hours per week in a 1:1 teaching setting using errorless [[discrete trial training]] (DTT). The treatment is done at home with parents involved in every aspect of treatment, and the curriculum is highly individualized with a heavy emphasis on teaching eye contact and language. ABA principles were used to motivate learning and reduce non-desired behaviors. The outcome of this study indicated 47% of the experimental group (9/19) went on to lose their autism diagnosis and were described as indistinguishable from their typical adolescent peers. This included passing regular education without assistance, making and maintaining friends, and becoming self-sufficient as adults. These gains were maintained as reported in the 1993 study, \"Long-Term Outcome for Children With Autism Who Received Early Intensive Behavioral Treatment\". Lovaas\u2019 work went on to be recognized by the US Surgeon General in 1999, and his research outcomes were replicated in university and private settings. The \"Lovaas Method\" went on to become known as early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), or DTT for 30 to 40 hours per week.\n\nOver the years, \"behavior analysis\" gradually superseded \"behavior modification\";  that is, from simply trying to alter problematic behavior, behavior analysts sought to understand the function of that behavior, what antecedents promote and maintain it, and how it can be replaced by successful behavior.<ref name=JEAB/> This analysis is based on careful initial assessment of a behavior's function and a testing of methods that produce changes in behavior.\n\nWhile ABA seems to be intrinsically linked to autism intervention, it is also used in a broad range of other situations.

For example, a non-applied researcher may study eating behavior because this research helps to clarify metabolic processes, whereas the applied researcher may study eating behavior in individuals who eat too little or too much, trying to change such behavior so that it is more acceptable to the persons involved.\n* '''Behavioral''':  ABA is pragmatic; it asks how it is possible to get an individual to do something effectively. To answer this question, the behavior itself must be objectively measured. Verbal descriptions are treated as behavior in themselves, and not as substitutes for the behavior described.\n* '''Analytic''':  Behavior analysis is successful when the analyst understands and can manipulate the events that control a target behavior. This may be relatively easy to do in the lab, where a researcher is able to arrange the relevant events, but it is not always easy, or ethical, in an applied situation.<ref name=BWR>{{cite journal |author1=Baer, D.M. |author2=Wolf, M.M. |author3=Risley, T.R. |year=1968 |title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 91\u201397 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91 |pmc=1310980 |pmid=16795165}}</ref> Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the intervention is removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The intervention is effective to the extent that the behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations.  The multiple baseline method may be used for behaviors that seem irreversible. Here, several behaviors are measured and then the intervention is applied to each in turn. The effectiveness of the intervention is revealed by changes in just the behavior to which the intervention is being applied. \n* '''Technological''':  The description of analytic research must be clear and detailed, so that any competent researcher can repeat it accurately.<ref name=BWR/>  Cooper et al. describe a good way to check this: Have a person trained in applied behavior analysis read the description and then act out the procedure in detail. If the person makes any mistakes or has to ask any questions then the description needs improvement.<ref name=CooperHeron2007/><ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=17}}</ref>\n* '''Conceptually Systematic''':  Behavior analysis should not simply produce a list of effective interventions.  Rather, to the extent possible, these methods should be grounded in behavioral principles. This is aided by the use of theoretically meaningful terms, such as \"secondary reinforcement\" or \"errorless discrimination\" where appropriate.\n* '''Effective''':  Though analytic methods should be theoretically grounded, they must be effective. If an intervention does not produce a large enough effect for practical use, then the analysis has failed\n* '''Generality''':  Behavior analysts should aim for interventions that are generally applicable; the methods should work in different environments, apply to more than one specific behavior, and have long-lasting effects.\n\n===Other proposed characteristics===\n\nIn 2005, Heward et al. suggested that the following five characteristics should be added:<ref name=Heward>{{cite book |editor=Heward, W.L. |year=2005 |title=Focus on behavior analysis in education: Achievements, challenges, and opportunities |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall/Merrill |isbn=978-0-13-111339-8|display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n* '''Accountable''': To be accountable means that ABA must be able to demonstrate that its methods are effective. This requires the repeatedly measuring the success of interventions, and, if necessary, making changes that improve their effectiveness.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Stokes, Trevor |author2=Budd, Karen S. |title=A small matter of proof: the legacy of Donald M. Baer |publisher=Context Press |location=Reno, NV |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-878978-43-1}}</ref>\n* '''Public''': The methods, results, and theoretical analyses of ABA must be published and open to scrutiny. There are no hidden treatments or mystical, metaphysical explanations.\n* '''Doable''': To be generally useful, interventions should be available to a variety of individuals, who might be teachers, parents, therapists, or even those who wish to modify their own behavior. With proper planning and training, many interventions can be applied by almost anyone willing to invest the effort.<ref name=Heward1>Heward, 205 p. 322</ref>\n* '''Empowering''': ABA provides tools that give the practitioner feedback on the results of interventions. These allow clinicians to assess their skill level and build confidence in their effectiveness.<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=19}}</ref>\n* '''Optimistic''': According to several leading authors, behavior analysts have cause to be optimistic that their efforts are socially worthwhile, for the following reasons:\n** The behaviors impacted by behavior analysis are largely determined by learning and controlled by manipulable aspects of the environment.\n** Practitioners can improve performance by direct and continuous measurements.\n** As a practitioner uses behavioral techniques with positive outcomes, they become more confident of future success.\n** The literature provides many examples of success in teaching individuals considered previously unteachable.\n\n==Concepts==\n\n===Behavior===\n{{Main|Behavior}}\n\nBehavior refers to the movement of some part of an organism that changes some aspect of the environment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=James M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993a |title=Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum Associates |page=23 |isbn=978-0-8058-0905-3}}</ref> Often, the term behavior refers to a class of responses that share physical dimensions or functions, and in that case a ''response'' is a single instance of that behavior.<ref name=CooperHeron2007/><ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=26}}</ref> If a group of responses have the same function, this group may be called a response class. \"Repertoire\" refers to the various responses available to an individual; the term may refer to responses that are relevant to a particular situation, or it may refer to everything a person can do.\n\n====Operant conditioning====\n{{Main|Operant conditioning}}\n\nOperant behavior is the so-called \"voluntary\" behavior that is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. Specifically, operant conditioning refers to the [[three-term contingency]] that uses [[stimulus control]], in particular an antecedent contingency called the discriminative stimulus (SD) that influences the strengthening or weakening of behavior through such consequences as [[reinforcement]] or [[punishment]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=33}}</ref> The term is used quite generally, from reaching for a candy bar, to turning up the heat to escape an aversive chill, to studying for an exam to get good grades.\n\n====Respondent (classical) conditioning====\n{{Main|Classical conditioning}}\n\nRespondent (classical) conditioning is based on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not ''produce'' a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food ''because'' it salivates).\n\n===Environment===\n\nThe environment is the entire constellation of stimuli in which an organism exists.<ref name=\"Michael, J. 2004\">Michael, J. (2004). ''Concepts and principles of behavior analysis'' (rev. ed.) Kalamazoo, MI: Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis.</ref> This includes events both inside and outside of an organism, but only real physical events are included.  A stimulus is an \"energy change that affects an organism through its receptor cells\".<ref name=\"Michael, J. 2004\"/>\n\n'''A stimulus can be described''':\n* '''Topographically''' by its physical features.\n* '''Temporally''' by when it occurs.\n* '''Functionally''' by its effect on behavior.\n\n===Reinforcement===\n[[File:ABA 2.png|thumb|A drawing showing examples of punishments and rewards. The use of punishments, especially those that [[aversives|inflict sensory or physical pain]], is an area of controversy.]]\n{{Main|Reinforcement}}\n\nReinforcement is the key element in operant conditioning<ref>{{cite book |author=Flora, S.R. |title=The power of reinforcement |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2004 }}</ref> and in most behavior change programs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-527 |author1=Northup, J. |author2=Vollmer, T.R. |author3=Serret, K. |year=1993 |title=Publication trends in 25 years of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |journal= Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=527\u201337 |pmid=16795803 |pmc=1297882}}</ref> It is the process by which behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement.<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=27}}</ref> There are multiple [[schedules of reinforcement]] that affect the future probability of behavior.\n\n===Punishment===\n{{Main|Punishment (psychology)}}\n\nPunishment is a process by which a consequence immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of that behavior. As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added ([[positive punishment]]) or removed ([[negative punishment]]). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of aversive stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out').<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=355}}</ref> Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects.<ref>{{cite book |author=Reese E.P. |title=The analysis of human operant behavior |publisher=Brown |location=Dubuque IA |year=1966 }}</ref> Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it.\n\n===Extinction===\n{{Main|Extinction (psychology)}}\n\nExtinction is the technical term to describe the procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of that behavior.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 102.</ref> The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 104.</ref> Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression\u2014the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability\u2014the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] procedures.\n\n===Discriminated operant and three-term contingency===\n\nIn addition to a relation being made between behavior and its consequences, operant conditioning also establishes relations between antecedent conditions and behaviors. This differs from the S\u2013R formulations (If-A-then-B), and replaces it with an AB-because-of-C formulation. In other words, the relation between a behavior (B) and its context (A) is because of consequences (C), more specifically, this relationship between AB because of C indicates that the relationship is established by prior consequences that have occurred in similar contexts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moxley, R.A. |year=2004 |title=Pragmatic selectionism.

A behavior which occurs more frequently in the presence of an antecedent condition than in its absence is called a discriminated operant. The antecedent stimulus is called a discriminative stimulus (S<sup>D</sup>). The fact that the discriminated operant occurs only in the presence of the discriminative stimulus is an illustration of [[stimulus control]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=41}}</ref> More recently behavior analysts have been focusing on conditions that occur prior to the circumstances for the current behavior of concern that increased the likelihood of the behavior occurring or not occurring. These conditions have been referred to variously as \"Setting Event\", \"Establishing Operations\", and \"Motivating Operations\" by various researchers in their publications.\n\n===Verbal behavior===\n{{Main|Verbal Behavior}}\n\n[[B.F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner's]] classification system of behavior analysis has been applied to treatment of a host of communication disorders.<ref>Peterson, P. (2007). Promoting generalization and maintenance of skills learned via natural language teaching. ''SPL-ABA'' 1(4)\u20132(1), 97\u2013138</ref> Skinner's system includes:\n* [[Tact (psychology)]] \u2013 a verbal response evoked by a non-verbal antecedent and maintained by generalized conditioned reinforcement.\n* [[Mand (psychology)]] \u2013 behavior under control of motivating operations maintained by a characteristic reinforcer.\n* Intraverbals \u2013 verbal behavior for which the relevant antecedent stimulus was other verbal behavior, but which does not share the response topography of that prior verbal stimulus (e.g., responding to another speaker's question).\n* [[Autoclitic]] \u2013 secondary verbal behavior which alters the effect of primary verbal behavior on the listener. Examples involve quantification, grammar, and qualifying statements (e.g., the differential effects of \"I think...\" vs. \"I know...\")\n\nFor assessment of verbal behavior from Skinner's system see [[Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills]].\n\n==Measuring behavior==\n\nWhen measuring behavior, there are both dimensions of behavior and quantifiable measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the quantifiable measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=J.M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993b |title=Readings for Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |edition=2nd |location=Hillsdale, HF |publisher=Erlbaum |isbn=978-0-8058-0906-0}}</ref>\n\n===Repeatability===\n\nResponse classes occur repeatedly throughout time\u2014i.e., how many times the behavior occurs.\n* '''Count''' is the number of occurrences in behavior.\n* '''Rate/frequency''' is the number of instances of behavior per unit of time.\n* '''Celeration''' is the measure of how the rate changes over time.\n\n===Temporal extent===\n\nThis dimension indicates that each instance of behavior occupies some amount of time\u2014i.e., how long the behavior occurs.\n* '''Duration''' is the period of time over which the behavior occurs.\n\n===Temporal locus===\n\nEach instance of behavior occurs at a specific point in time\u2014i.e., when the behavior occurs.\n* '''Response latency''' is the measure of elapsed time between the onset of a stimulus and the initiation of the response.\n* '''Interresponse time''' is the amount of time that occurs between two consecutive instances of a response class.\n\n===Derivative measures===\n\nDerivative measures are unrelated to specific dimensions:\n* '''Percentage''' is the ratio formed by combining the same dimensional quantities.\n* '''Trials-to-criterion''' are the number of response opportunities needed to achieve a predetermined level of pe\u0632\u0624\u0646\u064a\u064a\n\nrformance.\n\n==Analyzing behavior change==\n\n===Experimental control===\n\nIn applied behavior analysis, all experiments should include the following:<ref>{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=422}}</ref>\n* At least one participant\n* At least one behavior (dependent variable)\n* At least one setting\n* A system for measuring the behavior and ongoing visual analysis of data\n* At least one treatment or intervention condition\n* Manipulations of the independent variable so that its effects on the dependent variable may be quantitatively or qualitatively analyzed\n* An intervention that will benefit the participant in some way<ref>[[Behavioral Cusp]]</ref>\n\n==Functional analysis (psychology)==\n{{main|Functional analysis (psychology)}}\n\n===History of functional analysis===\n\nPrior to the seminal article on functional analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology available to them at the time. Instead of treating the function of the disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead ''pre-assume'' consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, [[B.F. Skinner]]) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.\n\nIn 1977, Dr. Edward Carr, PhD, a professor of psychology at Dept. of Psychology at [[Stony Brook University]] and a New York State Certified psychologist, published a paper on potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors. In the paper, Dr. Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) [[negative reinforcement]] in the form of removal of an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.\n\nIn 1982, Dr. Brian A.Iwata, Ph.D.(an American psychologist and now Distinguished professor at the Psychology Department at the University of Florida) and colleagues including of Dr. Michael Dorsey, Ph.D. in Psychology, Dr. Keith J. Slifer, Ph.D. a child clinical psychologist with special interest in pediatric psychology, and Director, Pediatric Psychology Consultation Program, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, conducted the first experimental analysis of the maintaining variables for self-injurious behavior. In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions to examine whether or not the behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Functional behavior assessment (FBA)===\nFunctional assessment of behavior provides hypotheses about the relationships between specific environmental events and behaviors. Decades of research have established that both desirable and undesirable behaviors are learned and maintained through interactions with the social and physical environment. Functional behavior assessments are used to identify controlling variables for challenging behaviors as the basis for intervention efforts designed to decrease the occurrence of these behaviors.\n\n===Functions of behavior===\n\nBehavior serves two major functions for an individual: (1) to obtain desired events, or (2) to escape/avoid undesired events. Put another way, individuals engage in behavior to get something or to get out of something.  When trying to identify the function of a behavior, it is often helpful to think, \"What purpose is this behavior serving the individual?\" Described below are the common functions of behavior.\n\n==== Obtain socially mediated events ====\n\n''Access to attention (positive reinforcement: social)'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior to obtain attention from another person. For example, a child throws a toy because it characteristically results in a parent's attention. (If this behavior results in a parent looking at child and giving them lots of attention\u2014even if they're saying \"NO\"\u2014he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get a parent's attention.) Common forms of attention include, but are not limited to, hugs, kisses, reprimands, frowns, smiles, etc.\n\n''Access to tangibles (positive reinforcement: tangible/activity)'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior to obtain a specific item or engage in a specific activity from another person. For example, a child hits their parent because they want the toy they are holding. (If this behavior results in a parent giving the child the toy, they will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get a parent's attention.) Common forms of tangible items include, but are not limited to, food, toys, movies, video games, etc.\n\n''Automatic positive reinforcement'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior because the response-produced stimulation possesses reinforcing characteristics. In other words, engaging in the behavior produces reinforcing stimulation unique to the specific context. For example, a child hits their eyes because it produces the specific stimulation of various colors and effects. Another example includes a child spinning a bowl on a table to produce the specific auditory stimulation unique to that object. Common forms of automatic stimulation include, but are not limited to, auditory stimulation, visual stimulation, endorphin release, etc.\n\n==== Escape/avoid undesirable events (negative reinforcement) ====\n\n===== Escape/avoid socially mediated events =====\n\n''Escape/removal of attention'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive socially mediated attention. Put another way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring. For example, a child hits the teacher to avoid talking in front of the class. Common forms of aversive social situations include, but are not limited to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc.\n\n''Escape/removal of tasks or activities'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, when a child is told to take a bath, they begin to cry, so their mother tells them that they no longer have to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a set of worksheets, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principal's office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing the worksheets. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, etc.\n\n===== Escape/avoid specific stimulation =====\n\n''Automatic negative reinforcement'':\nThe individual engages in the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging in the behavior decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs their head against the wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching their arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.\n\n=== Function versus topography ===\n\nAs previously stated function refers to the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from their parent. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies that are likely to be effective.\n\n=== Method of identifying functions of behavior ===\n\n'''FBA methods can be classified into three types''':\n* Indirect assessment\n* Descriptive assessment\n* Functional (experimental) analysis\n\n==== Indirect FBA ====\n\nThis method uses structured interviews, checklists, rating scales, or questionnaires to obtain information from persons who are familiar with the person exhibiting the behavior to identify possible conditions or events in the natural environment that correlate with the problem behavior. They are referred to as \"indirect\" because they do not involve direct observation of the behavior, but rather they solicit information based on others' recollections of the behavior. This form of assessment typically yields the least reliable information about the function of behavior, but can provide insight as to possible functions of the behavior to be tested in the future, the form of the behaviors (e.g. screaming, hitting, etc.), and environments in which the behavior typically occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.). This type of assessment should be performed as the initial step of any functional behavior assessment to gather relevant information to complete more direct assessments.\n\n==== Descriptive FBA ====\n\nUnlike the indirect methods of FBAs, descriptive functional behavior assessment employs direct observation of behavior. These observations occur in the environment in which the behavior naturally occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.) therefore there is no direct manipulation of the environment.\nThe most common form of descriptive assessment involves recording the antecedents and consequences that naturally occur when the individual emits the behavior. This is referred to as ABC data collection, in which (A) represents the common antecedent, (B) represents the behavior of interest, and (C) represents the immediate consequences that occur following the behavior. ABC data collection is used to identify the naturally occurring consequences delivered in the environment in which the behavior occurs. ABC data collection can be conducted by a wide array of individuals who have received appropriate training on how to record the data.\nAnother form of descriptive FBA is called a scatterplot. In this assessment, staff record the time and setting in which the behavior of interest occurs over a series of days. The data are plotted on a visual scale to indicate whether there are any patterns in the behavior (for example, if the behavior occurs more frequently during math instruction than it does during lunchtime). Although this assessment does not indicate the consequences maintaining the behavior, it can be used to identify some of the antecedent conditions that typically precede the behavior of interest.\n\n==== Functional (experimental) analysis ====\n\nA functional analysis is the most direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects on the behavior of interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a functional analysis, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) it can be said that there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://autism.outreach.psu.edu/sites/omcphplive.outreach.psu.edu.drpms.autismconference/files/42%20and%2055%20Presentation.pdf | title=Functional Analysis of Problem Behavior: the Basics | date=2010 | author=Brian A.

After that initial instruction, the experimenter pretends to act busy and ignores all bids for attention from the individual. If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the experimenter provides the individual with attention (commonly in the form of a reprimand). Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be attention maintained.\n\n===== Escape =====\n\nIn this condition, the experimenter instructs the individual that it is time to work. After the initial instruction, the experimenter delivers a series of demands that the individual is typically required to complete (e.g. math problems, cleaning up, etc.). If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the demand is removed and the child is allowed to take a break. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be escape maintained.\n\n===== Alone =====\nIn this condition, the child is left alone with a variety of items to engage with. If the child engages in the behavior of interest, no programmed consequences are delivered. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be automatically maintained.\n\n===== Control (play) =====\n\nIn this condition, the child is allowed to engage with a variety of items during the session. No demands are placed on the child throughout the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions.

For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or school and ''generalize'' the skill in these more natural environments with other materials.

If the student engages with a dog by hitting it, then they could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which they touch the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of [[operant conditioning]] principles and [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]].

The plot is loosely based on a short story about [[Nie Xiaoqian]] from [[Qing dynasty]] writer [[Pu Songling]]'s ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' and is also inspired by the 1960 [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] film ''[[The Enchanting Shadow]]''. The film was popular in Hong Kong and several Asian countries, including [[South Korea]] and Japan. Although the film could not gain access to movie theaters in mainland China when it was first released, it became a [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|classic]] among young people in the mainland, especially the generation born in the 1980s. Most notably it boosted the stardom of Joey Wong, won Leslie Cheung popularity in Japan, and sparked a trend of folklore ghost films in the [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong film industry]], including two sequels, an animated film, a television series and a 2011 remake. The film was ranked number 50 of the [[Hong Kong Film Award#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures]] presented at the [[24th Hong Kong Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nNing Choi-san, a timid debt collector, goes to a rural town to collect debts but fails and runs out of money. He has no choice but to take shelter in a deserted temple in the forest on the outskirts of the town. That night, he meets a beautiful and alluring young maiden, [[Nie Xiaoqian|Nip Siu-sin]], and falls in love with her. In the morning, however, after he recalls that night's events, he becomes increasingly fearful and superstitious because Yin Chik-ha, a Taoist priest, told him that the people he saw in the temple are ghosts. That night, he returns to the temple and confirms his theory that Nip is actually a ghost.\n\nNip tells Ning her story of how she became eternally bound to the servitude of a sinister Tree Demoness. She explains that as long as her remains are buried at the foot of the tree, her spirit will be forever enslaved by the Tree Demoness. Ning attempts to free her from her suffering so he seeks help from Yin Chik-ha. Yin fights with the Tree Demoness and attempts to free Nip's soul but fails. As punishment for betraying her master, Nip's soul is banished to the [[Diyu|Underworld]].\n\nNing is unwilling to give up on Nip and he insists that Yin help him. Yin reluctantly opens a temporary portal into the Underworld and brings Ning along to search for Nip. As the Underworld is full of spirits, they have a hard time finding her. Ning and Nip are eventually able to see each other briefly near dawn when they manage to leave the Underworld. When sunlight shines on the urn containing Nip's cremated remains, Ning uses a curtain to shield the urn to prevent Nip's soul from being destroyed by exposure to sunlight. Before leaving for good, she tells him that the only way to save her soul is to rebury her remains at a more auspicious burial site. Ning follows her instructions and, acting on Yin's advice, he buries her remains near the crest of a hill. He burns a [[joss stick]] for her and prays for her soul while Yin watches solemnly behind him.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Leslie Cheung]] as Ning Choi-san\n*[[Joey Wong]] as [[Nip Siu-sin]]\n*[[Wu Ma]] as Yin

film or a non-horror based ghost story.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Hark noted that his higher up approached him to develop the film into being about a female cop, not being aware that it was based on a book or that it was a period film.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} While working on the film, Hark and Siu-Tung did not really know what it was end up being like, as Siu-Tung was still apprehensive on creating a romance film and desired to add horror film elements.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Rumours persist around the production suggesting that it Tsui Hark effectively directed the film.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=111}} British critic [[Tony Rayns]] stated that effectively, most Film Workshop productions were \"redirected or hijacked by Tsui Hark\"{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=111}} [[Joey Wong]] was a professional basketball player and model before starting her film career.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} Prior to working on the film, she appeared in films such as the Taiwanese production

several Hong Kong horror film productions such as ''[[Spooky Encounters]]'', ''The Dead and the Deadly'' and ''[[Mr. Vampire]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} The film used the services of Cinefex Workshop, Hong Kong's first proper special effects studio who had previously worked on Hark's film ''[[Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} The film script which called for the giant slithering tongue and zombies were developed by Cinefex technician Man Xian Liang who taught himself stop motion animation to make the effects happen.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} [[James Wong (lyricist)|James Wong]] contributed to the score of the film.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Wong was primarily known for writing songs for pop stars and television programs and completed his first

The plot is loosely based on a short story about [[Nie Xiaoqian]] from [[Qing dynasty]] writer [[Pu Songling]]'s ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' and is also inspired by the 1960 [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] film ''[[The Enchanting Shadow]]''. The film was popular in Hong Kong and several Asian countries, including [[South Korea]] and Japan. Although the film could not gain access to movie theaters in mainland China when it was first released, it became a [[cult classic]] among young people in the mainland, especially the generation born in the 1980s. Most notably it boosted the stardom of Joey Wong, won Leslie Cheung popularity in Japan, and sparked a trend of folklore ghost films in the [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong film industry]], including two sequels, an animated film, a television series and a 2011 remake. The film was ranked number 50 of the [[Hong Kong Film Award#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures]] presented at the [[24th Hong Kong Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nNing Choi-san, a timid debt collector, goes to a rural town to collect debts but fails and runs out of money. He has no choice but to take shelter in a deserted temple in the forest on the outskirts of the town. That night, he meets a beautiful and alluring young maiden, [[Nie Xiaoqian|Nip Siu-sin]], and falls in love with her. In the morning, however, after he recalls that night's events, he becomes increasingly fearful and superstitious because Yin Chik-ha, a Taoist priest, told him that the people he saw in the temple are ghosts. That night, he returns to the temple and confirms his theory that Nip is actually a ghost.\n\nNip tells Ning her story of how she became eternally bound to the servitude of a sinister Tree Demoness. She explains that as long as her remains are buried at the foot of the tree, her spirit will be forever enslaved by the Tree Demoness. Ning attempts to free her from her suffering so he seeks help from Yin Chik-ha. Yin fights with the Tree Demoness and attempts to free Nip's soul but fails. As punishment for betraying her master, Nip's soul is banished to the [[Diyu|Underworld]].\n\nNing is unwilling to give up on Nip and he insists that Yin help him. Yin reluctantly opens a temporary portal into the Underworld and brings Ning along to search for Nip. As the Underworld is full of spirits, they have a hard time finding her. Ning and Nip are eventually able to see each other briefly near dawn when they manage to leave the Underworld. When sunlight shines on the urn containing Nip's cremated remains, Ning uses a curtain to shield the urn to prevent Nip's soul from being destroyed by exposure to sunlight. Before leaving for good, she tells him that the only way to save her soul is to rebury her remains at a more auspicious burial site. Ning follows her instructions and, acting on Yin's advice, he buries her remains near the crest of a hill. He burns a [[joss stick]] for her and prays for her soul while Yin watches solemnly behind him.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Leslie Cheung]] as Ning Choi-san\n*[[Joey Wong]] as [[Nip Siu-sin]]\n*[[Wu Ma]] as Yin

[[TVB]].{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=74}} The producer turned it down, feeling it would not be suitable for television.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=74}} ''A Chinese Ghost Story'' uses elements of several stories from [[Pu Songling]]'s 17th century collection ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]''.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=72}} Tsui Hark stated that they changed a lot of the stories for their adaptation as they found out the stories were against their initial interpretation.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} On developing the film, Tsui Hark noted that director [[Ching Siu-Tung]] wanted to work with him.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Ching Siu-Tung had previously worked as a director and an action choreographer on various [[Film Workshop]] productions such as ''[[Peking Opera Blues]]'' and ''[[A Better Tomorrow II]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=111}} Hark suggested developing ''A Chinese Ghost Story'', describing it as a love story which Siu-Tung was not as interested in developing as either a romance film or a non-horror based ghost story.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Hark noted that his higher up approached him to develop the film into being about a female cop, not being aware that it was based on a book or that it was a period film.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} While working on the film, Hark and Siu-Tung did not really know what it was end up being like, as Siu-Tung was still apprehensive on creating a romance film and desired to add horror film elements.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Rumours persist around the production suggesting that it Tsui Hark effectively directed the film.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=111}} British critic [[Tony Rayns]] stated that effectively, most Film Workshop productions were \"redirected or hijacked by Tsui Hark\"{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=111}} [[Joey Wong]] was a professional basketball player and model before starting her film career.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} Prior to working on the film, she appeared in films such as the Taiwanese production ''It'll Be Very Cold at the Lakeside This Year''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} She would show up in a few [[Shaw Brothers]] produced Hong Kong films and Tsui Hark's film ''Working Class''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}}\n\nActors in the film include [[Leslie Cheung]] who was also a cantopop singer.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} Cheung had previously worked with Tsui Hark productions such as ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[A Better Tomorrow II]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}}  Cheung also sung the films theme song.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} [[Wu Ma]] had previously appeared in several Hong Kong horror film productions such as ''[[Spooky Encounters]]'', ''The Dead and the Deadly'' and ''[[Mr. Vampire]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} The film used the services of Cinefex Workshop, Hong Kong's first proper special effects studio who had previously worked on Hark's film ''[[Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} The film script which called for the giant slithering tongue and zombies were developed by Cinefex technician Man Xian Liang who taught himself stop motion animation to make the effects happen.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} [[James Wong (lyricist)|James Wong]] contributed to the score of the film.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Wong was primarily known for writing songs for pop stars and television programs and completed his first score for Hark's ''[[Shanghai Blues]]''.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}}\n\n==Release==\n''A Chinese Ghost Story'' opened on July 18, 1987.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=70}} The film received theatrical release throughout Asia and Europe.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=71}} ''A Chinese Ghost Story'' performed well in the Hong Kong box office earning [[Hong Kong Dollar|HK$]]18,831,638 making it the fifteenth highest-grossing film in Hong Kong for 1987.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=74}} The film also received international recognition when it won the special Jury Prize at the Avoriaz festival in France and the Best

The archipelago is notable as well in connection with the ongoing multiyear [[Arctic sea ice decline]]. Until recently, ice joined the islands to [[Eurasia]], even at its smallest extent during the late summer melt season, blocking the [[Northeast Passage]] between the Atlantic and the Pacific. By the late summer of 2012, however, the permanent ice had reached a record low extent and open water appeared to the south of the archipelago.<ref>\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/arctic-seaice-2012.html Retrieved on 27 August 2012.</ref>\n\n==History==\nAlthough located not far off the northern coast of Russia, nested among Arctic ice-locked waters, the archipelago that is now known as Severnaya Zemlya was not formally recorded until the 20th century. Earlier explorers deemed that there was a land mass in the general area of the archipelago, such as in the report by [[Matvei Gedenschtrom]] and [[Yakov Sannikov]] made in 1810 at the time of their exploration of the [[New Siberian Islands]].\n\nLater in the 19th century [[Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld]] during the [[Vega Expedition]] sailed very close to this land in 1878 but did not notice it. \nIn 1882, Danish [[Arctic explorer]] and naval officer [[Andreas Peter Hovgaard]], leader of the Arctic survey [[Dijmphna Expedition]], set himself the goal of discovering land north of [[Cape Chelyuskin]] and explore the unknown northeastern limits of the [[Kara Sea]].<ref name=\"DAE\">[https://archive.org/stream/danisharcticexp00hovggoog#page/n30/mode/2up/search/Tscheljuskin S.25&nbsp;f.

A staunch royalist, he retreated to the mountains near [[Belgrade]] when the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] overran [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in April 1941 and there he organized bands of guerrillas known as the [[Chetniks|Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army]].\n\nThe organisation is commonly known as the Chetniks, although the name of the organisation was later changed to the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland (JVUO, \u0408\u0412\u0423\u041e).{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=125}} Founded as the first Yugoslav [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement]], it was royalist and nationalist, as opposed to the other, [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] who were communist. Initially, the two groups operated in parallel, but by late 1941 began fighting each other in the attempt to gain control of post-war Yugoslavia. Many Chetnik groups [[Collaborationism|collaborated]] or established ''[[modus vivendi]]'' with the [[Axis powers]]. Mihailovi\u0107 himself collaborated with [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]] at the end of the war.  After the war, Mihailovi\u0107 was captured by the communists. He was [[Trial of Mihailovi\u0107 et al.|tried and convicted]] of [[high treason]] and [[war crimes]] by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|communist authorities]] of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]], and executed by [[firing squad]] in Belgrade. The nature and extent of his responsibility for collaboration and ethnic massacres remains controversial. On 14 May 2015, Mihailovi\u0107's verdict was overturned on appeal with the ruling showing that his trial amounted to a communist kangaroo court. The [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Serbia)|Supreme Court of Cassation]], and [[appellate court]] handed out the rulings. While some see this as a rehabilitation the courts did not go as far and only ruled on the previous trial without offering to retry the case. This was done to satisfy his offspring's legal rights to property which the ruling at his trial stripped from them. \n\n==Early life and military career==\n\nDragoljub \"Dra\u017ea\" Mihailovi\u0107 was born on 27 April 1893 in [[Ivanjica]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]] to Mihailo and Smiljana Mihailovi\u0107 (''n\u00e9e'' Petrovi\u0107).{{sfn|Mihailovi\u0107|1946|p=13}} His father was a [[court clerk]]. Orphaned at seven years of age, Mihailovi\u0107 was raised by his paternal uncle in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=13}} As both of his uncles were military officers, Mihailovi\u0107 himself joined the Serbian [[Military Academy (Serbia)|Military Academy]] in October 1910. He fought as a cadet in the [[Serbian Army]] during the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u201313 and was awarded the [[Silver Medal of Valor]] at the end of the [[First Balkan War]], in May 1913.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=26\u201327}} At the end of the [[Second Balkan War]], during which he mainly led operations along the [[Provisional Government of Albania|Albanian]] border, he was given the rank of second [[lieutenant]] as the top soldier in his class, ranked sixth at the Serbian military academy.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=26\u201327}} He served in [[World War I]] and was involved in the [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania|Serbian Army's retreat]] through [[Principality of Albania|Albania]] in 1915. He later received several decorations for his achievements on the [[Salonika Front]]. Following the war, he became a member of the Royal Guard of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] but had to leave his position in 1920 after taking part in a public argument between communist and nationalist sympathizers. He was subsequently stationed to [[Skopje]]. In 1921, he was admitted to the Superior Military Academy of Belgrade. In 1923, having finished his studies, he was promoted as an assistant to the [[Staff (military)|military staff]], along with the fifteen other best alumni of his promotion.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=45\u201349}} He was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] in 1930. That same year, he spent three months in [[Paris]], following classes at the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]]. Some authors claim that he met and befriended [[Charles de Gaulle]] during his stay, although there is no known evidence of this.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=55\u201356}} In 1935, he became a military [[attach\u00e9]] to the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and was stationed to [[Sofia]]. On 6 September 1935, he was promoted to the rank of [[colonel]]. Mihailovi\u0107 then came in contact with members of [[Zveno]] and considered taking part in a plot which aimed to provoke [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]]'s abdication and the creation of an alliance between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, but, being untrained as a spy, he was soon identified by Bulgarian authorities and was asked to leave the country. He was then appointed as an attach\u00e9 to [[Czechoslovakia]] in [[Prague]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nHis military career almost came to an abrupt end in 1939, when he submitted a report strongly criticizing the organization of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] ({{lang-sh|Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VKJ). Among his most important proposals were abandoning the defence of the northern frontier to concentrate forces in the mountainous interior; re-organizing the armed forces into [[Serb]], [[Croat]], and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] units in order to better counter subversive activities; and using mobile Chetnik units along the borders. [[Milan Nedi\u0107]], the Minister of the Army, was incensed by Mihailovi\u0107's report and ordered that he be confined to barracks for 30&nbsp;days.{{sfn|Trew|1998|pp=5\u20136}} Afterwards, Mihailovi\u0107 became a professor at Belgrade's [[staff college]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=66\u201368}} In the summer of 1940, he attended a function put on by the British military attach\u00e9 for the Association of Yugoslav Reserve NCOs. The meeting was seen as highly anti-Nazi in tone, and the German ambassador protested Mihailovi\u0107's presence. Nedi\u0107 once more ordered him confined to barracks for 30&nbsp;days as well as demoted and placed on the retired list. These last punishments were avoided only by Nedi\u0107's retirement in November and his replacement by [[Petar Pe\u0161i\u0107]].{{sfn|Trew|1998|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nIn the years preceding the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]], Mihailovi\u0107 was stationed in [[Celje]], [[Drava Banovina]] (modern [[Slovenia]]). At the time of the invasion, Colonel Mihailovi\u0107 was an assistant to the chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav [[2nd Army (Yugoslavia)|Second Army]] in northern Bosnia. He briefly served as the Second Army chief-of-staff{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=53}} prior to taking command of a \"Rapid Unit\" (''brzi odred'') shortly before the Yugoslav High Command capitulated to the Germans on 17 April 1941.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n==World War II==\n\nFollowing the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]], a small group of officers and soldiers led by Mihailovi\u0107 escaped in the hope of finding VKJ units still fighting in the mountains. After skirmishing with several [[Usta\u0161e]] and Muslim bands and attempting to sabotage several objects, Mihailovi\u0107 and about 80 of his men crossed the [[Drina River]] into [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied Serbia]]{{efn|name=Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia}} on 29 April.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=13}} Mihailovi\u0107 planned to establish an underground intelligence movement and establish contact with the Allies, though it is unclear if he initially envisioned to start an actual armed resistance movement.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=54}}\n\n===Formation of the Chetniks===\n\n{{See also|Uprising in Serbia (1941)}}\n\n[[File:Chetniks Flag.svg|thumb|The Chetnik flag. The flag reads: \"For King and Fatherland \u2013 [[Give me Liberty, or give me Death!|Liberty or Death]]\".]]\n\nFor the time being, Mihailovi\u0107 established a small nucleus of officers with an armed guard, which he called the \"Command of Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=54}} After arriving at [[Ravna Gora (highland)|Ravna Gora]] in early May 1941, he realized that his group of seven officers and twenty-four non-commissioned officers and soldiers was the only one.{{sfn|Freeman|2007|p=123}} He began to draw up lists of conscripts and reservists for possible use. His men at Ravna Gora were joined by a group of civilians, mainly intellectuals from the [[Serbian Cultural Club]], who took charge of the movement's propaganda sector.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=54}}\n\nThe [[Chetniks of Kosta Pe\u0107anac|Chetniks]] of [[Kosta Pe\u0107anac]], which were already in existence before the invasion, did not share Mihailovi\u0107's desire for resistance.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=21}} In order to distinguish his Chetniks from other groups calling themselves Chetniks, Mihailovi\u0107 and his followers identified themselves as the \"Ravna Gora movement\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=21}} The stated goal of the Ravna Gora movement was the liberation of the country from the occupying armies of Germany, Italy and the [[Usta\u0161e]], and the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-sh|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}, NDH).{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nMihailovi\u0107 spent most of 1941 consolidating scattered VKJ remnants and finding new recruits. In August, he set up a civilian advisory body, the Central National Committee, composed of Serb political leaders including some with strong nationalist views such as [[Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107]] and [[Stevan Moljevi\u0107]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=21\u201322}} On 19 June, a clandestine Chetnik courier reached [[Istanbul]], whence royalist Yugoslavs reported that Mihailovi\u0107 appeared to be organizing a resistance movement against Axis forces.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=22}} Mihailovi\u0107 first established radio contact with the British in September 1941, when his radio operator raised a ship in the [[Mediterranean]]. On 13 September, Mihailovi\u0107's first radio message to [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]]'s [[Yugoslav government-in-exile|government-in-exile]] announced that he was organizing VKJ remnants to fight against the Axis powers.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=22}}\n\nMihailovi\u0107 also received help from officers in other areas of Yugoslavia, such as Slovene officer [[Rudolf Perinhek]], who brought reports on the situation in Montenegro. Mihailovi\u0107 sent him back to Montenegro with written authorization to organize units there, with the oral approval of officers such as [[\u0110or\u0111ije La\u0161i\u0107]], [[Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]], [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]] and [[Kosta Mu\u0161icki]]. Mihailovi\u0107 only gave vague and contradictory orders to Perinhek, mentioning the need to put off civil strife and to \"remove enemies\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=79}}\n\nMihailovi\u0107's strategy was to avoid direct conflict with the Axis forces, intending to rise up after Allied forces arrived in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=26}} Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks had had defensive encounters with the Germans, but reprisals and the tales of the massacres in the NDH made them reluctant to engage directly in armed struggle, except against the Usta\u0161e in Serbian border areas.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=59}} In the meantime, following the Axis [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ), led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], also went into action and called for a popular insurrection against the Axis powers in July 1941. Tito subsequently set up a communist resistance movement known as the [[Yugoslav Partisans]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=56}} By the end of August, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks and the Partisans began attacking Axis forces, sometimes jointly despite their mutual diffidence, and captured numerous prisoners.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=60}} On 28 October 1941 Mihailovi\u0107 received an order from the Prime Minister of the Yugoslav Government in exile [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] who urged Mihailovi\u0107 to avoid premature actions and avoid reprisals.<ref>{{harv|Karchmar|1973|p=241}}</ref> Mihailovi\u0107 discouraged sabotage due to German reprisals (such as more than 3,000 killed in [[Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac]]) unless some great gain could be accomplished. Instead, he favoured sabotage that could not easily be traced back to the Chetniks.{{sfn|Freeman|2007|pp=124\u2013126}} His reluctance to engage in more active resistance meant that most sabotage carried out in the early period of the war were due to efforts by the Partisans, and Mihailovi\u0107 lost several commanders and a number of followers who wished to fight the Germans to the Partisan movement.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nEven though Mihailovi\u0107 initially asked for discreet support, propaganda from the British and from the Yugoslav government-in-exile quickly began to exalt his feats.

While Mihailovi\u0107 approved the destruction of communist forces, he aimed to exploit the connections of Chetniks commanders with the Italians to get food, arms and ammunition in the expectation of an Allied landing in the Balkans. On 1 December, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 organised a Chetnik \"youth conference\" at \u0160ahovi\u0107i. The congress, which historian [[Stevan K.

Italian commander [[Mario Roatta]] aimed to spare Italian lives, but also to counter the Usta\u0161e and Germans, to undermine Mihailovi\u0107's authority among the Chetniks by playing up local leaders. Chetniks, led by [[Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107]], came from Montenegro to help the Bosnian Serb population against the Usta\u0161e. They murdered and pillaged in [[Fo\u010da]] until the Italians intervened in August. The Chetniks also asked the Italians for protection against Usta\u0161e retribution. On 22 July, Mihailovi\u0107 met with Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin, Jev\u0111evi\u0107, and his newly appointed delegate in Herzegovina, [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]]. The meeting was supposedly secret, but was known to Italian intelligence. Mihailovi\u0107 gave no precise orders but expressed his confidence in both his subordinates, adding, according to Italian reports, that he was waiting for help from the Allies to start a real guerrilla campaign, in order to spare Serb lives. Summoned by Roatta upon their return, Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin and Jev\u0111evi\u0107 assured the Italian commander that Mihailovi\u0107 was merely a \"moral head\" and that they would not attack Italians, even if he should give such an order.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=122\u2013126}}\n\nHaving become more and more concerned with domestic enemies and concerned that he be in a position to control Yugoslavia after the Allies defeated the Axis, Mihailovi\u0107 concentrated from Montenegro on directing operations, in the various parts of Yugoslavia, mostly against Partisans, but also against the Usta\u0161e and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]]'s [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] (SDK).{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=67}} During the autumn of 1942, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks\u2014at the request of the British organization\u2014sabotaged several railway lines used to supply Axis forces in the [[Western Desert campaign|Western Desert]] of [[North African campaign|northern Africa]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=98}} In September and December, Mihailovi\u0107's actions damaged the railway system seriously; the Allies gave him credit for inconveniencing Axis forces and contributing to Allied successes in Africa.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=98\u2013100}} The credit given to Mihailovi\u0107 for sabotages was maybe undeserved:\n: ''But an S.O.E.

This prompted fighting between the Chetniks and followers of the Nedi\u0107 regime. The Germans, whom the Nedi\u0107 administration had called for help against Mihailovi\u0107, responded to Nedi\u0107's request and to the sabotages with mass terror, and attacked the Chetniks in late 1942 and early 1943.

Thousands of arrests were made and it has been estimated that during December 1942, 1,600 Chetnik combatants were killed by the Germans through combat actions and executions. These actions by the Nedi\u0107 regime and the Germans \"brought to an abrupt conclusion much of the anti-German action Mihailovi\u0107 had started up again since the summer (of 1942)\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=100}} [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote to [[Benito Mussolini]] on February 16, 1943, demanding that in addition to the partisans be pursued the chetniks who possessed \"a special danger in the long-term plans that Mihailovic's supporters were building.\" Hitler adds: \"In any case, the liquidation of the Mihailovic movement will no longer be an easy task, given the forces at its disposal and the large number of armed Chetniks\". At that time, General Mihailovic was with his Supreme Command in [[Montenegro]], which was under Italian occupation. From the beginning of 1943, General Mihailovic prepared his units for the supports of Allied landing on the [[Adriatic]] coast.

He also hid the situation from the British and the Yugoslav government-in-exile.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=127\u2013128}} Many terror acts were committed by Chetnik groups against their various enemies, real or perceived, reaching a peak between October 1942 and February 1943.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=256}} \nBrigadier [[Charles Armstrong (soldier)|Charles Armstrong]] reported to his command \u00b0''that Mihailovic believed that Britain had left Yugoslavia to Soviet influence ...''\u00b0.

The British officially protested to the Yugoslav government-in-exile and demanded explanations regarding Mihailovi\u0107's attitude and collaboration with the Italians. Mihailovi\u0107 answered to his government that he had had no meetings with Italian generals and that Jev\u0111evi\u0107 had no command to do so. The British announced that they would send him more abundant supplies.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=93\u201396}} Also in early 1943, the tone of the BBC broadcasts became more and more favourable to the Partisans, describing them as the only resistance movement in Yugoslavia, and occasionally attributing to them resistance acts actually undertaken by the Chetniks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=361}} Bailey complained to the Foreign Office that his position with Mihailovi\u0107 was being prejudiced by this.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=86}} The Foreign Office protested and the BBC apologized, but the line did not really change.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=86}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"In the internal struggles in the various occupied countries, the British press has in almost all cases sided with the faction favoured by the Russians and libelled the opposing faction, sometimes suppressing material evidence in order to do so.

The Russians, who had their own Jugoslav protege in Marshal Tito, accused Mihailovich of collaborating with the Germans. This accusation was promptly taken up by the British press: Mihailovich\u2019s supporters were given no chance of answering it, and facts contradicting it were simply kept out of print.

The Germans disapproved of this collaboration, about which Hitler personally wrote to Mussolini.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=103\u2013106}} At the end of February, shortly after his speech, Mihailovi\u0107 himself joined his troops in [[Herzegovina]] near the Neretva in order to try to salvage the situation. The Partisans nevertheless defeated the opposing Chetniks troops, who were in a state of disarray, and managed to go across the Neretva.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=159\u2013160}} In March, the Partisans negotiated a truce with Axis forces in order to gain some time and use it to defeat the Chetniks. While Ribbentrop and Hitler finally overruled the orders of their subordinates and forbade any such contacts, the Partisans benefited from this brief truce, during which Italian support for the Chetniks was suspended, and which allowed Tito's forces to deal a severe blow to Mihailovi\u0107's troops.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=161\u2013165}}\n\nIn May, the German intelligence service also tried to establish a contact with Mihailovi\u0107 to see if an alliance against the Partisans was possible. In [[Kola\u0161in]], they met with a Chetnik officer, who did not introduce himself. They assumed they had met the general himself, but the man was possibly not Mihailovi\u0107, whom [[William Bailey (soldier)|Bailey]] reported to be in another area at the same period. The German command, however, reacted strongly against any attempt at \"negotiating with the enemy\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\nThe Germans then turned to their next operation, code-named [[Case Black|Schwarz]], and attacked the Montenegrin Chetniks. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 appears to have suggested to Mihailovi\u0107 a short-term cooperation with the Germans against the Partisans, something Mihailovi\u0107 refused to condone. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 ended up defending his headquarters at Kola\u0161in against the Partisans. On 14 May, the Germans entered Kola\u0161in and captured \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, while Mihailovi\u0107 escaped.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=161\u2013165}}{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=106\u2013112}}\n\nIn late May, after regaining control of most of Montenegro, the Italians turned their efforts against the Chetniks, at least against Mihailovi\u0107's forces, and put a reward of half-a-million lire for the capture of Mihailovi\u0107, and one million for the capture of Tito.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=171}}\n\n==Allied support shifts==\n\nIn April and May 1943, the British sent a mission to the Partisans and strengthened their mission to the Chetniks. Major [[Jasper Rootham]], one of the liaison officers to the Chetniks, reported that engagements between Chetniks and Germans did occur, but were invariably started by German attacks. During the summer, the British sent supplies to both Chetniks and Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=117\u2013120}}\n\nMihailovi\u0107 returned to Serbia and his movement rapidly recovered its dominance in the region. Receiving more weapons from the British, he undertook a series of actions and sabotages, disarmed [[Serbian State Guard]] (SDS) detachments and skirmished with Bulgarian troops, though he generally avoided the Germans, considering that his troops were not yet strong enough. In Serbia, his organization controlled the mountains where Axis forces were absent. The collaborationist Nedi\u0107 administration was largely infiltrated by Mihailovi\u0107's men and many SDS troops being actually sympathetic to his movement. After his defeat in Case White, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to improve his organization. Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107, the movement's ideologue who had opposed the Italian connection and clashed with Mihailovi\u0107, left the supreme command. Mihailovi\u0107 tried to extend his contacts to Croats and traditional parties, and to revitalise his contacts in Slovenia.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=182\u2013186}} The [[United States]] sent liaison officers to join Bailey's mission with Mihailovi\u0107, while also sending men to Tito.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=138\u2013144}} The Germans, in the meantime, became worried by the growing strength of the Partisans and made local arrangements with Chetnik groups, though not with Mihailovi\u0107 himself. According to Walter R. Roberts, there is \"little doubt\" that Mihailovi\u0107 was aware of these arrangements and that he might have regarded them as the lesser of two evils, his primary aim being to defeat the Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nFrom the beginning of 1943, British impatience with Mihailovi\u0107 grew. From the decrypts of German wireless messages, Churchill and his government concluded that the Chetniks' collaboration with the Italians went beyond what was acceptable and that the Partisans were doing the most severe damage to the Axis.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nWith Italy's withdrawal from the war in September 1943, the Chetniks in Montenegro found themselves under attack by both the Germans and the Partisans, who took control of large parts of Montenegrin territory, including the former \"Chetnik capital\" of Kola\u0161in. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, having escaped from a German camp in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], found his way to Yugoslavia, was captured again, and was then asked by collaborationist prime minister Milan Nedi\u0107 to form a [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]] against the Partisans. He was pledged to Nedi\u0107, but also made a secret allegiance to Mihailovi\u0107. Both Mihailovi\u0107 and \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 expected a landing by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. In Serbia, Mihailovi\u0107 was considered the representative of the victorious Allies.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=192\u2013195}} In the chaotic situation created by the Italian surrender, several Chetnik leaders overtly collaborated with the Germans against the reinforced Partisans; approached by an Abwehr agent, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 offered the services of about 5,000 men. [[Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107]] also went to the Germans for cover against the Usta\u0161e and Partisans, although he was distrusted.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=204\u2013205}} In October 1943, Mihailovi\u0107, at the Allies' request, agreed to undertake two sabotage operations, which had the effect of making him even more of a wanted man and forced him, according to British reports, to change his headquarters frequently.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nBy November and December 1943, the Germans had realized that Tito was their most dangerous opponent; German representative [[Hermann Neubacher]] managed to conclude secret arrangements with four of Mihailovi\u0107's commanders for the cessation of hostilities for periods of five to ten weeks. The Germans interpreted this as a sign of weakness from the Mihailovi\u0107 movement. The truces were kept secret but came to the knowledge of the British through decrypts. There is no evidence that Mihailovi\u0107 had been involved or approved, though British Military Intelligence found it possible that he was \"conniving\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=197\u2013199}} At the end of October, the local signals decrypted in Cairo had disclosed that Mihailovi\u0107 had ordered all Chetnik units to co-operate with Germany against the Partisans.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993|p=358}} This order for cooperation was originally decrypted by Germans, and it was noted in the ''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'' War Journal.{{sfn|Schramm|1963|pp=1304}}{{efn|name=quote from KTB OKW}}\n\nThe British were more and more concerned about the fact that the Chetniks were more willing to fight Partisans than Axis troops. At the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|third Moscow Conference]] in October 1943, [[Anthony Eden]] expressed impatience about Mihailovi\u0107's lack of action.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=157\u2013160}} The report of [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]], liaison officer to the Partisans, convinced Churchill that Tito's forces were the most reliable resistance group. The report of Charles Armstrong, liaison officer to Mihailovi\u0107, arrived too late for Anthony Eden to take it to the [[Tehran Conference]] in late November 1943, though Stevan K. Pavlowitch thinks that it would probably been insufficient to change Churchill's mind. At Tehran, Churchill argued in favour of the Partisans, while [[Joseph Stalin]] expressed limited interest but agreed that they should receive the greatest possible support.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nOn 10 December, Churchill met King Peter II in London and told him that he possessed irrefutable proofs of Mihailovi\u0107's collaboration with the enemy and that Mihailovi\u0107 should be eliminated from the Yugoslav cabinet. Also in early December, Mihailovi\u0107 was asked to undertake an important sabotage mission against railways, which was later interpreted as a \"final opportunity\" to redeem himself. However, possibly not realizing how Allied policy had evolved, he failed to give the go-ahead.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=178\u2013180}} On 12 January 1944, the SOE in Cairo sent a report to the Foreign Office, saying that Mihailovi\u0107's commanders had collaborated with Germans and Italians and that Mihailovi\u0107 himself had condoned and in certain cases approved their actions. This hastened the British's decision to withdraw their thirty liaison officers to Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=197}} The mission was effectively withdrawn in the spring of 1944. In April, one month before leaving, liaison officer Brigadier Armstrong noted that Mihailovi\u0107 had been mostly active in propaganda against the Axis, that he had missed numerous occasions for sabotage in the last six or eight months and that the efforts of many Chetnik leaders to follow Mihailovi\u0107's orders for inactivity had evolved into non-aggression pacts with Axis troops, although the mission had no evidence of collaboration with the enemy.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=225}} \n\nIn the meantime, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to improve the organization of his movement. On 25 January 1944, with the help of [[\u017divko Topalovi\u0107]], he organized in [[Ba (Ljig)|Ba]], a village near Ravna Gora, the [[Ba Congress]] also meant to remove the shadow of the previous congress held in Montenegro. The congress was attended by 274 people, representing various parties, and aimed to be a reaction against the arbitrary behaviour of some commanders. The organization of a new, democratic, possibly federal, Yugoslavia, was mentioned, though the proposals remained vague, and an appeal was even made for the KPJ to join. The Chetnik command structure was formally reorganized. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was still in charge of Montenegro and \u0110uji\u0107 of Dalmatia, but Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was excluded. The Germans and Bulgarians reacted to the congress by conducting an operation against the Chetniks in northern Serbia in February, killing 80 and capturing 913.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=223\u2013226}}\n\nAfter May and the withdrawal of the British mission, Mihailovi\u0107 kept transmitting radio messages to the Allies and to his government but no longer received replies.\n\nIn July and August 1944, Mihailovi\u0107 ordered his forces to cooperate with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and 60th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS) in the successful rescue of hundreds downed Allied airmen between August and December 1944 in what was called [[Operation Halyard]];{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=245\u2013257}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=378}} for this, he was posthumously awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] by United States President [[Harry S.

The Americans, with a weaker intelligence presence in the Balkans than the British, were less in touch with the realities of the Yugoslav civil war. They were consequently less than enthusiastic about British abandonment of the anti-communist Mihailovi\u0107, and more reserved toward the Partisans.\" Several Yugoslavs were also evacuated in Operation Halyard, along with Topalovi\u0107; they tried to raise more support abroad for Mihailovi\u0107's movement, but this came too late to reverse Allied policy.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=253\u2013254}} The United States also sent an intelligence mission to Mihailovi\u0107 in March, but withdrew it after Churchill advised Roosevelt that all support should go to Tito and that \"complete chaos\" would ensue if the Americans also backed Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=245\u2013257}}\n\nIn July, [[Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107]] formed the new Yugoslav government-in-exile, which did not include Mihailovi\u0107 as a minister. Mihailovi\u0107, however, remained the official chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav Army. On 29 August, upon the recommendation of his government, King Peter dissolved by royal decree the Supreme Command, therefore abolishing Mihailovi\u0107's post. On 12 September, King Peter broadcast a message from London, announcing the gist of 29 August's decree and calling upon all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to \"join the National Liberation Army under the leadership of Marshal Tito\". He also proclaimed that he strongly condemned \"the misuse of the name of the King and the authority of the Crown by which an attempt has been made to justify collaboration with the enemy\". Though the King did not mention Mihailovi\u0107, it was clear who he meant. According to his own account, Peter had obtained after strenuous talks with the British not to say a word directly against Mihailovi\u0107. The message had a devastating effect on the morale of the Chetniks. Many men left Mihailovi\u0107 after the broadcast; others remained out of loyalty to him.\n{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=258\u2013260}} Mihailovi\u0107 resented the fact that he was abandoned by his former allies and in August 1944 summed up his position by stating that:\n\n: ''\"More than three years ago I took up arms to fight for democracy against dictatorship in the form of nazism and fascism. In fighting for this cause there were ten occasions on which I almost lost my life. If I must die in fighting against a new form of dictatorship, I shall die, bitter because I have been deserted by those who profess to believe in democracy, but satisfied that I myself have fought bravely and honestly and have refused to compromise my cause.\"''{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=292}}\n\n==Defeat in 1944\u201345==\n\nAt the end of August 1944, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]] arrived on the eastern borders of Yugoslavia. In early September, it invaded Bulgaria and coerced it into turning against the Axis. Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks, meanwhile, were so badly armed to resist the Partisan incursions into Serbia that some of Mihailovi\u0107's officers, including [[Nikola Kalabi\u0107]], Ne\u0161ko Nedi\u0107 and Dragoslav Ra\u010di\u0107, met German officers on 11 August to arrange a meeting of Mihailovi\u0107 with Neubacher and to set forth the conditions for increased collaboration.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=342}} Nedi\u0107, in turn, apparently picked up the idea and suggested forming an army of united anti-communist forces; he arranged a secret meeting with Mihailovi\u0107, which apparently took place around 20 August. From the existing accounts, they met in a dark room and Mihailovi\u0107 remained mostly silent, so much so that Nedi\u0107 was not even sure afterwards that he had actually met the real Mihailovi\u0107. According to British official Stephen Clissold, Mihailovi\u0107 was initially very reluctant to go to the meeting, but was finally convinced by Kalabi\u0107. It appears that Nedi\u0107 offered to obtain arms from the Germans, and to place his Serbian State Guard under Mihailovi\u0107's command, possibly as part of an attempt to switch sides as Germany was losing the war.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=257\u2013258}} Neubacher favoured the idea, but it was vetoed by Hitler, who saw this as an attempt to establish an \"English fifth column\" in Serbia. According to Pavlowitch, Mihailovi\u0107, who was reportedly not enthusiastic about the proposal, and Nedi\u0107 might have been trying to \"exploit each other's predicaments\", while Nedi\u0107 may have considered letting Mihailovi\u0107 \"take over\". At the end of August, Mihailovi\u0107 also met an OSS mission, headed by Colonel [[Robert H. McDowell]], who stayed with him until November.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nAs the Red Army approached, Mihailovi\u0107 thought that the outcome of war would depend on [[Turkey]] entering the conflict, followed at last by an Allied incursion in the Balkans. He called upon all Yugoslavs to remain faithful to the King, and claimed that Peter had sent him a message telling him not to believe what he had heard on the radio about his dismissal. His troops started to break up outside Serbia in mid-August, as he tried to reach to Muslim and Croat leaders for a national uprising. However, whatever his intentions, he proved to have little attraction for non-Serbs. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, while leading his [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]], which was related on paper to Ljoti\u0107's forces, accepted once again Mihailovi\u0107's command.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=230\u2013235}} Mihailovi\u0107 ordered a general mobilization on 1 September; his troops were engaged against the Germans and the Bulgarians, while also under attack by the Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=258\u2013260}} On 4 September, Mihailovi\u0107 issued a circular telegram ordering his commanders that no action can be undertaken without his orders, save against the communists.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=380}} German sources confirm the loyalty of Mihailovi\u0107 and forces under his direct influence in this period.{{efn|name=Army Group F Ic notice}} The Partisans then penetrated Chetnik territory, fighting a difficult battle and ultimately defeating Mihailovi\u0107's main force by October. On 6 September, what was left of Nedi\u0107's troops openly joined Mihailovi\u0107. In the meantime, the [[Red Army]] encountered both the Partisans and Chetniks while entering from Romania and Bulgaria. They briefly cooperated with the Chetniks against retreating Germans, before disarming them. Mihailovi\u0107 sent a delegation to the Soviet command, but his representatives were ignored and ultimately arrested. Mihailovi\u0107's movement collapsed in Serbia under the attacks of Soviets, Partisans, Bulgarians and fighting with the retreating Germans. Still hoping for a landing by the Western Allies, he headed for Bosnia with his staff, McDowell and a force of a few hundred. He set up a few Muslim units and appointed Croat Major Matija Parac as the head of an as yet non-existent Croatian Chetnik army. Nedi\u0107 himself had fled to Austria. On 25 May 1945, he wrote to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], asserting that he had always been a secret ally of Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=231\u2013238}}\n\nNow hoping for support from the United States, Mihailovi\u0107 met a small British mission between the Neretva river and Dubrovnik, but realized that it wasn't the signal of the hoped-for landing. McDowell was evacuated on 1 November and was instructed to offer Mihailovi\u0107 the opportunity to leave with him. Mihailovi\u0107 refused, as he wanted to remain until the expected change of Western Allied policy.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=254}} During the next weeks, the British government also raised the possibility of evacuating Mihailovi\u0107 by arranging a \"rescue and honorable detention\", and discussed the matter with the United States. In the end, no action was taken.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=280\u2013282}} With their main forces in eastern Bosnia, the Chetniks under Mihailovi\u0107's personal command in the late months of 1944 continued to collaborate with Germans. Colonel Borota and ''vojvoda'' Jev\u0111evi\u0107 maintained contacts with Germans for the whole group.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=433}} In January 1945, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to regroup his forces on the [[Ozren (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ozren]] heights, planning Muslim, Croatian and Slovenian units. His troops were, however, decimated and worn out, some selling their weapons and ammunition, or pillaging the local population. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 joined Mihailovi\u0107, with his own depleted forces, and found out that Mihailovi\u0107 had no plan.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=440}} \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 went his own way, and was killed on 12 April in a battle with the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=254\u2013256}}\n\nOn 17 March 1945, Mihailovi\u0107 was visited in Bosnia by German emissary St\u00e4rker, who requested that Mihailovi\u0107 transmit to the Allied headquarters in Italy a secret German offer of capitulation. Mihailovi\u0107 transmitted the message, which was to be his last.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=306\u2013307}} Ljoti\u0107 and several independent Chetnik leaders in [[Istria]] proposed the forming of a common anti-communist front in the north-western coast, which could be acceptable to the Western Allies. Mihailovi\u0107 was not in favour of such a heterogeneous gathering, but did not reject Ljoti\u0107's proposal entirely, since the littoral area would be a convenient place to meet the Western Allies, and to join Slovene anti-communists, while Germany's collapse might make an anti-communist alliance possible. He authorized the departure of all who wanted to go, but few Chetniks ultimately arrived on the coast, with many being decimated on their way by Usta\u0161e, Partisans, sickness and hunger.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=256\u2013258}} On 13 April, Mihailovi\u0107 set out for northern Bosnia, on a 280&nbsp;km-long march back to Serbia, aiming to start over a resistance movement, this time against the communists. His units were decimated by clashes with the Usta\u0161e and Partisans, as well as dissension and [[typhus]]. On 10 May, they were attacked and defeated by [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), the successor to the Partisans, in [[battle of Zelengora]]. Mihailovi\u0107 managed to escape with 1,000\u20132,000 men, who gradually dispersed. Mihailovi\u0107 himself went into hiding in the mountains with a handful of men.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=266\u2013267}}\n\n==Capture, trial and execution==\n\n{{Main|Trial of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107}}\n\n[[File:Dra\u017ea pred sudom.jpg|thumbnail|Mihailovi\u0107's trial]]\n\nThe Yugoslav authorities wanted to catch Mihailovi\u0107 alive in order to stage a full-scale trial.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=267}} He was finally caught on 13 March 1946.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=307}} The elaborate circumstances of his capture were kept secret for sixteen years. According to one existing version, Mihailovi\u0107 was approached by men who were supposedly British agents offering him help and an evacuation by aeroplane. After hesitating, he boarded the aeroplane, only to discover that it was a trap set up by the [[Department for the Protection of the People|OZNA]]. Another version, proposed by the Yugoslav government, is that he was betrayed by Nikola Kalabi\u0107, who revealed his place of hiding in exchange for leniency.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=250\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Ravnagora spomenik1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Monument to General Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 on [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]], Serbia.]]\n\nThe [[trial of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] opened on 10 June 1946. His co-defendants were other prominent figures of the Chetnik movement as well as members of the Yugoslav government-in-exile, such as [[Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107]], who were tried in absentia, but also members of [[ZBOR]] and of the [[Nedi\u0107 regime]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=262}} The main prosecutor was [[Milo\u0161 Mini\u0107]], later Minister of Foreign Affairs in the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] government. The Allied airmen he had rescued in 1944 were not allowed to testify in his favour.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=260\u2013262}} Mihailovi\u0107 evaded several questions by accusing some of his subordinates of incompetence and disregard of his orders. The trial shows, according to Jozo Tomasevich, that he never had firm and full control over his local commanders.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=462\u2013463}} A ''Committee for the Fair Trial of General Mihailovi\u0107'' was set up in the United States, but to no avail.

Mihailovi\u0107 was convicted of [[high treason]] and [[war crimes]], and was executed on 17 July 1946.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=307}} He was executed together with nine other officers in Lisi\u010diji Potok, about 200 meters from the former Royal Palace.

Tomasevich suggests one main cause of his defeat was his failure to grow professionally, politically or ideologically as his responsibilities increased, rendering him unable to face both the exceptional circumstances of the war and the complex situation of the Chetniks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p={{page needed|date=September 2012}}}} Tomasevich also criticizes Mihailovi\u0107's loss of the Allied support through Chetnik collaboration with the Axis, as well as his doctrine of \"passive resistance\" which was perceived as idleness, stating \"of generalship in the general there was precious little.\"{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=470}} Pavlowitch also points to Mihailovi\u0107's failure to grow and evolve during the conflict and describes him as a man \"generally out of his depth\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=279}} Roberts asserts that Mihailovi\u0107's policies were \"basically static\", that he \"gambled all in the faith of an Allied victory,\" and that ultimately he was unable to control the Chetniks, who, \"although hostile to the Germans and the Italians&nbsp;... allowed themselves to drift into a policy of accommodations with both in the face of what they considered the greatest danger.\"{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=322}}\n\nPolitical views of Mihailovi\u0107 cover a wide range. After the war, Mihailovi\u0107's wartime role was viewed in the light of his movement's collaboration, particularly in Yugoslavia where he was considered a collaborator convicted of high treason. Charles de Gaulle considered Mihailovi\u0107 a \"pure hero\" and always refused to have personal meetings with Tito, whom he considered as Mihailovi\u0107's \"murderer\".{{sfn|Peyrefitte|1997|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Lutard-Tavard|2005|p=78}} During the war, Churchill believed intelligence reports had shown that Mihailovi\u0107 had engaged \"...&nbsp;in active collaboration with the Germans\".{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=409\u2013415}} He observed that, under the pressure of German reprisals in 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 \"drifted gradually into a posture where some of his commanders made accommodations with German and Italian troops to be left alone in certain mountain areas in return for doing little or nothing against the enemy\", but concluded that \"those who have triumphantly withstood such strains may brand his [Mihailovi\u0107's] name, but history, more discriminating, should not erase it from the scroll of Serbian patriots.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=408\u2013409}} In the United States, due to the efforts of Major Richard L.

27 April 1893&nbsp;\u2013 17 July 1946) was a Yugoslav [[Serb]] general during [[World War II]]. A staunch royalist, he retreated to the mountains near [[Belgrade]] when the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] overran [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in April 1941 and there he organized bands of guerrillas known as the [[Chetniks|Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army]].\n\nThe organisation is commonly known as the Chetniks, although the name of the organisation was later changed to the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland (JVUO, \u0408\u0412\u0423\u041e).{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=125}} Founded as the first Yugoslav [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement]], it was royalist and nationalist, as opposed to the other, [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] who were communist. Initially, the two groups operated in parallel, but by late 1941 began fighting each other in the attempt to gain control of post-war Yugoslavia. Many Chetnik groups [[Collaborationism|collaborated]] or established ''[[modus vivendi]]'' with the [[Axis powers]]. Mihailovi\u0107 himself collaborated with [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]] at the end of the war.  After the war, Mihailovi\u0107 was captured by the communists. He was [[Trial of Mihailovi\u0107 et al.|tried and convicted]] of [[high treason]] and [[war crimes]] by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|communist authorities]] of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]], and executed by [[firing squad]] in Belgrade. The nature and extent of his responsibility for collaboration and ethnic massacres remains controversial. On 14 May 2015, Mihailovi\u0107's verdict was overturned on appeal with the ruling showing that his trial amounted to a communist kangaroo court. The [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Serbia)|Supreme Court of Cassation]], and [[appellate court]] handed out the rulings. While some see this as a rehabilitation the courts did not go as far and only ruled on the previous trial without offering to retry the case. This was done to satisfy his offspring's legal rights to property which the ruling at his trial stripped from them. \n\n==Early life and military career==\n\nDragoljub \"Dra\u017ea\" Mihailovi\u0107 was born on 27 April 1893 in [[Ivanjica]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]] to Mihailo and Smiljana Mihailovi\u0107 (''n\u00e9e'' Petrovi\u0107).{{sfn|Mihailovi\u0107|1946|p=13}} His father was a [[court clerk]]. Orphaned at seven years of age, Mihailovi\u0107 was raised by his paternal uncle in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=13}} As both of his uncles were military officers, Mihailovi\u0107 himself joined the Serbian [[Military Academy (Serbia)|Military Academy]] in October 1910. He fought as a cadet in the [[Serbian Army]] during the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u201313 and was awarded the [[Silver Medal of Valor]] at the end of the [[First Balkan War]], in May 1913.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=26\u201327}} At the end of the [[Second Balkan War]], during which he mainly led operations along the [[Provisional Government of Albania|Albanian]] border, he was given the rank of second [[lieutenant]] as the top soldier in his class, ranked sixth at the Serbian military academy.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=26\u201327}} He served in [[World War I]] and was involved in the [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania|Serbian Army's retreat]] through [[Principality of Albania|Albania]] in 1915. He later received several decorations for his achievements on the [[Salonika Front]]. Following the war, he became a member of the Royal Guard of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] but had to leave his position in 1920 after taking part in a public argument between communist and nationalist sympathizers. He was subsequently stationed to [[Skopje]]. In 1921, he was admitted to the Superior Military Academy of Belgrade. In 1923, having finished his studies, he was promoted as an assistant to the [[Staff (military)|military staff]], along with the fifteen other best alumni of his promotion.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=45\u201349}} He was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] in 1930. That same year, he spent three months in [[Paris]], following classes at the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]]. Some authors claim that he met and befriended [[Charles de Gaulle]] during his stay, although there is no known evidence of this.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=55\u201356}} In 1935, he became a military [[attach\u00e9]] to the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and was stationed to [[Sofia]]. On 6 September 1935, he was promoted to the rank of [[colonel]]. Mihailovi\u0107 then came in contact with members of [[Zveno]] and considered taking part in a plot which aimed to provoke [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]]'s abdication and the creation of an alliance between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, but, being untrained as a spy, he was soon identified by Bulgarian authorities and was asked to leave the country. He was then appointed as an attach\u00e9 to [[Czechoslovakia]] in [[Prague]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nHis military career almost came to an abrupt end in 1939, when he submitted a report strongly criticizing the organization of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] ({{lang-sh|Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VKJ). Among his most important proposals were abandoning the defence of the northern frontier to concentrate forces in the mountainous interior; re-organizing the armed forces into [[Serb]], [[Croat]], and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] units in order to better counter subversive activities; and using mobile Chetnik units along the borders. [[Milan Nedi\u0107]], the Minister of the Army, was incensed by Mihailovi\u0107's report and ordered that he be confined to barracks for 30&nbsp;days.{{sfn|Trew|1998|pp=5\u20136}} Afterwards, Mihailovi\u0107 became a professor at Belgrade's [[staff college]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=66\u201368}} In the summer of 1940, he attended a function put on by the British military attach\u00e9 for the Association of Yugoslav Reserve NCOs. The meeting was seen as highly anti-Nazi in tone, and the German ambassador protested Mihailovi\u0107's presence. Nedi\u0107 once more ordered him confined to barracks for 30&nbsp;days as well as demoted and placed on the retired list.

At the time of the invasion, Colonel Mihailovi\u0107 was an assistant to the chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav [[2nd Army (Yugoslavia)|Second Army]] in northern Bosnia. He briefly served as the Second Army chief-of-staff{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=53}} prior to taking command of a \"Rapid Unit\" (''brzi odred'') shortly before the Yugoslav High Command capitulated to the Germans on 17 April 1941.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n==World War II==\n\nFollowing the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]], a small group of officers and soldiers led by Mihailovi\u0107 escaped in the hope of finding VKJ units still fighting in the mountains.

The creation of a resistance movement in occupied Europe was received as a morale booster.

Mihailovi\u0107 and \u0110ukanovi\u0107 did not attend the event, which was entirely dominated by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, but they sent representatives.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=110\u2013112}} In the same month, Mihailovi\u0107 informed his subordinates that: \"The units of the Partisans are filled with thugs of the most varied kinds, such as Usta\u0161as&nbsp;\u2013 the worst butchers of the Serb people&nbsp;\u2013 Jews, Croats, Dalmatians, Bulgarians, Turks, Magyars, and all the other nations of the world.\"{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=161}}\n\n[[File:Predrag Rakovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|right|British Brigadier [[Charles Armstrong (soldier)|Charles Armstrong]] visits the 2nd Ravna Gora Corps in the fall of 1943.

He led the \"nationalist\" resistance against Partisans and [[Usta\u0161e]] and acknowledged Mihailovi\u0107 as formal leader, but acted on his own, with his troops being used by the Italians as the local [[Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia]] (MVAC). Italian commander [[Mario Roatta]] aimed to spare Italian lives, but also to counter the Usta\u0161e and Germans, to undermine Mihailovi\u0107's authority among the Chetniks by playing up local leaders. Chetniks, led by [[Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107]], came from Montenegro to help the Bosnian Serb population against the Usta\u0161e. They murdered and pillaged in [[Fo\u010da]] until the Italians intervened in August. The Chetniks also asked the Italians for protection against Usta\u0161e retribution. On 22 July, Mihailovi\u0107 met with Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin, Jev\u0111evi\u0107, and his newly appointed delegate in Herzegovina, [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]]. The meeting was supposedly secret, but was known to Italian intelligence. Mihailovi\u0107 gave no precise orders but expressed his confidence in both his subordinates, adding, according to Italian reports, that he was waiting for help from the Allies to start a real guerrilla campaign, in order to spare Serb lives. Summoned by Roatta upon their return, Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin and Jev\u0111evi\u0107 assured the Italian commander that Mihailovi\u0107 was merely a \"moral head\" and that they would not attack Italians, even if he should give such an order.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=122\u2013126}}\n\nHaving become more and more concerned with domestic enemies and concerned that he be in a position to control Yugoslavia after the Allies defeated the Axis, Mihailovi\u0107 concentrated from Montenegro on directing operations, in the various parts of Yugoslavia, mostly against Partisans, but also against the Usta\u0161e and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]]'s [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] (SDK).{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=67}} During the autumn of 1942, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks\u2014at the request of the British organization\u2014sabotaged several railway lines used to supply Axis forces in the [[Western Desert campaign|Western Desert]] of [[North African campaign|northern Africa]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=98}} In September and December, Mihailovi\u0107's actions damaged the railway system seriously; the Allies gave him credit for inconveniencing Axis forces and contributing to Allied successes in Africa.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=98\u2013100}} The credit given to Mihailovi\u0107 for sabotages was maybe undeserved:\n: ''But an S.O.E.

This prompted fighting between the Chetniks and followers of the Nedi\u0107 regime. The Germans, whom the Nedi\u0107 administration had called for help against Mihailovi\u0107, responded to Nedi\u0107's request and to the sabotages with mass terror, and attacked the Chetniks in late 1942 and early 1943.

Thousands of arrests were made and it has been estimated that during December 1942, 1,600 Chetnik combatants were killed by the Germans through combat actions and executions. These actions by the Nedi\u0107 regime and the Germans \"brought to an abrupt conclusion much of the anti-German action Mihailovi\u0107 had started up again since the summer (of 1942)\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=100}} [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote to [[Benito Mussolini]] on February 16, 1943, demanding that in addition to the partisans be pursued the chetniks who possessed \"a special danger in the long-term plans that Mihailovic's supporters were building.\" Hitler adds: \"In any case, the liquidation of the Mihailovic movement will no longer be an easy task, given the forces at its disposal and the large number of armed Chetniks\". At that time, General Mihailovic was with his Supreme Command in [[Montenegro]], which was under Italian occupation. From the beginning of 1943, General Mihailovic prepared his units for the supports of Allied landing on the [[Adriatic]] coast.

They assumed they had met the general himself, but the man was possibly not Mihailovi\u0107, whom [[William Bailey (soldier)|Bailey]] reported to be in another area at the same period.

During the summer, the British sent supplies to both Chetniks and Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=117\u2013120}}\n\nMihailovi\u0107 returned to Serbia and his movement rapidly recovered its dominance in the region. Receiving more weapons from the British, he undertook a series of actions and sabotages, disarmed [[Serbian State Guard]] (SDS) detachments and skirmished with Bulgarian troops, though he generally avoided the Germans, considering that his troops were not yet strong enough. In Serbia, his organization controlled the mountains where Axis forces were absent. The collaborationist Nedi\u0107 administration was largely infiltrated by Mihailovi\u0107's men and many SDS troops being actually sympathetic to his movement. After his defeat in Case White, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to improve his organization. Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107, the movement's ideologue who had opposed the Italian connection and clashed with Mihailovi\u0107, left the supreme command.

According to Walter R. Roberts, there is \"little doubt\" that Mihailovi\u0107 was aware of these arrangements and that he might have regarded them as the lesser of two evils, his primary aim being to defeat the Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nFrom the beginning of 1943, British impatience with Mihailovi\u0107 grew. From the decrypts of German wireless messages, Churchill and his government concluded that the Chetniks' collaboration with the Italians went beyond what was acceptable and that the Partisans were doing the most severe damage to the Axis.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nWith Italy's withdrawal from the war in September 1943, the Chetniks in Montenegro found themselves under attack by both the Germans and the Partisans, who took control of large parts of Montenegrin territory, including the former \"Chetnik capital\" of Kola\u0161in. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, having escaped from a German camp in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], found his way to Yugoslavia, was captured again, and was then asked by collaborationist prime minister Milan Nedi\u0107 to form a [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]] against the Partisans. He was pledged to Nedi\u0107, but also made a secret allegiance to Mihailovi\u0107. Both Mihailovi\u0107 and \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 expected a landing by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. In Serbia, Mihailovi\u0107 was considered the representative of the victorious Allies.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=192\u2013195}} In the chaotic situation created by the Italian surrender, several Chetnik leaders overtly collaborated with the Germans against the reinforced Partisans; approached by an Abwehr agent, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 offered the services of about 5,000 men. [[Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107]] also went to the Germans for cover against the Usta\u0161e and Partisans, although he was distrusted.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=204\u2013205}} In October 1943, Mihailovi\u0107, at the Allies' request, agreed to undertake two sabotage operations, which had the effect of making him even more of a wanted man and forced him, according to British reports, to change his headquarters frequently.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nBy November and December 1943, the Germans had realized that Tito was their most dangerous opponent; German representative [[Hermann Neubacher]] managed to conclude secret arrangements with four of Mihailovi\u0107's commanders for the cessation of hostilities for periods of five to ten weeks. The Germans interpreted this as a sign of weakness from the Mihailovi\u0107 movement. The truces were kept secret but came to the knowledge of the British through decrypts. There is no evidence that Mihailovi\u0107 had been involved or approved, though British Military Intelligence found it possible that he was \"conniving\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=197\u2013199}} At the end of October, the local signals decrypted in Cairo had disclosed that Mihailovi\u0107 had ordered all Chetnik units to co-operate with Germany against the Partisans.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993|p=358}} This order for cooperation was originally decrypted by Germans, and it was noted in the ''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'' War Journal.{{sfn|Schramm|1963|pp=1304}}{{efn|name=quote from KTB OKW}}\n\nThe British were more and more concerned about the fact that the Chetniks were more willing to fight Partisans than Axis troops. At the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|third Moscow Conference]] in October 1943, [[Anthony Eden]] expressed impatience about Mihailovi\u0107's lack of action.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=157\u2013160}} The report of [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]], liaison officer to the Partisans, convinced Churchill that Tito's forces were the most reliable resistance group. The report of Charles Armstrong, liaison officer to Mihailovi\u0107, arrived too late for Anthony Eden to take it to the [[Tehran Conference]] in late November 1943, though Stevan K. Pavlowitch thinks that it would probably been insufficient to change Churchill's mind. At Tehran, Churchill argued in favour of the Partisans, while [[Joseph Stalin]] expressed limited interest but agreed that they should receive the greatest possible support.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nOn 10 December, Churchill met King Peter II in London and told him that he possessed irrefutable proofs of Mihailovi\u0107's collaboration with the enemy and that Mihailovi\u0107 should be eliminated from the Yugoslav cabinet. Also in early December, Mihailovi\u0107 was asked to undertake an important sabotage mission against railways, which was later interpreted as a \"final opportunity\" to redeem himself. However, possibly not realizing how Allied policy had evolved, he failed to give the go-ahead.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=178\u2013180}} On 12 January 1944, the SOE in Cairo sent a report to the Foreign Office, saying that Mihailovi\u0107's commanders had collaborated with Germans and Italians and that Mihailovi\u0107 himself had condoned and in certain cases approved their actions. This hastened the British's decision to withdraw their thirty liaison officers to Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=197}} The mission was effectively withdrawn in the spring of 1944. In April, one month before leaving, liaison officer Brigadier Armstrong noted that Mihailovi\u0107 had been mostly active in propaganda against the Axis, that he had missed numerous occasions for sabotage in the last six or eight months and that the efforts of many Chetnik leaders to follow Mihailovi\u0107's orders for inactivity had evolved into non-aggression pacts with Axis troops, although the mission had no evidence of collaboration with the enemy.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=225}} \n\nIn the meantime, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to improve the organization of his movement. On 25 January 1944, with the help of [[\u017divko Topalovi\u0107]], he organized in [[Ba (Ljig)|Ba]], a village near Ravna Gora, the [[Ba Congress]] also meant to remove the shadow of the previous congress held in Montenegro. The congress was attended by 274 people, representing various parties, and aimed to be a reaction against the arbitrary behaviour of some commanders. The organization of a new, democratic, possibly federal, Yugoslavia, was mentioned, though the proposals remained vague, and an appeal was even made for the KPJ to join. The Chetnik command structure was formally reorganized. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was still in charge of Montenegro and \u0110uji\u0107 of Dalmatia, but Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was excluded. The Germans and Bulgarians reacted to the congress by conducting an operation against the Chetniks in northern Serbia in February, killing 80 and capturing 913.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=223\u2013226}}\n\nAfter May and the withdrawal of the British mission, Mihailovi\u0107 kept transmitting radio messages to the Allies and to his government but no longer received replies.\n\nIn July and August 1944, Mihailovi\u0107 ordered his forces to cooperate with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and 60th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS) in the successful rescue of hundreds downed Allied airmen between August and December 1944 in what was called [[Operation Halyard]];{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=245\u2013257}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=378}} for this, he was posthumously awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] by United States President [[Harry S. Truman]].  Details of this rescue mission are described in The Forgotten 500, by Gregory A. Freeman, published in 2007.  [http://www.gregoryafreeman.com/forgotten500.html]\n\nAccording to historian [[Marko Attila Hoare]], \"On other occasions, however, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks rescued German airmen and handed them over safely to the German armed forces&nbsp;... The Americans, with a weaker intelligence presence in the Balkans than the British, were less in touch with the realities of the Yugoslav civil war. They were consequently less than enthusiastic about British abandonment of the anti-communist Mihailovi\u0107, and more reserved toward the Partisans.\" Several Yugoslavs were also evacuated in Operation Halyard, along with Topalovi\u0107; they tried to raise more support abroad for Mihailovi\u0107's movement, but this came too late to reverse Allied policy.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=253\u2013254}} The United States also sent an intelligence mission to Mihailovi\u0107 in March, but withdrew it after Churchill advised Roosevelt that all support should go to Tito and that \"complete chaos\" would ensue if the Americans also backed Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=245\u2013257}}\n\nIn July, [[Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107]] formed the new Yugoslav government-in-exile, which did not include Mihailovi\u0107 as a minister. Mihailovi\u0107, however, remained the official chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav Army. On 29 August, upon the recommendation of his government, King Peter dissolved by royal decree the Supreme Command, therefore abolishing Mihailovi\u0107's post. On 12 September, King Peter broadcast a message from London, announcing the gist of 29 August's decree and calling upon all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to \"join the National Liberation Army under the leadership of Marshal Tito\". He also proclaimed that he strongly condemned \"the misuse of the name of the King and the authority of the Crown by which an attempt has been made to justify collaboration with the enemy\". Though the King did not mention Mihailovi\u0107, it was clear who he meant. According to his own account, Peter had obtained after strenuous talks with the British not to say a word directly against Mihailovi\u0107. The message had a devastating effect on the morale of the Chetniks. Many men left Mihailovi\u0107 after the broadcast; others remained out of loyalty to him.\n{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=258\u2013260}} Mihailovi\u0107 resented the fact that he was abandoned by his former allies and in August 1944 summed up his position by stating that:\n\n: ''\"More than three years ago I took up arms to fight for democracy against dictatorship in the form of nazism and fascism. In fighting for this cause there were ten occasions on which I almost lost my life. If I must die in fighting against a new form of dictatorship, I shall die, bitter because I have been deserted by those who profess to believe in democracy, but satisfied that I myself have fought bravely and honestly and have refused to compromise my cause.\"''{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=292}}\n\n==Defeat in 1944\u201345==\n\nAt the end of August 1944, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]] arrived on the eastern borders of Yugoslavia. In early September, it invaded Bulgaria and coerced it into turning against the Axis. Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks, meanwhile, were so badly armed to resist the Partisan incursions into Serbia that some of Mihailovi\u0107's officers, including [[Nikola Kalabi\u0107]], Ne\u0161ko Nedi\u0107 and Dragoslav Ra\u010di\u0107, met German officers on 11 August to arrange a meeting of Mihailovi\u0107 with Neubacher and to set forth the conditions for increased collaboration.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=342}} Nedi\u0107, in turn, apparently picked up the idea and suggested forming an army of united anti-communist forces; he arranged a secret meeting with Mihailovi\u0107, which apparently took place around 20 August. From the existing accounts, they met in a dark room and Mihailovi\u0107 remained mostly silent, so much so that Nedi\u0107 was not even sure afterwards that he had actually met the real Mihailovi\u0107. According to British official Stephen Clissold, Mihailovi\u0107 was initially very reluctant to go to the meeting, but was finally convinced by Kalabi\u0107. It appears that Nedi\u0107 offered to obtain arms from the Germans, and to place his Serbian State Guard under Mihailovi\u0107's command, possibly as part of an attempt to switch sides as Germany was losing the war.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=257\u2013258}} Neubacher favoured the idea, but it was vetoed by Hitler, who saw this as an attempt to establish an \"English fifth column\" in Serbia. According to Pavlowitch, Mihailovi\u0107, who was reportedly not enthusiastic about the proposal, and Nedi\u0107 might have been trying to \"exploit each other's predicaments\", while Nedi\u0107 may have considered letting Mihailovi\u0107 \"take over\". At the end of August, Mihailovi\u0107 also met an OSS mission, headed by Colonel [[Robert H. McDowell]], who stayed with him until November.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nAs the Red Army approached, Mihailovi\u0107 thought that the outcome of war would depend on [[Turkey]] entering the conflict, followed at last by an Allied incursion in the Balkans. He called upon all Yugoslavs to remain faithful to the King, and claimed that Peter had sent him a message telling him not to believe what he had heard on the radio about his dismissal. His troops started to break up outside Serbia in mid-August, as he tried to reach to Muslim and Croat leaders for a national uprising. However, whatever his intentions, he proved to have little attraction for non-Serbs. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, while leading his [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]], which was related on paper to Ljoti\u0107's forces, accepted once again Mihailovi\u0107's command.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=230\u2013235}} Mihailovi\u0107 ordered a general mobilization on 1 September; his troops were engaged against the Germans and the Bulgarians, while also under attack by the Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=258\u2013260}} On 4 September, Mihailovi\u0107 issued a circular telegram ordering his commanders that no action can be undertaken without his orders, save against the communists.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=380}} German sources confirm the loyalty of Mihailovi\u0107 and forces under his direct influence in this period.{{efn|name=Army Group F Ic notice}} The Partisans then penetrated Chetnik territory, fighting a difficult battle and ultimately defeating Mihailovi\u0107's main force by October. On 6 September, what was left of Nedi\u0107's troops openly joined Mihailovi\u0107. In the meantime, the [[Red Army]] encountered both the Partisans and Chetniks while entering from Romania and Bulgaria. They briefly cooperated with the Chetniks against retreating Germans, before disarming them. Mihailovi\u0107 sent a delegation to the Soviet command, but his representatives were ignored and ultimately arrested. Mihailovi\u0107's movement collapsed in Serbia under the attacks of Soviets, Partisans, Bulgarians and fighting with the retreating Germans. Still hoping for a landing by the Western Allies, he headed for Bosnia with his staff, McDowell and a force of a few hundred. He set up a few Muslim units and appointed Croat Major Matija Parac as the head of an as yet non-existent Croatian Chetnik army. Nedi\u0107 himself had fled to Austria. On 25 May 1945, he wrote to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], asserting that he had always been a secret ally of Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=231\u2013238}}\n\nNow hoping for support from the United States, Mihailovi\u0107 met a small British mission between the Neretva river and Dubrovnik, but realized that it wasn't the signal of the hoped-for landing. McDowell was evacuated on 1 November and was instructed to offer Mihailovi\u0107 the opportunity to leave with him. Mihailovi\u0107 refused, as he wanted to remain until the expected change of Western Allied policy.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=254}} During the next weeks, the British government also raised the possibility of evacuating Mihailovi\u0107 by arranging a \"rescue and honorable detention\", and discussed the matter with the United States. In the end, no action was taken.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=280\u2013282}} With their main forces in eastern Bosnia, the Chetniks under Mihailovi\u0107's personal command in the late months of 1944 continued to collaborate with Germans. Colonel Borota and ''vojvoda'' Jev\u0111evi\u0107 maintained contacts with Germans for the whole group.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=433}} In January 1945, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to regroup his forces on the [[Ozren (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ozren]] heights, planning Muslim, Croatian and Slovenian units. His troops were, however, decimated and worn out, some selling their weapons and ammunition, or pillaging the local population. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 joined Mihailovi\u0107, with his own depleted forces, and found out that Mihailovi\u0107 had no plan.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=440}} \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 went his own way, and was killed on 12 April in a battle with the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=254\u2013256}}\n\nOn 17 March 1945, Mihailovi\u0107 was visited in Bosnia by German emissary St\u00e4rker, who requested that Mihailovi\u0107 transmit to the Allied headquarters in Italy a secret German offer of capitulation. Mihailovi\u0107 transmitted the message, which was to be his last.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=306\u2013307}} Ljoti\u0107 and several independent Chetnik leaders in [[Istria]] proposed the forming of a common anti-communist front in the north-western coast, which could be acceptable to the Western Allies. Mihailovi\u0107 was not in favour of such a heterogeneous gathering, but did not reject Ljoti\u0107's proposal entirely, since the littoral area would be a convenient place to meet the Western Allies, and to join Slovene anti-communists, while Germany's collapse might make an anti-communist alliance possible. He authorized the departure of all who wanted to go, but few Chetniks ultimately arrived on the coast, with many being decimated on their way by Usta\u0161e, Partisans, sickness and hunger.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=256\u2013258}} On 13 April, Mihailovi\u0107 set out for northern Bosnia, on a 280&nbsp;km-long march back to Serbia, aiming to start over a resistance movement, this time against the communists. His units were decimated by clashes with the Usta\u0161e and Partisans, as well as dissension and [[typhus]]. On 10 May, they were attacked and defeated by [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), the successor to the Partisans, in [[battle of Zelengora]]. Mihailovi\u0107 managed to escape with 1,000\u20132,000 men, who gradually dispersed. Mihailovi\u0107 himself went into hiding in the mountains with a handful of men.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=266\u2013267}}\n\n==Capture, trial and execution==\n\n{{Main|Trial of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107}}\n\n[[File:Dra\u017ea pred sudom.jpg|thumbnail|Mihailovi\u0107's trial]]\n\nThe Yugoslav authorities wanted to catch Mihailovi\u0107 alive in order to stage a full-scale trial.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=267}} He was finally caught on 13 March 1946.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=307}} The elaborate circumstances of his capture were kept secret for sixteen years. According to one existing version, Mihailovi\u0107 was approached by men who were supposedly British agents offering him help and an evacuation by aeroplane. After hesitating, he boarded the aeroplane, only to discover that it was a trap set up by the [[Department for the Protection of the People|OZNA]]. Another version, proposed by the Yugoslav government, is that he was betrayed by Nikola Kalabi\u0107, who revealed his place of hiding in exchange for leniency.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=250\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Ravnagora spomenik1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Monument to General Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 on [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]], Serbia.]]\n\nThe [[trial of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] opened on 10 June 1946. His co-defendants were other prominent figures of the Chetnik movement as well as members of the Yugoslav government-in-exile, such as [[Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107]], who were tried in absentia, but also members of [[ZBOR]] and of the [[Nedi\u0107 regime]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=262}} The main prosecutor was [[Milo\u0161 Mini\u0107]], later Minister of Foreign Affairs in the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] government. The Allied airmen he had rescued in 1944 were not allowed to testify in his favour.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=260\u2013262}} Mihailovi\u0107 evaded several questions by accusing some of his subordinates of incompetence and disregard of his orders. The trial shows, according to Jozo Tomasevich, that he never had firm and full control over his local commanders.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=462\u2013463}} A ''Committee for the Fair Trial of General Mihailovi\u0107'' was set up in the United States, but to no avail. Mihailovi\u0107 is quoted as saying, in his final statement, \"I wanted much; I began much; but the gale of the world carried away me and my work.\"{{sfn|''Time''|7 October 1957}}\n\nRoberts considers that the trial was \"anything but a model of justice\" and that \"it is clear that Mihailovi\u0107 was not guilty of all, or even many, of the charges brought against him\" though Tito would probably not have had a fair trial either, had Mihailovi\u0107 prevailed. Mihailovi\u0107 was convicted of [[high treason]] and [[war crimes]], and was executed on 17 July 1946.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=307}} He was executed together with nine other officers in Lisi\u010diji Potok, about 200 meters from the former Royal Palace.

Tomasevich suggests one main cause of his defeat was his failure to grow professionally, politically or ideologically as his responsibilities increased, rendering him unable to face both the exceptional circumstances of the war and the complex situation of the Chetniks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p={{page needed|date=September 2012}}}} Tomasevich also criticizes Mihailovi\u0107's loss of the Allied support through Chetnik collaboration with the Axis, as well as his doctrine of \"passive resistance\" which was perceived as idleness, stating \"of generalship in the general there was precious little.\"{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=470}} Pavlowitch also points to Mihailovi\u0107's failure to grow and evolve during the conflict and describes him as a man \"generally out of his depth\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=279}} Roberts asserts that Mihailovi\u0107's policies were \"basically static\", that he \"gambled all in the faith of an Allied victory,\" and that ultimately he was unable to control the Chetniks, who, \"although hostile to the Germans and the Italians&nbsp;... allowed themselves to drift into a policy of accommodations with both in the face of what they considered the greatest danger.\"{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=322}}\n\nPolitical views of Mihailovi\u0107 cover a wide range. After the war, Mihailovi\u0107's wartime role was viewed in the light of his movement's collaboration, particularly in Yugoslavia where he was considered a collaborator convicted of high treason. Charles de Gaulle considered Mihailovi\u0107 a \"pure hero\" and always refused to have personal meetings with Tito, whom he considered as Mihailovi\u0107's \"murderer\".{{sfn|Peyrefitte|1997|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Lutard-Tavard|2005|p=78}} During the war, Churchill believed intelligence reports had shown that Mihailovi\u0107 had engaged \"...&nbsp;in active collaboration with the Germans\".{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=409\u2013415}} He observed that, under the pressure of German reprisals in 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 \"drifted gradually into a posture where some of his commanders made accommodations with German and Italian troops to be left alone in certain mountain areas in return for doing little or nothing against the enemy\", but concluded that \"those who have triumphantly withstood such strains may brand his [Mihailovi\u0107's] name, but history, more discriminating, should not erase it from the scroll of Serbian patriots.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=408\u2013409}} In the United States, due to the efforts of Major Richard L. Felman and his friends, President Truman, on the recommendation of Eisenhower, posthumously awarded Mihailovi\u0107 the Legion of Merit for the rescue of American airmen by the Chetniks. The award and the story of the rescue was classified secret by the State Department so as not to offend the Yugoslav government.\n\n: ''\"The unparalleled rescue of over 500 American Airmen from capture by the Enemy Occupation Forces in Yugoslavia during World War II by General Dragoljub Mihailovich and his Chetnik Freedom Fighters for which this \"Legion of Merit\" medal was awarded by President Harry S. Truman, also represents a token of deep personal appreciation and respect by all those rescued American Airmen and their descendants, who will be forever grateful.\"'' (NATIONAL COMMITTEE OF AMERICAN AIRMEN RESCUED BY GENERAL Mihailovi\u0107H&nbsp;\u2013 1985)\n\n[[Maximilian von Weichs|Generalfeldmarschall von Weichs]], German commander-in-chief south east 1943\u20131945, in his interrogation statement in October 1945, wrote about Mihailovi\u0107 and his forces in section named \"Groups Aiding Germany\":\n: ''\"MIHAILOVIC 's troops once fought against our occupation troops out of loyalty to their King. At the same time they fought against TITO, because of anti\u2014Communist convictions. This two front war could not last long, particularly when British support favored TITO. Consequently MIHAILOVIC showed pro-German leanings. There were engagements during which Serbian Chetniks fought TITO alongside German troops. On the other hand, hostile Chetnik groups were known to attack German supply trains in order to replenish their own stocks.\"''\n: ''\"MIHAILOVIC liked to remain in the background, and leave such affairs up to his subordinates. He hoped to bide his time with this play of power until an Anglo\u2014American landing would provide sufficient support against TITO. Germany welcomed his support, however temporary. Chetnik reconnaissance activities were valued highly by our commanders.\"''{{sfn|von Weichs|1945|p=22}}\n\nAlmost sixty years after his death, on 29 March 2005, Mihailovi\u0107's daughter, Gordana, was presented with the posthumous decoration by president [[George W. Bush]].{{sfn|Hoare|2005}} The decision was controversial; in [[Croatia]] Zoran Pusi\u0107, head of the Civil Committee for Human Rights, protested against the decision and stated that Mihailovi\u0107 was directly responsible for the war crimes committed by the Chetniks.{{sfn|Balkan News|2005}}{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}}\n\nWith the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and the renewal of ethnic nationalism, the historical perception of Mihailovi\u0107's collaboration has been challenged by parts of the public in [[Serbia]] and other ethnic Serb-populated regions of the former Yugoslavia. In the 1980s, political and economic problems within Yugoslavia undermined faith in the communist regime, and historians in Serbia began a re-evaluation of Serbian historiography and proposed the rehabilitation of Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetniks.{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}} In the 1990s, during the [[Yugoslav Wars]], several Serbian nationalist groups began calling themselves \"Chetniks\", while Serb paramilitaries often self-identified with them and were referred to as such.{{sfn|Cathcart|1994}} [[Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj]]'s [[Serbian Radical Party]] formed the [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]], a paramilitary group considered responsible for war crimes and ethnic cleansing, which identified with the Chetniks.{{sfn|Allen|1996|p={{page needed|date=September 2012}}}}{{sfn|Bassiouni|1994}} [[Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107]]'s Serbian Renewal Movement was closely associated with the [[Serbian Guard]], which was also associated with Chetniks and monarchism.{{sfn|Glas javnosti|1999}} Reunions of Chetnik survivors and nostalgics and of Mihailovi\u0107 admirers have been held in Serbia{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=9\u201310}} By the late 20th and early 21st century, Serbian history textbooks and academic works characterized Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetniks as \"fighters for a just cause\", and Chetnik massacres of civilians and commission of war crimes were ignored or barely mentioned.{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}} In 2004, Mihailovi\u0107 was officially rehabilitated in Serbia by an act of the Serbian Parliament.{{sfn|Cviji\u0107|2010}} In a 2009 survey carried out in Serbia, 34.44 percent of respondents favored annulling the 1946 verdict against Mihailovi\u0107 (in which he was found to be a traitor and Axis collaborator), 15.92 percent opposed, and 49.64 percent stated they did not know what to think.{{sfn|Ramet|2011|p=2}}\n\nThe revised image of Mihailovi\u0107 is not shared in non-Serbian post-Yugoslav nations. In Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] analogies are drawn between war crimes committed during World War II and those of the Yugoslav Wars, and Mihailovi\u0107 is \"seen as a war criminal responsible for ethnic cleansing and genocidal massacres.\"{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}} The differences were illustrated in 2004, when a Serbian basketball player, Milan Gurovi\u0107, who has a tattoo of Mihailovi\u0107 on his left arm, was banned by the Croatian Ministry of the Interior Zlatko Mehun from traveling to Croatia for refusing to cover the tattoo, as its display was deemed equivalent to \"provoking hatred or violence because of racial background, national identity or religious affiliation.\"{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}}{{sfn|MSNBC|2004}} Serbian press and politicians reacted to the ban with surprise and indignation, while in Croatia the decision was seen as \"wise and a means of protecting the player himself against his own stupidity.\"{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}} In 2009, a Serb group based in Chicago offered a reward of $100,000.00 for help finding Mihailovi\u0107's grave.{{sfn|Meyer|2009}} A commission formed by the Serbian government began an investigation and in 2010 suggested Mihailovi\u0107 may have been interred at [[Ada Ciganlija]].{{sfn|Cviji\u0107|2010}}\n\n{{quote|General Dragoljub Mihailovich distinguished himself in an outstanding manner as Commander-in-Chief of the Yugoslavian Army Forces and later as Minister of War by organizing and leading important resistance forces against the enemy which occupied Yugoslavia, from December 1941 to December 1944.
