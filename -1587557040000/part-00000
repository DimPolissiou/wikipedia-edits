In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nCommonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.\n[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nAnimation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], television series, animated GIF's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s and [[visual effects]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136519550}}</ref>\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics \u2013 in for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows \u2013 can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].\n\n[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"anim\u0101ti\u014dn\", stem of \"anim\u0101ti\u014d\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}</ref> The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of animation}}\n\n===Before cinematography===\nAlthough examples of sequential images can be found occasionally throughout the history of art, there is no evidence of any related technology that enabled the artists to view such series in motion before 1832. Other ways to create moving images, by manipulating figures by hand or with mechanics, can be recognized in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and (since around 1659) the [[magic lantern]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky & Vieweg in 1833.]]\nIn 1833, the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877), Muybridge's [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879) and [[cinematography]].\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nA few years before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895, [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]] had much success with his ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. These animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song, and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]] in Paris\n\n===Silent era===\nA few years after film became a popular medium, some manufacturers of optical toys produced many [[chromolithography]] film loops for adapted toy magic lanterns. These lanterns usually depicted images traced from live-action film footage. At a time when hardly any animations could be seen in theaters, kids would project these animation loops at home.\n \nSome early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with [[stop-motion]] animation, possibly since around 1899, or, more likely, since 1906. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves. The short film inspired other filmmakers to try the technique.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton's ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) is usually regarded as the first animated film on [[standard picture film]] shown in theatres. It was partly animated on a chalkboard and partly with cut-outs.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].\n\nGreat artistic and very influential animations were made by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914). Gertie was also an early example of character development in drawn animation{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}} and featured a scene with a live-action recording of McCay interacting with Gertie in a drawn landscape.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"[[cartoons]]\" became an industry.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nIn 1919, the silent animated short ''[[Feline Follies]]'' marked the debut of [[Felix the Cat]], becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length silhouette animation ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\n\n===1928-1960s: Golden age of American animation===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (licensed by King Feature Syndicate) (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (licensed by DC Comics) (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]: [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).\n\n===Animated features before CGI===\nIn 1937, [[Walt Disney Studios]] premiered their first-ever animated feature, [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]], still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features as of June 2014.<ref name=\"snowwhite1\">* Total prior to 50th anniversary reissue: {{cite news |last=Culhane |first=John |title='Snow White' At 50: Undimmed Magic |date=July 12, 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=By now, it has grossed about $330&nbsp;million worldwide - so it remains one of the most popular films ever made. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604200704/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |archive-date=June 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"snowwhite2\">* 1987 and 1993 grosses from North America: {{cite web |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \u2013 Releases |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=snowwhite.htm |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=1987 release \u2013 $46,594,212; 1993 release \u2013 $41,634,471 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529094807/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=snowwhite.htm |archive-date=May 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. He produced 8 theatrically released animated features aimed at adult audiences from 1972 to 1982. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.\n\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries (further) developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and, despite a decline afterwards, reached 1,582 titles in 2018. Also China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France and Belgium have animation industries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].\n\n===Animation on television===\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most wealthy countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960-1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series), ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981-1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a \"renaissance\" of American animation.\n\nWhile American animation also experienced international successes, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, often preferring [[stop-motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable traditional animation relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, with hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973-1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken M\u00e4nner/\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 \u30d3\u30c3\u30b1 (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974) and  ''[[Once Upon a Time...|Il \u00e9tait une fois\u2026 (Once Upon a Time...)]]'' (France/Japan 1978).\n\n===Switch from cel animation to computer animation===\n{{main|History of computer animation}}\n\n[[Computer animation]] was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976).\n\n''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.<ref name=\"first digital guinness\">{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film/ |title=First fully digital feature film |work=Guinness World Records |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |accessdate=2018-12-27 }}</ref> It was created with the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS) developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in collaboration with [[Pixar]] in the late 1980s, in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation.\n\nThe 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first computer animated feature in this style. \n\nMost of the traditional animation film studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance. Most of the characteristics of traditional handmade animation that were deemed charming could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs & Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|accessdate=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&rpctoken=342270562&_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and 2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early-2020s.\n\n==Education, propaganda and commercials==\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. It has therefore been widely for other purposed than mere entertainment.\n\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts. \n\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] \"[[Kills Bugs Dead]]\" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Spin-off enterprises: other media, merchandise and theme parks==\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.   \n\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen, original animated characters also commonly appear in  comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from movies and vice versa.\n\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\n\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey_Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey_Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\n\n[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products#Disney_resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The_Walt_Disney_Company#Financial_data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''Flowers and Trees'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84\u201385}} [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]\n\nSeveral other countries have instituted an award for best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].\n\nThe [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar & DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joy &amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|Joy &amp; Heron - A featured video]]\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor-intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}\n\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. {{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}\n\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}\n\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n=== Traditional animation ===\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]\n\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\n\n==== Full animation ====\n'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194\u201395}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros.

Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).\n\n==== Live-action/animation ====\n\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n\n'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}}. Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice comedies]]'' (1923-1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).\n\n=== Stop motion animation ===\n{{Main|Stop motion}}\n\n'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}\n* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155\u201356}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005\u2013present).\n** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]\n* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150\u2013151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151\u201354}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes.

manipulated to appear as moving images. In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nCommonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.\n[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nAnimation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], television series, animated GIF's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s and [[visual effects]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136519550}}</ref>\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics \u2013 in for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows \u2013 can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].\n\n[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"anim\u0101ti\u014dn\", stem of \"anim\u0101ti\u014d\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}</ref> The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of animation}}\n\n===Before cinematography===\nAlthough examples of sequential images can be found occasionally throughout the history of art, there is no evidence of any related technology that enabled the artists to view such series in motion before 1832. Other ways to create moving images, by manipulating figures by hand or with mechanics, can be recognized in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and (since around 1659) the [[magic lantern]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky & Vieweg in 1833.]]\nIn 1833, the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877), Muybridge's [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879) and [[cinematography]].\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nA few years before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895, [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]] had much success with his ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. These animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song, and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]] in Paris\n\n===Silent era===\nA few years after film became a popular medium, some manufacturers of optical toys produced many [[chromolithography]] film loops for adapted toy magic lanterns. These lanterns usually depicted images traced from live-action film footage. At a time when hardly any animations could be seen in theaters, kids would project these animation loops at home.\n \nSome early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with [[stop-motion]] animation, possibly since around 1899, or, more likely, since 1906. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves. The short film inspired other filmmakers to try the technique.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton's ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) is usually regarded as the first animated film on [[standard picture film]] shown in theatres. It was partly animated on a chalkboard and partly with cut-outs.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].\n\nGreat artistic and very influential animations were made by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914). Gertie was also an early example of character development in drawn animation{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}} and featured a scene with a live-action recording of McCay interacting with Gertie in a drawn landscape.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"[[cartoons]]\" became an industry.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nIn 1919, the silent animated short ''[[Feline Follies]]'' marked the debut of [[Felix the Cat]], becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length silhouette animation ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\n\n===1928-1960s: Golden age of American animation===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (licensed by King Feature Syndicate) (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (licensed by DC Comics) (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]: [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).\n\n===Animated features before CGI===\nIn 1937, [[Walt Disney Studios]] premiered their first-ever animated feature, [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]], still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features as of June 2014.<ref name=\"snowwhite1\">* Total prior to 50th anniversary reissue: {{cite news |last=Culhane |first=John |title='Snow White' At 50: Undimmed Magic |date=July 12, 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=By now, it has grossed about $330&nbsp;million worldwide - so it remains one of the most popular films ever made. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604200704/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |archive-date=June 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"snowwhite2\">* 1987 and 1993 grosses from North America: {{cite web |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \u2013 Releases |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=snowwhite.htm |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=1987 release \u2013 $46,594,212; 1993 release \u2013 $41,634,471 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529094807/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=snowwhite.htm |archive-date=May 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. He produced 8 theatrically released animated features aimed at adult audiences from 1972 to 1982. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.\n\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries (further) developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and, despite a decline afterwards, reached 1,582 titles in 2018. Also China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France and Belgium have animation industries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].\n\n===Animation on television===\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most wealthy countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960-1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series), ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981-1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a \"renaissance\" of American animation.\n\nWhile American animation also experienced international successes, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, often preferring [[stop-motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable traditional animation relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, with hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973-1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken M\u00e4nner/\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 \u30d3\u30c3\u30b1 (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974) and  ''[[Once Upon a Time...|Il \u00e9tait une fois\u2026 (Once Upon a Time...)]]'' (France/Japan 1978).\n\n===Switch from cel animation to computer animation===\n{{main|History of computer animation}}\n\n[[Computer animation]] was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976).\n\n''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.<ref name=\"first digital guinness\">{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film/ |title=First fully digital feature film |work=Guinness World Records |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |accessdate=2018-12-27 }}</ref> It was created with the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS) developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in collaboration with [[Pixar]] in the late 1980s, in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation.\n\nThe 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first computer animated feature in this style. \n\nMost of the traditional animation film studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance. Most of the characteristics of traditional handmade animation that were deemed charming could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs & Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|accessdate=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&rpctoken=342270562&_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and 2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early-2020s.\n\n==Education, propaganda and commercials==\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. It has therefore been widely for other purposed than mere entertainment.\n\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts. \n\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] \"[[Kills Bugs Dead]]\" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Spin-off enterprises: other media, merchandise and theme parks==\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.   \n\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen, original animated characters also commonly appear in  comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from movies and vice versa.\n\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\n\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey_Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey_Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\n\n[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products#Disney_resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The_Walt_Disney_Company#Financial_data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''Flowers and Trees'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84\u201385}} [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]\n\nSeveral other countries have instituted an award for best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].\n\nThe [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar & DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joy &amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|Joy &amp; Heron - A featured video]]\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor-intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}\n\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. {{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}\n\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}\n\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n=== Traditional animation ===\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]\n\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010).

Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).\n\n==== Live-action/animation ====\n\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n\n'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}}.

{"title_page": "Feminist performance art", "text_new": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\nAccording to scholar Virginia Mackenny, [[performance art]] is a great tool to mold and remold gender because performance art, in most instances, includes a direct subversion to everyday conventions. MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n== [[Frida Kahlo]] ==\nFrida Kahlo's work as an artist remained relatively unknown until the late 1970s to most people outside of Mexico and Latin America, when her work was rediscovered by art historians and political activists she, her art, and her role as a performance artist was brought to the forefront of the art world. In the early 1990s, Kahlo had become a recognized figure in art history, but also regarded as an icon for [[Chicano Movement|Chicana/os]], the [[Latinx]]<nowiki/>community, the [[feminism]]<nowiki/>movement, and the [[LGBTQ+]]<nowiki/>movement. Kahlo's work is celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican nationalism and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]]<nowiki/>traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broude|first=Norma|url=http://archive.org/details/expandingdiscour00norm|title=The Expanding discourse : feminism and art history|last2=Garrard|first2=Mary D.|date=1992|publisher=New York, NY : IconEditions|others=Internet Archive}}</ref> While she is definitely Mexican, Kahlo is regarded as an icon for Chicana/os who recognize themselves as the hyphen in the middle of the label of Mexican - American. Her depictions of being a person limited by her realities are expressed in her surreal style, which appeal to a broad audience of people from many walks of life.\n\nAlthough [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], a [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artist, regarded her primarily as a 'feminista' within the Surrealist movement, Kahlo brought postcolonial issues to the forefront of her brand of Surrealism<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418093138/https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/107983/content/JSA_VOL5_NO1_Pages33-54_Mahon.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2018-04-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>. Her understanding and visions of being, living with the disabilities she suffered from a trolley accident in her younger years resonate with those also afflicted with disabilities. Her portrayal of herself as a person of color, living the realities of a person limited by her gender, disabilities and a dissident politico made her appealing to an audience previously absent to the art scene. Her art raised the questions of identity. What was it to be a Mexican? \u2013 modern, yet pre-Columbian; young, yet old; anti-Catholic yet Catholic; Western, yet New World; developing, yet underdeveloped; independent, yet colonized; ''mestizo'', yet not Spanish nor Indian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809095503/https://www.gen2.ca/DBHS/Art/3346753.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|last=Bakewell 1993, pg. 169|first=|date=2017-08-09|website=web.archive.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n[[File:Las Dos Fridas.jpg|thumb|The Two Fridas, 1939]]\nOriana Baddeley has written that Kahlo has become a signifier of non-conformity and \"the archetype of a cultural minority,\" who is regarded simultaneously as \"a victim, crippled and abused\" and as \"a survivor who fights back.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baddeley|first=St. Clair|date=1897-01-16|title=Waterspout and Whirlwind|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nq/s8-xi.264.47a|journal=Notes and Queries|volume=s8-XI|issue=264|pages=47\u201347|doi=10.1093/nq/s8-xi.264.47a|issn=1471-6941}}</ref> Edward Sullivan stated that Kahlo is hailed as a hero by so many because she is \"someone to validate their own struggle to find their own voice and their own public personalities\".<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2004|editor-last=Kauffman|editor-first=Kyle D.|editor2-last=Lindauer|editor2-first=David L.|title=AIDS and South Africa|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230523517|doi=10.1057/9780230523517}}</ref> According to [[John Berger]], Kahlo's popularity is partly due to the fact that \"the sharing of pain is one of the essential preconditions for a refinding of dignity and hope\" in twenty-first century society.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brock\u2010Servais|first=Rhonda|date=2001|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1010417217654|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=32|issue=3|pages=155\u2013165|doi=10.1023/a:1010417217654|issn=0045-6713}}</ref> She did not use them only to show her subjective experience but to raise questions about Mexican society and the construction of identity within it, particularly gender, race, and social class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809095503/https://www.gen2.ca/DBHS/Art/3346753.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|last=Bakewell 1993 pg. 168-170|first=|date=2017-08-09|website=web.archive.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Frida has become almost saint like to many and a symbol, a feeling to people who like her, have experienced questioning their identity, their place in a society that does not accept difference readily. Her paintings evoke a sense pride in being of Mexican heritage for many and an acceptance for those who have struggled in life.   \n\n\n==[[Yoko Ono]]==\n\n=== Overview ===\nOno belonged to a generation of early feminist performance artists but is unique among them for her international fame as [[John Lennon]]\u2019s wife in the late 60s and 70s.  During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. On her exterior, she had a large photo of a torso on her chest. This was turned into a slot machine, where the audience could put a coin down the slot and watch it descend into the groin. As a reward, that audience member were given a kiss. She also displayed her sexual organs during menstruation under a magnifying glass for respective audience members to study. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Donger|first=Simon|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XoXFBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=orlan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyw_Da7snoAhVxlFwKHZmmAdsQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=orlan&f=false|title=ORLAN: A Hybrid Body of Artworks|last2=Shepherd|first2=Simon|date=2010-05-20|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-97128-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir ==\nThe musical artist Bj\u00f6rk has been challenging musical barriers since her time in the band [[The Sugarcubes]], which became the biggest alternative rock band in Iceland.

The album was developed into an iPad and iPod app that allowed users to listen to each song while playing games that visually showcased the music.

Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n== [[Frida Kahlo]] ==\nFrida Kahlo's work as an artist remained relatively unknown until the late 1970s to most people outside of Mexico and Latin America, when her work was rediscovered by art historians and political activists she, her art, and her role as a performance artist was brought to the forefront of the art world. In the early 1990s, Kahlo had become a recognized figure in art history, but also regarded as an icon for [[Chicano Movement|Chicana/os]], the [[Latinx]]<nowiki/>community, the [[feminism]]<nowiki/>movement, and the [[LGBTQ+]]<nowiki/>movement. Kahlo's work is celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican nationalism and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]]<nowiki/>traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Broude|first=Norma|url=http://archive.org/details/expandingdiscour00norm|title=The Expanding discourse : feminism and art history|last2=Garrard|first2=Mary D.|date=1992|publisher=New York, NY : IconEditions|others=Internet Archive}}</ref> While she is definitely Mexican, Kahlo is regarded as an icon for Chicana/os who recognize themselves as the hyphen in the middle of the label of Mexican - American. Her depictions of being a person limited by her realities are expressed in her surreal style, which appeal to a broad audience of people from many walks of life.\n\nAlthough [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], a [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artist, regarded her primarily as a 'feminista' within the Surrealist movement, Kahlo brought postcolonial issues to the forefront of her brand of Surrealism<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418093138/https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/107983/content/JSA_VOL5_NO1_Pages33-54_Mahon.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2018-04-18|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>. Her understanding and visions of being, living with the disabilities she suffered from a trolley accident in her younger years resonate with those also afflicted with disabilities. Her portrayal of herself as a person of color, living the realities of a person limited by her gender, disabilities and a dissident politico made her appealing to an audience previously absent to the art scene. Her art raised the questions of identity.

During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. On her exterior, she had a large photo of a torso on her chest. This was turned into a slot machine, where the audience could put a coin down the slot and watch it descend into the groin. As a reward, that audience member were given a kiss.

His armed forces were in occupation of the country, and the communists were in control of its administration. The [[Soviet Union]] was in the process of incorporating the lands to the east of the [[Curzon Line]], which it had [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded and occupied between 1939 and 1941]].\n\nIn compensation, the USSR gave Poland former German populated territories in [[Pomerania]], [[Silesia]], and [[Brandenburg]] east of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], plus the southern half of [[East Prussia]]. These awards were confirmed at the Tripartite Conference of Berlin, otherwise known as the [[Potsdam Conference]] in August 1945 after the end of the war in Europe. Stalin was determined that Poland's new government would become his tool towards making Poland a Soviet puppet state controlled by the communists. He had severed relations with the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London in 1943, but to appease Roosevelt and Churchill he agreed at Yalta that a coalition government would be formed. The communists held a majority of key posts in this new government, and with Soviet support they soon gained almost total control of the country, rigging all elections.\n\nIn June 1946, the \"[[Three Times Yes]]\" referendum was held on a number of issues\u2014abolition of the [[Senate of Poland]], land reform, and making the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] Poland's western border. The communist-controlled Interior Ministry issued results showing that all three questions passed overwhelmingly. Years later, however, evidence was uncovered showing that the referendum had been tainted by massive fraud, and only the third question actually passed.<ref>Czes\u0142aw Os\u0119kowski ''Referendum 30 czerwca 1946 roku w Polsce'', Wydawnictwo Sejmowe, 2000, {{ISBN|83-7059-459-X}}</ref>  [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] then took advantage of a split in the [[Polish Socialist Party]].  One faction, which included [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], wanted to join forces with the Peasant Party and form a united front against the Communists. Another faction, led by [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]], argued that the Socialists should support the Communists in carrying through a socialist program, while opposing the imposition of one-party rule. Pre-war political hostilities continued to influence events, and [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] would not agree to form a united front with the Socialists. The Communists played on these divisions by dismissing Os\u00f3bka-Morawski and making Cyrankiewicz Prime Minister.\n\nBetween the referendum and the [[1947 Polish legislative election|January 1947 general elections]], the opposition was subjected to persecution.  Only the candidates of the pro-government \"Democratic Bloc\" (the PPR, Cyrankiewicz' faction of the PPS, and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]]) were allowed to campaign completely unmolested.  Meanwhile, several opposition candidates were prevented from campaigning at all. Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u201349)|Polish People's Party]] (PSL) in particular suffered persecution; it had opposed the abolition of the Senate as a test of strength against the government.  Although it supported the other two questions, the Communist-dominated government branded the PSL \"traitors\".  This massive oppression was overseen by Gomu\u0142ka and the provisional president, [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]].\n\n[[File:Westverschiebung.Polens.gif|thumb|left|Border changes of Poland after [[World War II]]. The eastern territories (''[[Kresy]]'') were annexed by the Soviets. The western so-called \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" were granted as war reparations. Despite the western lands being more industrialized, Poland lost 77,035 km<sup>2</sup> (29,743 sq mi) and major cities like [[Lviv]] and [[Vilnius]].]]\n\nThe official results of the election showed the Democratic Bloc with 80.1 percent of the vote.  The Democratic Bloc was awarded 394 seats to only 28 for the PSL. Miko\u0142ajczyk immediately resigned to protest this so-called 'implausible result', and fled to the United Kingdom in April rather than face arrest.  Later, some historians announced that the official results were only obtained through massive fraud.  Government officials didn't even count the real votes in many areas, and simply filled in the relevant documents in accordance with instructions from the Communists.  In other areas, the ballot boxes were either destroyed or replaced with boxes containing prefilled ballots.\n\nThe 1947 election marked the beginning of undisguised Communist rule in Poland, though it was not officially transformed into the Polish People's Republic until the adoption of the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|1952 Constitution]].  However, Gomu\u0142ka never supported Stalin's control over the Polish Communists, and was soon replaced as party leader by the more pliable Bierut.  In 1948, the Communists consolidated their power, merging with Cyrankiewicz' faction of the PPS to form the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (known in Poland as 'the Party'), which would monopolise political power in Poland until 1989. In 1949, Polish-born Soviet Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] became the Minister of National Defence, with the additional title [[Marshal of Poland]], and in 1952 he became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers (deputy premier).\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = 3xtak.jpg\n | caption1 = A propaganda poster enhancing to vote for Communist policies in the \"[[Three Times Yes]]\" 1946 referendum\n | image2 = Konstytucja PRL draft with Stalin remarks.jpg\n | caption2 = Draft of [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]] (Russian version) with Stalin's remarks, 1952\n}}\n\nOver the coming years, private industry was [[nationalisation|nationalised]], the land seized from the pre-war landowners and redistributed to the lower-class farmers, and millions of Poles were transferred from the lost eastern territories to the lands acquired from Germany. Poland was now to be brought into line with the Soviet model of a \"people's democracy\" and a centrally planned socialist economy. The government also embarked on the [[collectivisation]] of agriculture, although the pace was slower than in other satellites: Poland remained the only Eastern Bloc country where individual farmers dominated agriculture.\n\nThrough a careful balance of agreement, compromise and resistance \u2014 and having signed an agreement of coexistence with the communist regime \u2014 [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[primate (bishop)|primate]] [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] maintained and even strengthened the Polish church through a series of failed government leaders.

In June, workers in the industrial city of [[Pozna\u0144]] went on strike, in what became known as [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]]. Voices began to be raised in the Party and among the intellectuals calling for wider reforms of the Stalinist system. Eventually, power shifted towards Gomu\u0142ka, who replaced Ochab as party leader. Hardline Stalinists were removed from power and many Soviet officers serving in the [[Polish Army]] were dismissed. This marked the end of the Stalinist era.\n\n=== 1970s and 1980s ===\n[[File:Polish 1970 protests - Zbyszek Godlewski body.jpg|thumb|left|The [[1970 Polish protests]] were ruthlessly crushed by the Communist authorities and [[Milicja Obywatelska|Citizens' Militia]]. The riots resulted in the deaths of 42 people and over 1,000 injured.]]\nIn 1970, Gomu\u0142ka's government had decided to adopt massive increases in the prices of basic goods, including food. The resulting widespread [[Polish 1970 protests|violent protests]] in December that same year resulted in a number of deaths. They also forced another major change in the government, as Gomu\u0142ka was replaced by [[Edward Gierek]] as the new First Secretary. Gierek's plan for recovery was centered on massive borrowing, mainly from the United States and [[West Germany]], to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers some incentive to work. While it boosted the Polish economy, and is still remembered as the \"Golden Age\" of socialist Poland, it left the country vulnerable to global economic fluctuations and western undermining, and the repercussions in the form of massive debt is still felt in Poland even today. This Golden Age came to an end after the [[1973 energy crisis]]. The failure of the Gierek government, both economically and politically, soon led to the creation of opposition in the form of [[trade union]]s, student groups, clandestine newspapers and publishers, imported books and newspapers, and even a \"flying university.\"\n\n[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|250px|Queues waiting to enter state-run grocery stores in Warsaw and other Polish cities and towns were a typical sight in the 1950s and 1980s. The availability of food and goods varied at times, and the most sought after basic item was toilet paper.]]\n\nOn 16 October 1978, the [[Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Karol Wojty\u0142a, was [[Papal conclave, October 1978|elected Pope]], taking the name [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. The election of a Polish Pope had an electrifying effect on what had been, even under Communist rule, one of the most devoutly Catholic nations in Europe. Gierek is alleged to have said to his cabinet, \"O God, what are we going to do now?\" or, as occasionally reported, \"Jesus and Mary, this is the end\". When John Paul II made his first papal tour of Poland in June 1979, half a million people heard him speak in Warsaw; he did not call for rebellion, but instead encouraged the creation of an \"alternative Poland\" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next economic crisis came, the nation would present a united front.\n\nA new wave of labour strikes undermined Gierek's government, and in September Gierek, who was in poor health, was finally removed from office and replaced as Party leader by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]]. However, Kania was unable to find an answer for the fast-eroding support of communism in Poland. Labour turmoil led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') in September 1980, originally led by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]. In fact, Solidarity became a broad [[anti-communist]] social movement ranging from people associated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], to members of the anti-Stalinist left. By the end of 1981, Solidarity had nine million members\u2014a quarter of Poland's population and three times as many as the PUWP had. Kania resigned under Soviet pressure in October and was succeeded by [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who had been Defence minister since 1968 and Premier since February.\n\n[[File:Warszawa 1975 WDC 42783.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The new [[Warszawa Centralna railway station]] in [[Warsaw]] had automatic doors and escalators, an unlikely sight in Communist Poland. It was a flagship project during the 1970s economic boom and was dubbed the most modern station in Europe at the time of its completion in 1975.]]\n\nOn 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski [[martial law in Poland|proclaimed martial law]], suspended Solidarity, and temporarily imprisoned most of its leaders. This sudden crackdown on Solidarity was reportedly out of fear of Soviet intervention (see [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980\u201381]]). The government then disallowed Solidarity on 8 October 1982. Martial law was formally lifted in July 1983, though many heightened controls on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place through the mid-to-late-1980s. Jaruzelski stepped down as prime minister in 1985 and became president (chairman of the Council of State).\n\n[[File:Stakingsleider Lech Walesa deelt handtekeningen uit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] co-founded and headed the [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107|Solidarity movement]] which toppled Communism.

Lenina 07.jpg|thumb|right|The [[History of Solidarity|1980 Gda\u0144sk Shipyard Strike]] and subsequent [[Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland|Summer 1981 Hunger Demonstrations]] were instrumental in strengthening the Solidarity movement's influence.]]\n\nThis did not prevent Solidarity from gaining more support and power. Eventually it eroded the dominance of the PUWP, which in 1981 lost approximately 85,000 of its 3 million members. Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persisted solely as an underground organization, but by the late 1980s was sufficiently strong to frustrate Jaruzelski's attempts at reform, and nationwide [[1988 Polish strikes|strike]]s in 1988 were one of the factors that forced the government to open a dialogue with Solidarity.\n\nFrom 6 February to 15 April 1989, talks of 13 [[working group]]s in 94 sessions, which became known as the \"[[Polish Round Table Agreement|Roundtable Talks]]\" (''Rozmowy Okr\u0105g\u0142ego Sto\u0142u'') saw the PUWP abandon power and radically altered the shape of the country. In June, shortly after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] in China, the [[1989 Polish legislative election]] took place. Much to its own surprise, Solidarity took all contested (35%) seats in the [[Sejm]], the Parliament's lower house, and all but one seat in the fully free elected [[Senate of Poland|Senate]].\n\nSolidarity persuaded the Communists' longtime satellite parties, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] and Democratic Party, to throw their support to Solidarity.  This all but forced Jaruzelski, who had been named president in July, to appoint a Solidarity member as prime minister.  Finally, he appointed a Solidarity-led coalition government with [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] as the country's first non-Communist prime minister since 1948.\n\nOn 10 December 1989, the [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|statue]] of [[Vladimir Lenin]] was removed in [[Warsaw]] by the PRL authorities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Upheaval in the East; Lenin Statue in Mothballs |author=Reuters |date=11 December 1989 |work=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/11/world/upheaval-in-the-east-lenin-statue-in-mothballs.html }}</ref>\n\nThe Parliament amended the Constitution on 29 December 1989 to formally restore democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties. This began the [[Third Polish Republic]], and served as a prelude to the fully democratic elections of [[1991 Polish parliamentary election|1991]]\u2014only the third free election ever held in Poland.\n\nThe PZPR was finally disbanded on 30 January 1990, even if Wa\u0142\u0119sa could be elected as President only eleven months after. The [[Warsaw Pact]] was soon followed on 1 July 1991 and the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991. On 27 October 1991, the [[1991 Polish parliamentary election|first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections]] since the 1920s took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style [[Parliamentary system|liberal democratic political system]]. The last [[Northern Group of Forces|post-Soviet troops]] left Poland on 18 September 1993. After ten years of [[democratic consolidation]], Poland joined [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] in 1996, [[NATO]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004.\n\n== Government and politics ==\n{{see also|Politics of Poland}}\n[[File:POL PZPR logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.60|right|Logo of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]]]]\n\nThe government and politics of the Polish People's Republic were governed by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (''Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza, PZPR''). Despite the presence of two minor parties, the United People's Party and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]], the country was generally reckoned by western nations as a [[one-party state]] because these two parties were supposedly completely subservient to the Communists and had to accept the PZPR's \"leading role\" as a condition of their existence. It was politically influenced by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to the extent of being its [[satellite state|satellite country]], along with [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and other [[Eastern Bloc]] members. \n\nFrom 1952, the highest law was the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]], and the [[Polish Council of State]] replaced the [[president of Poland|presidency of Poland]]. Elections were held on the single lists of the [[Front of National Unity]]. Despite these changes, Poland was one of the most liberal communist nations and was the only communist country in the world which did not have any [[Communist symbolism|socialist symbols]] ([[red star]], stars, ears of [[wheat]] or [[hammer and sickle]]) on its [[Flag of Poland|flag]] and [[coat of arms of Poland|coat of arms]]. The [[Polish White Eagle|White Eagle]] founded by Polish monarchs in the [[Middle Ages]] remained as Poland's national emblem; the only feature removed by the communists from the pre-war design was the crown, which was seen as [[Imperialism|imperialistic]] and [[Monarchy|monarchist]]. \n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{see also|Foreign relations of Poland}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0417-0001-011, Berlin, VII. SED-Parteitag, Er\u00f6ffnung.jpg|thumb|right|[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in [[East Berlin]], 1967]]\nDuring its existence, the Polish People's Republic maintained relations not only with the [[Soviet Union]], but several communist states around the world. It also had friendly relations with the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and the [[Western Bloc]] as well as the [[People's Republic of China]]. At the height of the [[Cold War]], Poland attempted to remain neutral to the conflict between the Soviets and the Americans. In particular, [[Edward Gierek]] sought to establish Poland as a mediator between the two powers in the 1970s. Both the [[U.S. presidents]] and the Soviet [[Soviet leaders|general secretaries]] or leaders visited communist Poland.\n\nUnder pressure from the USSR, Poland participated in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968.\n\nPoland's [[Israel\u2013Poland relations|relations]] with [[Israel]] were on a fair level following the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]]. In 1947, the PRL voted in favour of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], which lead to Israel's recognition by the PRL on 19 May 1948. However, by the [[Six-Day War]], it severed diplomatic relations with Israel in June 1967 and supported the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] which [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|recognized]] the [[State of Palestine]] on 14 December 1988. In 1989, PRL restored relations with Israel.\n\nThe PRL participated as a member of the [[United Nations|UN]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Warsaw Pact]], [[Comecon]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], and [[Interkosmos]].\n\n== Economy ==\n{{further|Economy of Poland|Eastern Bloc economies}}\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Kroscienko PGR 1.jpg|thumb|right|An abandoned [[State Agricultural Farm]] in south-eastern Poland. State farms were a form of [[collective farming]] created in 1949.]]\nPoland suffered tremendous economic losses during World War II. In 1939, Poland had 35.1 million inhabitants, but the census of 14 February 1946 showed only 23.9 million inhabitants. (The difference was partially the result of the border revision.) The losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to 38%. Compared to [[Western Europe]]an nations, including Germany, Poland was still mostly an agrarian country. The implementation of the immense tasks involved with the reconstruction of the country was intertwined with the struggle of the new government for the stabilisation of power, made even more difficult by the fact that a considerable part of society was mistrustful of the communist government. The occupation of Poland by the Red Army and the support the Soviet Union had shown for the Polish communists was decisive in the communists gaining the upper hand in the new Polish government. Poland was under Soviet control, both directly (Red Army, [[NKVD]], deportations to the SU) and indirectly (NKVD created the Polish political police UB).\n\n[[File:Bazylika Archikatedralna w \u0141odzi.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] was Poland's largest city after the destruction of [[Warsaw]] during [[World War II]]. It was also a major industrial centre in Europe and served as the temporary capital due to its economic significance in the 1940s.]]\n\nAs control of the Polish territories passed from occupying forces of [[Nazi Germany]] to the subsequent occupying forces of the [[Soviet Union]], and from the Soviet Union to the Soviet-imposed puppet [[satellite state]], Poland's new [[economic system]] was forcibly imposed and began moving towards a radical, communist [[central planning|centrally planned]] economy. One of the first major steps in that direction involved the [[agricultural reform]] issued by the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] government on 6 September 1944. All estates over 0.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in pre-war Polish territories and all over 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in former German territories were nationalised without compensation. In total, 31,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of land were nationalised in Poland and 5 million in the former German territories, out of which 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> were redistributed to farmers and the rest remained in the hands of the government (Most of this was eventually used in the [[collectivization]] and creation of [[sovkhoz]]-like [[State Agricultural Farm]]s \"PGR\"). However, the collectivization of Polish farming never reached the same extent as it did in the Soviet Union or other countries of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"PWN-Reforma\">Wojciech Roszkowski, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060407135210/http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/62528_1.html  Reforma Rolna] Encyklopedia.PWN.pl (Internet Archive)</ref>\n\n[[File:Ignacy P\u0142a\u017cewski, Prz\u0105dki przy pracy, I-4717-4.jpg|thumb|right|Female [[textile]] workers in a state-run factory, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, 1950s]]\n\n[[Nationalisation]] began in 1944, with the pro-Soviet government taking over industries in the newly acquired territories along with the rest of the country. As nationalization was unpopular, the communists delayed [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic|the nationalization reform]] until 1946, when after the [[3xTAK]] [[referendum]]s they were fairly certain they had total control of the state and could deal a heavy blow to eventual public protests. Some semi-official nationalisation of various private enterprises had begun also in 1944.

However, those were truncated into insignificance by the break-up of Germany into East and West and the onset of the Cold War. Poland was then relegated to receive her share from the Soviet-controlled [[East Germany]]. However, even this was attenuated, as the Soviets pressured the Polish Government to cease receiving the reparations far ahead of schedule as a sign of 'friendship' between the two new communist neighbors and, therefore, now friends.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fHYh1QxFnFwC&pg=PA230&lpg=PA230&dq=working+with+the+enemy+Poland+Soviet+1953 |title=Working for the enemy: Ford, General Motors, and forced labor in Germany during the Second World War |isbn=978-1-84545-013-7 |author1=Billstein |first1=Reinhold |last2=Fings |first2=Karola |last3=Kugler |first3=Anita |last4=Levis |first4=Billstein |date=October 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"Hofhansel\">{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ea-j1w5Z17kC&pg=RA1-PA56&lpg=RA1-PA56&dq=multilateralism+Poland+Soviet+German+reparations+1953 |title=Multilateralism, German foreign policy and Central Europe |isbn=978-0-415-36406-5 |author1=Hofhansel |first1=Claus |year=2005 |format=Google Books, no preview}}&nbsp;{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref> Thus, without the reparations and without the massive [[Marshall Plan]] implemented in the West at that time, Poland's postwar recovery was much harder than it could have been.\n\n=== Later years ===\n[[File:SuperSam Warszawa 1969.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supersam Warsaw]], the first self-serve shopping centre in Poland, 1969]]\nDuring the [[Gierek decade|Gierek era]], Poland borrowed large sums from [[Club de Paris|Western creditors]] in exchange for promise of social and economic reforms.

The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing [[black market]] and the development of a [[shortage economy]].<ref name=\"EKP-Econ\">{{cite book |author=Jackson, John E. |author2=Jacek Klich |author3=Krystyna Poznanska |title=The Political Economy of Poland's Transition: New Firms and Reform Governments |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-83895-9 |pages=21\u2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfptbHVD20UC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&sig=L2ZFypSPKyVA23BrkjLx6UtK\u2013D4 }}</ref> The only way for an individual to buy most Western goods was to use Western currencies, notably the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], which in effect became a parallel currency. However, it could not simply be exchanged at the official banks for Polish [[z\u0142oty]]s, since the government exchange rate undervalued the dollar and placed heavy restrictions on the amount that could be exchanged, and so the only practical way to obtain it was from [[remittances]] or work outside the country. An entire illegal industry of street-corner money changers emerged as a result. The so-called ''Cinkciarze'' gave clients far better than official exchange rate and became wealthy from their opportunism albeit at the risk of punishment, usually diminished by the wide scale bribery of the Militia.<ref name=\"Szama\u0144ska-2008\"/>\n\nAs Western currency came into the country from emigrant families and foreign workers, the government in turn attempted to gather it up by various means, most visibly by establishing a chain of state-run ''[[Pewex]]'' and ''Baltona'' stores in all Polish cities, where goods could only be bought with hard currency. It even introduced its own ''[[ersatz]]'' U.S. currency (''bony PeKaO'' in Polish).<ref name=\"Szama\u0144ska-2008\">{{cite web |url=http://wiedzaiedukacja.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/karolina-szymanska-sklepy-w-prl.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019092744/http://wiedzaiedukacja.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/karolina-szymanska-sklepy-w-prl.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 October 2014 |title=Sklepy w czasach PRL |publisher=Portal Naukowy Wiedza i Edukacja |year=2008 |accessdate=15 October 2014 |author=Karolina Szama\u0144ska |pages=13, 22&ndash;23 / 25 |format=PDF file, direct download }}</ref> This paralleled the financial practices in East Germany running its own [[ration stamp]]s at the same time.<ref name=\"Szama\u0144ska-2008\"/> The trend led to an unhealthy state of affairs where the chief determinant of economic status was access to hard currency. This situation was incompatible with any remaining ideals of socialism, which were soon completely abandoned at the community level.\n\n[[File:Kartki-cukier-77.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ration cards]] for sugar, 1977]]\n\nIn this desperate situation, all development and growth in the Polish economy slowed to a crawl. Most visibly, work on most of the major investment projects that had begun in the 1970s was stopped. As a result, most Polish cities acquired at least one infamous example of a large unfinished building languishing in a state of limbo. While some of these were eventually finished decades later, most, such as the [[Szkieletor]] [[skyscraper]] in Krak\u00f3w, were never finished at all, wasting the considerable resources devoted to their construction. Polish investment in economic infrastructure and technological development fell rapidly, ensuring that the country lost whatever ground it had gained relative to Western European economies in the 1970s. To escape the constant economic and political pressures during these years, and the general sense of hopelessness, many family income providers traveled for work in Western Europe, particularly West Germany (''Wyjazd na saksy'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/saksy|title=saksy \u2013 Wikis\u0142ownik, wolny s\u0142ownik wieloj\u0119zyczny|website=pl.wiktionary.org|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref> During the era, hundreds of thousands of Poles left the country permanently and settled in the West, few of them returning to Poland even after the end of socialism in Poland. Tens of thousands of others went to work in countries that could offer them salaries in hard currency, notably [[Libya]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtaspekte.de/fundstuecke/|title=Building Export from Socialist Poland: On the Traces of a Photograph - Stadtaspekte|date=2 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dairy bar at ulica Wladyslawa IV, Gdynia.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Bar mleczny]]'', a former milk bar in [[Gdynia]]. These [[Cafeteria|canteen]]s offered value meals to citizens throughout Communist Poland.]]\n\nAfter several years of the situation continuing to worsen, during which time the socialist government unsuccessfully tried various expedients to improve the performance of the economy&mdash;at one point resorting to placing military [[commissar]]s to direct work in the factories &mdash; it grudgingly accepted pressures to liberalize the economy. The government introduced a series of small-scale reforms, such as allowing more small-scale private enterprises to function. However, the government also realized that it lacked the legitimacy to carry out any large-scale reforms, which would inevitably cause large-scale social dislocation and economic difficulties for most of the population, accustomed to the extensive [[social safety net]] that the socialist system had provided. For example, when the government proposed to close the [[Gda\u0144sk Shipyard]], a decision in some ways justifiable from an economic point of view but also largely political, there was a wave of public outrage and the government was forced to back down.\n\nThe only way to carry out such changes without social upheaval would be to acquire at least some support from the opposition side. The government accepted the idea that some kind of a deal with the opposition would be necessary, and repeatedly attempted to find common ground throughout the 1980s. However, at this point the communists generally still believed that they should retain the reins of power for the near future, and only allowed the opposition limited, advisory participation in the running of the country. They believed that this would be essential to pacifying the Soviet Union, which they felt was not yet ready to accept a non-Communist Poland.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{main|Culture in the Polish People's Republic}}\n===Television and media===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width1 = 220\n | width2 = 220\n | image1 = Dziennik telewizyjny.jpg\n | alt1 = Dziennik\n | image2 = Dziennik-telewizyjny-Intro.ogg\n | alt2 = Dziennik\n | footer = Opening panel and sequence of ''[[Dziennik Telewizyjny|Dziennik]]'', the chief news program in communist Poland.

Commonly known to the viewers as ''Dziennik'', aired in the years 1958\u20131989 and was utilized by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] as a propaganda tool to control the masses.

The apartment blocks in Poland, commonly known as ''bloki'', were built on East German and Czechoslovak standards, alongside department stores, pavilions and public spaces.

Furthermore, the pre-war system of education was in disarray; many educational facilities were much more accessible in wealthier western and central Poland than in the rural east (Kresy), particularly in the [[Polesie]] region where there was one large school per 100 square kilometers (39 square miles).<ref name=\"auto8\">{{Cite web|url=https://niepodlegla.gov.pl/o-niepodleglej/edukacja-w-ii-rzeczypospolitej/|title=Edukacja w II Rzeczypospolitej|website=Niepodleg\u0142a - stulecie odzyskania niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci}}</ref> Schools were also in desperate need of staff, tutors and teachers before 1939.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> \n\nAfter the [[1947 Polish legislative election]], the communists took full control of the education in the newly-formed Polish People's Republic.

Attendance gradually grew, which put an end to illiteracy in rural areas. The communist government also introduced new beneficial content into the system; sports and [[physical education]] were enforced and students were encouraged to learn foreign languages, especially German, Russian or French and from the 1980s also English. On July 15, 1961, two-year [[vocational education|vocational career training]] was made obligatory to boost the number of skilled labourers and the minimum age of graduation rose to 15. Additionally, special schools were established for deaf, [[muteness|mute]] and blind children. Such institutions for the impaired were almost nonexistent in the Second Polish Republic. During the 1960s, thousands of modern schools were founded. \n\nThe number of universities nearly doubled between 1938 and 1963. Medical, agricultural, economical, engineering and sport faculties became separate colleges, under a universal communist model used in other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Theological]] faculties were deemed unnecessary or potentially dangerous and were therefore removed from state universities. [[Philosophy]] was also seen as superfluous. In order to strengthen the post-war Polish economy, the government created many common-labour faculties across the country, including dairying, fishing, tailoring, chemistry and mechanics to achieve a better economic output alongside efficiency. However, by 1980 the number of graduates from primary and secondary schools was so high that admission quotas for universities were introduced.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{main|Polish anti-religious campaign (1945\u20131990)}} \n{{see also|Religion in Poland}}\n[[File:Popieluszko Europena 02 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko]] was a Roman Catholic priest who supported the anti-communist opposition.

Despite this, some groundbreaking achievements were established during the People's Republic such as improved living conditions, rapid industrialization, [[urbanization]] of smaller or larger cities and access to free healthcare and education was made available. The birth rate was high and the population almost doubled between 1947 and 1989. The party's most successful accomplishment, however, was the rebuilding of [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|ruined Warsaw]] after [[World War II]] and the complete riddance of [[illiteracy]], which stood at 30% in 1931<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retropress.pl/nowy-kurjer/30-procent-analfabetow/|title=30 procent analfabet\u00f3w... - Retropress|website=retropress.pl|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref> and at 2% in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/analfabetyzm;3869021.html|title=analfabetyzm - Encyklopedia PWN - \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142o wiarygodnej i rzetelnej wiedzy|website=encyklopedia.pwn.pl}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Polish People's Army]] was the main branch of the Armed Forces, though [[Red Army]] units were also stationed in Poland as in all other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries.<ref name=\"Rao, B.

[[Joseph Stalin]], whose [[Red Army]] occupied the entire country, presented several alternatives which granted Poland [[Recovered territories|industrialized territories]] in the west whilst the Red Army simultaneously permanently annexed Polish [[Kresy|territories in the east]], resulting in Poland losing over 20% of its [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war borders]]. Stalin then imposed upon Poland a Soviet-backed puppet communist government following the war, forcibly bringing the nation into the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet sphere of influence]].]]\n\nAt the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] was able to present his western allies, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]], with a ''[[fait accompli]]'' in Poland. His armed forces were in occupation of the country, and the communists were in control of its administration. The [[Soviet Union]] was in the process of incorporating the lands to the east of the [[Curzon Line]], which it had [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded and occupied between 1939 and 1941]].\n\nIn compensation, the USSR gave Poland former German populated territories in [[Pomerania]], [[Silesia]], and [[Brandenburg]] east of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], plus the southern half of [[East Prussia]]. These awards were confirmed at the Tripartite Conference of Berlin, otherwise known as the [[Potsdam Conference]] in August 1945 after the end of the war in Europe. Stalin was determined that Poland's new government would become his tool towards making Poland a Soviet puppet state controlled by the communists. He had severed relations with the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London in 1943, but to appease Roosevelt and Churchill he agreed at Yalta that a coalition government would be formed. The communists held a majority of key posts in this new government, and with Soviet support they soon gained almost total control of the country, rigging all elections.\n\nIn June 1946, the \"[[Three Times Yes]]\" referendum was held on a number of issues\u2014abolition of the [[Senate of Poland]], land reform, and making the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] Poland's western border. The communist-controlled Interior Ministry issued results showing that all three questions passed overwhelmingly. Years later, however, evidence was uncovered showing that the referendum had been tainted by massive fraud, and only the third question actually passed.<ref>Czes\u0142aw Os\u0119kowski ''Referendum 30 czerwca 1946 roku w Polsce'', Wydawnictwo Sejmowe, 2000, {{ISBN|83-7059-459-X}}</ref>  [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] then took advantage of a split in the [[Polish Socialist Party]].  One faction, which included [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Os\u00f3bka-Morawski]], wanted to join forces with the Peasant Party and form a united front against the Communists. Another faction, led by [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]], argued that the Socialists should support the Communists in carrying through a socialist program, while opposing the imposition of one-party rule. Pre-war political hostilities continued to influence events, and [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] would not agree to form a united front with the Socialists. The Communists played on these divisions by dismissing Os\u00f3bka-Morawski and making Cyrankiewicz Prime Minister.\n\nBetween the referendum and the [[1947 Polish legislative election|January 1947 general elections]], the opposition was subjected to persecution.  Only the candidates of the pro-government \"Democratic Bloc\" (the PPR, Cyrankiewicz' faction of the PPS, and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]]) were allowed to campaign completely unmolested.  Meanwhile, several opposition candidates were prevented from campaigning at all. Miko\u0142ajczyk's [[Polish People's Party (1945\u201349)|Polish People's Party]] (PSL) in particular suffered persecution; it had opposed the abolition of the Senate as a test of strength against the government.  Although it supported the other two questions, the Communist-dominated government branded the PSL \"traitors\".  This massive oppression was overseen by Gomu\u0142ka and the provisional president, [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]].\n\n[[File:Westverschiebung.Polens.gif|thumb|left|Border changes of Poland after [[World War II]]. The eastern territories (''[[Kresy]]'') were annexed by the Soviets. The western so-called \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" were granted as war reparations. Despite the western lands being more industrialized, Poland lost 77,035 km<sup>2</sup> (29,743 sq mi) and major cities like [[Lviv]] and [[Vilnius]].]]\n\nThe official results of the election showed the Democratic Bloc with 80.1 percent of the vote.  The Democratic Bloc was awarded 394 seats to only 28 for the PSL. Miko\u0142ajczyk immediately resigned to protest this so-called 'implausible result', and fled to the United Kingdom in April rather than face arrest.  Later, some historians announced that the official results were only obtained through massive fraud.  Government officials didn't even count the real votes in many areas, and simply filled in the relevant documents in accordance with instructions from the Communists.  In other areas, the ballot boxes were either destroyed or replaced with boxes containing prefilled ballots.\n\nThe 1947 election marked the beginning of undisguised Communist rule in Poland, though it was not officially transformed into the Polish People's Republic until the adoption of the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|1952 Constitution]].  However, Gomu\u0142ka never supported Stalin's control over the Polish Communists, and was soon replaced as party leader by the more pliable Bierut.  In 1948, the Communists consolidated their power, merging with Cyrankiewicz' faction of the PPS to form the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (known in Poland as 'the Party'), which would monopolise political power in Poland until 1989. In 1949, Polish-born Soviet Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] became the Minister of National Defence, with the additional title [[Marshal of Poland]], and in 1952 he became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers (deputy premier).\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = 3xtak.jpg\n | caption1 = A propaganda poster enhancing to vote for Communist policies in the \"[[Three Times Yes]]\" 1946 referendum\n | image2 = Konstytucja PRL draft with Stalin remarks.jpg\n | caption2 = Draft of [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]] (Russian version) with Stalin's remarks, 1952\n}}\n\nOver the coming years, private industry was [[nationalisation|nationalised]], the land seized from the pre-war landowners and redistributed to the lower-class farmers, and millions of Poles were transferred from the lost eastern territories to the lands acquired from Germany. Poland was now to be brought into line with the Soviet model of a \"people's democracy\" and a centrally planned socialist economy. The government also embarked on the [[collectivisation]] of agriculture, although the pace was slower than in other satellites: Poland remained the only Eastern Bloc country where individual farmers dominated agriculture.\n\nThrough a careful balance of agreement, compromise and resistance \u2014 and having signed an agreement of coexistence with the communist regime \u2014 [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[primate (bishop)|primate]] [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] maintained and even strengthened the Polish church through a series of failed government leaders.

In June, workers in the industrial city of [[Pozna\u0144]] went on strike, in what became known as [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]]. Voices began to be raised in the Party and among the intellectuals calling for wider reforms of the Stalinist system. Eventually, power shifted towards Gomu\u0142ka, who replaced Ochab as party leader. Hardline Stalinists were removed from power and many Soviet officers serving in the [[Polish Army]] were dismissed. This marked the end of the Stalinist era.\n\n=== 1970s and 1980s ===\n[[File:Polish 1970 protests - Zbyszek Godlewski body.jpg|thumb|left|The [[1970 Polish protests]] were ruthlessly crushed by the Communist authorities and [[Milicja Obywatelska|Citizens' Militia]]. The riots resulted in the deaths of 42 people and over 1,000 injured.]]\nIn 1970, Gomu\u0142ka's government had decided to adopt massive increases in the prices of basic goods, including food. The resulting widespread [[Polish 1970 protests|violent protests]] in December that same year resulted in a number of deaths. They also forced another major change in the government, as Gomu\u0142ka was replaced by [[Edward Gierek]] as the new First Secretary. Gierek's plan for recovery was centered on massive borrowing, mainly from the United States and [[West Germany]], to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers some incentive to work. While it boosted the Polish economy, and is still remembered as the \"Golden Age\" of socialist Poland, it left the country vulnerable to global economic fluctuations and western undermining, and the repercussions in the form of massive debt is still felt in Poland even today. This Golden Age came to an end after the [[1973 energy crisis]]. The failure of the Gierek government, both economically and politically, soon led to the creation of opposition in the form of [[trade union]]s, student groups, clandestine newspapers and publishers, imported books and newspapers, and even a \"flying university.\"\n\n[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|250px|Queues waiting to enter state-run grocery stores in Warsaw and other Polish cities and towns were a typical sight in the 1950s and 1980s. The availability of food and goods varied at times, and the most sought after basic item was toilet paper.]]\n\nOn 16 October 1978, the [[Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Karol Wojty\u0142a, was [[Papal conclave, October 1978|elected Pope]], taking the name [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. The election of a Polish Pope had an electrifying effect on what had been, even under Communist rule, one of the most devoutly Catholic nations in Europe. Gierek is alleged to have said to his cabinet, \"O God, what are we going to do now?\" or, as occasionally reported, \"Jesus and Mary, this is the end\". When John Paul II made his first papal tour of Poland in June 1979, half a million people heard him speak in Warsaw; he did not call for rebellion, but instead encouraged the creation of an \"alternative Poland\" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next economic crisis came, the nation would present a united front.\n\nA new wave of labour strikes undermined Gierek's government, and in September Gierek, who was in poor health, was finally removed from office and replaced as Party leader by [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]]. However, Kania was unable to find an answer for the fast-eroding support of communism in Poland. Labour turmoil led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''Solidarno\u015b\u0107'') in September 1980, originally led by [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]. In fact, Solidarity became a broad [[anti-communist]] social movement ranging from people associated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], to members of the anti-Stalinist left. By the end of 1981, Solidarity had nine million members\u2014a quarter of Poland's population and three times as many as the PUWP had. Kania resigned under Soviet pressure in October and was succeeded by [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who had been Defence minister since 1968 and Premier since February.\n\n[[File:Warszawa 1975 WDC 42783.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The new [[Warszawa Centralna railway station]] in [[Warsaw]] had automatic doors and escalators, an unlikely sight in Communist Poland. It was a flagship project during the 1970s economic boom and was dubbed the most modern station in Europe at the time of its completion in 1975.]]\n\nOn 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski [[martial law in Poland|proclaimed martial law]], suspended Solidarity, and temporarily imprisoned most of its leaders. This sudden crackdown on Solidarity was reportedly out of fear of Soviet intervention (see [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980\u201381]]). The government then disallowed Solidarity on 8 October 1982. Martial law was formally lifted in July 1983, though many heightened controls on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place through the mid-to-late-1980s. Jaruzelski stepped down as prime minister in 1985 and became president (chairman of the Council of State).\n\n[[File:Stakingsleider Lech Walesa deelt handtekeningen uit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] co-founded and headed the [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107|Solidarity movement]] which toppled Communism.

Eventually it eroded the dominance of the PUWP, which in 1981 lost approximately 85,000 of its 3 million members. Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persisted solely as an underground organization, but by the late 1980s was sufficiently strong to frustrate Jaruzelski's attempts at reform, and nationwide [[1988 Polish strikes|strike]]s in 1988 were one of the factors that forced the government to open a dialogue with Solidarity.\n\nFrom 6 February to 15 April 1989, talks of 13 [[working group]]s in 94 sessions, which became known as the \"[[Polish Round Table Agreement|Roundtable Talks]]\" (''Rozmowy Okr\u0105g\u0142ego Sto\u0142u'') saw the PUWP abandon power and radically altered the shape of the country. In June, shortly after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] in China, the [[1989 Polish legislative election]] took place. Much to its own surprise, Solidarity took all contested (35%) seats in the [[Sejm]], the Parliament's lower house, and all but one seat in the fully free elected [[Senate of Poland|Senate]].\n\nSolidarity persuaded the Communists' longtime satellite parties, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] and Democratic Party, to throw their support to Solidarity.  This all but forced Jaruzelski, who had been named president in July, to appoint a Solidarity member as prime minister.  Finally, he appointed a Solidarity-led coalition government with [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] as the country's first non-Communist prime minister since 1948.\n\nOn 10 December 1989, the [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|statue]] of [[Vladimir Lenin]] was removed in [[Warsaw]] by the PRL authorities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Upheaval in the East; Lenin Statue in Mothballs |author=Reuters |date=11 December 1989 |work=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/11/world/upheaval-in-the-east-lenin-statue-in-mothballs.html }}</ref>\n\nThe Parliament amended the Constitution on 29 December 1989 to formally restore democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties. This began the [[Third Polish Republic]], and served as a prelude to the fully democratic elections of [[1991 Polish parliamentary election|1991]]\u2014only the third free election ever held in Poland.\n\nThe PZPR was finally disbanded on 30 January 1990, even if Wa\u0142\u0119sa could be elected as President only eleven months after. The [[Warsaw Pact]] was soon followed on 1 July 1991 and the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991. On 27 October 1991, the [[1991 Polish parliamentary election|first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections]] since the 1920s took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style [[Parliamentary system|liberal democratic political system]]. The last [[Northern Group of Forces|post-Soviet troops]] left Poland on 18 September 1993. After ten years of [[democratic consolidation]], Poland joined [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] in 1996, [[NATO]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004.\n\n== Government and politics ==\n{{see also|Politics of Poland}}\n[[File:POL PZPR logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.60|right|Logo of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]]]]\n\nThe government and politics of the Polish People's Republic were governed by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (''Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza, PZPR''). Despite the presence of two minor parties, the United People's Party and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]], the country was generally reckoned by western nations as a [[one-party state]] because these two parties were supposedly completely subservient to the Communists and had to accept the PZPR's \"leading role\" as a condition of their existence. It was politically influenced by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to the extent of being its [[satellite state|satellite country]], along with [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and other [[Eastern Bloc]] members. \n\nFrom 1952, the highest law was the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]], and the [[Polish Council of State]] replaced the [[president of Poland|presidency of Poland]]. Elections were held on the single lists of the [[Front of National Unity]]. Despite these changes, Poland was one of the most liberal communist nations and was the only communist country in the world which did not have any [[Communist symbolism|socialist symbols]] ([[red star]], stars, ears of [[wheat]] or [[hammer and sickle]]) on its [[Flag of Poland|flag]] and [[coat of arms of Poland|coat of arms]]. The [[Polish White Eagle|White Eagle]] founded by Polish monarchs in the [[Middle Ages]] remained as Poland's national emblem; the only feature removed by the communists from the pre-war design was the crown, which was seen as [[Imperialism|imperialistic]] and [[Monarchy|monarchist]]. \n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{see also|Foreign relations of Poland}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0417-0001-011, Berlin, VII. SED-Parteitag, Er\u00f6ffnung.jpg|thumb|right|[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in [[East Berlin]], 1967]]\nDuring its existence, the Polish People's Republic maintained relations not only with the [[Soviet Union]], but several communist states around the world. It also had friendly relations with the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and the [[Western Bloc]] as well as the [[People's Republic of China]]. At the height of the [[Cold War]], Poland attempted to remain neutral to the conflict between the Soviets and the Americans. In particular, [[Edward Gierek]] sought to establish Poland as a mediator between the two powers in the 1970s. Both the [[U.S. presidents]] and the Soviet [[Soviet leaders|general secretaries]] or leaders visited communist Poland.\n\nUnder the pressure from the USSR, Poland participated in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968.\n\nPoland's [[Israel\u2013Poland relations|relations]] with [[Israel]] were on a fair level following the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]]. In 1947, the PRL voted in favour of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], which lead to Israel's recognition by the PRL on 19 May 1948. However, by the [[Six-Day War]], it severed diplomatic relations with Israel in June 1967 and supported the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] which [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|recognized]] the [[State of Palestine]] on 14 December 1988. In 1989, PRL restored relations with Israel.\n\nThe PRL participated as a member of the [[United Nations|UN]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Warsaw Pact]], [[Comecon]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], and [[Interkosmos]].\n\n== Economy ==\n{{further|Economy of Poland|Eastern Bloc economies}}\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:Kroscienko PGR 1.jpg|thumb|right|An abandoned [[State Agricultural Farm]] in south-eastern Poland. State farms were a form of [[collective farming]] created in 1949.]]\nPoland suffered tremendous economic losses during World War II. In 1939, Poland had 35.1 million inhabitants, but the census of 14 February 1946 showed only 23.9 million inhabitants. (The difference was partially the result of the border revision.) The losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to 38%. Compared to [[Western Europe]]an nations, including Germany, Poland was still mostly an agrarian country. The implementation of the immense tasks involved with the reconstruction of the country was intertwined with the struggle of the new government for the stabilisation of power, made even more difficult by the fact that a considerable part of society was mistrustful of the communist government. The occupation of Poland by the Red Army and the support the Soviet Union had shown for the Polish communists was decisive in the communists gaining the upper hand in the new Polish government. Poland was under Soviet control, both directly (Red Army, [[NKVD]], deportations to the SU) and indirectly (NKVD created the Polish political police UB).\n\n[[File:Bazylika Archikatedralna w \u0141odzi.jpg|thumb|left|[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] was Poland's largest city after the destruction of [[Warsaw]] during [[World War II]]. It was also a major industrial centre in Europe and served as the temporary capital due to its economic significance in the 1940s.]]\n\nAs control of the Polish territories passed from occupying forces of [[Nazi Germany]] to the subsequent occupying forces of the [[Soviet Union]], and from the Soviet Union to the Soviet-imposed puppet [[satellite state]], Poland's new [[economic system]] was forcibly imposed and began moving towards a radical, communist [[central planning|centrally planned]] economy. One of the first major steps in that direction involved the [[agricultural reform]] issued by the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] government on 6 September 1944. All estates over 0.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in pre-war Polish territories and all over 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in former German territories were nationalised without compensation. In total, 31,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of land were nationalised in Poland and 5 million in the former German territories, out of which 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> were redistributed to farmers and the rest remained in the hands of the government (Most of this was eventually used in the [[collectivization]] and creation of [[sovkhoz]]-like [[State Agricultural Farm]]s \"PGR\"). However, the collectivization of Polish farming never reached the same extent as it did in the Soviet Union or other countries of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"PWN-Reforma\">Wojciech Roszkowski, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060407135210/http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/62528_1.html  Reforma Rolna] Encyklopedia.PWN.pl (Internet Archive)</ref>\n\n[[File:Ignacy P\u0142a\u017cewski, Prz\u0105dki przy pracy, I-4717-4.jpg|thumb|right|Female [[textile]] workers in a state-run factory, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, 1950s]]\n\n[[Nationalisation]] began in 1944, with the pro-Soviet government taking over industries in the newly acquired territories along with the rest of the country. As nationalization was unpopular, the communists delayed [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic|the nationalization reform]] until 1946, when after the [[3xTAK]] [[referendum]]s they were fairly certain they had total control of the state and could deal a heavy blow to eventual public protests. Some semi-official nationalisation of various private enterprises had begun also in 1944. In 1946, all enterprises with over 50 employees were nationalised, with no compensation to Polish owners.<ref name=\"PWN-Nacjonalizacja\">Zbigniew Landau, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050324055335/http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/49495_1.html  Nacjonalizacja w Polsce] Encyklopedia.PWN.pl (Internet Archive)</ref>\n\nThe Allied punishment of Germany for the war of destruction was intended to include large-scale reparations to Poland. However, those were truncated into insignificance by the break-up of Germany into East and West and the onset of the Cold War. Poland was then relegated to receive her share from the Soviet-controlled [[East Germany]]. However, even this was attenuated, as the Soviets pressured the Polish Government to cease receiving the reparations far ahead of schedule as a sign of 'friendship' between the two new communist neighbors and, therefore, now friends.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fHYh1QxFnFwC&pg=PA230&lpg=PA230&dq=working+with+the+enemy+Poland+Soviet+1953 |title=Working for the enemy: Ford, General Motors, and forced labor in Germany during the Second World War |isbn=978-1-84545-013-7 |author1=Billstein |first1=Reinhold |last2=Fings |first2=Karola |last3=Kugler |first3=Anita |last4=Levis |first4=Billstein |date=October 2004}}</ref><ref name=\"Hofhansel\">{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ea-j1w5Z17kC&pg=RA1-PA56&lpg=RA1-PA56&dq=multilateralism+Poland+Soviet+German+reparations+1953 |title=Multilateralism, German foreign policy and Central Europe |isbn=978-0-415-36406-5 |author1=Hofhansel |first1=Claus |year=2005 |format=Google Books, no preview}}&nbsp;{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref> Thus, without the reparations and without the massive [[Marshall Plan]] implemented in the West at that time, Poland's postwar recovery was much harder than it could have been.\n\n=== Later years ===\n[[File:SuperSam Warszawa 1969.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supersam Warsaw]], the first self-serve shopping centre in Poland, 1969]]\nDuring the [[Gierek decade|Gierek era]], Poland borrowed large sums from [[Club de Paris|Western creditors]] in exchange for promise of social and economic reforms.

Most visibly, work on most of the major investment projects that had begun in the 1970s was stopped. As a result, most Polish cities acquired at least one infamous example of a large unfinished building languishing in a state of limbo. While some of these were eventually finished decades later, most, such as the [[Szkieletor]] [[skyscraper]] in Krak\u00f3w, were never finished at all, wasting the considerable resources devoted to their construction. Polish investment in economic infrastructure and technological development fell rapidly, ensuring that the country lost whatever ground it had gained relative to Western European economies in the 1970s. To escape the constant economic and political pressures during these years, and the general sense of hopelessness, many family income providers traveled for work in Western Europe, particularly West Germany (''Wyjazd na saksy'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/saksy|title=saksy \u2013 Wikis\u0142ownik, wolny s\u0142ownik wieloj\u0119zyczny|website=pl.wiktionary.org|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref> During the era, hundreds of thousands of Poles left the country permanently and settled in the West, few of them returning to Poland even after the end of socialism in Poland.

The government introduced a series of small-scale reforms, such as allowing more small-scale private enterprises to function. However, the government also realized that it lacked the legitimacy to carry out any large-scale reforms, which would inevitably cause large-scale social dislocation and economic difficulties for most of the population, accustomed to the extensive [[social safety net]] that the socialist system had provided. For example, when the government proposed to close the [[Gda\u0144sk Shipyard]], a decision in some ways justifiable from an economic point of view but also largely political, there was a wave of public outrage and the government was forced to back down.\n\nThe only way to carry out such changes without social upheaval would be to acquire at least some support from the opposition side. The government accepted the idea that some kind of a deal with the opposition would be necessary, and repeatedly attempted to find common ground throughout the 1980s. However, at this point the communists generally still believed that they should retain the reins of power for the near future, and only allowed the opposition limited, advisory participation in the running of the country. They believed that this would be essential to pacifying the Soviet Union, which they felt was not yet ready to accept a non-Communist Poland.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{main|Culture in the Polish People's Republic}}\n===Television and media===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width1 = 220\n | width2 = 220\n | image1 = Dziennik telewizyjny.jpg\n | alt1 = Dziennik\n | image2 = Dziennik-telewizyjny-Intro.ogg\n | alt2 = Dziennik\n | footer = Opening panel and sequence of ''[[Dziennik Telewizyjny|Dziennik]]'', the chief news program in communist Poland.

Furthermore, the pre-war system of education was in disarray; many educational facilities were much more accessible in wealthier western and central Poland than in the rural east (Kresy), particularly in the [[Polesie]] region where there was one large school per 100 square kilometers (39 square miles).<ref name=\"auto8\">{{Cite web|url=https://niepodlegla.gov.pl/o-niepodleglej/edukacja-w-ii-rzeczypospolitej/|title=Edukacja w II Rzeczypospolitej|website=Niepodleg\u0142a - stulecie odzyskania niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci}}</ref> Schools were also in desperate need of staff, tutors and teachers before 1939.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> \n\nAfter the [[1947 Polish legislative election]], the communists took full control of the education in the newly-formed Polish People's Republic.

Attendance gradually grew, which put an end to illiteracy in rural areas. The communist government also introduced new beneficial content into the system; sports and [[physical education]] were enforced and students were encouraged to learn foreign languages, especially German, Russian or French and from the 1980s also English. On July 15, 1961, two-year [[vocational education|vocational career training]] was made obligatory to boost the number of skilled labourers and the minimum age of graduation rose to 15. Additionally, special schools were established for deaf, [[muteness|mute]] and blind children. Such institutions for the impaired were almost nonexistent in the Second Polish Republic. During the 1960s, thousands of modern schools were founded. \n\nThe number of universities nearly doubled between 1938 and 1963. Medical, agricultural, economical, engineering and sport faculties became separate colleges, under a universal communist model used in other countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Theological]] faculties were deemed unnecessary or potentially dangerous and were therefore removed from state universities. [[Philosophy]] was also seen as superfluous. In order to strengthen the post-war Polish economy, the government created many common-labour faculties across the country, including dairying, fishing, tailoring, chemistry and mechanics to achieve a better economic output alongside efficiency.

The areas in the East that were not [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union|annexed by the Soviet Union]] had their borders left almost unchanged.

Two cities were granted voivodeship status: [[Warsaw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].\n \nIn 1950, new voivodeships were created: [[Koszalin Voivodeship|Koszalin]] - previously part of [[Szczecin Voivodeship|Szczecin]], [[Opole Voivodeship|Opole]] - previously part of [[Katowice Voivodeship|Katowice]], and [[Zielona G\u00f3ra Voivodeship|Zielona G\u00f3ra]] - previously part of [[Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship|Pozna\u0144]], [[Wroc\u0142aw Voivodeship|Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[Szczecin Voivodeship|Szczecin]] voivodeships.

This reorganization of administrative division of Poland was mainly a result of local government reform acts of 1973 to 1975. In place of three level administrative division (voivodeship, county, commune), new two-level administrative division was introduced (49 small voidships and communes).
