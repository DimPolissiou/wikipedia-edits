JCPenney had previously operated a store in downtown Sandusky.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sA0QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=josDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6016,3588791&dq=sandusky-mall&hl=en|title=Ohio town feels effect of new mall|last=Giegerich|first=Steve|work=[[The Free-Lance Star]]|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}</ref> It is managed by [[Cafaro Company]] of [[Youngstown, Ohio]].\n\n==History==\nMall construction began in 1976 and Sandusky Mall opened in 1977. Its original anchors included [[JCPenney]], [[Elder-Beerman]], [[The May Department Stores Company]] (simply the May Co.), and [[Montgomery Ward]] (later [[Sears]] in 1986). The outdoor section, [[Child World]] closed in 1992 and later converted to [[OfficeMax]] in 1994, then closed in 2005. It was converted to K&K Home Furnishings in 2006, then closed in 2014. It later converted to a Planet Fitness in 2015.\n\nThe May Co. rebranded their store at the Sandusky Mall as [[Kaufmann's]] in the mid-1990s. In 2006, the store was converted to [[Macy's]], when May Department Stores Company and Federated Department Stores merged into Macy's, Inc. [[Borders Group|Borders]] opened in 2005.  [[T. J. Maxx|TJ Maxx]] was added in 2009. Borders closed in 2011. A few months later, it was replaced by [[Books-A-Million|BAM!]].\n\nOn April 7, 2016, Sears announced that its store would be closing in June 2016.<ref>http://www.sanduskyregister.com/story/201701040044</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2017, Macy's announced that its store would also be closing as part of a plan to close 100 stores nationwide over the next several years. The store closed in March 2017.<ref>http://www.sanduskyregister.com/story/201701040044</ref>\n\nOn April 18, 2018, it was announced that Elder-Beerman would be closing all of their stores after the parent company, Bon-Ton became bankrupt. The store closed late August 2018. \n\nIn December 2018, Cafaro Company announced that they had a redevelopment plan set in place for the mall with chances on the horizon coming within the next year. \n[[File:Sandusky Mall Viewed From Back of Nearby Mcdonald's Lot.jpg|thumb|445x445px|Picture of the mall taken by YouTuber, \"Tom's Terrific Retales\"]]\nOn June 30, 2019, It was announced that Hobby Lobby, a crafts/ home decor store would be coming to the Sandusky Mall.

They were intended for use on the [[Piccadilly line]], but also saw use on several other tube lines. It was the first production (not prototype) tube stock to have unpainted [[aluminium]] alloy bodywork.\n\n==Construction==\nThe 1959 Stock was built by [[Metro-Cammell]] in [[Birmingham]] and were closely based on the prototype aluminium alloy bodied [[London Underground 1956 Stock|1956 Stock]]. It operated at various times on the [[Northern line]], [[Bakerloo line]], [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] and Piccadilly line. The units had a long career, with some examples remaining in service until 2000, three years beyond their intended withdrawal date.\n\nThe 1959 Stock entered service on the Piccadilly line, but most units were drafted to the Central line because that line's [[London Underground Standard Stock|\"Standard stock\"]] was becoming very unreliable. The Central line's version of the 1959 stock, the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 stock]], later took over.\n\n==Transfer from the Piccadilly line==\nThe Piccadilly line extension to [[Heathrow]], which opened in the early 1970s, coincided with the introduction of new [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]]. Therefore, the 1959 Stock was transferred to the Northern line between 1975 and 1979, allowing the scrapping of the oldest 1938 Stock on that line. The 1959 Stock also saw service on the Bakerloo line in the 1980s, again to facilitate withdrawal of 1938 Stock.\n\nWhen new, the 1959 stock was seen as distinctive because of the clean 'silver' exterior. Over the years, however, the trains' unpainted exteriors became jaded and dirty. The blue and grey interiors dated quickly. Stylistically the 1959 stock looked worn, but without the aesthetic red and green charm or old-fashioned thirties ambience of the more celebrated [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 stock]].\n\nBy the mid-1990s these units were getting old and were in need of works attention. By this time, all the remaining 1959 Stock was concentrated on the Northern line. Minor refurbishment of the stock took place, painting the blue/grey interiors white and replacing some of the seat moquettes. This was done in a haphazard manner, the white interiors becoming very dirty inside by 1998, and with a failure rate that had risen to 1 in {{convert|1864|mi|km|abbr=off}}, the 1959 Stock was in urgent need of replacement.\n\n==Replacement==\nNew trains in the form of [[London Underground 1995 Stock|1995 Stock]] were built as replacements for both the 1959 stock and the 30 trains of [[London Underground 1972 Stock|1972 stock]] also operating on the Northern line. Originally it had been planned to keep the 1972 stock running with the new trains, with the same extensive refurbishment as done to the 1972 stock on the Bakerloo line, but after one trial refurbishment of a Northern line 1972 stock carriage it was decided that it would be more cost-effective in the long run to have the line operated by one type of train only. Withdrawal of the 1959 Stock was a drawn-out affair, and when the last example was withdrawn on 28 January 2000, it was the only remaining tube train to be crewed with a motorman and a guard. One unit was repainted in \"heritage\" red and cream livery in 1990 to commemorate the line's 100th anniversary. One trailer forms part of the Central Line Sandite train, the other cars were 1962 stock.\n\nSeveral vehicles have been preserved, at various locations, including one complete 4-car unit (1304).

An analogy illustrates the concept of public key exchange by using colors instead of very large numbers:\n\nThe process begins by having the two parties, [[Alice and Bob]], agree on an arbitrary starting color that does not need to be kept secret (but should be different every time<ref name=imperfectfs/>). In this example, the color is yellow. Each person also selects a secret color that they keep to themselves \u2013 in this case, red and blue-green. The crucial part of the process is that Alice and Bob each mix their own secret color together with their mutually shared color, resulting in orange-tan and light-blue mixtures respectively, and then publicly exchange the two mixed colors. Finally, each of the two mixes the color they received from the partner with their own private color. The result is a final color mixture (yellow-brown in this case) that is identical to the partner's final color mixture.\n\nIf a third party listened to the exchange, it would only know the common color (yellow) and the first mixed colors (orange-tan and light-blue), but it would be difficult for this party to determine the final secret color (yellow-brown). Bringing the analogy back to a [[real-life]] exchange using large numbers rather than colors, this determination is computationally expensive. It is impossible to compute in a practical amount of time even for modern [[Supercomputer|supercomputers]].\n\n===Cryptographic explanation===\nThe simplest and the original implementation<ref name=\"Diffie 1976\" /> of the protocol uses the [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo]] ''p'', where ''p'' is [[prime number|prime]], and ''g'' is a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root modulo]] ''p''. These two values are chosen in this way to ensure that the resulting shared secret can take on any value from 1 to ''p''\u20131. Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span>, and secret values in'''<span style=\"color:red\"> red</span>'''.\n\n# [[Alice and Bob]] publicly agree to use a modulus ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>'' = <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> and base ''<span style=\"color:blue\">g</span>'' = <span style=\"color:blue\">5</span> (which is a primitive root modulo 23).\n# Alice chooses a secret integer '''''<span style=\"color:red\">a</span>''''' = 4, then sends Bob ''<span style=\"color:blue\">A</span>'' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">g</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">a</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* ''<span style=\"color:blue\">A</span>'' = <span style=\"color:blue\">5</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">4</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:blue\">4</span>\n# Bob chooses a secret integer '''''<span style=\"color:red\">b</span>''''' = 3, then sends Alice ''<span style=\"color:blue\">B</span>'' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">g</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">b</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* ''<span style=\"color:blue\">B</span>'' = <span style=\"color:blue\">5</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">3</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:blue\">10</span>\n# Alice computes '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">B</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">a</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = <span style=\"color:blue\">10</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">4</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:red\">18</span>\n# Bob computes '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">A</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">b</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = <span style=\"color:blue\">4</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">3</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:red\">18</span>\n# Alice and Bob now share a secret (the number 18).\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have arrived at the same values because under mod p,\n\n:<math>{\\color{Blue}A}^{\\color{Red}b}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = {\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}ab}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = {\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}ba}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = {\\color{Blue}B}^{\\color{Red}a}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p}</math>\n\nMore specifically,\n\n:<math>({\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}a}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p})^{\\color{Red}b}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = ({\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}b}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p})^{\\color{Red}a}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p}</math>\n\nOnly ''a'', ''b'', and (''g<sup>ab</sup>'' mod ''p'' = ''g<sup>ba</sup>'' mod ''p'') are kept secret. All the other values \u2013 ''p'', ''g'', ''g<sup>a</sup>'' mod ''p'', and ''g<sup>b</sup>'' mod ''p'' \u2013 are sent in the clear. Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret they can use it as an encryption key, known only to them, for sending messages across the same open communications channel.\n\nOf course, much larger values of ''a'', ''b'', and ''p'' would be needed to make this example secure, since there are only 23 possible results of ''n'' mod 23. However, if ''p'' is a prime of at least 600 digits, then even the fastest modern computers cannot find ''a'' given only ''g'', ''p'' and ''g<sup>a</sup>'' mod ''p''. Such a problem is called the [[discrete logarithm problem]].<ref name=imperfectfs/> The computation of ''g<sup>a</sup>'' mod ''p'' is known as [[modular exponentiation]] and can be done efficiently even for large numbers.\nNote that ''g'' need not be large at all, and in practice is usually a small integer (like 2, 3, ...).\n\n===Secrecy chart===\nThe chart below depicts who knows what, again with non-secret values in <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span>, and secret values in'''<span style=\"color:red\"> red</span>'''.

(This is usually done long before the rest of the protocol; ''g'' is assumed to be known by all attackers.) The group ''G'' is written multiplicatively.\n# Alice picks a random [[natural number]] ''a'', where 1 < ''a'' < ''n'', and sends ''g<sup>a</sup>'' to Bob.\n# Bob picks a random natural number ''b'', which is also 1 < ''b'' < ''n'', and sends ''g<sup>b</sup>'' to Alice.\n# Alice computes (''g<sup>b</sup>'')''<sup>a</sup>''.\n# Bob computes (''g<sup>a</sup>'')''<sup>b</sup>''.\n\nBoth Alice and Bob are now in possession of the group element ''g<sup>ab</sup>'', which can serve as the shared secret key. The group ''G'' satisfies the requisite condition for [[secure communication]] if there is not an efficient algorithm for determining ''g<sup>ab</sup>'' given ''g'', ''g<sup>a</sup>'', and ''g<sup>b</sup>''.\n\nFor example, the [[Elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman|elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] protocol is a variant that uses elliptic curves instead of the multiplicative group of integers modulo p.&nbsp;Variants using [[Hyperelliptic curve cryptography|hyperelliptic curves]] have also been proposed. The [[supersingular isogeny key exchange]] is a Diffie\u2013Hellman variant that has been designed to be secure against [[quantum computers]].\n\n==Operation with more than two parties==\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key agreement is not limited to negotiating a key shared by only two participants. Any number of users can take part in an agreement by performing iterations of the agreement protocol and exchanging intermediate data (which does not itself need to be kept secret). For example, Alice, Bob, and Carol could participate in a Diffie\u2013Hellman agreement as follows, with all operations taken to be modulo ''p'':\n\n# The parties agree on the algorithm parameters ''p'' and ''g''.\n# The parties generate their private keys, named ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''.\n# Alice computes ''{{not a typo|g<sup>a</sup>}}'' and sends it to Bob.\n# Bob computes ({{var|g<sup>a</sup>}})<sup>{{var|b}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>ab</sup>}}'' and sends it to Carol.\n# Carol computes ({{var|g<sup>ab</sup>}})<sup>{{var|c}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abc</sup>}}'' and uses it as her secret.\n# Bob computes ''g<sup>b</sup>'' and sends it to Carol.\n# Carol computes ({{var|g<sup>b</sup>}})<sup>{{var|c}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>bc</sup>}}'' and sends it to Alice.\n# Alice computes ({{var|g<sup>bc</sup>}})<sup>{{var|a}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>bca</sup>}}'' = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abc</sup>}}'' and uses it as her secret.\n# Carol computes ''{{not a typo|g<sup>c</sup>}}'' and sends it to Alice.\n# Alice computes ({{var|g<sup>c</sup>}})<sup>{{var|a}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>ca</sup>}}'' and sends it to Bob.\n# Bob computes ({{var|g<sup>ca</sup>}})<sup>{{var|b}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>cab</sup>}}'' = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abc</sup>}}'' and uses it as his secret.\n\nAn eavesdropper has been able to see ''{{not a typo|g<sup>a</sup>}}'', ''{{not a typo|g<sup>b</sup>}}'', ''{{not a typo|g<sup>c</sup>}}'', ''{{not a typo|g<sup>ab</sup>}}'', ''{{not a typo|g<sup>ac</sup>}}'', and ''{{not a typo|g<sup>bc</sup>}}'', but cannot use any combination of these to efficiently reproduce ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abc</sup>}}''.\n\nTo extend this mechanism to larger groups, two basic principles must be followed:\n\n* Starting with an \"empty\" key consisting only of ''g'', the secret is made by raising the current value to every participant's private exponent once, in any order (the first such exponentiation yields the participant's own public key).\n* Any intermediate value (having up to ''N''-1 exponents applied, where ''N'' is the number of participants in the group) may be revealed publicly, but the final value (having had all ''N'' exponents applied) constitutes the shared secret and hence must never be revealed publicly. Thus, each user must obtain their copy of the secret by applying their own private key last (otherwise there would be no way for the last contributor to communicate the final key to its recipient, as that last contributor would have turned the key into the very secret the group wished to protect).\n\nThese principles leave open various options for choosing in which order participants contribute to keys. The simplest and most obvious solution is to arrange the ''N'' participants in a circle and have ''N'' keys rotate around the circle, until eventually every key has been contributed to by all ''N'' participants (ending with its owner) and each participant has contributed to ''N'' keys (ending with their own). However, this requires that every participant perform ''N'' modular exponentiations.\n\nBy choosing a more optimal order, and relying on the fact that keys can be duplicated, it is possible to reduce the number of modular exponentiations performed by each participant to {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') + 1}} using a [[Divide and conquer algorithms|divide-and-conquer-style]] approach, given here for eight participants:\n\n# Participants A, B, C, and D each perform one exponentiation, yielding ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcd</sup>}}''; this value is sent to E, F, G, and H. In return, participants A, B, C, and D receive ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efgh</sup>}}''.\n# Participants A and B each perform one exponentiation, yielding ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghab</sup>}}'', which they send to C and D, while C and D do the same, yielding ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcd</sup>}}'', which they send to A and B.\n# Participant A performs an exponentiation, yielding ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcda</sup>}}'', which it sends to B; similarly, B sends ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcdb</sup>}}'' to A. C and D do similarly.\n# Participant A performs one final exponentiation, yielding the secret ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcdba</sup>}}'' = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcdefgh</sup>}}'', while B does the same to get ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcdab</sup>}}'' = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcdefgh</sup>}}''; again, C and D do similarly.\n# Participants E through H simultaneously perform the same operations using ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcd</sup>}}'' as their starting point.\n\nOnce this operation has been completed all participants will possess the secret ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcdefgh</sup>}}'', but each participant will have performed only four modular exponentiations, rather than the eight implied by a simple circular arrangement.\n\n==Security==\nThe protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if ''G'' and ''g'' are chosen properly. In particular, the order of the group G must be large, particularly if the same group is used for large amounts of traffic. The eavesdropper (\"Eve\") has to solve the [[Diffie\u2013Hellman problem]] to obtain ''g''<sup>''ab''</sup>. This is currently considered difficult for groups whose order is large enough. An efficient algorithm to solve the [[discrete logarithm problem]] would make it easy to compute ''a'' or ''b'' and solve the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem, making this and many other public key cryptosystems insecure. Fields of small characteristic may be less secure.<ref>{{cite conference | first1=Razvan | last1=Barbulescu | first2=Pierrick | last2=Gaudry | first3=Antoine | last3=Joux | first4=Emmanuel | last4=Thom\u00e9 | title=A Heuristic Quasi-Polynomial Algorithm for Discrete Logarithm in Finite Fields of Small Characteristic | work=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | book-title=Advances in Cryptology \u2013 EUROCRYPT 2014 | conference=Proceedings 33rd Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques | location=Copenhagen, Denmark | volume=8441 | date=2014 | pages=1\u201316 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-55220-5_1 | isbn=978-3-642-55220-5 | url=http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/90/90/87/PDF/article.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'' should have a large prime factor to prevent use of the [[Pohlig\u2013Hellman algorithm]] to obtain ''a'' or ''b''. For this reason, a [[Sophie Germain prime]] ''q'' is sometimes used to calculate {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2''q'' + 1}}, called a [[safe prime]], since the order of ''G'' is then only divisible by 2 and ''q''. ''g'' is then sometimes chosen to generate the order ''q'' subgroup of ''G'', rather than ''G'', so that the [[Legendre symbol]] of ''g<sup>a</sup>'' never reveals the low order bit of ''a''. A protocol using such a choice is for example [[Internet Key Exchange|IKEv2]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=RFC 4306 Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol |publisher=Internet Engineeringrg/web/20150107073645/http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4306.txt |archivedate=2015-01-07 }}</ref>\n\n''g'' is often a small integer such as 2. Because of the [[random self-reducibility]] of the discrete logarithm problem a small ''g'' is equally secure as any other generator of the same group.\n\nIf Alice and Bob use [[random number generator]]s whose outputs are not completely random and can be predicted to some extent, then Eve's task is much easier.\n\nIn the original description, the Diffie\u2013Hellman exchange by itself does not provide [[authentication]] of the communicating parties and is thus vulnerable to a [[man-in-the-middle attack]]. Mallory (an active attacker executing the man-in-the-middle attack) may establish two distinct key exchanges, one with Alice and the other with Bob, effectively masquerading as Alice to Bob, and vice versa, allowing her to decrypt, then re-encrypt, the messages passed between them. Note that Mallory must continue to be in the middle, actively decrypting and re-encrypting messages every time Alice and Bob communicate. If she is ever absent, her previous presence is then revealed to Alice and Bob. They will know that all of their private conversations had been intercepted and decoded by someone in the channel. In most cases it will not help them get Mallory's private key, even if she used the same key for both exchanges.\n\nA method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack. Variants of Diffie\u2013Hellman, such as [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS protocol]], may be used instead to avoid these types of attacks.\n\n===Practical attacks on Internet traffic===\nThe [[number field sieve]] algorithm, which is generally the most effective in solving the [[discrete logarithm problem]], consists of four computational steps. The first three steps only depend on the order of the group G, not on the specific number whose finite log is desired.<ref>Whitfield Diffie, Paul C. Van Oorschot, and Michael J. Wiener \"Authentication and Authenticated Key Exchanges\", in Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 2, 107\u2013125 (1992), Section 5.2, available as Appendix B to {{US patent|5724425}}</ref> It turns out that much Internet traffic uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024&nbsp;bits or less.<ref name=imperfectfs/> By [[precomputing]] the first three steps of the number field sieve for the most common groups, an attacker need only carry out the last step, which is much less computationally expensive than the first three steps, to obtain a specific logarithm. The [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam]] attack used this vulnerability to compromise a variety of Internet services that allowed the use of groups whose order was a 512-bit prime number, so called [[export of cryptography|export grade]]. The authors needed several thousand CPU cores for a week to precompute data for a single 512-bit prime. Once that was done, individual logarithms could be solved in about a minute using two 18-core Intel Xeon CPUs.<ref name=imperfectfs/>\n\nAs estimated by the authors behind the Logjam attack, the much more difficult precomputation needed to solve the discrete log problem for a 1024-bit prime would cost on the order of $100 million, well within the budget of a large national [[intelligence agency]] such as the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). The Logjam authors speculate that precomputation against widely reused 1024-bit DH primes is behind claims in [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|leaked NSA documents]] that NSA is able to break much of current cryptography.<ref name=imperfectfs/>\n\nTo avoid these vulnerabilities, the Logjam authors recommend use of [[elliptic curve cryptography]], for which no similar attack is known. Failing that, they recommend that the order, ''p'', of the Diffie\u2013Hellman group should be at least 2048&nbsp;bits. They estimate that the pre-computation required for a 2048-bit prime is 10<sup>9</sup> times more difficult than for 1024-bit primes.<ref name=\"imperfectfs\">{{cite web|url=https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf|title=Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie\u2013Hellman Fails in Practice|last1=Adrian|first1=David|last2=Bhargavan|first2=Karthikeyan|date=October 2015|last3=Durumeric|first3=Zakir|last4=Gaudry|first4=Pierrick|last5=Green|first5=Matthew|last6=Halderman|first6=J.

The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a [[shared secret]] key over an [[insecure channel]]. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a [[symmetric key]] [[cipher]].\n\nDiffie\u2013Hellman is used to secure a variety of [[Internet]] services.

An analogy illustrates the concept of public key exchange by using colors instead of very large numbers:\n\nThe process begins by having the two parties, [[Alice and Bob]], agree on an arbitrary starting color that does not need to be kept secret (but should be different every time<ref name=imperfectfs/>). In this example, the color is yellow. Each person also selects a secret color that they keep to themselves \u2013 in this case, red and blue-green. The crucial part of the process is that Alice and Bob each mix their own secret color together with their mutually shared color, resulting in orange-tan and light-blue mixtures respectively, and then publicly exchange the two mixed colors. Finally, each of the two mixes the color they received from the partner with their own private color. The result is a final color mixture (yellow-brown in this case) that is identical to the partner's final color mixture.\n\nIf a third party listened to the exchange, it would only know the common color (yellow) and the first mixed colors (orange-tan and light-blue), but it would be difficult for this party to determine the final secret color (yellow-brown). Bringing the analogy back to a [[real-life]] exchange using large numbers rather than colors, this determination is computationally expensive. It is impossible to compute in a practical amount of time even for modern [[Supercomputer|supercomputers]].\n\n===Cryptographic explanation===\nThe simplest and the original implementation<ref name=\"Diffie 1976\" /> of the protocol uses the [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo]] ''p'', where ''p'' is [[prime number|prime]], and ''g'' is a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root modulo]] ''p''. These two values are chosen in this way to ensure that the resulting shared secret can take on any value from 1 to ''p''\u20131. Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span>, and secret values in'''<span style=\"color:red\"> red</span>'''.\n\n# [[Alice and Bob]] publicly agree to use a modulus ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>'' = <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> and base ''<span style=\"color:blue\">g</span>'' = <span style=\"color:blue\">5</span> (which is a primitive root modulo 23).\n# Alice chooses a secret integer '''''<span style=\"color:red\">a</span>''''' = 4, then sends Bob ''<span style=\"color:blue\">A</span>'' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">g</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">a</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* ''<span style=\"color:blue\">A</span>'' = <span style=\"color:blue\">5</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">4</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:blue\">4</span>\n# Bob chooses a secret integer '''''<span style=\"color:red\">b</span>''''' = 3, then sends Alice ''<span style=\"color:blue\">B</span>'' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">g</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">b</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* ''<span style=\"color:blue\">B</span>'' = <span style=\"color:blue\">5</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">3</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:blue\">10</span>\n# Alice computes '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">B</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">a</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = <span style=\"color:blue\">10</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">4</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:red\">18</span>\n# Bob computes '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">A</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">b</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = <span style=\"color:blue\">4</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">3</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:red\">18</span>\n# Alice and Bob now share a secret (the number 18).\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have arrived at the same values because under mod p,\n\n:<math>{\\color{Blue}A}^{\\color{Red}b}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = {\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}ab}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = {\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}ba}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = {\\color{Blue}B}^{\\color{Red}a}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p}</math>\n\nMore specifically,\n\n:<math>({\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}a}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p})^{\\color{Red}b}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = ({\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}b}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p})^{\\color{Red}a}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p}</math>\n\nOnly ''a'', ''b'', and (''g<sup>ab</sup>'' mod ''p'' = ''g<sup>ba</sup>'' mod ''p'') are kept secret. All the other values \u2013 ''p'', ''g'', ''g<sup>a</sup>'' mod ''p'', and ''g<sup>b</sup>'' mod ''p'' \u2013 are sent in the clear. Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret they can use it as an encryption key, known only to them, for sending messages across the same open communications channel.\n\nOf course, much larger values of ''a'', ''b'', and ''p'' would be needed to make this example secure, since there are only 23 possible results of ''n'' mod 23. However, if ''p'' is a prime of at least 600 digits, then even the fastest modern computers cannot find ''a'' given only ''g'', ''p'' and ''g<sup>a</sup>'' mod ''p''. Such a problem is called the [[discrete logarithm problem]].<ref name=imperfectfs/> The computation of ''g<sup>a</sup>'' mod ''p'' is known as [[modular exponentiation]] and can be done efficiently even for large numbers.\nNote that ''g'' need not be large at all, and in practice is usually a small integer (like 2, 3, ...).\n\n===Secrecy chart===\nThe chart below depicts who knows what, again with non-secret values in <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span>, and secret values in'''<span style=\"color:red\"> red</span>'''.

If it is not difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key (or vice versa), Eve may simply substitute her own private / public key pair, plug Bob's public key into her private key, produce a fake shared secret key, and solve for Bob's private key (and use that to solve for the shared secret key. Eve may attempt to choose a public / private key pair that will make it easy for her to solve for Bob's private key).\n\nAnother demonstration of Diffie\u2013Hellman (also using numbers too small for practical use) is given [http://buchananweb.co.uk/security02.aspx here].<ref>{{citation | first1=Bill | last1=Buchanan | title=Diffie\u2013Hellman Example in ASP.NET | work=Bill's Security Tips | url=http://buchananweb.co.uk/security02.aspx | accessdate=2015-08-27 | url-status=live | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110827202606/http://buchananweb.co.uk/security02.aspx | archivedate=2011-08-27 }}</ref>\n\n=== Generalization to finite cyclic groups ===\nHere is a more general description of the protocol:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuQlBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA190#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Introduction to Cryptography|last=Buchmann|first=Johannes A.|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4419-9003-7|edition=Second|location=|pages=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\n# Alice and Bob agree on a finite [[cyclic group]] ''G'' of order ''n'' and a [[Generating set of a group|generating]] element ''g'' in ''G''. (This is usually done long before the rest of the protocol; ''g'' is assumed to be known by all attackers.) The group ''G'' is written multiplicatively.\n# Alice picks a random [[natural number]] ''a'', where 1 < ''a'' < ''n'', and sends ''g<sup>a</sup>'' to Bob.\n# Bob picks a random natural number ''b'', which is also 1 < ''b'' < ''n'', and sends ''g<sup>b</sup>'' to Alice.\n# Alice computes (''g<sup>b</sup>'')''<sup>a</sup>''.\n# Bob computes (''g<sup>a</sup>'')''<sup>b</sup>''.\n\nBoth Alice and Bob are now in possession of the group element ''g<sup>ab</sup>'', which can serve as the shared secret key. The group ''G'' satisfies the requisite condition for [[secure communication]] if there is not an efficient algorithm for determining ''g<sup>ab</sup>'' given ''g'', ''g<sup>a</sup>'', and ''g<sup>b</sup>''.\n\nFor example, the [[Elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman|elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] protocol is a variant that uses elliptic curves instead of the multiplicative group of integers modulo p.&nbsp;Variants using [[Hyperelliptic curve cryptography|hyperelliptic curves]] have also been proposed. The [[supersingular isogeny key exchange]] is a Diffie\u2013Hellman variant that has been designed to be secure against [[quantum computers]].\n\n==Operation with more than two parties==\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key agreement is not limited to negotiating a key shared by only two participants. Any number of users can take part in an agreement by performing iterations of the agreement protocol and exchanging intermediate data (which does not itself need to be kept secret). For example, Alice, Bob, and Carol could participate in a Diffie\u2013Hellman agreement as follows, with all operations taken to be modulo ''p'':\n\n# The parties agree on the algorithm parameters ''p'' and ''g''.\n# The parties generate their private keys, named ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''.\n# Alice computes ''{{not a typo|g<sup>a</sup>}}'' and sends it to Bob.\n# Bob computes ({{var|g<sup>a</sup>}})<sup>{{var|b}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>ab</sup>}}'' and sends it to Carol.\n# Carol computes ({{var|g<sup>ab</sup>}})<sup>{{var|c}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abc</sup>}}'' and uses it as her secret.\n# Bob computes ''g<sup>b</sup>'' and sends it to Carol.\n# Carol computes ({{var|g<sup>b</sup>}})<sup>{{var|c}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>bc</sup>}}'' and sends it to Alice.\n# Alice computes ({{var|g<sup>bc</sup>}})<sup>{{var|a}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>bca</sup>}}'' = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abc</sup>}}'' and uses it as her secret.\n# Carol computes ''{{not a typo|g<sup>c</sup>}}'' and sends it to Alice.\n# Alice computes ({{var|g<sup>c</sup>}})<sup>{{var|a}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>ca</sup>}}'' and sends it to Bob.\n# Bob computes ({{var|g<sup>ca</sup>}})<sup>{{var|b}}</sup> = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>cab</sup>}}'' = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abc</sup>}}'' and uses it as his secret.\n\nAn eavesdropper has been able to see ''{{not a typo|g<sup>a</sup>}}'', ''{{not a typo|g<sup>b</sup>}}'', ''{{not a typo|g<sup>c</sup>}}'', ''{{not a typo|g<sup>ab</sup>}}'', ''{{not a typo|g<sup>ac</sup>}}'', and ''{{not a typo|g<sup>bc</sup>}}'', but cannot use any combination of these to efficiently reproduce ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abc</sup>}}''.\n\nTo extend this mechanism to larger groups, two basic principles must be followed:\n\n* Starting with an \"empty\" key consisting only of ''g'', the secret is made by raising the current value to every participant's private exponent once, in any order (the first such exponentiation yields the participant's own public key).\n* Any intermediate value (having up to ''N''-1 exponents applied, where ''N'' is the number of participants in the group) may be revealed publicly, but the final value (having had all ''N'' exponents applied) constitutes the shared secret and hence must never be revealed publicly. Thus, each user must obtain their copy of the secret by applying their own private key last (otherwise there would be no way for the last contributor to communicate the final key to its recipient, as that last contributor would have turned the key into the very secret the group wished to protect).\n\nThese principles leave open various options for choosing in which order participants contribute to keys. The simplest and most obvious solution is to arrange the ''N'' participants in a circle and have ''N'' keys rotate around the circle, until eventually every key has been contributed to by all ''N'' participants (ending with its owner) and each participant has contributed to ''N'' keys (ending with their own). However, this requires that every participant perform ''N'' modular exponentiations.\n\nBy choosing a more optimal order, and relying on the fact that keys can be duplicated, it is possible to reduce the number of modular exponentiations performed by each participant to {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') + 1}} using a [[Divide and conquer algorithms|divide-and-conquer-style]] approach, given here for eight participants:\n\n# Participants A, B, C, and D each perform one exponentiation, yielding ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcd</sup>}}''; this value is sent to E, F, G, and H. In return, participants A, B, C, and D receive ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efgh</sup>}}''.\n# Participants A and B each perform one exponentiation, yielding ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghab</sup>}}'', which they send to C and D, while C and D do the same, yielding ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcd</sup>}}'', which they send to A and B.\n# Participant A performs an exponentiation, yielding ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcda</sup>}}'', which it sends to B; similarly, B sends ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcdb</sup>}}'' to A. C and D do similarly.\n# Participant A performs one final exponentiation, yielding the secret ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcdba</sup>}}'' = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcdefgh</sup>}}'', while B does the same to get ''{{not a typo|g<sup>efghcdab</sup>}}'' = ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcdefgh</sup>}}''; again, C and D do similarly.\n# Participants E through H simultaneously perform the same operations using ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcd</sup>}}'' as their starting point.\n\nOnce this operation has been completed all participants will possess the secret ''{{not a typo|g<sup>abcdefgh</sup>}}'', but each participant will have performed only four modular exponentiations, rather than the eight implied by a simple circular arrangement.\n\n==Security==\nThe protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if ''G'' and ''g'' are chosen properly. In particular, the order of the group G must be large, particularly if the same group is used for large amounts of traffic. The eavesdropper (\"Eve\") has to solve the [[Diffie\u2013Hellman problem]] to obtain ''g''<sup>''ab''</sup>. This is currently considered difficult for groups whose order is large enough. An efficient algorithm to solve the [[discrete logarithm problem]] would make it easy to compute ''a'' or ''b'' and solve the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem, making this and many other public key cryptosystems insecure. Fields of small characteristic may be less secure.<ref>{{cite conference | first1=Razvan | last1=Barbulescu | first2=Pierrick | last2=Gaudry | first3=Antoine | last3=Joux | first4=Emmanuel | last4=Thom\u00e9 | title=A Heuristic Quasi-Polynomial Algorithm for Discrete Logarithm in Finite Fields of Small Characteristic | work=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | book-title=Advances in Cryptology \u2013 EUROCRYPT 2014 | conference=Proceedings 33rd Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques | location=Copenhagen, Denmark | volume=8441 | date=2014 | pages=1\u201316 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-55220-5_1 | isbn=978-3-642-55220-5 | url=http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/90/90/87/PDF/article.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'' should have a large prime factor to prevent use of the [[Pohlig\u2013Hellman algorithm]] to obtain ''a'' or ''b''. For this reason, a [[Sophie Germain prime]] ''q'' is sometimes used to calculate {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2''q'' + 1}}, called a [[safe prime]], since the order of ''G'' is then only divisible by 2 and ''q''. ''g'' is then sometimes chosen to generate the order ''q'' subgroup of ''G'', rather than ''G'', so that the [[Legendre symbol]] of ''g<sup>a</sup>'' never reveals the low order bit of ''a''. A protocol using such a choice is for example [[Internet Key Exchange|IKEv2]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=RFC 4306 Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol |publisher=Internet Engineeringrg/web/20150107073645/http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4306.txt |archivedate=2015-01-07 }}</ref>\n\n''g'' is often a small integer such as 2. Because of the [[random self-reducibility]] of the discrete logarithm problem a small ''g'' is equally secure as any other generator of the same group.\n\nIf Alice and Bob use [[random number generator]]s whose outputs are not completely random and can be predicted to some extent, then Eve's task is much easier.\n\nIn the original description, the Diffie\u2013Hellman exchange by itself does not provide [[authentication]] of the communicating parties and is thus vulnerable to a [[man-in-the-middle attack]]. Mallory (an active attacker executing the man-in-the-middle attack) may establish two distinct key exchanges, one with Alice and the other with Bob, effectively masquerading as Alice to Bob, and vice versa, allowing her to decrypt, then re-encrypt, the messages passed between them. Note that Mallory must continue to be in the middle, actively decrypting and re-encrypting messages every time Alice and Bob communicate. If she is ever absent, her previous presence is then revealed to Alice and Bob. They will know that all of their private conversations had been intercepted and decoded by someone in the channel. In most cases it will not help them get Mallory's private key, even if she used the same key for both exchanges.\n\nA method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack. Variants of Diffie\u2013Hellman, such as [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS protocol]], may be used instead to avoid these types of attacks.\n\n===Practical attacks on Internet traffic===\nThe [[number field sieve]] algorithm, which is generally the most effective in solving the [[discrete logarithm problem]], consists of four computational steps. The first three steps only depend on the order of the group G, not on the specific number whose finite log is desired.<ref>Whitfield Diffie, Paul C. Van Oorschot, and Michael J. Wiener \"Authentication and Authenticated Key Exchanges\", in Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 2, 107\u2013125 (1992), Section 5.2, available as Appendix B to {{US patent|5724425}}</ref> It turns out that much Internet traffic uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024&nbsp;bits or less.<ref name=imperfectfs/> By [[precomputing]] the first three steps of the number field sieve for the most common groups, an attacker need only carry out the last step, which is much less computationally expensive than the first three steps, to obtain a specific logarithm. The [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam]] attack used this vulnerability to compromise a variety of Internet services that allowed the use of groups whose order was a 512-bit prime number, so called [[export of cryptography|export grade]]. The authors needed several thousand CPU cores for a week to precompute data for a single 512-bit prime. Once that was done, individual logarithms could be solved in about a minute using two 18-core Intel Xeon CPUs.<ref name=imperfectfs/>\n\nAs estimated by the authors behind the Logjam attack, the much more difficult precomputation needed to solve the discrete log problem for a 1024-bit prime would cost on the order of $100 million, well within the budget of a large national [[intelligence agency]] such as the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). The Logjam authors speculate that precomputation against widely reused 1024-bit DH primes is behind claims in [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|leaked NSA documents]] that NSA is able to break much of current cryptography.<ref name=imperfectfs/>\n\nTo avoid these vulnerabilities, the Logjam authors recommend use of [[elliptic curve cryptography]], for which no similar attack is known. Failing that, they recommend that the order, ''p'', of the Diffie\u2013Hellman group should be at least 2048&nbsp;bits. They estimate that the pre-computation required for a 2048-bit prime is 10<sup>9</sup> times more difficult than for 1024-bit primes.<ref name=\"imperfectfs\">{{cite web|url=https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf|title=Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie\u2013Hellman Fails in Practice|last1=Adrian|first1=David|last2=Bhargavan|first2=Karthikeyan|date=October 2015|last3=Durumeric|first3=Zakir|last4=Gaudry|first4=Pierrick|last5=Green|first5=Matthew|last6=Halderman|first6=J.

The first such scheme is the [[ElGamal encryption]]. A more modern variant is the [[Integrated Encryption Scheme]].\n\n===Forward secrecy===\nProtocols that achieve [[forward secrecy]] generate new key pairs for each [[session (computer science)|session]] and discard them at the end of the session. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is a frequent choice for such protocols, because of its fast key generation.\n\n===Password-authenticated key agreement===\nWhen Alice and Bob share a password, they may use a [[password-authenticated key agreement]] (PK) form of Diffie\u2013Hellman to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. One simple scheme is to compare the [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of '''s''' concatenated with the password calculated independently on both ends of channel. A feature of these schemes is that an attacker can only test one specific password on each iteration with the other party, and so the system provides good security with relatively weak passwords. This approach is described in [[ITU-T]] Recommendation [[X.1035]], which is used by the [[G.hn]] home networking standard.\n\nAn example of such a protocol is the [[Secure Remote Password protocol]].\n\n===Public key===\nIt is also possible to use Diffie\u2013Hellman as part of a [[public key infrastructure]], allowing Bob to encrypt a message so that only Alice will be able to decrypt it, with no prior communication between them other than Bob having trusted knowledge of Alice's public key. Alice's public key is <math>(g^a \\bmod{p}, g, p)</math>. To send her a message, Bob chooses a random ''b'' and then sends Alice <math>g^b \\bmod p</math> (unencrypted) together with the message encrypted with symmetric key <math>(g^a)^b \\bmod{p}</math>. Only Alice can determine the symmetric key and hence decrypt the message because only she has ''a'' (the private key). A pre-shared public key also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nIn practice, Diffie\u2013Hellman is not used in this way, with [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] being the dominant public key algorithm. This is largely for historical and commercial reasons,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} namely that [[RSA (security firm)|RSA Security]] created a certificate authority for key signing that became [[Verisign]]. Diffie\u2013Hellman cannot be used to sign certificates. However, the [[ElGamal signature scheme|ElGamal]] and [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] signature algorithms are mathematically related to it, as well as [[MQV]], [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS]] and the [[Internet key exchange|IKE]] component of the [[IPsec]] protocol suite for securing [[Internet Protocol]] communications.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] key exchange\n* [[Supersingular isogeny key exchange]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* {{cite book | last1=Gollman | first1=Dieter | title=Computer Security | year=2011 | edition=2nd | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. | location=West Sussex, England | isbn=978-0470741153 }}\n* {{cite techreport | last1=Williamson | first1=Malcolm J. | title=Non-secret encryption using a finite field | institution=Communications Electronics Security Group | date=January 21, 1974 | url=https://www.gchq.gov.uk/sites/default/files/document_files/nonsecret_encryption_finite_field_0.pdf | accessdate=2017-03-22 }}\n* {{cite techreport | last1=Williamson | first1=Malcolm J. | title=Thoughts on Cheaper Non-Secret Encryption | institution=Communications Electronics Security Group | date=August 10, 1976 | url=http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/matyas/lecture/paper3.pdf | accessdate=2015-08-25 }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130404174201/https://cryptocellar.web.cern.ch/cryptocellar/cesg/ellis.pdf The History of Non-Secret Encryption] [[James H.

The council acts as the governing body for the international association and is responsible for forming policy and doctrine for the Church. The council meets four times a year.\n\nUCG's international headquarters is referred to as the \"Home Office\" and is located in [[Milford, Ohio]] (a suburb of [[Cincinnati]]). This office is headed by UCG's President, who is the church's official spokesperson and is charged with administrative responsibility over day-to-day functions, such as managing the church's paid ministry and producing literature or other publications. The president is appointed by the Council of Elders (COE) and can be removed from his appointment by the COE. The COE must remain in the confidence of the General Conference of Elders, and COE members serve on a rotating system of election wherein four of twelve men are up for re-election or replacement in any given year.\n\n==Fundamental Beliefs==\n[[File:UCG-FOT-Branson-MO-2015.jpg|thumb|UCG Feast of Tabernacles observance in Branson, Missouri, 2015]]\nThe UCG follows and believes in many of the basic doctrinal principles shared by other Christian churches such as the inspiration of the scriptures, Christ's bodily resurrection, and the three ordinances of baptism,<ref name=\"Mead, Frank S pp. 246-247\">(2010) Mead, Frank S, Hill, Samuel L. , Atwood, Craig D., ''Handbook of Denominations in The U.S., 13th Edition'', Abingdon Press, Nashville, pp. 246\u2013247.</ref> and agrees with Protestant theology regarding the tenets of ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and that Justification is a gift given freely by God. However, its teachings differ from mainstream Catholic and Protestant theology in a number of key areas: The fundamental beliefs of the United Church of God are as follows: God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The Word of God. Satan the Devil. Humanity. Sin and God\u2019s Law. The Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Three Days and Three Nights. Repentance. Water Baptism. The Sabbath Day. The Passover. The Festivals of God. God\u2019s Food Laws. Military Service and War. Promises to Abraham. God's Purpose for Mankind. The Church. Tithing. The Resurrections. Jesus Christ's Return.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamental Beliefs of the United Church of God, an International Association |date=2003 |publisher=United Church of God, an International Association |pages=1}}</ref> \n\n* Belief concerning God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit: The official position of UCG on the nature of God resembles that of [[Binitarians]]. The Holy Spirit is the spirit/power of God and of Christ Jesus rather than a separate person in the Godhead. God 'the Father' and Jesus Christ are viewed as two distinct beings in the 'God family'; Nevertheless, they are viewed as sharing in perfect union and oneness.<ref name=\"Is God a Trinity\">{{cite web|title=Is God a Trinity?|url=http://www.ucg.org/booklet/god-trinity/|work=UCG|publisher=The United Church of God, an International Association|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref> In a 2005 doctrinal paper approved by the UCG council of Elders, the Hebrew word ''echad'' used in Deuteronomy 6:4, \u201cHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!\u201d is contrasted with the Hebrew word ''yachid'' when referring to the oneness of God. A paragraph taken from the organizations sixty-four page doctrinal paper on \u201cThe Nature of God and Christ\u201d states: \"So what is the meaning of ''echad''? According to Gensenius\u2019 Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon, ''echad'' means \u201cto unite, to join together, to be in unity.\u201d ''Echad'' also conveys the idea of  being \u201cbound together\u201d like the cords of a rope. The tighter the cords are bound, the greater the strength produced. Echad does indeed mean \u201cone\u201d but it is a oneness that is produced by a collective unity. This idea of collective unity is clearly demonstrated in Genesis 2:23-24, \u201cAnd Adam said: \u2018This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\u2019 Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one [''echad''] flesh.\u201d Here two distinct individuals are \u201cone\u201d flesh. This is not talking about one in number but one in collective unity, harmony, peace, and the sharing of common goals. Adam and Eve were joined together, twisted, bound and wrapped together in singleness of purpose.\" <ref>''The Nature of God and Christ: doctrinal study paper''.

Like many churches in the Restorationist movement, UCG believes that a number of today's mainstream Christian teachings resulted from doctrinal corruption under the influence of Greco-Roman philosophy, [[Gnosticism]], [[Anti-Semitism]], and mistranslation which occurred early in the history of the church.

This office is headed by UCG's President, who is the church's official spokesperson and is charged with administrative responsibility over day-to-day functions, such as managing the church's paid ministry and producing literature or other publications. The president is appointed by the Council of Elders (COE) and can be removed from his appointment by the COE. The COE must remain in the confidence of the General Conference of Elders, and COE members serve on a rotating system of election wherein four of twelve men are up for re-election or replacement in any given year.\n\n==Fundamental Beliefs==\n[[File:UCG-FOT-Branson-MO-2015.jpg|thumb|UCG Feast of Tabernacles observance in Branson, Missouri, 2015]]\nThe UCG follows and believes in many of the basic doctrinal principles shared by other Christian churches such as the inspiration of the scriptures, Christ's bodily resurrection, and the three ordinances of baptism,<ref name=\"Mead, Frank S pp. 246-247\">(2010) Mead, Frank S, Hill, Samuel L. , Atwood, Craig D., ''Handbook of Denominations in The U.S., 13th Edition'', Abingdon Press, Nashville, pp. 246\u2013247.</ref> and agrees with Protestant theology regarding the tenets of ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and that Justification is a gift given freely by God.

The Word of God. Satan the Devil. Humanity. Sin and God\u2019s Law. The Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Three Days and Three Nights. Repentance. Water Baptism. The Sabbath Day. The Passover.

The Holy Spirit is the spirit/power of God and of Christ Jesus rather than a separate person in the Godhead. God 'the Father' and Jesus Christ are viewed as two distinct beings in the 'God family'; Nevertheless, they are viewed as sharing in perfect union and oneness.<ref name=\"Is God a Trinity\">{{cite web|title=Is God a Trinity?|url=http://www.ucg.org/booklet/god-trinity/|work=UCG|publisher=The United Church of God, an International Association|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref> In a 2005 doctrinal paper approved by the UCG council of Elders, the Hebrew word ''echad'' used in Deuteronomy 6:4, \u201cHear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!\u201d is contrasted with the Hebrew word ''yachid'' when referring to the oneness of God. A paragraph taken from the organizations sixty-four page doctrinal paper on \u201cThe Nature of God and Christ\u201d states: \"So what is the meaning of ''echad''? According to Gensenius\u2019 Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon, ''echad'' means \u201cto unite, to join together, to be in unity.\u201d ''Echad'' also conveys the idea of  being \u201cbound together\u201d like the cords of a rope. The tighter the cords are bound, the greater the strength produced. Echad does indeed mean \u201cone\u201d but it is a oneness that is produced by a collective unity. This idea of collective unity is clearly demonstrated in Genesis 2:23-24, \u201cAnd Adam said: \u2018This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\u2019 Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one [''echad''] flesh.\u201d Here two distinct individuals are \u201cone\u201d flesh.

Christians are viewed as being called out of this world, having their citizenship in heaven, and discouraged from participating too closely in worldly affairs. John 18:36 is often used to defend this position, \u201cJesus stated, \u2018My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants fight\u2026\u2019 \u201d Also, because most militaries require you to sign away certain rights, UCG strongly dissuades members from enlisting and voluntarily giving away their freedom to serve God to the best of their ability.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamental Beliefs of the United Church of God, an International Association |date=2003 |publisher=United Church of God, an International Association |pages=33-35}}</ref>\n\n* Belief concerning Promises to Abraham: UCG holds that people of Western European descent, primarily the original British colonies and the United States, are direct physical descendants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of the northern kingdom of ancient Israel, whereas the historical Jews (and modern-day Israel) are descendants of the ancient southern kingdom of Judah. This belief is not used to assert racial or ethnic superiority, but solely to interpret [[End Time]] prophecies which are believed to be directed at the United States and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=The United States and Britain in Bible Prophecy|url=http://www.ucg.org/booklet/united-states-and-britain-bible-prophecy/|work=UCG|publisher=The United Church of God, an International Association|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n* Belief concerning God\u2019s Purpose for Mankind: The purpose of mankind is to prepare us to become part of God\u2019s family.

Those who do not know or understand the truth of the Bible during their lifetimes will be given time to learn these teachings after the \"[[Second Resurrection]]\" to a new physical life. After living again in the Millennial world under God's Kingdom, those who continue to reject God's Holy Spirit and way of life will be annihilated after the \"[[Third Resurrection]]\" along with unrepentant former believers who had turned away from God.

Like many churches in the Restorationist movement, UCG believes that a number of today's mainstream Christian teachings resulted from doctrinal corruption under the influence of Greco-Roman philosophy, [[Gnosticism]], [[Anti-Semitism]], and mistranslation which occurred early in the history of the church. Much of UCG doctrine that is distinct from mainstream Christianity is the outgrowth of an effort to separate these influences and traditions from what is believed to be the beliefs and practices of Jesus Christ and the [[Apostolic Age|original Apostolic church]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ashley|first=Scott|title=Warnings of Change in the Church|url=http://www.ucg.org/doctrinal-beliefs/warnings-change-church/|work=UCG|publisher=The United Church of God, an International Association|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=This is the United Church of God|url=http://www.ucg.org/booklet/united-church-god/|work=UCG|publisher=The United Church of God, an International Association|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Church Jesus Built|url=http://www.ucg.org/booklet/church-jesus-built/|work=UCG|publisher=The United Church of God, an International Association|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref> UCG holds that the Roman Catholic church and most Protestant denominations today have mistakenly [[syncretism|syncretized]] various [[paganism|pagan]] doctrines and practices.

It is the seventh installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], and [[Cary Elwes]].\n\nThe film focuses on a man who falsely claims to be a Jigsaw survivor, becoming a local celebrity. However, he soon finds himself part of a real Jigsaw game where he must ultimately save his wife. Meanwhile, [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]] reveals to an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs officer]] that rogue [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]] is the man responsible for the recent Jigsaw games, and Hoffman hunts her down.\n\nAn eighth installment<!-- Not the same eighth installment as \"Jigsaw\" (2017 film). --> was planned, but the decrease in the [[Saw VI#Box office|box office performance for ''Saw VI'']] compared to previous installments led to ''Saw 3D'' being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for ''Saw VIII'' being incorporated into ''Saw 3D''. ''[[Saw V]]'' director [[David Hackl]] was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. [[Principal photography]] took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in [[post-production]].\n\n''Saw 3D'' was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on October 22, 2010, by Lionsgate, but was pushed back a week from its original release date of October 22, 2010, to October 29, 2010; it was released a day earlier in the United Kingdom and Australia. ''Saw 3D'' opened at number one making over $22.5 million. It was eventually followed by an eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nTwo men, Brad and Ryan, awaken in a Metropolitan Storefront, bound at the wrists to opposite sides of a worktable with a circular saw in front of each of them. Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw, and [[Billy the Puppet|Jigsaw's puppet]] informs the men that Dina has been manipulating both of them, driving them into criminal activity to fulfill her material desires. They are given a choice \u2014 either Brad or Ryan can be killed, or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut by the saw. However, Ryan notices Dina is only cheering for whoever's winning, making him realize she's only using them, so he makes peace with Brad, and they allow Dina to die instead.\n\nAfter witnessing [[Mark Hoffman]]'s survival and being attacked, Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an internal affairs detective from the precinct where he works, and incriminates him in exchange for protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman for years, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang \u2014 Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara \u2014 and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including [[Saw (2004 film)|Lawrence Gordon]], who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a [[self-help]] guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying a story of his own survival. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Bobby awakens in a cage in an abandoned asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Bobby's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist; Suzanne, his lawyer; and Cale, his best friend and co-conspirator, all in separate traps representing the [[three wise monkeys]] and all of them are killed despite his efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Bobby finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap he claimed to have survived: he must drive two hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a [[brazen bull]] capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.\n\nGibson eventually discovers the game's location and sends a [[SWAT]] team, who are sealed in another room and killed by toxic gas. Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse sitting in front of several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic [[turret gun]] rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her jaws apart.\n\nAfter destroying his workshop, Hoffman is attacked and subdued by three pig-masked figures, one of whom is Lawrence Gordon. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Gordon has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, which contained a videotape, in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. As a result, Gordon has Hoffman brought to the bathroom from the first film and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. When Hoffman tries to reach for the [[hacksaw]] used to sever Gordon's leg, in an effort to escape, Gordon throws it out of the room, turns off the lights and yells \"Game Over\", before sealing the door, leaving Hoffman to die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]]\n* [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] as [[List of Saw characters#Bobby Dagen|Bobby \nDagen]]\n* [[Chad Donella]] as [[List of Saw characters#Matt Gibson|Detective Matt Gibson]]\n* [[Gina Holden]] as [[List of Saw characters#Joyce Dagen|Joyce Dagen]]\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer/Jigsaw]]\n* Laurence Anthony as [[List of Saw characters#Rogers|Rogers]]\n* [[Dean Armstrong]] as [[List of Saw characters#Cale|Cale]]\n* [[Naomi Snieckus]] as [[List of Saw characters#Nina|Nina]]\n* Rebecca Marshall as [[List of Saw characters#Suzanne|Suzanne]]\n* James Van Patten as [[List of Saw characters#Adam Heffner|Dr. Heffner]]\n* [[Sebastian Pigott]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Brad]]\n* [[Jon Cor]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Ryan]]\n* Anne Greene as  [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Dina]]\n* [[Chester Bennington]] as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Evan]]\n* Dru Viergever as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Dan]]\n* [[Gabby West]] as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Kara]]\n* Benjamin Clost as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Jake]]\n* [[Olunik\u00e9 Adeliyi]] as [[List of Saw characters#Sidney|Sidney]]\n* [[Ishan Morris|Ish Morris]] as Alex\n* [[Tanedra Howard]] as [[List of Saw characters#Simone|Simone]]\n* [[Shauna MacDonald]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brent and Tara Abbott|Tara Abbott]]\n* Janelle Hutchison as [[List of Saw characters#Addy and Allen|Addy]]\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mallick|Mallick]]\n* Larissa Gomes as [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|Emily]]\n* Kevin Rushton as [[List of Saw characters#Trevor|Trevor]]\n* [[Noam Jenkins]] as [[List of Saw characters#Michael Marks|Michael Marks]]\n* [[Carlos D\u00edaz (actor)|Carlos D\u00edaz]] as Coroner Worker\n* [[Rachel Wilson]] as Mother\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Saw VII filming Metro Hall Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|A scene being constructed at the [[Metro Hall]] of Toronto in April 2010.]]\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported in July 2009 that [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] [[Green-light|greenlit]] ''Saw VII'' and announced [[David Hackl]] would return to direct, his last film being ''[[Saw V]]''.

Before choosing 3D, Burg and others viewed a minute of the original ''Saw'' film rendered in 3D and were pleased, which led to them choosing 3D for the seventh film.<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  The sets and traps were designed to take advantage of 3D.<ref name=\"IGN Interview about 3D\"/> To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot [[Hand-held camera|handheld]]. ''Saw 3D'' was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He said in an interview with ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, \"If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's a good chance that when you look at a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space. It looks like a mistake. These things aren't an issue at all in 2D but in 3D are obsessively problematic\".<ref name=\"PopularMechanics\"/> Given the cost of filming in 3D, Greutert said the budget was $17 million, the most expensive of the series.<ref name=\"budget\"/> [[Principal photography]] began on February 8, 2010, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and wrapped on April 12, 2010.<ref name=\"bd7\"/><ref name=\"Saw VII Wraps\"/> Filming took place mostly at Toronto's [[Cinespace Film Studios]].<ref name=\"Cinespace\"/>\n\n[[File:Kevin Greutert and Elizabeth Rowin at Comic Con 2010.jpg|thumb|left|''Saw 3D'' director Kevin Greutert and his wife, actress Elizabeth Rowin, at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2010.]]\nWhen determining the style of 3D shooting they wanted to use, Burg felt that the audience would want several moments where objects move into the audience, comparing this to ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D]]''. He acknowledged that this method would be used, but expressed an interest in shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of [[first-person shooter]] video games being rendered in 3D.<ref name=\"Collider\"/> Dunstan added that \"It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface to try to get a reaction out of you. Now, we get to push out a bit and envelop the viewer, still maintaining the patterns that have worked and been successful, but also to raise it up a notch.\"<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an \"interesting experience\".<ref name= \"Tobin\" /> Mandylor called the 3D shoot \"more tedious and longer\".<ref name=\"pressUK\"/> Flannery described the 3D aspect as being \"[not] shot in 3D so that you can, per&nbsp;se, see blood coming directly at you. It's in 3D for the texture and the depth, for the architecture, to get a sense that you're in the scene but there's no 'we want to see blood coming at the lens' it's nothing like that.

Morris closed his review by saying \"This alleged final edition trashes the perverse morality of [Jigsaw's] legacy to make him the [[Jerry Springer]] of gore\".<ref name=\"BostonReviewOct30\"/> Jason Anderson of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' gave the film two out of four stars.

He thought Greutert gave the film a \"pulpy energy\" and described the film's traps and gore as having an \"unpretentious sensibility\" to films by [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]].<ref name=\"TorontoStarOct30\"/> Alan Jones of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' gave the film four out of five stars saying, \"though the film initially borders on parody, once the ever-ingenious trapping begins \u2013 using fishhooks, superglue, ovens and dental equipment \u2013 the chills run on turbo drive right through to the greatest hits flashback finale\". He implied that the \"shock scenarios\" were borrowed from sources such as, ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' and the work of [[Lucio Fulci]]. Jones said the 3D did not add to the experience saying \"the CGI blood splatter something of a distraction to the almost Shakespearean crescendo of anguish and carnage\".<ref name=\"RadioTimes\"/> The film was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for \"Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3D\", but it lost to ''[[The Last Airbender]]''.\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Jigsaw (2017 film)}}\nAlthough ''Saw 3D'' was intended to be the finale for the film series,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bowles|first1=Scott|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|website=USA Today|accessdate=18 February 2016}}</ref> it was reported in February 2016 that an eighth film under the working title ''Saw: Legacy'' was being developed.

It is the seventh installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], and [[Cary Elwes]].\n\nThe film focuses on a man who falsely claims to be a Jigsaw survivor, becoming a local celebrity. However, he soon finds himself part of a real Jigsaw game where he must ultimately save his wife. Meanwhile, [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]] reveals to an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs officer]] that rogue [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]] is the man responsible for the recent Jigsaw games, and Hoffman hunts her down.\n\nAn eighth installment<!-- Not the same eighth installment as \"Jigsaw\" (2017 film). --> was planned, but the decrease in the [[Saw VI#Box office|box office performance for ''Saw VI'']] compared to previous installments led to ''Saw 3D'' being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for ''Saw VIII'' being incorporated into ''Saw 3D''. ''[[Saw V]]'' director [[David Hackl]] was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. [[Principal photography]] took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in [[post-production]].\n\n''Saw 3D'' was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on October 22, 2010, by Lionsgate, but was pushed back a week from its original release date of October 22, 2010, to October 29, 2010; it was released a day earlier in the United Kingdom and Australia. ''Saw 3D'' opened at number one making over $22.5 million. It was eventually followed by an eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nTwo men, Brad and Ryan, awaken in a Metropolitan Storefront, bound at the wrists to opposite sides of a worktable with a circular saw in front of each of them. Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw, and [[Billy the Puppet|Jigsaw's puppet]] informs the men that Dina has been manipulating both of them, driving them into criminal activity to fulfill her material desires. They are given a choice \u2014 either Brad or Ryan can be killed, or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut by the saw. However, Ryan notices Dina is only cheering for whoever's winning, making him realize she's only using them, so he makes peace with Brad, and they allow Dina to die instead.\n\nAfter witnessing [[Mark Hoffman]]'s survival and being attacked, Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an internal affairs detective from the precinct where he works, and incriminates him in exchange for protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman for years, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang \u2014 Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara \u2014 and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including [[Saw (2004 film)|Lawrence Gordon]], who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a [[self-help]] guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying a story of his own survival. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Bobby awakens in a cage in an abandoned asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Bobby's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist; Suzanne, his lawyer; and Cale, his best friend and co-conspirator, all in separate traps representing the [[three wise monkeys]] and all of them are killed despite his efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Bobby finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap he claimed to have survived: he must drive two hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a [[brazen bull]] capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.\n\nGibson eventually discovers the game's location and sends a [[SWAT]] team, who are sealed in another room and killed by toxic gas. Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse sitting in front of several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic [[turret gun]] rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her jaws apart.\n\nAfter destroying his workshop, Hoffman is attacked and subdued by three pig-masked figures, one of whom is Lawrence Gordon. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Gordon has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, which contained a videotape, in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. As a result, Gordon has Hoffman brought to the bathroom from the first film and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. When Hoffman tries to reach for the [[hacksaw]] used to sever Gordon's leg, in an effort to escape, Gordon throws it out of the room, turns off the lights and yells \"Game Over\", before sealing the door, leaving Hoffman to die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]]\n* [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] as [[List of Saw characters#Bobby Dagen|Bobby \nDagen]]\n* [[Chad Donella]] as [[List of Saw characters#Matt Gibson|Detective Matt Gibson]]\n* [[Gina Holden]] as [[List of Saw characters#Joyce Dagen|Joyce Dagen]]\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer/Jigsaw]]\n* Laurence Anthony as [[List of Saw characters#Rogers|Rogers]]\n* [[Dean Armstrong]] as [[List of Saw characters#Cale|Cale]]\n* [[Naomi Snieckus]] as [[List of Saw characters#Nina|Nina]]\n* Rebecca Marshall as [[List of Saw characters#Suzanne|Suzanne]]\n* James Van Patten as [[List of Saw characters#Adam Heffner|Dr. Heffner]]\n* [[Sebastian Pigott]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Brad]]\n* [[Jon Cor]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Ryan]]\n* Anne Greene as  [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Dina]]\n* [[Chester Bennington]] as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Evan]]\n* Dru Viergever as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Dan]]\n* [[Gabby West]] as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Kara]]\n* Benjamin Clost as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Jake]]\n* [[Olunik\u00e9 Adeliyi]] as [[List of Saw characters#Sidney|Sidney]]\n* [[Ishan Morris|Ish Morris]] as Alex\n* [[Tanedra Howard]] as [[List of Saw characters#Simone|Simone]]\n* [[Shauna MacDonald]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brent and Tara Abbott|Tara Abbott]]\n* Janelle Hutchison as [[List of Saw characters#Addy and Allen|Addy]]\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mallick|Mallick]]\n* Larissa Gomes as [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|Emily]]\n* Kevin Rushton as [[List of Saw characters#Trevor|Trevor]]\n* [[Noam Jenkins]] as [[List of Saw characters#Michael Marks|Michael Marks]]\n* [[Carlos D\u00edaz (actor)|Carlos D\u00edaz]] as Coroner Worker\n* [[Rachel Wilson]] as Mother\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Saw VII filming Metro Hall Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|A scene being constructed at the [[Metro Hall]] of Toronto in April 2010.]]\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported in July 2009 that [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] [[Green-light|greenlit]] ''Saw VII'' and announced [[David Hackl]] would return to direct, his last film being ''[[Saw V]]''.

The storyline for a ''Saw VIII'' was combined into ''Saw VII''; this decision was primarily due to [[Saw VI#Box office|''Saw VI''{{'s}} below average box office performance]].<ref name=\"SawVIII\"/><ref name=\"QA With Patrick Melton\"/>  On July&nbsp;22, 2010, in an interview with ''[[USA Today]]'' the producers confirmed that ''Saw VII'' will officially end the film series.<ref name=\"usatoday\"/> Burg told [[Reuters]] that, \"In every ''Saw'' movie, we left questions open and in ''Saw VII'' we answer every question the audience has ever had\". He added that, \"even new viewers will be able to follow and get caught up to speed\".<ref name=\"reuters\"/>\n\nIn January 2010, [[Kevin Greutert]], who made his directorial debut with the sixth film, was about to begin work on [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]'' when [[Twisted Pictures]] suddenly dismissed Hackl and forced Greutert on the project by exercising a \"contractual clause\" in his contract, much to Greutert's dismay.<ref name=\"Greutert director\"/><ref name=\"LAtimes\"/><ref name=\"bd6\" /><ref name=\"bd6-2\" /> When Greutert arrived on set two weeks before filming began, he performed a \"compressive re-write\" of the script.  Melton explained that, \"He has a lot of ideas, but it's a bit hard and extreme to implement all of these ideas because sets have been built, people have been cast, props have been bought or created, and with the ''Saw'' films they are so specific in set design because of the traps. It becomes very problematic and difficult to change things a whole bunch right in the middle of it\".<ref name=\"Patrick Melton Talks The Collector 2\"/>\n\n''Saw 3D'' was originally intended to be two separate films. According to Melton and Dunstan, \"It was our original intention to make the final ''Saw'' in two parts, but when ''[Saw] VI'' didn't do so well, the studio got nervous and we were only allowed to make one more.\"<ref name=\"2Parts\">http://bloody-disgusting.com/exclusives/3404119/previous-saw-entry-supposed-split-two-exclusive/</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{see also|List of Saw characters}}\n[[File:Gina Holden Elizabeth Rowin Saw 3D premiere cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Gina Holden]] (Joyce) at the film's premiere.]]\n<!-- NOTE: It's from David Hackl's OFFICIAL twitter feed.

Before choosing 3D, Burg and others viewed a minute of the original ''Saw'' film rendered in 3D and were pleased, which led to them choosing 3D for the seventh film.<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  The sets and traps were designed to take advantage of 3D.<ref name=\"IGN Interview about 3D\"/> To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot [[Hand-held camera|handheld]]. ''Saw 3D'' was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He said in an interview with ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, \"If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's a good chance that when you look at a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space. It looks like a mistake. These things aren't an issue at all in 2D but in 3D are obsessively problematic\".<ref name=\"PopularMechanics\"/> Given the cost of filming in 3D, Greutert said the budget was $17 million, the most expensive of the series.<ref name=\"budget\"/> [[Principal photography]] began on February 8, 2010, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and wrapped on April 12, 2010.<ref name=\"bd7\"/><ref name=\"Saw VII Wraps\"/> Filming took place mostly at Toronto's [[Cinespace Film Studios]].<ref name=\"Cinespace\"/>\n\n[[File:Kevin Greutert and Elizabeth Rowin at Comic Con 2010.jpg|thumb|left|''Saw 3D'' director Kevin Greutert and his wife, actress Elizabeth Rowin, at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2010.]]\nWhen determining the style of 3D shooting they wanted to use, Burg felt that the audience would want several moments where objects move into the audience, comparing this to ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D]]''. He acknowledged that this method would be used, but expressed an interest in shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of [[first-person shooter]] video games being rendered in 3D.<ref name=\"Collider\"/> Dunstan added that \"It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface to try to get a reaction out of you. Now, we get to push out a bit and envelop the viewer, still maintaining the patterns that have worked and been successful, but also to raise it up a notch.\"<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an \"interesting experience\".<ref name= \"Tobin\" /> Mandylor called the 3D shoot \"more tedious and longer\".<ref name=\"pressUK\"/> Flannery described the 3D aspect as being \"[not] shot in 3D so that you can, per&nbsp;se, see blood coming directly at you. It's in 3D for the texture and the depth, for the architecture, to get a sense that you're in the scene but there's no 'we want to see blood coming at the lens' it's nothing like that.

She told [[VH1]], \"They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary!

Private copies were still legal to own and personal use was not punishable; however any public screening was a highly prohibited and punishable act. There is a censored \"Keine Jugendfreigabe/No youth admitted\" version, but it has all the violent scenes cut out.

He said the central storyline of the films was beginning to feel \"played out\".<ref name=\"E! Review Oct28\"/> Rob Nelson of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review. He called the film \"relentlessly repugnant\" that would please fans, but offer no surprise. He went on to say, \"Apart from these limb-pulling setpieces, tech credits appear fairly shoddy, as do any 3D effects that don't include flying viscera. The editing relies on lazy flashbacks, while the dialogue remains as horrific as the killings.\"<ref name=\"Variety review Oct28\"/>  Kim Newman of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film two out of five stars, calling it \"a step down from last year's much more pointed ''[[Saw VI]]''\". He criticized the repetition of the plot but thought bringing back Jigsaw survivors was a \"nice idea\". He closed his review with, \"There are a scattering of infallibly cringe-making horrors, but on the whole ''Saw 3D'' could do with more depth\".<ref name=\"EmpireReview Oct28\"/>\n\nEric Goldman of [[IGN|IGN Movies]] gave the film two out of five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from ''Saw VI'', but did point out his favorite and highlight of the film as the \"garage trap\". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said \"The 3D is used as you might expect it to be \u2013 which is to say, this is no [[James Cameron]] immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, and there is some fun had with blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>  Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a mixed review. He said ''Saw 3D'' is \"consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions\", but said most of the film's traps lack the \"[[Rube Goldberg]]-style cleverness that marked the series\".  Scheck went on to say that it was \"unfortunate\" the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an \"exceedingly bland stand-in\". He called the visual impact of the 3D \"negligible\".<ref name=\"THRreviewOct29\"/> \n[[File:James Wan and Leigh Whannell Saw 3D premiere.jpg|thumb|right|Creators of the ''Saw'' franchise, [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]] at the premiere.]]\n\nRoger Moore of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' gave the film one out of five stars saying, \"It's all bunk and has been for years. These are all no-win scenarios. Whatever moral lessons were presented in the earliest ''Saw'' films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?' Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise\".<ref name=\"Orlando Sentinel Oct28\"/>  Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film the most \"straightforward\" of the series and the \"most consistently (though not inventively) violent\". He ended his review saying, \"If you see the film in a theater equipped with [[RealD 3D]] and [[Dolby Digital|Dolby sound]], you'll come away with a pretty good idea of what it would feel like to have flying body parts hit you in the face\".<ref name=\"NYTreviewOct29\"/> \n[[File:Cary Elwes Saw 3D premiere cropped.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Cary Elwes|Elwes]] reprises his role as [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], last seen in the [[Saw (2004 film)|first film]], in newly filmed scenes as opposed to flashbacks or [[Stock footage|archive footage]].]]\nElizabeth Weitzman of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave the film one out of five stars. She criticized the lack of Bell's screentime saying, \"What the filmmakers of the last four ''Saw'' movies have somehow overlooked is that Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is the linchpin of these films. It's right there in the title, so you'd think they'd realize what they lost when they killed him off in ''Saw III''. But it's been downhill ever since, and we hit bottom today\". She admitted that the performances have become \"painfully stilted\" and called the script \"a jumble of nothing punctuated by barely-trying death traps\". She went on to say, \"It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just to up the body count\" and closed her review with, \"No matter how much money ''The Final Chapter'' makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over\".<ref name=\"NYDailyreviewOct29\"/>\n\n[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called the film the \"most gruesome and least coherent of the seven movies\". He felt that some of the film's \"games\" were just randomly forced into the film, saying that kind of \"episodic approach\" and 3D works for a \"far more innovative series like ''[[Jackass 3D]]''\".  Morris closed his review by saying \"This alleged final edition trashes the perverse morality of [Jigsaw's] legacy to make him the [[Jerry Springer]] of gore\".<ref name=\"BostonReviewOct30\"/> Jason Anderson of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' gave the film two out of four stars.  He praised ''Saw 3D''{{'}}s plot for not being as confusing as previous films, for which he described as having to \"generally require an encyclopedic knowledge of the series' many plot strands\" in order to understand them. He thought Greutert gave the film a \"pulpy energy\" and described the film's traps and gore as having an \"unpretentious sensibility\" to films by [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]].<ref name=\"TorontoStarOct30\"/> Alan Jones of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' gave the film four out of five stars saying, \"though the film initially borders on parody, once the ever-ingenious trapping begins \u2013 using fishhooks, superglue, ovens and dental equipment \u2013 the chills run on turbo drive right through to the greatest hits flashback finale\". He implied that the \"shock scenarios\" were borrowed from sources such as, ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' and the work of [[Lucio Fulci]]. Jones said the 3D did not add to the experience saying \"the CGI blood splatter something of a distraction to the almost Shakespearean crescendo of anguish and carnage\".<ref name=\"RadioTimes\"/> The film was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for \"Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3D\", but it lost to ''[[The Last Airbender]]''.\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Jigsaw (2017 film)}}\nAlthough ''Saw 3D'' was intended to be the finale for the film series,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bowles|first1=Scott|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|website=USA Today|accessdate=18 February 2016}}</ref> it was reported in February 2016 that an eighth film under the working title ''Saw: Legacy'' was being developed.

It purports to be the charter by which \u00c6thelred granted 300 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] (about 36,000 acres) at Gloucester to King [[Osric, king of the Hwicce|Osric of the Hwicce]], and another 300 at Pershore to Osric's brother Oswald.<ref name=Sims94-6>Sims-Williams, ''Religion and literature'', pp. 94-6.</ref><ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+70 S 70]</ref> It is preserved only as a copy in a 14th-century register of Gloucester, where it is followed by two charters listing the endowments made to the abbey until the reign of Link [[Burgred of Mercia]] (852-874).<ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+209 S 209]</ref><ref name=S1782>[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/content/charter/1782.html S 1782]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The 300 hides mentioned here are unlikely to be a contemporary detail, as they were intended to represent the triple [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] which later made up the area of Worcestershire.<ref name=Sims94-6 /> Historian [[H. P. R. Finberg]] suggests that the foundation charter may have been drafted in the 9th century, based on some authentic material.<ref>Finberg, ''Early charters'', pp. 153-66.</ref> Oswald's foundation of a monastery at Pershore is not stated explicitly in the charter, but the Worcester chronicle ''[[Cronica de Anglia]]'', written ''c''. 1150, reports it under the annal for 683, and [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], consulting the now lost ''Annals of Pershore'', places the event around 689.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref>John Leland, ''Collectanea'', ed. Hearne, pp. 240-1.</ref> Patrick Sims-Williams suggests that the foundation by Oswald may also represent an oral tradition at Pershore, as its archives were probably destroyed in fires of 1002 and again in 1223.<ref name=Sims94-6 />\n\nIn the 9th century, Pershore comes to light again as a minster under the patronage of [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Mercian kings]]. In other charters contained in the Gloucester register, [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]] (r. 796-821) and Burgred are recorded as having been patrons of Pershore.<ref name=S1782 /> A charter of [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] refers back to a grant of privileges by Coenwulf at the request of his [[ealdorman]] (''[[dux]]'') Beornnoth.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref name=S786>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+786 S 786]</ref>\n\n===Refoundation===\nIn the reign of King Edgar (959-975), Pershore reappears as one of the abbeys to be re-established (or restored) under the programme of [[Benedictine]] reform. Writing ''c''. 1000, the Ramsey monk [[Byrhtferth]] relates that under the auspices of [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald, bishop of Worcester]], seven monasteries were founded in his diocese, notably including Pershore.<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', p. 494 (ch. 8).</ref> The first abbot was one Foldbriht,<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', pp. 494-5 (ch. 9).</ref> whose name is sufficiently rare to suggest that he may be the same Foldbriht whom Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold]] previously installed at [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]] and used to be a monk of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]] before that time.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', p. cciii.</ref>\n\nThe refoundation is what lies behind an exceptionally elaborate charter for Pershore, dated 972, in which King Edgar is presented as granting new lands and privileges as well as confirming old ones, such as the one granted by Coenwulf.<ref name=S786 /> The authenticity of this document, however, has been questioned. [[Simon Keynes]] in 1980 showed that it belongs to the so-called ''Orthodoxorum'' group of charters, so named after the initial word of their [[Preface|proem]], which he concluded were forgeries based on a charter of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred II]]'s reign.<ref>Keynes, ''The diplomas of King \u00c6thelred 'the Unready' 978-1016'', pp. 98-100</ref> Since then, Susan Kelly and John Hudson have vindicated the status of some of these charters, including the one for Pershore, which is written in square minuscule characteristic of some of Edgar's charters.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', pp. cxcix-cciv</ref> More recently, Peter Stokes has brought to light a variant copy of the charter and suggests that two different versions may have been produced around the same time, somewhere between 972 and 1066. A possible scenario is that they were produced to make up for the loss of the original charter(s), perhaps shortly after the fire which is reported to have destroyed the abbey in ''c''. 1002 (see below).<ref name=Stokes72-3>Stokes, \"King Edgar's charter for Pershore, 972\", pp. 72-3.</ref>\n\nThe 12th-century historian [[William of Malmesbury]], who seems unaware of any pre-existing minster, claims that one \u00c6thelweard (''Egelwardus''), whom he describes as \"ealdorman of Dorset\", had founded the abbey of Pershore in the time of King Edgar.<ref name=Gesta-iv.162>William of Malmesbury, ''Gesta pontificum'' IV, ch. 162, ed. and tr, Winterbottom and Thomson</ref> Similarly, [[Osbert de Clare|Osbert]]'s ''Life'' of [[Eadburh of Winchester]] alleges that one ''Alwardus'', who is styled ''comes'' and ''consul'', was responsible for the refoundation. Both authors also attribute to him a role in the translation of some of the saint's relics to Pershore. Osbert writes that an abbess of Nunnaminster had sold some relics to \u00c6thelweard (''Alwardus''), who in turn handed them over for the refoundation of Pershore.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ridyard, ''The royal saints of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> Some scholars have identified him with [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], the well-known chronicler and ealdorman of the western shires.<ref name=World11-3>Williams, ''World before Domesday'', pp. 11-3.</ref> {{#tag:ref|A tradition at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], only 10&nbsp;miles from Pershore, also remembers a royal kinsman called \u00c6thelweard (''Haylwardus'') as its patron as well as that of [[Cranborne Abbey]] (Dorset), of which Tewkesbury was a dependency.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347>Jayakumar, \"Reform and retribution\", p. 347.</ref> The account, which places his floruit in the time of King \u00c6thelred and Dunstan, is recorded in a late chronicle of that house, written in the 15th century, but may very well be based on older sources.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347 /> This \u00c6thelweard is to be identified with the \u00c6thelweard ''M\u00e6w'' whose activities, including the foundation of Cranborne, are attested in sources closer to his day.<ref name=World11-3 /> Historian Jayakumar suggests that he may be the chronicler [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], ealdorman of the western shires, as both were royal kinsmen and in the Tewkesbury Chronicle, Cranborne is said to have been founded ''in suo dominio''.<ref name=reform347 /> Ann Williams, however, prefers to see them as separate persons.<ref name=World11-3 />|group=note}}\n\nWhatever high-level patronage the foundation may have received, it was not enough to sustain its fortunes for very long. Precisely what happened to Pershore in the later 10th century is poorly documented, but some sources seem to hint that it went into decline during the succession crisis which emerged in the wake of King Edgar's death.<ref name=Williams167-8>Williams, \"''Princeps Merciorum gentis''\", pp. 167-8</ref> William of Malmesbury says that \"it, too, like the others, decayed to a pitiful extent, and was reduced by more than a half\".<ref name=Gesta-iv.162 /> According to Leland, the ''Annals of Pershore'' hold an earl called ''Delfer'' responsible for depriving the abbey of several of its lands. This ''Delfer'' has been interpreted as a misreading for [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6lfhere]] (d. 983), ealdorman of Mercia<ref name=Williams167-8 /> (whom Leland mentions elsewhere).<ref name=LelandIter>\"Oswaldus ''primum instituit Canonicos seculares apud'' Persore.{{Clear}} ''Postea fuit ibidem chorus monachorum''.{{Clear}}''Rursus Canonici inducti''.{{Clear}}''Postea monachi per'' Edgarum.{{Clear}} Elferus ''abstulit pr\u00e6dia monachis''.{{Clear}}Odda ''comes ejus filius restituit''.{{Clear}}''Monasterium conflagravit & \u00e0 monachis desertum est''.{{Clear}}''Monachi'' Westmonasterienses ''pr\u00e6dia usurpabant''.{{Clear}}Wada ''comes attulit reliqias S.''

Hearne, vol. 5, p. 2.</ref> While himself a patron of Ely and Abingdon, \u00c6lfhere was also charged with despoiling reformed monasteries during [[Edward the Martyr]]'s brief reign (975-978). The targets included houses refounded by Bishop Oswald or Bishop \u00c6thelwold and considerably enriched under the patronage of \u00c6thelstan Half-King's sons, notably [[\u00c6thelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia|\u00c6thelwine, ealdorman of East Anglia]]. [[Evesham Abbey]], for instance, as later reported by [[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|its own chronicle]], also claimed to have lost several of its lands in this way, and [[Winchcombe]] was disbanded altogether. \u00c6thelwine, in his turn, was remembered at Ely as a despoiler of its lands. Tensions between \u00c6lfhere and Bishop Oswald, whose authorities overlapped, and between \u00c6lfhere and \u00c6thelwine, with whom Oswald maintained a close relationship, are therefore likely to have been the principal cause of the upheaval.<ref name=Williams167-8 /> Whether a liberty similar to that of [[Oswaldslow (hundred)|Oswaldslow]] was an extra cause for concern, compromising \u00c6lfhere's authority as ealdorman, cannot be ascertained from the sources.<ref name=Williams167-8 />\n\n===\"Second\" refoundation===\n[[File:Pershore Abbey Nave.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The chancel]]\nPershore suffered worse misfortune when, according to Leland, it was destroyed by fire and subsequently deserted by the monks,<ref name=LelandIter /><ref name=Victoria /> probably in the year 1002.<ref name=ODNBOdda>Williams, \"Odda, earl (''d''. 1056)\"</ref> The monastic archives were largely lost in the event, as no original record from before that date survives today.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> Pershore, however, found a generous patron in the wealthy nobleman [[Odda of Deerhurst]] (d. 1056), who restored many of its lands and granted new ones.

It purports to be the charter by which \u00c6thelred granted 300 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] (about 36,000 acres) at Gloucester to King [[Osric, king of the Hwicce|Osric of the Hwicce]], and another 300 at Pershore to Osric's brother Oswald.<ref name=Sims94-6>Sims-Williams, ''Religion and literature'', pp. 94-6.</ref><ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+70 S 70]</ref> It is preserved only as a copy in a 14th-century register of Gloucester, where it is followed by two charters listing the endowments made to the abbey until the reign of Link [[Burgred of Mercia]] (852-874).<ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+209 S 209]</ref><ref name=S1782>[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/content/charter/1782.html S 1782]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The 300 hides mentioned here are unlikely to be a contemporary detail, as they were intended to represent the triple [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] which later made up the area of Worcestershire.<ref name=Sims94-6 /> Historian [[H. P. R. Finberg]] suggests that the foundation charter may have been drafted in the 9th century, based on some authentic material.<ref>Finberg, ''Early charters'', pp. 153-66.</ref> Oswald's foundation of a monastery at Pershore is not stated explicitly in the charter, but the Worcester chronicle ''[[Cronica de Anglia]]'', written ''c''. 1150, reports it under the annal for 683, and [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], consulting the now lost ''Annals of Pershore'', places the event around 689.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref>John Leland, ''Collectanea'', ed. Hearne, pp. 240-1.</ref> Patrick Sims-Williams suggests that the foundation by Oswald may also represent an oral tradition at Pershore, as its archives were probably destroyed in fires of 1002 and again in 1223.<ref name=Sims94-6 />\n\nIn the 9th century, Pershore comes to light again as a minster under the patronage of [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Mercian kings]]. In other charters contained in the Gloucester register, [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]] (r. 796-821) and Burgred are recorded as having been patrons of Pershore.<ref name=S1782 /> A charter of [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] refers back to a grant of privileges by Coenwulf at the request of his [[ealdorman]] (''[[dux]]'') Beornnoth.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref name=S786>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+786 S 786]</ref>\n\n===Refoundation===\nIn the reign of King Edgar (959-975), Pershore reappears as one of the abbeys to be re-established (or restored) under the programme of [[Benedictine]] reform. Writing ''c''. 1000, the Ramsey monk [[Byrhtferth]] relates that under the auspices of [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald, bishop of Worcester]], seven monasteries were founded in his diocese, notably including Pershore.<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', p. 494 (ch. 8).</ref> The first abbot was one Foldbriht,<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', pp. 494-5 (ch. 9).</ref> whose name is sufficiently rare to suggest that he may be the same Foldbriht whom Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold]] previously installed at [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]] and used to be a monk of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]] before that time.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', p. cciii.</ref>\n\nThe refoundation is what lies behind an exceptionally elaborate charter for Pershore, dated 972, in which King Edgar is presented as granting new lands and privileges as well as confirming old ones, such as the one granted by Coenwulf.<ref name=S786 /> The authenticity of this document, however, has been questioned. [[Simon Keynes]] in 1980 showed that it belongs to the so-called ''Orthodoxorum'' group of charters, so named after the initial word of their [[Preface|proem]], which he concluded were forgeries based on a charter of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred II]]'s reign.<ref>Keynes, ''The diplomas of King \u00c6thelred 'the Unready' 978-1016'', pp. 98-100</ref> Since then, Susan Kelly and John Hudson have vindicated the status of some of these charters, including the one for Pershore, which is written in square minuscule characteristic of some of Edgar's charters.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', pp. cxcix-cciv</ref> More recently, Peter Stokes has brought to light a variant copy of the charter and suggests that two different versions may have been produced around the same time, somewhere between 972 and 1066. A possible scenario is that they were produced to make up for the loss of the original charter(s), perhaps shortly after the fire which is reported to have destroyed the abbey in ''c''. 1002 (see below).<ref name=Stokes72-3>Stokes, \"King Edgar's charter for Pershore, 972\", pp. 72-3.</ref>\n\nThe 12th-century historian [[William of Malmesbury]], who seems unaware of any pre-existing minster, claims that one \u00c6thelweard (''Egelwardus''), whom he describes as \"ealdorman of Dorset\", had founded the abbey of Pershore in the time of King Edgar.<ref name=Gesta-iv.162>William of Malmesbury, ''Gesta pontificum'' IV, ch. 162, ed. and tr, Winterbottom and Thomson</ref> Similarly, [[Osbert de Clare|Osbert]]'s ''Life'' of [[Eadburh of Winchester]] alleges that one ''Alwardus'', who is styled ''comes'' and ''consul'', was responsible for the refoundation. Both authors also attribute to him a role in the translation of some of the saint's relics to Pershore. Osbert writes that an abbess of Nunnaminster had sold some relics to \u00c6thelweard (''Alwardus''), who in turn handed them over for the refoundation of Pershore.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ridyard, ''The royal saints of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> Some scholars have identified him with [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], the well-known chronicler and ealdorman of the western shires.<ref name=World11-3>Williams, ''World before Domesday'', pp. 11-3.</ref> {{#tag:ref|A tradition at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], only 10&nbsp;miles from Pershore, also remembers a royal kinsman called \u00c6thelweard (''Haylwardus'') as its patron as well as that of [[Cranborne Abbey]] (Dorset), of which Tewkesbury was a dependency.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347>Jayakumar, \"Reform and retribution\", p. 347.</ref> The account, which places his floruit in the time of King \u00c6thelred and Dunstan, is recorded in a late chronicle of that house, written in the 15th century, but may very well be based on older sources.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347 /> This \u00c6thelweard is to be identified with the \u00c6thelweard ''M\u00e6w'' whose activities, including the foundation of Cranborne, are attested in sources closer to his day.<ref name=World11-3 /> Historian Jayakumar suggests that he may be the chronicler [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], ealdorman of the western shires, as both were royal kinsmen and in the Tewkesbury Chronicle, Cranborne is said to have been founded ''in suo dominio''.<ref name=reform347 /> Ann Williams, however, prefers to see them as separate persons.<ref name=World11-3 />|group=note}}\n\nWhatever high-level patronage the foundation may have received, it was not enough to sustain its fortunes for very long. Precisely what happened to Pershore in the later 10th century is poorly documented, but some sources seem to hint that it went into decline during the succession crisis which emerged in the wake of King Edgar's death.<ref name=Williams167-8>Williams, \"''Princeps Merciorum gentis''\", pp. 167-8</ref> William of Malmesbury says that \"it, too, like the others, decayed to a pitiful extent, and was reduced by more than a half\".<ref name=Gesta-iv.162 /> According to Leland, the ''Annals of Pershore'' hold an earl called ''Delfer'' responsible for depriving the abbey of several of its lands. This ''Delfer'' has been interpreted as a misreading for [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6lfhere]] (d. 983), ealdorman of Mercia<ref name=Williams167-8 /> (whom Leland mentions elsewhere).<ref name=LelandIter>\"Oswaldus ''primum instituit Canonicos seculares apud'' Persore.{{Clear}} ''Postea fuit ibidem chorus monachorum''.{{Clear}}''Rursus Canonici inducti''.{{Clear}}''Postea monachi per'' Edgarum.{{Clear}} Elferus ''abstulit pr\u00e6dia monachis''.{{Clear}}Odda ''comes ejus filius restituit''.{{Clear}}''Monasterium conflagravit & \u00e0 monachis desertum est''.{{Clear}}''Monachi'' Westmonasterienses ''pr\u00e6dia usurpabant''.{{Clear}}Wada ''comes attulit reliqias S.''

Hearne, vol. 5, p. 2.</ref> While himself a patron of Ely and Abingdon, \u00c6lfhere was also charged with despoiling reformed monasteries during [[Edward the Martyr]]'s brief reign (975-978). The targets included houses refounded by Bishop Oswald or Bishop \u00c6thelwold and considerably enriched under the patronage of \u00c6thelstan Half-King's sons, notably [[\u00c6thelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia|\u00c6thelwine, ealdorman of East Anglia]]. [[Evesham Abbey]], for instance, as later reported by [[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|its own chronicle]], also claimed to have lost several of its lands in this way, and [[Winchcombe]] was disbanded altogether. \u00c6thelwine, in his turn, was remembered at Ely as a despoiler of its lands. Tensions between \u00c6lfhere and Bishop Oswald, whose authorities overlapped, and between \u00c6lfhere and \u00c6thelwine, with whom Oswald maintained a close relationship, are therefore likely to have been the principal cause of the upheaval.<ref name=Williams167-8 /> Whether a liberty similar to that of [[Oswaldslow (hundred)|Oswaldslow]] was an extra cause for concern, compromising \u00c6lfhere's authority as ealdorman, cannot be ascertained from the sources.<ref name=Williams167-8 />\n\n===\"Second\" refoundation===\n[[File:Pershore Abbey Nave.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The chancel]]\nPershore suffered worse misfortune when, according to Leland, it was destroyed by fire and subsequently deserted by the monks,<ref name=LelandIter /><ref name=Victoria /> probably in the year 1002.<ref name=ODNBOdda>Williams, \"Odda, earl (''d''. 1056)\"</ref> The monastic archives were largely lost in the event, as no original record from before that date survives today.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> Pershore, however, found a generous patron in the wealthy nobleman [[Odda of Deerhurst]] (d. 1056), who restored many of its lands and granted new ones. It has been suggested{{who|date=April 2019}} that he was a kinsman of the ealdorman \u00c6thelweard. The earliest extant record from the archive of Pershore, a charter of 1014 by which King \u00c6thelred granted Mathon (Herefordshire) to ealdorman Leofwine, may testify to Odda's restorations of lands to the house.<ref name=ODNBOdda /><ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+932 S 932].</ref> The monastery was active again by the 1020s, as its abbot Brihtheah was promoted bishop of Worcester in 1033.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> Odda's brother \u00c6lfric was buried at Pershore in 1053, joined three years later by Odda himself.<ref name=ODNBOdda />\n\nIn Odda's lifetime the total landed assets of Pershore grew to 300 hides, but after the loss of its benefactor in 1056 about two-thirds were seized and given to [[Edward the Confessor]]'s new foundation at Westminster.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> The original single sheet which preserves the fullest version of King Edgar's refoundation charter (though it need not be authentic) is marked by a number of textual alterations and erasures. Some of these changes may suggest a response to the abbey's proprietary struggles.<ref name=Stokes72-3 />\n\nFrom the early 12th century there is evidence that Pershore Abbey claimed possession of some of the relics of Saint [[Eadburh of Winchester]], the [[saint]]ed daughter of King [[Edward the Elder]]. Her body was initially buried at [[Nunnaminster]] (Winchester), but it was translated in the 960s to a more central spot in [[Winchester]], and again to a shrine in the 970s. Among several possibilities, Susan Ridyard has suggested that the Eadburh whose relics were preserved at Pershore may have been a Mercian saint of that name whose identity had become obscure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Later Middle Ages===\nThe main building was begun in about 1100.  In the fourteenth century it benefitted from the generosity of [[Adam de Harvington]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] 1327\u201330, who was probably related to the Abbot, William of Harvington. The abbey was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] in 1539. A monk of Pershore, named Richard Beerly, was one of those who gave evidence to [[Thomas Cromwell]] in 1536 about the misbehaviour of some of his brothers, writing that \"Monckes drynk an bowll after collacyon tell ten or xii of the clock, and cum to mattens as dronck as myss, and sume at cardes, sume at dyss.\"{{refn|{{cite book|editor-last=Wright|editor-first=Thomas|series=Camden Society Old Series: Volume XXVI|title=Three Chapters of Letters Relating to the Suppression of Monasteries|chapter=LX.

He also managed [[Wingate F.C.|Wingate]].\n\nAfter beginning his career as an amateur in the [[Stanley, County Durham|Stanley]] area, Smith was signed by [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in 1933 following a trial. He was signed by [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1935 and would make 93 appearances for the club. He joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 1938, and remained with the club through the [[World War II|war]] years. Smith made guest appearances for Fulham, [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].\n\nAt the end of the war, Smith joined [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] but was then poached by [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] rivals [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] towards the end of the [[1946\u201347 Colchester United F.C. season|1946\u201347 season]]. He made a return to [[The Football League|League]] football in 1947, joining [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. [[Bedford Town F.C.|Bedford Town]] signed Smith for the [[1948\u201349 Southern Football League|1948\u201349 season]], where he was made [[Captain (association football)|captain]]. He then became manager of [[Wingate F.C.|Wingate]] in 1949.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Stanley, County Durham|Stanley]], Smith had trials for three [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs having developed as an amateur player with South Moor and [[Annfield Plain F.C.|Annfield Plain]]. Following trials with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in the early 1930s, Charlton signed Smith in 1933. He scored six goals in 23 appearances for Charlton before making a move to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in March 1935 for a \u00a31,000 fee.\n\nSmith helped Fulham reach the semi-final of the [[FA Cup]] in 1936 and went on to score 19 goals in 93 appearances.<ref name=\"WWCU\"/> [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] signed Smith from Fulham on 4 February 1938 for \u00a32,500.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=111&player=849 |title=Trevor Smith |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Holmesdale.net |accessdate=17 March 2016 }}</ref> Here, he scored 14 goals in 57 games, but his Palace career was interrupted by [[World War II]].

These units were tested on the [[Piccadilly line]] and remained in service after production trains were introduced. Later they were transferred to the [[Northern line]], but in 1995 they were replaced as non-standard by [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 Stock]] cascaded from the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]].\n\n==Background==\nThe introduction of the [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 Stock]] released considerable numbers of Standard Stock trains, which were scheduled to make up the shortfall on the Central line resulting from the extensions to the line. However, this process was interrupted by the [[Second World War]], and although much of the Standard Stock had been through Acton Works for refurbishment, it was stored, as the opening of the extensions was delayed. Further refurbishment was carried out as the extensions opened between 1946 and 1949, but the stock proved to be unreliable after such a long period of storage. With the Piccadilly line also needing more trains, a plan for new rolling stock was formulated in 1948.{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |p=88}}\n\nThe plans were for 100 trains, each of seven cars. The British Transport Commission approved the project \"in principle\" in 1950, and a design contract was awarded to [[Metro-Cammell]]. A mock-up of a car body was constructed at Acton Works, and included some features which had been tried out on individual cars of 1938 stock, including some circular windows, and others that ran up above the roof line, to give passengers better visibility at stations. It was originally called 1951 Stock and then 1952 Stock when the programme was delayed. Bodywork would be of aluminium, rather than steel, but the official drawings showed that they would still be painted red, although experiments with unpainted aluminium [[London Underground R Stock|R Stock]] were taking place on the [[District line]] at the time. The high cost of building the trains, and a decline in passenger numbers, resulted in the plans being shelved in September 1952.{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |p=90}} When the situation was re-assessed in 1954, [[London Underground]] decided to build three seven-car trains incorporating new ideas, and these became the 1956 Stock. They became available in 1957, and a production run followed in 1959. The unpainted exterior was adopted for the prototype 1956 stock and production [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959]] / [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 stock]]{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |pp=92-93}} and the interiors were given a blue and grey colour scheme to match.\n\n==Design==\nThree seven-car trains of 1956 stock were built, each train by a different manufacturer. The companies involved were [[Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|Birmingham RC&W]], [[Gloucester Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|Gloucester RC&W]] and [[Metro-Cammell]], although the units supplied were of near-identical external appearance, and fitted with the same equipment. Each company provided a three-car and a four-car unit, the three-car unit consisting of a trailer car with a driving motor car at both ends, and the four-car units being of similar formation, but with an additional non-driving motor car in the rake.<ref name=bruce87>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=87}}</ref>\n\nWhile they were similar in many respects to the [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 stock]], the main differences were that the body panels were unpainted aluminium, rather than painted steel, a rubber suspension system was used on the bogies, reducing the number of parts that required regular maintenance, and the lighting was provided by fluorescent tubes, rather than incandescent bulbs. The front ends were flatter above the roof line, as the destination blind was fitted over the front cab door, rather than below the cab window. Control was provided by a PCM (Pneumatic Cam Motor) controller, supplied by [[Associated Electrical Industries]], which had proved to be reliable in the 1938 stock.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\nThe outer ends of the trains were not fitted with fully automatic couplers, so that in an emergency, two trains could be coupled together mechanically, but not electrically. Once the 1959 stock was delivered, the couplings were modified so that the two builds could work together. The electro-pneumatic brake was of a similar design to the 1938 stock, but the motor generator set was rather different, as it needed to supply alternating current at 110 V and 850&nbsp;Hz. The design was influenced by problems with the fluorescent lighting supply on the sub-surface [[London Underground R Stock|R stock]], which tended to generate a loud magnetic hum. The frequency was chosen to ensure that it could not interfere with lineside signalling.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\n[[File:Morden London Underground (5).jpg|thumb|left|Trains of 1956 Stock (left) and 1959 Stock (right), for which they were the prototype, stabled at Morden Depot in 1988]]\nFour speed settings were possible, three provided by the main controller, and the fourth by a weak field flag switch. Shunt mode was used in depots and yards, and was achieved by connecting resistance banks in series with the motors. In series mode, the resistance was removed in steps, until the two motors were in series between the 600 V supply. The maximum speed in this mode was around {{convert|15|mph|kph}}. Parallel mode reconnected the motors in parallel across the supply, and allowed operation up to normal full speed. The weak field flag switch allowed higher speeds still, but was only to be operated on open sections of the line. Its operation was visible from outside of the train.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\nThe first train  began working on the Piccadilly line on 9 September 1957, and all three were operational by the following April. Trials went well, and the design became the prototype for the 1959 stock. An order for 76 seven-car trains was placed with Metro-Cammell, and the first unit entered service on 14 December 1959. All 76 were in service by 30 March 1962. Visually, they were very similar to the 1956 stock, the obvious difference being that the earlier stock had five lights on the front, which were used to display the destination of the train, and the later stock had two headlights.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |pp=87\u201388}}</ref> When the 1956 stock was delivered, it was numbered in a series starting at 40000, but when the 1959 units arrived, they were numbered from 1012 upwards, leaving space for the 1956 stock to be inserted at the start of the sequence once they had been modified to be compatible.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=89}}</ref>\n\nWhile in operational service, a number of changes were made to the vehicles. When first delivered, Wedglock automatic couplers were fitted to the motor cars in the middle of the train, which provided mechanical, pneumatic and electrical connection. The motor cars at the outside ends of the units were only fitted with mechanical couplers. These were changed to Wedglock couplers as part of the work to make them compatible with the 1959 Stock. The renumbering of the cars into the same series as the 1959 Stock took place in 1965.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=7}} In 1971\u201372, stabling lights were fitted, located at the bottom right of the five headcode lamps,{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=8}} and in 1989, the headcode lights were replaced by two headlights, although the placement was somewhat different to that of the 1959 Stock.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=11}}\n\n===Demise===\nWhen [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] was bought to re-equip the Piccadilly line, the three 1956 Stock trains and the 1959 Stock trains were transferred to the Northern line. They continued to work there until delivery of [[London Underground 1992 Stock|1992 Stock]] began to replace the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 Stock]] working on the Central line. A few of the 1962 Stock trains were moved to the Northern line in 1993, to enable the 1956 Stock to be withdrawn, and to provide a modest increase in the number of trains running on the line.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=12}} Initially, four cars were moved to Upminster depot, awaiting scrapping, and another four went to Golders Green depot for storage.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=91}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=J Graeme|last=Bruce\n  |title=The London Underground Tube Stock\n  |publisher=Ian Allan and London Transport Museum\n  |location=Shepperton\n  |year=1988\n  |isbn=978-0-7110-1707-8\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Brian |last=Hardy\n  |title=London Underground Rolling Stock (13th Ed.)\n  |year=1993\n  |publisher=Capital Transport\n  |isbn=978-1-85414-164-4\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Brian|last=Hardy\n  |title=Underground Train File: Tube Stock 1933-1959\n  |year=2001\n  |isbn=978-1-85414-235-1\n  |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|London Underground 1956 Stock}}\n* [https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/collections-online/photographs London Transport Museum Photographic Archive]\n** {{ltmcollection|db/i0000bdb.jpg|1956 stock DM car 42000, 1957.}}\n** {{ltmcollection|f6/i0000bf6.jpg|1956 stock interior, 1957.}}\n\n{{Northern line navbox}}\n{{Piccadilly line navbox}}\n{{London Underground Rolling Stock}}\n\n[[Category:London Underground electric multiple units|1956]]\n[[Category:Train-related introductions in 1957]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox train\n|name         = 1956 Stock\n|image        = File:Golders Green London Underground 1956 Stock.jpg\n|image_size   = x258px\n|caption      = 1008 at {{Tubestation|Golders Green}} in 1988\n|manufacturer = [[Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|BRC&W]]<br>[[Gloucester Railway Carriage & Wagon Company|GRC&W]]<br>[[Metro-Cammell]]\n|service      = 1957\u20131995\n|family       =\n|replaced     =\n|lines        =\n|carlength    = DM {{convert|52|ft|2+5/16|in|m|2|abbr=on}}<br>NDM {{convert|51|ft|2+13/16|in|m|2|abbr=on}}<br>T {{convert|51|ft|2+13/16|in|m|2|abbr=on}}\n|trainlength  =\n|width        = {{convert|8|ft|6+1/4|in|m|3|abbr=on}}\n|height       = {{convert|9|ft|5+1/2|in|m|3|abbr=on}}\n|maxspeed     =\n|weight       = DM {{convert|26.48|LT|t ST}}<br>NDM {{convert|23.61|LT|t ST}}<br>T {{convert|20.56|LT|t ST}}\n|seating      = DM 42<br>NDM 40<br>T 40\n|stocktype    = [[London Underground infrastructure#Subsurface versus deep-level tube lines|Deep-level tube]]\n|notes        = {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|London transport}}\n}}\n\nBefore mass production of the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 tube stock]], three '''1956 Tube Stock''' units were built as prototypes.

The front ends were flatter above the roof line, as the destination blind was fitted over the front cab door, rather than below the cab window. Control was provided by a PCM (Pneumatic Cam Motor) controller, supplied by [[Associated Electrical Industries]], which had proved to be reliable in the 1938 stock.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\nThe outer ends of the trains were not fitted with fully automatic couplers, so that in an emergency, two trains could be coupled together mechanically, but not electrically. Once the 1959 stock was delivered, the couplings were modified so that the two builds could work together. The electro-pneumatic brake was of a similar design to the 1938 stock, but the motor generator set was rather different, as it needed to supply alternating current at 110 V and 850&nbsp;Hz. The design was influenced by problems with the fluorescent lighting supply on the sub-surface [[London Underground R Stock|R stock]], which tended to generate a loud magnetic hum. The frequency was chosen to ensure that it could not interfere with lineside signalling.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\n[[File:Morden London Underground (5).jpg|thumb|left|Trains of 1956 Stock (left) and 1959 Stock (right), for which they were the prototype, stabled at Morden Depot in 1988]]\nFour speed settings were possible, three provided by the main controller, and the fourth by a weak field flag switch. Shunt mode was used in depots and yards, and was achieved by connecting resistance banks in series with the motors. In series mode, the resistance was removed in steps, until the two motors were in series between the 600 V supply. The maximum speed in this mode was around {{convert|15|mph|kph}}. Parallel mode reconnected the motors in parallel across the supply, and allowed operation up to normal full speed. The weak field flag switch allowed higher speeds still, but was only to be operated on open sections of the line. Its operation was visible from outside of the train.<ref name=bruce87/>\n\nThe first train  began working on the Piccadilly line on 9 September 1957, and all three were operational by the following April. Trials went well, and the design became the prototype for the 1959 stock. An order for 76 seven-car trains was placed with Metro-Cammell, and the first unit entered service on 14 December 1959. All 76 were in service by 30 March 1962. Visually, they were very similar to the 1956 stock, the obvious difference being that the earlier stock had five lights on the front, which were used to display the destination of the train, and the later stock had two headlights.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |pp=87\u201388}}</ref> When the 1956 stock was delivered, it was numbered in a series starting at 40000, but when the 1959 units arrived, they were numbered from 1012 upwards, leaving space for the 1956 stock to be inserted at the start of the sequence once they had been modified to be compatible.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=89}}</ref>\n\nWhile in operational service, a number of changes were made to the vehicles. When first delivered, Wedglock automatic couplers were fitted to the motor cars in the middle of the train, which provided mechanical, pneumatic and electrical connection. The motor cars at the outside ends of the units were only fitted with mechanical couplers. These were changed to Wedglock couplers as part of the work to make them compatible with the 1959 Stock. The renumbering of the cars into the same series as the 1959 Stock took place in 1965.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=7}} In 1971\u201372, stabling lights were fitted, located at the bottom right of the five headcode lamps,{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=8}} and in 1989, the headcode lights were replaced by two headlights, although the placement was somewhat different to that of the 1959 Stock.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=11}}\n\n===Demise===\nWhen [[London Underground 1973 Stock|1973 Stock]] was bought to re-equip the Piccadilly line, the three 1956 Stock trains and the 1959 Stock trains were transferred to the Northern line. They continued to work there until delivery of [[London Underground 1992 Stock|1992 Stock]] began to replace the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 Stock]] working on the Central line. A few of the 1962 Stock trains were moved to the Northern line in 1993, to enable the 1956 Stock to be withdrawn, and to provide a modest increase in the number of trains running on the line.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=12}} Initially, four cars were moved to Upminster depot, awaiting scrapping, and another four went to Golders Green depot for storage.{{sfn |Hardy |1993 |p=91}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=J Graeme|last=Bruce\n  |title=The London Underground Tube Stock\n  |publisher=Ian Allan and London Transport Museum\n  |location=Shepperton\n  |year=1988\n  |isbn=978-0-7110-1707-8\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Brian |last=Hardy\n  |title=London Underground Rolling Stock (13th Ed.)\n  |year=1993\n  |publisher=Capital Transport\n  |isbn=978-1-85414-164-4\n  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n  |first=Brian|last=Hardy\n  |title=Underground Train File: Tube Stock 1933-1959\n  |year=2001\n  |isbn=978-1-85414-235-1\n  |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|London Underground 1956 Stock}}\n* [https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/collections-online/photographs London Transport Museum Photographic Archive]\n** {{ltmcollection|db/i0000bdb.jpg|1956 stock DM car 42000, 1957.}}\n** {{ltmcollection|f6/i0000bf6.jpg|1956 stock interior, 1957.}}\n\n{{Northern line navbox}}\n{{Piccadilly line navbox}}\n{{London Underground Rolling Stock}}\n\n[[Category:London Underground electric multiple units|1956]]\n[[Category:Train-related introductions in 1957]]\n", "name_user": "C2A", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(correcting number of seats)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground_1956_Stock"}

They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Platonism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]].

Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. At the age of eighteen, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Hameed was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/almaas_bio.htm|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a unique kind of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our Being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[http://www.ridhwan.org/school/involved.html Ridhwan School \u2013 How to get Involved]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''tan tien''). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>http://www.ridhwan.org/school/faqs.html \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 http://www.ridhwan.org/school/school.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.

People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[http://www.ridhwan.org/school/involved.html Ridhwan School \u2013 How to get Involved]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''tan tien''). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>http://www.ridhwan.org/school/faqs.html \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 http://www.ridhwan.org/school/school.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.
