After the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Ottoman defeat]] there in [[World War I]] and as a result of the [[Treaty of Sevres]], they were then ruled under a [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]] given by the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919)|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.\n\nIn 1936 Syria [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence|signed a treaty]] with France which provided Syrian independence. However, with the breakout of World War II this never happened as the French feared that [[Nazi Germany]] would capitalise if France relinquished its colonies in the Middle East. Riots thus broke out and the new President [[Hashim al-Atassi]] resigned. With the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in 1940, Syria came under the control of [[Vichy France]] until the British and [[Free France|Free French]] occupied the country in the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign]] in July 1941.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mickelsen|first1=Martin L|title=Another Fashoda: the Anglo-Free French Conflict over the Levant, May-September, 1941|journal=Revue fran\u00e7aise d'histoire d'outre-mer|date=1976|volume=63|issue=230|pages=75\u2013100|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0300-9513_1976_num_63_230_1895}}</ref> Syria proclaimed its independence again in 1941, but it was not until 1 January 1944 that it was recognised as an independent republic.

News of this provoked more nationalist protests in Damascus. On [[VE Day]] both countries saw huge protests in which some French nationals were attacked and killed. The French responded to these protests with threats of artillery and air strikes in an effort to stop the movement towards independence. Talks ceased immediately, and skirmishes took place between the Arabs and the French and [[Senegalese]] forces while Syrian and Lebanese soldiers deserted their French officers.<ref name=\"Lentz\">Lentz p. 730</ref>\n\n==Crisis==\nThe crisis began proper on May 19 when demonstrations in Damascus involved firing on the grounds of the French hospital; about a dozen people were injured but none were killed.

In Hama two French aircraft were downed, while the commander of a French unit was ambushed and killed. In [[Hauran]] French troops were rounded up disarmed\u2014their weapons distributed to young men hoping to march towards Damascus to help the central government.{{sfn|Moubayed|2012|p=63}} The French then called in for reinforcements and were now using their air force to drop bombs on suspected areas of resistance. At the same time the Syrian Prime Minister [[Faris al-Khoury]] was at the founding conference of the [[United Nations]] in [[San Francisco]], presenting Syria's claim for independence and also ordered the fighting to stop. They were both backed by President [[Harry Truman]], who declared \"those French ought to be taken out and castrated\".<ref>Jonathan Fenby: ''The General: Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved'', Skyhorse, New York 2012, p. 288.</ref>\n\n===British intervention===\nFinally, on 31 May, with news that the casualty toll had exceeded a thousand Syrians, Churchill sent de Gaulle a message saying, \"In order to avoid a collision between British and French forces, we request you immediately order French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks\". This was ignored and Churchill the next day without waiting for a response from the Americans authorised Paget to invade.<ref name=\"Wall\" />\n\nOn 1 June Paget ordered his force to invade Syria from Transjordan, with troops and tanks of the [[31st Indian Armoured Division]].<ref name=\"Brecher&Wilkenfeld\">Brecher & Wilkenfeld, pp. 420\u2013421</ref> They struck towards Damascus with 'D' Squadron of the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards|Kings Dragoon Guards]] having rolled into [[Beirut]] from which they cut the communications of Oliva-Roget. Paget ordered Oliva-Roget to tell his men to cease fire, but the Frenchman said that he would not take orders from the British even though Paget was his superior officer and Commander of [[Middle East Command]]. Paget then advanced towards Damascus; eventually and having realised he was heavily outnumbered, Roget ordered his men back to their base near the coast. He was angry that the British had arrived only after he had \"restored order\". He told a Syrian journalist, \"You are replacing the easygoing French with the brutal British\".<ref name=\"Gaunson\">Gaunson pp. 178\u2013179</ref> That night, with the Syrians killing any French or Senegalese troops they could find, the French were forced to accept the British escort back to the safety of their barracks at gunpoint.<ref name=\"Lentz\" />\n[[File:Lieutenant-general B C T Paget Cb, Dso, Mc Art.IWMARTLD1253.jpg|180px|thumb|Sir Bernard Paget Commander of [[Middle East Command]]]]\n\nThe British then had to mop up any of the French that had still not returned to their barracks much to the cheers of the people of Damascus.<ref name=\"Luce\"/> The damage to the city was considerable; the Syrian parliament was a smouldering shell, a large area of the town had been destroyed by fire and the streets were pitted with shell holes.<ref name=\"Barr\"/>\n\nThe [[Manchester Guardian]] reported the event with patriotic delight:\n{{quotation|I marched into Damascus with the sailors \u2026 while crowds of surprised Damascenes clapped their hands. \u2026 The people of Damascus hissed and booed the long line of British lorries, tanks and [[Bren gun carrier]]s taking French troops out of the city, escorted by British armoured cars.<ref name=\"Buruma\">Buruma p. 245</ref>}}\n\nOn 2 June De Gaulle realized nothing could be done and reluctantly arranged a ceasefire - Oliva-Roget was later sacked, but a furious row broke out between Britain and France.<ref name=\"Barr\" />\n\n===Ceasefire and diplomacy===\nOnce Paget had taken control of Damascus he then imposed a curfew on all French citizens.

After the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Ottoman defeat]] there in [[World War I]] and as a result of the [[Treaty of Sevres]], they were then ruled under a [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]] given by the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919)|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.\n\nIn 1936 Syria [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence|signed a treaty]] with France which provided Syrian independence. However, with the breakout of World War II this never happened as the French feared that [[Nazi Germany]] would capitalise if France relinquished its colonies in the Middle East. Riots thus broke out and the new President [[Hashim al-Atassi]] resigned. With the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in 1940, Syria came under the control of [[Vichy France]] until the British and [[Free France|Free French]] occupied the country in the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign]] in July 1941.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mickelsen|first1=Martin L|title=Another Fashoda: the Anglo-Free French Conflict over the Levant, May-September, 1941|journal=Revue fran\u00e7aise d'histoire d'outre-mer|date=1976|volume=63|issue=230|pages=75\u2013100|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0300-9513_1976_num_63_230_1895}}</ref> Syria proclaimed its independence again in 1941, but it was not until 1 January 1944 that it was recognised as an independent republic. For several months after both Lebanon and Syria had seen demonstrations against the French. With more and more French reinforcements having arrived, the demonstrations soon escalated.<ref name=\"PurnellHistory\">Masson, Philippe (1966) ''[[Purnell's History of the Second World War]]'': No. 119. \"France's Retreat from Empire\"</ref>\n\n[[Charles De Gaulle]] as head of the French [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|Provisional Government]] sent General Paul Beynet to establish an air base in Syria and a naval base in Lebanon in April 1945. News of this provoked more nationalist protests in Damascus. On [[VE Day]] both countries saw huge protests in which some French nationals were attacked and killed. The French responded to these protests with threats of artillery and air strikes in an effort to stop the movement towards independence. Talks ceased immediately, and skirmishes took place between the Arabs and the French and [[Senegalese]] forces while Syrian and Lebanese soldiers deserted their French officers.<ref name=\"Lentz\">Lentz p. 730</ref>\n\n==Crisis==\nThe crisis began proper on May 19 when demonstrations in Damascus involved firing on the grounds of the French hospital; about a dozen people were injured but none were killed. The next day serious rioting broke out in [[Aleppo]] in which a number of French soldiers were killed and some injured. In retaliation General Oliva-Roget ordered his troops to open fire on demonstrators in Damascus. Within several days the fighting escalated between Syrian youths and the French army in [[Hama]] and [[Homs]].<ref name=\"Thomas\">Thomas pp. 123-124</ref>\n[[File:Churchill De Gaulle HU 60057.jpg|thumb|220px|Winston Churchill and Charles De Gaulle in a meeting in 1944]]\n\nOn May 29 French troops stormed the [[Syrian parliament]] and tried to arrest the President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] and the speaker [[Saadallah al-Jabiri]] but both managed to escape. The French burned, bombarded the building and then cut off Damascus's electricity. They also sealed off Syria's borders with Jordan, [[Iraq]] and the Lebanon. The French began shelling with artillery and mortars while colonial Senegalese troops were sent in, who committed acts of looting and wanton destruction.<ref name=\"Rogan\">Rogan pp. 244\u2013246</ref>\n\nQuwatli having managed to escape via a British armoured car sent an urgent request for intervention to Prime Minister Winston Churchill for British troops to intervene.{{sfn|Moubayed|2012|p=64}} Churchill said he would do what he could, but his relationship with Charles de Gaulle however was at this time at a low ebb following the visit to [[Paris]] the previous year in spite of his efforts to preserve French interests following the [[Yalta conference]].<ref name=\"Werth\">{{cite book|last1=Werth|first1=Alexander|title=De Gaulle: A Political Biography|date=1966|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780671194147/page/186 186]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780671194147|url-access=registration}}</ref> In January Churchill told a colleague that he believed that de Gaulle was \"a great danger to peace and for Great Britain.

Paget had a large force in the region at his disposal and threatened that he would be forced to intervene from the [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] if the violence did not stop. Churchill agreed but needed the backing of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] in which to send British troops against the French.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/>\n\nAt the same time the French [[Army of the Levant]] in the region had been severely weakened - nearly 70 percent of all officers and 40 percent of Syrian soldiers in the French army had deserted their posts and taken up arms with the Syrian rebels. In Hama two French aircraft were downed, while the commander of a French unit was ambushed and killed. In [[Hauran]] French troops were rounded up  disarmed - their weapons distributed to young men hoping to march towards Damascus to help the central government.{{sfn|Moubayed|2012|p=63}} The French then called in for reinforcements and were now using their air force to drop bombs on suspected areas of resistance. At the same time the Syrian Prime Minister [[Faris al-Khoury]] was at the founding conference of the [[United Nations]] in [[San Francisco]], presenting Syria's claim for independence and also ordered the fighting to stop. They were both backed by President [[Harry Truman]], who declared \"those French ought to be taken out and castrated\".<ref>Jonathan Fenby: ''The General.

This was ignored and Churchill the next day without waiting for a response from the Americans authorised Paget to invade.<ref name=\"Wall\"/>\n\nOn 1 June Paget ordered his force to invade Syria from Transjordan, with troops and tanks of the [[31st Indian Armoured Division]].<ref name=\"Brecher&Wilkenfeld\">Brecher & Wilkenfeld, pp. 420-21</ref> They struck towards Damascus with 'D' Squadron of the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards|Kings Dragoon Guards]] having rolled into [[Beirut]] from which they cut the communications of Oliva-Roget. Paget ordered Oliva-Roget to tell his men to cease fire, but the Frenchman said that he would not take orders from the British even though Paget was his superior officer and Commander of [[Middle East Command]]. Paget then advanced towards Damascus; eventually and having realised he was heavily outnumbered, Roget ordered his men back to their base near the coast. He was angry that the British had arrived only after he had \"restored order\". He told a Syrian journalist, ''You are replacing the easygoing French with the brutal British''.<ref name=\"Gaunson\">Gaunson pp. 178-79</ref> That night, with the Syrians killing any French or Senegalese troops they could find, the French were forced to accept the British escort back to the safety of their barracks at gunpoint.<ref name=\"Lentz\"/>\n[[File:Lieutenant-general B C T Paget Cb, Dso, Mc Art.IWMARTLD1253.jpg|180px|thumb|Sir Bernard Paget Commander of [[Middle East Command]]]]\n\nThe British then had to mop up any of the French that had still not returned to their barracks much to the cheers of the people of Damascus.<ref name=\"Luce\"/> The damage to the city was considerable - the Syrian parliament was a smouldering shell, a large area of the town had been destroyed by fire and the streets were pitted with shell holes.<ref name=\"Barr\"/>\n\nThe [[Manchester Guardian]] reported the event with patriotic delight:\n{{quotation|I marched into Damascus with the sailors\u2026while crowds of surprised Damascenes clapped their hands\u2026The people of Damascus hissed and booed the long line of British lorries, tanks and [[Bren gun carrier]]s taking French troops out of the city, escorted by British armoured cars.<ref name=\"Buruma\">Buruma p. 245</ref>}}\n\nOn 2 June De Gaulle realized nothing could be done and reluctantly arranged a ceasefire - Oliva-Roget was later sacked, but a furious row broke out between Britain and France.<ref name=\"Barr\"/>\n\n===Ceasefire & diplomacy===\nOnce Paget had taken control of Damascus he then imposed a curfew on all French citizens. French soldiers were kept in their barracks and were not allowed to shoot except in self-defence under the watchful eyes of British guns.

On 10 July ''Mannforce'', together with the 2nd [[Sherwood Foresters]], were called to [[Baniyas]] when the French opened fire on the town with mortars and machine guns. With control restored there Lieutenant Mann then took a party to the Turkish frontier to bring back the horses and French officers of their Cavalry unit, whose men had deserted. By this time order was restored in the majority of Syria.<ref name=\"kdg\"/>\n\nBeynet was furious and labelled the British measures as a ''stab in the back''. De Gaulle raged against 'Churchill's ultimatum' saying that; ''the whole thing stank of oil''.<ref name=Werth /> The [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France|British ambassador to France]] [[Duff Cooper]] was summoned by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French foreign minister]] [[Georges Bidault]] saying ''whatever mistakes France had made she did not deserve such humiliation as this''.

This may result either from natural causes or due to [[anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] (human) causes, but the risks of extinction through natural disaster, such as a [[Meteorite|meteorite impact]] or [[Supervolcano|large-scale volcanism]], are generally considered to be comparatively low.<ref name=\"priorityBostrom2013\">Bostrom, Nick. \"[http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html Existential risk prevention as global priority]\". Global Policy 4.1 (2013): 15-31.</ref>\n\nMany possible scenarios of anthropogenic extinction have been proposed, such as [[Effects of global warming on humans|climate change]], [[Nuclear holocaust|global nuclear annihilation]], [[biological warfare]] (or the release of a [[pandemic]]-causing agent), and [[ecological collapse]]. In addition, emerging technologies could bring about new extinction scenarios, such as [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|advanced artificial intelligence]], [[biotechnology]], or [[Gray goo|self-replicating nanobots]].

Some of the arguments run as follows:\n* [[Carl Sagan]] wrote in 1983: \"If we are required to calibrate extinction in numerical terms, I would be sure to include the number of people in future generations who would not be born.... (By one calculation), the stakes are one million times greater for extinction than for the more modest nuclear wars that kill \"only\" hundreds of millions of people. There are many other possible measures of the potential loss\u2014including culture and science, the evolutionary history of the planet, and the significance of the lives of all of our ancestors who contributed to the future of their descendants.

Although this could, in a non-[[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic taxonomy]], be considered to give rise to a new species, such an ongoing evolution would biologically not be considered a [[Extinction|species extinction]]. Given the likelihood that significant genetic exchange between human populations will continue, some biologists argue that it is highly unlikely that humans will split into multiple species through natural evolution. Other biologists argue that since increased population means that there are more individuals that can mutate, and the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] means that more than one [[codon]] can code for the same amino acid in protein synthesis, genetic differences with species-level effects are arising faster than before. These biologists argue that since only some of the changes of the genes have functional effects, a fraction that is further decreased by the fact that only part of the protein structure have physiological roles, a few key mutations and not slow accumulation of differences between gene varieties are the cause of major differences in effects between gene varieties, and therefore that smaller differences in the gene sequence between the most distant post-Stone Age gene varieties compared to those between earlier diverged primates do not imply smaller differences in effects. Since this model implies that speciation occurs by a small number (at least two) of co-adapted gene varieties happening to arise at the same time (which may, for example, be synaptic and brain metabolic [[neoteny in humans|neoteny]] that would otherwise be lethal being \"rescued\" by arising along with other metabolic changes that make it possible to survive puberty without decreasing the brain's glucose metabolism), it is argued that the species that our ancestors were 10000 years ago may already be extinct due to genetic changes brought about by population explosions. In this model, genetic compatibility between people from different parts of the world is explained as a result of larger populations making it more likely for mutations with the same physiological effects to arise independently, with the fact that the protein structure does not contain all information needed to reconstruct the DNA and RNA sequences hiding the similarities between compatible gene varieties and [[linkage disequilibrium]] from sequence-centered analysis while opening the possibility that other, physiological function-centered methods of analysis may discover them.<ref>William Hoffman, Leo Furcht (2014). \"The Biologist's Imagination: Innovation in the Biosciences\"</ref><ref>Masatoshi Nei (2013). \"Mutation-Driven Evolution\"</ref>\n\nSome scenarios envision that humans could use [[genetic engineering]] or technological modifications to split into normal humans and a new species \u2013 [[Posthuman (Human evolution)|posthumans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/425804/emtech-get-ready-for-a-new-human-species/|title=EmTech: Get Ready for a New Human Species|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5vWCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA188|title=Thomas Aquinas : teacher of humanity : proceedings from the first conference of the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas held in the United States of America|isbn=978-1443875547|accessdate=1 July 2016|last1=Hittinger|first1=John|date=2015-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hYPZCZZUIEC&pg=PA143|title=Perspectives on Health and Human Rights|accessdate=1 July 2016|isbn=9780415948067|last1=Gruskin|first1=Sofia|last2=Annas|first2=George J.|last3=Grodin|first3=Michael A.|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulE-5xLdM5IC&pg=PA8|title=Posthuman Suffering and the Technological Embrace|last1=Miccoli|first1=Anthony|accessdate=1 July 2016|isbn=9780739126332|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/06/11/320961912/the-transhuman-future-be-more-than-you-can-be|title=The Transhuman Future: Be More Than You Can Be|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dld-conference.com/articles/will-you-join-the-transhuman-evolution|title=WILL YOU JOIN THE TRANSHUMAN EVOLUTION?|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techinsider.io/rob-nail-says-humans-are-turning-into-a-new-species-2016-6|title=How humans are turning into a 'totally different species'|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref> Such a species could be fundamentally different from any previous life form on Earth, e.g. by merging humans with technological systems.<ref>{{cite book|title=I, Cyborg|last=Warwick|first=Kevin|date=2004|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07215-4|authorlink=Kevin Warwick|url=https://archive.org/details/icyborg00kevi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3423063/Is-technology-causing-evolve-new-SPECIES-Expert-believes-super-humans-called-Homo-optimus-talk-machines-digitally-immortal-2050.html|title=Is technology causing us to 'evolve' into a new SPECIES?

The under-perception of rare events mentioned above is actually the opposite of the phenomenon originally described by [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] in \"[[prospect theory]]\" (in their original experiments the likelihood of rare events is overestimated). However, further analysis of the [[cognitive bias|bias]] has shown that both forms occur: When judging from ''description'' people tend to overestimate the described probability, so this effect taken alone would indicate that reading the extinction scenarios described here should make the reader overestimate the likelihood of any probabilities given. However, the effect that is more relevant to common consideration of human extinction is the bias that occurs with estimates from experience, and these are in the opposite direction: When judging from personal experience people who have never heard of or experienced their species become extinct would be expected to dramatically underestimate its likelihood. [[Sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] argued that: \"The reason for this myopic fog, evolutionary biologists contend, is that it was actually advantageous during all but the last few millennia of the two million years of existence of the [[genus]] Homo...

Counter-arguments against such views include the following: (1) All weapons ever designed have ultimately been used. States with strong military forces tend to engage in military aggression, (2) Although modern states have so far generally shown restraint in unleashing their most potent weapons, whatever rational control was guaranteed by government monopoly over such weapons becomes increasingly irrelevant in a world where individuals have access to the technology of mass destruction (as proposed in ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', for example). -->\n\n{{note|PlanForDestruction}} [http://www.religioustolerance.org/destruct.htm ReligiousTolerance.org says that ''Aum Supreme Truth'' is the only religion known to have planned Armageddon for non-believers].

Although this could, in a non-[[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic taxonomy]], be considered to give rise to a new species, such an ongoing evolution would biologically not be considered a [[Extinction|species extinction]]. Given the likelihood that significant genetic exchange between human populations will continue, some biologists argue that it is highly unlikely that humans will split into multiple species through natural evolution. Other biologists argue that since increased population means that there are more individuals that can mutate, and the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] means that more than one [[codon]] can code for the same amino acid in protein synthesis, genetic differences with species-level effects are arising faster than before. These biologists argue that since only some of the changes of the genes have functional effects, a fraction that is further decreased by the fact that only part of the protein structure have physiological roles, a few key mutations and not slow accumulation of differences between gene varieties are the cause of major differences in effects between gene varieties, and therefore that smaller differences in the gene sequence between the most distant post-Stone Age gene varieties compared to those between earlier diverged primates do not imply smaller differences in effects. Since this model implies that speciation occurs by a small number (at least two) of co-adapted gene varieties happening to arise at the same time (which may, for example, be synaptic and brain metabolic [[neoteny in humans|neoteny]] that would otherwise be lethal being \"rescued\" by arising along with other metabolic changes that make it possible to survive puberty without decreasing the brain's glucose metabolism), it is argued that the species that our ancestors were 10000 years ago may already be extinct due to genetic changes brought about by population explosions. In this model, genetic compatibility between people from different parts of the world is explained as a result of larger populations making it more likely for mutations with the same physiological effects to arise independently, with the fact that the protein structure does not contain all information needed to reconstruct the DNA and RNA sequences hiding the similarities between compatible gene varieties and [[linkage disequilibrium]] from sequence-centered analysis while opening the possibility that other, physiological function-centered methods of analysis may discover them.<ref>William Hoffman, Leo Furcht (2014). \"The Biologist's Imagination: Innovation in the Biosciences\"</ref><ref>Masatoshi Nei (2013). \"Mutation-Driven Evolution\"</ref>\n\nSome scenarios envision that humans could use [[genetic engineering]] or technological modifications to split into normal humans and a new species \u2013 [[Posthuman (Human evolution)|posthumans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/425804/emtech-get-ready-for-a-new-human-species/|title=EmTech: Get Ready for a New Human Species|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5vWCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA188|title=Thomas Aquinas : teacher of humanity : proceedings from the first conference of the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas held in the United States of America|isbn=978-1443875547|accessdate=1 July 2016|last1=Hittinger|first1=John|date=2015-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hYPZCZZUIEC&pg=PA143|title=Perspectives on Health and Human Rights|accessdate=1 July 2016|isbn=9780415948067|last1=Gruskin|first1=Sofia|last2=Annas|first2=George J.|last3=Grodin|first3=Michael A.|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulE-5xLdM5IC&pg=PA8|title=Posthuman Suffering and the Technological Embrace|last1=Miccoli|first1=Anthony|accessdate=1 July 2016|isbn=9780739126332|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/06/11/320961912/the-transhuman-future-be-more-than-you-can-be|title=The Transhuman Future: Be More Than You Can Be|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dld-conference.com/articles/will-you-join-the-transhuman-evolution|title=WILL YOU JOIN THE TRANSHUMAN EVOLUTION?|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techinsider.io/rob-nail-says-humans-are-turning-into-a-new-species-2016-6|title=How humans are turning into a 'totally different species'|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref> Such a species could be fundamentally different from any previous life form on Earth, e.g. by merging humans with technological systems.<ref>{{cite book|title=I, Cyborg|last=Warwick|first=Kevin|date=2004|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07215-4|authorlink=Kevin Warwick|url=https://archive.org/details/icyborg00kevi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3423063/Is-technology-causing-evolve-new-SPECIES-Expert-believes-super-humans-called-Homo-optimus-talk-machines-digitally-immortal-2050.html|title=Is technology causing us to 'evolve' into a new SPECIES?

Putnam's essay ''The place of facts in a world of values'' - page 113). This example illustrates why respectable scientists are very reluctant to go on record with extinction predictions: they can never be proven right.

The under-perception of rare events mentioned above is actually the opposite of the phenomenon originally described by [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] in \"[[prospect theory]]\" (in their original experiments the likelihood of rare events is overestimated). However, further analysis of the [[cognitive bias|bias]] has shown that both forms occur: When judging from ''description'' people tend to overestimate the described probability, so this effect taken alone would indicate that reading the extinction scenarios described here should make the reader overestimate the likelihood of any probabilities given. However, the effect that is more relevant to common consideration of human extinction is the bias that occurs with estimates from experience, and these are in the opposite direction: When judging from personal experience people who have never heard of or experienced their species become extinct would be expected to dramatically underestimate its likelihood. [[Sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] argued that: \"The reason for this myopic fog, evolutionary biologists contend, is that it was actually advantageous during all but the last few millennia of the two million years of existence of the [[genus]] Homo... A premium was placed on close attention to the near future and early reproduction, and little else.

In this view, the [[history]] of humanity suggests that humans will be the cause of their own extinction. However, others have reached the opposite conclusion with the same data on violence and hypothesize that as societies develop armies and [[weapon]]s with greater destructive power, they tend to be used less often. It is claimed that this implies a more secure future, despite the development of [[Weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] technology. As such this argument may constitute a form of [[deterrence theory]]. Counter-arguments against such views include the following: (1) All weapons ever designed have ultimately been used. States with strong military forces tend to engage in military aggression, (2) Although modern states have so far generally shown restraint in unleashing their most potent weapons, whatever rational control was guaranteed by government monopoly over such weapons becomes increasingly irrelevant in a world where individuals have access to the technology of mass destruction (as proposed in ''[[Our Final Hour]]'', for example). -->\n\n{{note|PlanForDestruction}} [http://www.religioustolerance.org/destruct.htm ReligiousTolerance.org says that ''Aum Supreme Truth'' is the only religion known to have planned Armageddon for non-believers].

Responsible tourism and sustainable tourism have an identical goal, that of [[sustainable development]].  The pillars of responsible tourism are therefore the same as those of sustainable tourism \u2013 environmental integrity, social justice and economic development.  The major difference between the two is that, in responsible tourism, individuals, organizations and businesses are asked to take responsibility for their actions and the impacts of their actions.  This shift in emphasis has taken place because some stakeholders feel that insufficient progress towards realizing sustainable tourism has been made since the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio.  This is partly because everyone has been expecting others to behave in a sustainable manner. The emphasis on responsibility in responsible tourism means that everyone involved in tourism \u2013 government, product owners and operators, transport operators, community services, [[NGO]]s and [[Community-based organization]] (CBOs), tourists, local communities, industry associations \u2013 are responsible for achieving the goals of responsible tourism.\n\n===Stakeholders===\nStakeholders of sustainable tourism play a role in continuing this form of tourism. This can include organizations as well as individuals, to be specific, ECOFIN.  \"A stakeholder in the tourism industry is deemed to be anyone who is impacted on by development positively or negatively, and as a result it reduces potential conflict between the tourists and host community by involving the latter in shaping the way in which tourism develops.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aas | first1 = C. | last2 = Ladkin | first2 = A. | last3 = Fletcher | first3 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Stakeholder collaboration and heritage management | url = http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/105/1/Fletcher_Output_4.pdf| journal = Annals of Tourism Research | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 28\u201348 | doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.04.005}}</ref>\n\nThe [http://gstcouncil.org Global Sustainable Tourism Council] (GSTC) serves as the international body for fostering increased knowledge and understanding of sustainable tourism practices, promoting the adoption of universal sustainable tourism principles and building demand for sustainable travel. It has a number of programmes including the setting of international standards for accreditation agencies (the organisations that would inspect a tourism product, and certify them as a sustainable company).\n\n====Governments====\nThe values and ulterior motives of governments often need to be taken into account when assessing the motives for sustainable tourism. One important factor to consider in any ecologically sensitive or remote area or an area new to tourism is that of [[carrying capacity]]. This is the capacity of tourists of visitors an area can sustainably tolerate without damaging the environment or culture of the surrounding area. This can be altered and revised in time and with changing perceptions and values. For example, originally the sustainable carrying capacity of the [[Galapagos Islands]] was set at 12,000 visitors per annum but was later changed by the Ecuadorian government to 50,000 for economic reasons and objectives.<ref>{{cite book|last=Croall|first=J|title=Preserve or Destroy: Tourism and the Environment|year=1995|publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation|location=London|pages=61}}</ref>\n\n====Non-governmental organizations====\n[[Non-governmental organization]]s are one of the stakeholders in advocating sustainable tourism. Their roles can range from spearheading sustainable tourism practices to simply doing research. University research teams and scientists can be tapped to aid in the process of planning. Such solicitation of research can be observed in the planning of [[C\u00e1t B\u00e0 National Park]] in [[Vietnam]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nDive resort operators in [[Bunaken National Park]], [[Indonesia]], play a crucial role by developing exclusive zones for [[Underwater diving|diving]] and [[fishing]] respectively, such that both tourists and locals can benefit from the venture.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nLarge [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[meeting]]s and other major organized events drive the travel, tourism and hospitality industry. Cities and [[convention center]]s compete to attract such commerce, commerce which has heavy impacts on resource use and the environment. Major sporting events, such as the [[Olympic Games]], present special problems regarding environmental burdens and degradation.<ref>Malhado A., de Araujo L., Rothfuss R. (2014).

More environmentally aware organizations, corporations and government agencies are now seeking more sustainable event practices, greener hotels, restaurants and convention venues, and more energy efficient or climate neutral travel and ground transportation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, the convention trip not taken can be the most sustainable option: \"With most international conferences having hundreds if not thousands of participants, and the bulk of these usually traveling by plane, conference travel is an area where significant reductions in air-travel-related GHG emissions could be made. ... This does not mean non-attendance\" (Reay, 2004), since modern Internet communications are now ubiquitous and remote audio/visual participation.<ref name=reay>Reay DS (2004).

See the Virtual Options section.</ref> Following the live-stream, the recording of each session is posted on-line within 24 hours.\n\nSome convention centers have begun to take direct action in reducing the impact of the conventions they host. One example is the [[Moscone Center]] in [[San Francisco]], which has a very aggressive [[recycling]] program, a large [[solar power]] system, and other programs aimed at reducing impact and increasing efficiency.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n====Local Communities====\nLocal communities benefit from sustainable tourism through economic development, job creation, and infrastructure development. Tourism revenues bring economic growth and prosperity to attractive tourist destinations which can raise the standard of living in destination communities.  Sustainable tourism operators commit themselves to creating jobs for local community members. Increase in tourism revenue to an area acts as a driver for the development of increased infrastructure. As tourist demands increase in a destination, a more robust infrastructure is needed to support the needs of both the tourism industry and the local community.<ref>McCool, S. F., Moisey, R. N.

In the 1970s this changed as academics started to take a much more negative view on tourism's consequences, particularly criticising the industry as an effective contributor towards development. International tourism is a volatile industry with visitors quick to abandon destinations that were formerly popular because of threats to health or security.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lea|first=J.

After the second World War First World conservationists with the intent of making such areas accessible to tourists as well as preserving the areas natural beauty and ecology moved into the areas where the Maasai tribes lived. This was often achieved through the setting up of national parks and conservation areas (Monbiot 1994;<ref name=\"Monbiot 1994\">{{cite book|last=Monbiot|first=G|title=No Man's Land|year=1994|publisher=Macmillan|location=London}}</ref> Olerokonga, 1992:7).<ref name=\"Olerokonga 1992 6\u20137\">{{cite journal|last=Olerokonga|first=T|title=What about the Maasai?|journal=In Focus|year=1992|volume=4|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that Maasai activities did not threaten the wildlife and the First World knowledge was blurred by '[[colonialism|colonial]] disdain' and misunderstandings of savannah wildlife.<ref name=\"Monbiot 1994\"/> As the Maasai have been displaced the area within the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] (NCA) has been modified to allow easier access for tourists by actions such as building campsites, tracks and the removal of stone objects such as stones for souvenirs.<ref name=\"Olerokonga 1992 6\u20137\"/>\n\nThis kind of 'sustainable tourism' is viewed by many as an oxymoron or metaphor since it seriously can't change anything. There likely is no way to make tourism sustainable but if all tourists cooperate it could possibly work in a viable world. It is a reality that many things done in the name of sustainability are actually masking the desire to allow extra profits.<ref name=\"Monbiot 1994\"/> There is often alienation of local populations from the tourists.<ref name=\"Olerokonga 1992 6\u20137\"/>\n\n===Environmental Impacts===\n{{main|environmental impact of tourism}}\n\"The environmental [[sustainability]] focuses on the overall viability and [[ecosystem health|health of ecological systems]]. [[Natural resource]] degradation, [[pollution]], and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] are detrimental because they increase vulnerability, undermine system health, and reduce [[ecological resilience|resilience]]. This aspect of sustainability has been the most often discussed through the literature by numerous authors such as Hall, C. M. & Lew A.A. (1998), Hall, D.

[[Coastal environment]]s are limited in extent consisting of only a narrow strip along the edge of the [[ocean]]. Coastal areas are often the first environments to experience the detrimental impacts of tourism.

Everest is a [[UNESCO World Heritage]] site. Over the years, carelessness and excessive consumption of resources by mountaineers, as well as [[overgrazing]] by livestock, have damaged the habitats of [[snow leopard]]s, [[lesser panda]]s, [[Tibetan bear]]s, and scores of bird species. To counteract past abuses, various [[reforestation]] programs have been carried out by local communities and the Nepalese government.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/197160/Mount-Everest/230896/The-height-of-Everest|title=Mount Everest - Geology, Height, Exploration, & Mountaineering|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nExpeditions have removed supplies and equipment left by climbers on Everest\u2019s slopes, including hundreds of oxygen containers. A large quantity of the [[litter]] of past climbers\u2014tons of items such as tents, cans, crampons, and human waste\u2014has been hauled down from the mountain and recycled or discarded. However, the bodies of most of the more than 260 climbers who have died on Everest (notably on its upper slopes) have not been removed, as they are unreachable or\u2014for those that are accessible\u2014their weight makes carrying them down extremely difficult. Notable in the cleanup endeavour have been the efforts of the Eco Everest Expeditions, the first of which was organized in 2008 to commemorate the death that January of Everest-climbing pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary. Those expeditions also have publicized ecological issues (in particular, concerns about the effects of climate change in the region through observations that the Khumbu Icefall has been melting).<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n====Small Island tourism====\nSmall Islands are especially affected and often depend on tourism, as this industry makes up anywhere from 40% to 75% of the GDP ([[Gross Domestic Product]]) for various islands including [[Barbados]], [[Aruba]], [[Isle of Man]], and [[Anguilla]].<ref name=\"Breaky2004\">{{cite journal|last1=Breaky|first1=Noreen|last2=Ruhanen|first2=Lisa|last3=Shakeela|first3=Aishath|title=The Role of Employment in the Sustainable Development Paradigm\u2014The Local Tourism Labor Market in Small Island Developing States|journal=Journal of Human Resources in Hospitality and Tourism|date=2004|volume=10|issue=4|pages=331\u2013353|doi=10.1080/15332845.2011.588493|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a46fef9892718e9579753d4d89dda1d22abddd00|hdl=10072/41063}}</ref><ref name=\"Querioz2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Queiroz|first1=Rose|title=Demand of the tourists visiting protected areas in small oceanic islands: the Azores case-study (Portugal)|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=2014|volume=16|issue=5|pages=1119\u20131135|doi=10.1007/s10668-014-9516-y}}</ref><ref name=\"Canavan2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Canavan|first1=B|title=Sustainable tourism: development, decline and de-growth.

This is due to inefficient political decisions and policies along with irresponsible tourist activity, such as reckless diving and waste disposal, damaging coastal and marine environments.

This form of tourism is based on the premise that the people living next to a resource are the ones best suited to protecting it. This means that the tourism activities and businesses are developed and operated by local community members, and certainly with their consent and support. Sustainable tourism typically involves the conservation of resources that are capitalized upon for tourism purposes. Locals run the businesses and are responsible for promoting the conservation messages to protect their environment.<ref>https://www.ecotourism.org/news/community-based-tourism-tool-sustainable-development</ref>\n\nCommunity-based sustainable tourism (CBST) associates the success of the sustainability of the ecotourism location to the management practices of the communities who are directly or indirectly dependent on the location for their livelihoods. A salient feature of CBST is that local knowledge is usually utilised alongside wide general frameworks of ecotourism business models. This allows the participation of locals at the management level and typically allows a more intimate understanding of the environment.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe use of local knowledge also means an easier entry level into a tourism industry for locals whose jobs or livelihoods are affected by the use of their environment as tourism locations. Environmentally sustainable development crucially depends on the presence of local support for a project.<ref>{{cite book|last=Drake|first=S|title='Local Participation in ecotourism project' in Nature Tourism|year=1991|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington D.C.|pages=132}}</ref> It has also been noted that in order for success projects must provide direct benefits for the local community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Epler Wood|first=M|title='Global Solutions: on ecotourism society', in Nature Tourism|year=1991|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington D.C.|pages=204}}</ref>\n\nHowever, recent research has found that economic linkages generated by CBST may only be sporadic, and that the linkages with agriculture are negatively affected by seasonality and by the small scale of the cultivated areas. This means that CBST may only have small-scale positive effects for these communities.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Trejos | first1 = B | last2 = Chiang | first2 = LHN | year = 2009 | title = Local economic linkages to community-based tourism in rural Costa Rica | journal = Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 373\u2013387 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9493.2009.00375.x}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been said that partnerships between governments and tourism agencies with smaller communities is not particularly effective because of the disparity in aims between the two groups, i.e. true sustainability versus mass tourism for maximum profit. In Honduras such a divergence can be demonstrated where consultants from the World Bank and officials from the Institute of tourism wanted to set up a selection of 5-star hotels near various [[ecotourism]] destinations. But another operating approach in the region by USAID and APROECOH (an ecotourism association) promotes community-based efforts which has trained many local Hondurans.

In Mowforth and Munt's book 'Tourism and Sustainability: New Tourism in the Third World, they criticised a document that was written by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the World Tourism Organisation and the Earth Council, which was included in Agenda 21. It was entitled 'Agenda 21 for the Travel and Tourism Industry: Towards Environmentally Sustainable Development'. Mowforth and Munt commented on the language used to describe the environment and local culture in such documents because the preservation of the environment and local culture are the two main objectives when practising sustainable tourism. They pointed out that some of the key words used were 'core asset', 'core product', 'product quality' and 'preserve'.<ref>{{cite book|author1=WTTC, WTO  |author2=Earth Council |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Agenda 21 for the travel and tourism industry: Towards Environmentally Sustainable Development|year=1995|publisher=WTTC|location=London}}</ref> They argued that the treatment of the environment as a marketable product was clear and that such documents provide a good list of advice for Third World governments regarding sustainable tourism but do not actually provide the resources to incorporate them into the development of their tourism industries.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mowforth, M.  |author2=Munt, I. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Tourism and Sustainability: New Tourism in the Third World|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0203437292}}</ref>\n\nIt is arguments such as these that postulate that there is a gap between the advice given by non-governmental or inter-governmental organisations to Third World governments and what can actually be brought to realisation. These arguments try and persuade readers that documents like the one released by the WTTC that the development of sustainable tourism actually 'bypasses the interests of local people'.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mowforth, M.  |author2=Munt, I. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Tourism and Sustainability: New Tourism in the Third World|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0203437292|pages=298}}</ref>\n\n===Responsible tourism===\nThere are many definitions and understandings of responsible tourism.

It is more than a form of tourism as it represents an approach to engaging with tourism, be that as a tourist, a business, locals at a destination or any other tourism stakeholder. It emphasizes that all stakeholders are responsible for the kind of tourism they develop or engage in. This ensures that the tourism service providers and purchasers or consumers are held accountable.<ref name=\":0\" /> Whilst different groups will see responsibility in different ways, the shared understanding is that responsible tourism should entail an improvement in tourism.

However, the objective is to create better places for people to live in and to visit. Importantly, there is no blueprint for responsible tourism: what is deemed responsible may differ depending on places and cultures. Responsible Tourism is an aspiration that can be realized in different ways in different originating markets and in the diverse destinations of the world (Goodwin, 2016).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Responsible Tourism : Using Tourism for Sustainable Development.|last=Goodwin, Harold.|date=2016|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers Ltd|isbn=978-1-910158-86-9|oclc=1086998051}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of responsible tourism emerged following the environmental awareness that rose out of the 1960s and 70s amidst a growing phenomenon of \u201cmass tourism\u201d.

The idea is to empower local communities through travel related businesses around the world, first and foremost in [[developing countries]]. The idea of humane travel or humane [[tourism]] is to connect travelers from [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] seeking new adventures and authentic experiences directly, to local businesses in the specific locations they wish to visit \u2013 thus, giving economic advantages to local businesses and giving travelers authentic and truly unique travel experiences. Humane travel or humane tourism focuses on the people, the local community. The idea is to enable travelers to experience the world through the eyes of its local people while contributing directly to those people, ensuring that tourist dollars benefit the local community directly.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nHumane tourism is about giving opportunity to the local people, empower them, enable them to enjoy the fruits of tourism directly. The [[Internet]] is changing tourism. More and more travelers are planning their travels and vacations via the net. The Internet enables people to cut off commissions. The traveler can search for new destinations to visit, talk or read about other people experience, and buy the services directly. The Internet platform can encourage local people to start new businesses and that already existing small businesses will begin to promote themselves through the net and receive the economic advantages of this directly in their communities. The world is now in a new tourism age, with globalization and the Internet playing a key role.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe new travelers have traveled the world, they have seen the classic sites. Staying at a Western hotel is not attractive enough, and they are excited by the prospect of experiencing the authentic local way of life: to go fishing with a local fisherman, to eat the fish with his family, to sleep in a typical village house. These tourists or travelers, are happy to know that while doing so they promote the economic well-being of those same people they spend time with.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nHumane tourism is part of Responsible tourism. The concept of Responsible Tourism originated in the work of Jost Krippendorf in The Holiday Makers<ref>1987, Jost Krippendorf, Holiday Makers,\n{{ISBN|978-0-7506-4348-1}}, {{ISBN|0-7506-4348-X}}, 1987</ref> called for \u201crebellious tourists and rebellious locals\u201d to create new forms of tourism. His vision was \u201cto develop and promote new forms of tourism, which will bring the greatest possible benefit to all the participants \u2013 travelers, the host population and the tourist business, without causing intolerable ecological and social damage.\u201d As one can see he already talked, back in the 80s about benefits for the host population and used the term human tourism. Humane travel focuses on that host local population.\n\nThe [[South Africa]]n national tourism policy (1996)<ref>available at: http://www.haroldgoodwin.info/resources/Explanatory%20Note.pdf</ref> used the term \"responsible tourism\" and mentioned the well-being of the local community as a main factor.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0160-7383(95)00043-7 | volume=23 | title=New directions in tourism for third world development | journal=Annals of Tourism Research | pages=48\u201370 | year=1996 | last1 = Brohman | first1 = John| citeseerx=10.1.1.330.6563 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Cape Town]] Declaration on Responsible Tourism in Destinations,<ref>available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.ansvarligturisme.org/CapeTown.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106134610/http://www.ansvarligturisme.org/CapeTown.html |archive-date=2009-01-06 |df= }}</ref> agreed in 2002, that Responsible Tourism is about \u201cmaking better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit.\u201d The declaration focused on \"places\" but did mention the local population.\n\nFrom the [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] summit or earth summit on 1992<ref>[[Earth Summit]]</ref> until the [[UN]] Commission on Sustainable Development in 1999,<ref>[[Commission on Sustainable Development]]</ref> the main focus of the tourism industry was the earth, the planet, the places, \"green\" or \"eco\" tourism. Now there is a trend to include the local population. This trend or branch of responsible tourism is called humane tourism or humane travel.\n\n===Responsible hospitality===\nAs with the view of responsible tourism, responsible hospitality is essentially about creating better places for people to live in, and better places for people to visit.  This does not mean all forms of hospitality are also forms of tourism although hospitality is the largest sector of the tourism industry. As such we should not be surprised at overlaps between responsible hospitality and responsible tourism.  In the instance where place of permanent residence is also the place where the hospitality service is consumed, if for example a meal is consumed in a local restaurant, this does not obviate the requirement to improve the place of residence. As such, the essence of Responsible Hospitality is not contingent upon touristic forms of hospitality.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nWhile Friedman (1962)<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=M.|title=Capitalism and Freedom|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalismfreedo00frie|url-access=registration|year=1962|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>  famously argued that, admittedly within legal parameters, the sole responsibility of business was to generate profit for shareholders the idea that businesses\u2019 responsibility extends beyond this has existed for decades and is most frequently encountered in the concept of [[corporate social responsibility]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=A.|title=Corporate Social Responsibility|journal=Business & Society|year=1998|volume=38|issue=3|series=3|pages=268\u2013295|doi=10.1177/000765039903800303|hdl=10806/4019|url=http://fox.leuphana.de/portal/de/publications/corporate-social-responsibility(4867aa3c-0ae1-4923-93e6-b51346e8ef49).html}}</ref> There are numerous ways businesses can and do engage in activities that are not intended to benefit shareholders and management, at least not in the short term. However, often acts of corporate social responsibility are undertaken because of the perceived benefit to business. Usually in hospitality this relates to the cost reductions associated with improved energy efficiency<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pizam|first=A.|title=Editorial: Green hotels: A fad, ploy or fact of life?|journal=International Journal of Hospitality Management|year=2009|volume=28|series=1|pages=1|doi=10.1016/j.ijhm.2008.09.001}}</ref>  but may also relate to, for example, the rise in [[ethical consumerism]] and the view that being seen to be a responsible business is beneficial to revenue growth.\n\nAs per the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism, responsible hospitality is culturally sensitive. Instead of then calling for the unachievable, responsible hospitality simply makes the case for more responsible forms of hospitality, hospitality that benefits locals first, and visitors second. Certainly, all forms of hospitality can be improved and managed so that negative impacts are minimized whilst striving for a maximization of positive impacts on the environment.\n\n==Hospitality Education==\nMinistry of Tourism, Government of India has mentioned that some of the hospitality management/ culinary training institutes in India will no longer make it mandatory for students to engage in non-vegetarian cooking. The student will be given an option to choose vegetarian cooking. IHMCTAN Ahmedabad, IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur are the hospitality training institutes that offer a vegetarian choice, and this practice will be extended to all IHMCTANs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofjaipur.com/news/2016/07/13/vegetarian-cooking-courses-to-be-introduced-in-hotel-management-institutes/|title=Vegetarian Cooking Courses to be Introduced in Hotel Management Institutes - City of Jaipur|website=www.cityofjaipur.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nFundamental research was presented in the book \u00abSustainable tourism development: theory, methodology, business realities\u00bb ({{lang-uk|\u00ab\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0443: \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f, \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0457 \u0431\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443\u00bb}}))<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|first=T|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0443: \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f, \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0457 \u0431\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443|year=2006|publisher=\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432. \u043d\u0430\u0446. \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433.-\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043d. \u0443\u043d-\u0442|location=\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432|pages=537}}</ref> by Ukrainian scientist Professor Tetiana Tkachenko in 2006 \u0443ear (with corrections and additions in 2009<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|first=T|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0443: \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f, \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0457 \u0431\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443|year=2009|publisher=\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432. \u043d\u0430\u0446. \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433.-\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043d. \u0443\u043d-\u0442|location=\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432|pages=463}}</ref>).

Chapter 6 in: Climate Change and Aviation: Issues, Challenges and Solutions.</ref> \"Sustainable transportation is now established as the critical issue confronting a global tourism industry that is palpably unsustainable, and aviation lies at the heart of this issue.\"<ref name=\"Cohen\"/>\n\n==Social & economic aspects==\nGlobal economists forecast continuing international [[tourism]] growth, the amount depending on the location.  As one of the world's largest and fastest growing industries, this continuous growth will place great stress on remaining biologically diverse [[habitat]]s and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures, which are often used to support [[mass tourism]].  Tourists who promote sustainable tourism are sensitive to these dangers and seek to protect tourist destinations, and to protect tourism as an industry. Sustainable tourists can reduce the impact of tourism in many ways:\n\n*informing themselves of the [[culture]], [[politics]], and [[economy]] of the communities visited\n*anticipating and respecting local cultures, expectations and assumptions\n*supporting the integrity of local cultures by favoring businesses which conserve cultural heritage and traditional values\n*supporting local economies by purchasing local goods and participating with small, local businesses\n*conserving resources by seeking out businesses that are environmentally conscious, and by using the least possible amount of [[non-renewable resource]]s\n\nIncreasingly, destinations and tourism operations are endorsing and following \"responsible tourism\" as a pathway towards sustainable tourism. Responsible tourism and sustainable tourism have an identical goal, that of [[sustainable development]].  The pillars of responsible tourism are therefore the same as those of sustainable tourism \u2013 environmental integrity, social justice and economic development.  The major difference between the two is that, in responsible tourism, individuals, organizations and businesses are asked to take responsibility for their actions and the impacts of their actions.  This shift in emphasis has taken place because some stakeholders feel that insufficient progress towards realizing sustainable tourism has been made since the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio.  This is partly because everyone has been expecting others to behave in a sustainable manner. The emphasis on responsibility in responsible tourism means that everyone involved in tourism \u2013 government, product owners and operators, transport operators, community services, [[NGO]]s and [[Community-based organization]] (CBOs), tourists, local communities, industry associations \u2013 are responsible for achieving the goals of responsible tourism.\n\n===Stakeholders===\nStakeholders of sustainable tourism play a role in continuing this form of tourism. This can include organizations as well as individuals, to be specific, ECOFIN.  \"A stakeholder in the tourism industry is deemed to be anyone who is impacted on by development positively or negatively, and as a result it reduces potential conflict between the tourists and host community by involving the latter in shaping the way in which tourism develops.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aas | first1 = C. | last2 = Ladkin | first2 = A. | last3 = Fletcher | first3 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Stakeholder collaboration and heritage management | url = http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/105/1/Fletcher_Output_4.pdf| journal = Annals of Tourism Research | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 28\u201348 | doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.04.005}}</ref>\n\nThe [http://gstcouncil.org Global Sustainable Tourism Council] (GSTC) serves as the international body for fostering increased knowledge and understanding of sustainable tourism practices, promoting the adoption of universal sustainable tourism principles and building demand for sustainable travel. It has a number of programmes including the setting of international standards for accreditation agencies (the organisations that would inspect a tourism product, and certify them as a sustainable company).\n\n====Governments====\nThe values and ulterior motives of governments often need to be taken into account when assessing the motives for sustainable tourism. One important factor to consider in any ecologically sensitive or remote area or an area new to tourism is that of [[carrying capacity]]. This is the capacity of tourists of visitors an area can sustainably tolerate without damaging the environment or culture of the surrounding area. This can be altered and revised in time and with changing perceptions and values. For example, originally the sustainable carrying capacity of the [[Galapagos Islands]] was set at 12,000 visitors per annum but was later changed by the Ecuadorian government to 50,000 for economic reasons and objectives.<ref>{{cite book|last=Croall|first=J|title=Preserve or Destroy: Tourism and the Environment|year=1995|publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation|location=London|pages=61}}</ref>\n\n====Non-governmental organizations====\n[[Non-governmental organization]]s are one of the stakeholders in advocating sustainable tourism. Their roles can range from spearheading sustainable tourism practices to simply doing research. University research teams and scientists can be tapped to aid in the process of planning. Such solicitation of research can be observed in the planning of [[C\u00e1t B\u00e0 National Park]] in [[Vietnam]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nDive resort operators in [[Bunaken National Park]], [[Indonesia]], play a crucial role by developing exclusive zones for [[Underwater diving|diving]] and [[fishing]] respectively, such that both tourists and locals can benefit from the venture.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nLarge [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[meeting]]s and other major organized events drive the travel, tourism and hospitality industry. Cities and [[convention center]]s compete to attract such commerce, commerce which has heavy impacts on resource use and the environment. Major sporting events, such as the [[Olympic Games]], present special problems regarding environmental burdens and degradation.<ref>Malhado A., de Araujo L., Rothfuss R. (2014).

More environmentally aware organizations, corporations and government agencies are now seeking more sustainable event practices, greener hotels, restaurants and convention venues, and more energy efficient or climate neutral travel and ground transportation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, the convention trip not taken can be the most sustainable option: \"With most international conferences having hundreds if not thousands of participants, and the bulk of these usually traveling by plane, conference travel is an area where significant reductions in air-travel-related GHG emissions could be made. ...

Tourism revenues bring economic growth and prosperity to attractive tourist destinations which can raise the standard of living in destination communities.  Sustainable tourism operators commit themselves to creating jobs for local community members. Increase in tourism revenue to an area acts as a driver for the development of increased infrastructure. As tourist demands increase in a destination, a more robust infrastructure is needed to support the needs of both the tourism industry and the local community.<ref>McCool, S. F., Moisey, R. N.

In the 1970s this changed as academics started to take a much more negative view on tourism's consequences, particularly criticising the industry as an effective contributor towards development. International tourism is a volatile industry with visitors quick to abandon destinations that were formerly popular because of threats to health or security.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lea|first=J.

After the second World War First World conservationists with the intent of making such areas accessible to tourists as well as preserving the areas natural beauty and ecology moved into the areas where the Maasai tribes lived. This was often achieved through the setting up of national parks and conservation areas (Monbiot 1994;<ref name=\"Monbiot 1994\">{{cite book|last=Monbiot|first=G|title=No Man's Land|year=1994|publisher=Macmillan|location=London}}</ref> Olerokonga, 1992:7).<ref name=\"Olerokonga 1992 6\u20137\">{{cite journal|last=Olerokonga|first=T|title=What about the Maasai?|journal=In Focus|year=1992|volume=4|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that Maasai activities did not threaten the wildlife and the First World knowledge was blurred by '[[colonialism|colonial]] disdain' and misunderstandings of savannah wildlife.<ref name=\"Monbiot 1994\"/> As the Maasai have been displaced the area within the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] (NCA) has been modified to allow easier access for tourists by actions such as building campsites, tracks and the removal of stone objects such as stones for souvenirs.<ref name=\"Olerokonga 1992 6\u20137\"/>\n\nThis kind of 'sustainable tourism' is viewed by many as an oxymoron or metaphor since it seriously can't change anything.

Everest is a [[UNESCO World Heritage]] site. Over the years, carelessness and excessive consumption of resources by mountaineers, as well as [[overgrazing]] by livestock, have damaged the habitats of [[snow leopard]]s, [[lesser panda]]s, [[Tibetan bear]]s, and scores of bird species. To counteract past abuses, various [[reforestation]] programs have been carried out by local communities and the Nepalese government.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/197160/Mount-Everest/230896/The-height-of-Everest|title=Mount Everest - Geology, Height, Exploration, & Mountaineering|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nExpeditions have removed supplies and equipment left by climbers on Everest\u2019s slopes, including hundreds of oxygen containers. A large quantity of the [[litter]] of past climbers\u2014tons of items such as tents, cans, crampons, and human waste\u2014has been hauled down from the mountain and recycled or discarded. However, the bodies of most of the more than 260 climbers who have died on Everest (notably on its upper slopes) have not been removed, as they are unreachable or\u2014for those that are accessible\u2014their weight makes carrying them down extremely difficult. Notable in the cleanup endeavour have been the efforts of the Eco Everest Expeditions, the first of which was organized in 2008 to commemorate the death that January of Everest-climbing pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary. Those expeditions also have publicized ecological issues (in particular, concerns about the effects of climate change in the region through observations that the Khumbu Icefall has been melting).<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n====Small Island tourism====\nSmall Islands are especially affected and often depend on tourism, as this industry makes up anywhere from 40% to 75% of the GDP ([[Gross Domestic Product]]) for various islands including [[Barbados]], [[Aruba]], [[Isle of Man]], and [[Anguilla]].<ref name=\"Breaky2004\">{{cite journal|last1=Breaky|first1=Noreen|last2=Ruhanen|first2=Lisa|last3=Shakeela|first3=Aishath|title=The Role of Employment in the Sustainable Development Paradigm\u2014The Local Tourism Labor Market in Small Island Developing States|journal=Journal of Human Resources in Hospitality and Tourism|date=2004|volume=10|issue=4|pages=331\u2013353|doi=10.1080/15332845.2011.588493|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a46fef9892718e9579753d4d89dda1d22abddd00|hdl=10072/41063}}</ref><ref name=\"Querioz2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Queiroz|first1=Rose|title=Demand of the tourists visiting protected areas in small oceanic islands: the Azores case-study (Portugal)|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=2014|volume=16|issue=5|pages=1119\u20131135|doi=10.1007/s10668-014-9516-y}}</ref><ref name=\"Canavan2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Canavan|first1=B|title=Sustainable tourism: development, decline and de-growth.

This is due to inefficient political decisions and policies along with irresponsible tourist activity, such as reckless diving and waste disposal, damaging coastal and marine environments.

This form of tourism is based on the premise that the people living next to a resource are the ones best suited to protecting it. This means that the tourism activities and businesses are developed and operated by local community members, and certainly with their consent and support. Sustainable tourism typically involves the conservation of resources that are capitalized upon for tourism purposes. Locals run the businesses and are responsible for promoting the conservation messages to protect their environment.<ref>https://www.ecotourism.org/news/community-based-tourism-tool-sustainable-development</ref>\n\nCommunity-based sustainable tourism (CBST) associates the success of the sustainability of the ecotourism location to the management practices of the communities who are directly or indirectly dependent on the location for their livelihoods. A salient feature of CBST is that local knowledge is usually utilised alongside wide general frameworks of ecotourism business models. This allows the participation of locals at the management level and typically allows a more intimate understanding of the environment.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe use of local knowledge also means an easier entry level into a tourism industry for locals whose jobs or livelihoods are affected by the use of their environment as tourism locations. Environmentally sustainable development crucially depends on the presence of local support for a project.<ref>{{cite book|last=Drake|first=S|title='Local Participation in ecotourism project' in Nature Tourism|year=1991|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington D.C.|pages=132}}</ref> It has also been noted that in order for success projects must provide direct benefits for the local community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Epler Wood|first=M|title='Global Solutions: on ecotourism society', in Nature Tourism|year=1991|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington D.C.|pages=204}}</ref>\n\nHowever, recent research has found that economic linkages generated by CBST may only be sporadic, and that the linkages with agriculture are negatively affected by seasonality and by the small scale of the cultivated areas. This means that CBST may only have small-scale positive effects for these communities.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Trejos | first1 = B | last2 = Chiang | first2 = LHN | year = 2009 | title = Local economic linkages to community-based tourism in rural Costa Rica | journal = Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 373\u2013387 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9493.2009.00375.x}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been said that partnerships between governments and tourism agencies with smaller communities is not particularly effective because of the disparity in aims between the two groups, i.e. true sustainability versus mass tourism for maximum profit. In Honduras such a divergence can be demonstrated where consultants from the World Bank and officials from the Institute of tourism wanted to set up a selection of 5-star hotels near various [[ecotourism]] destinations. But another operating approach in the region by USAID and APROECOH (an ecotourism association) promotes community-based efforts which has trained many local Hondurans.

In Mowforth and Munt's book 'Tourism and Sustainability: New Tourism in the Third World, they criticised a document that was written by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the World Tourism Organisation and the Earth Council, which was included in Agenda 21. It was entitled 'Agenda 21 for the Travel and Tourism Industry: Towards Environmentally Sustainable Development'. Mowforth and Munt commented on the language used to describe the environment and local culture in such documents because the preservation of the environment and local culture are the two main objectives when practising sustainable tourism. They pointed out that some of the key words used were 'core asset', 'core product', 'product quality' and 'preserve'.<ref>{{cite book|author1=WTTC, WTO  |author2=Earth Council |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Agenda 21 for the travel and tourism industry: Towards Environmentally Sustainable Development|year=1995|publisher=WTTC|location=London}}</ref> They argued that the treatment of the environment as a marketable product was clear and that such documents provide a good list of advice for Third World governments regarding sustainable tourism but do not actually provide the resources to incorporate them into the development of their tourism industries.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mowforth, M.  |author2=Munt, I. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Tourism and Sustainability: New Tourism in the Third World|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0203437292}}</ref>\n\nIt is arguments such as these that postulate that there is a gap between the advice given by non-governmental or inter-governmental organisations to Third World governments and what can actually be brought to realisation. These arguments try and persuade readers that documents like the one released by the WTTC that the development of sustainable tourism actually 'bypasses the interests of local people'.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mowforth, M.  |author2=Munt, I. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Tourism and Sustainability: New Tourism in the Third World|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0203437292|pages=298}}</ref>\n\n===Responsible tourism===\nThere are many definitions and understandings of responsible tourism.

It is more than a form of tourism as it represents an approach to engaging with tourism, be that as a tourist, a business, locals at a destination or any other tourism stakeholder. It emphasizes that all stakeholders are responsible for the kind of tourism they develop or engage in. This ensures that the tourism service providers and purchasers or consumers are held accountable.<ref name=\":0\" /> Whilst different groups will see responsibility in different ways, the shared understanding is that responsible tourism should entail an improvement in tourism.

However, the objective is to create better places for people to live in and to visit. Importantly, there is no blueprint for responsible tourism: what is deemed responsible may differ depending on places and cultures. Responsible Tourism is an aspiration that can be realized in different ways in different originating markets and in the diverse destinations of the world (Goodwin, 2016).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Responsible Tourism : Using Tourism for Sustainable Development.|last=Goodwin, Harold.|date=2016|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers Ltd|isbn=978-1-910158-86-9|oclc=1086998051}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of responsible tourism emerged following the environmental awareness that rose out of the 1960s and 70s amidst a growing phenomenon of \u201cmass tourism\u201d.

The idea is to empower local communities through travel related businesses around the world, first and foremost in [[developing countries]]. The idea of humane travel or humane [[tourism]] is to connect travelers from [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] seeking new adventures and authentic experiences directly, to local businesses in the specific locations they wish to visit \u2013 thus, giving economic advantages to local businesses and giving travelers authentic and truly unique travel experiences. Humane travel or humane tourism focuses on the people, the local community. The idea is to enable travelers to experience the world through the eyes of its local people while contributing directly to those people, ensuring that tourist dollars benefit the local community directly.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nHumane tourism is about giving opportunity to the local people, empower them, enable them to enjoy the fruits of tourism directly. The [[Internet]] is changing tourism. More and more travelers are planning their travels and vacations via the net. The Internet enables people to cut off commissions. The traveler can search for new destinations to visit, talk or read about other people experience, and buy the services directly. The Internet platform can encourage local people to start new businesses and that already existing small businesses will begin to promote themselves through the net and receive the economic advantages of this directly in their communities. The world is now in a new tourism age, with globalization and the Internet playing a key role.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe new travelers have traveled the world, they have seen the classic sites. Staying at a Western hotel is not attractive enough, and they are excited by the prospect of experiencing the authentic local way of life: to go fishing with a local fisherman, to eat the fish with his family, to sleep in a typical village house. These tourists or travelers, are happy to know that while doing so they promote the economic well-being of those same people they spend time with.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nHumane tourism is part of Responsible tourism. The concept of Responsible Tourism originated in the work of Jost Krippendorf in The Holiday Makers<ref>1987, Jost Krippendorf, Holiday Makers,\n{{ISBN|978-0-7506-4348-1}}, {{ISBN|0-7506-4348-X}}, 1987</ref> called for \u201crebellious tourists and rebellious locals\u201d to create new forms of tourism. His vision was \u201cto develop and promote new forms of tourism, which will bring the greatest possible benefit to all the participants \u2013 travelers, the host population and the tourist business, without causing intolerable ecological and social damage.\u201d As one can see he already talked, back in the 80s about benefits for the host population and used the term human tourism. Humane travel focuses on that host local population.\n\nThe [[South Africa]]n national tourism policy (1996)<ref>available at: http://www.haroldgoodwin.info/resources/Explanatory%20Note.pdf</ref> used the term \"responsible tourism\" and mentioned the well-being of the local community as a main factor.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0160-7383(95)00043-7 | volume=23 | title=New directions in tourism for third world development | journal=Annals of Tourism Research | pages=48\u201370 | year=1996 | last1 = Brohman | first1 = John| citeseerx=10.1.1.330.6563 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Cape Town]] Declaration on Responsible Tourism in Destinations,<ref>available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.ansvarligturisme.org/CapeTown.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106134610/http://www.ansvarligturisme.org/CapeTown.html |archive-date=2009-01-06 |df= }}</ref> agreed in 2002, that Responsible Tourism is about \u201cmaking better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit.\u201d The declaration focused on \"places\" but did mention the local population.\n\nFrom the [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] summit or earth summit on 1992<ref>[[Earth Summit]]</ref> until the [[UN]] Commission on Sustainable Development in 1999,<ref>[[Commission on Sustainable Development]]</ref> the main focus of the tourism industry was the earth, the planet, the places, \"green\" or \"eco\" tourism. Now there is a trend to include the local population. This trend or branch of responsible tourism is called humane tourism or humane travel.\n\n===Responsible hospitality===\nAs with the view of responsible tourism, responsible hospitality is essentially about creating better places for people to live in, and better places for people to visit.  This does not mean all forms of hospitality are also forms of tourism although hospitality is the largest sector of the tourism industry. As such we should not be surprised at overlaps between responsible hospitality and responsible tourism.  In the instance where place of permanent residence is also the place where the hospitality service is consumed, if for example a meal is consumed in a local restaurant, this does not obviate the requirement to improve the place of residence. As such, the essence of Responsible Hospitality is not contingent upon touristic forms of hospitality.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nWhile Friedman (1962)<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=M.|title=Capitalism and Freedom|url=https://archive.org/details/capitalismfreedo00frie|url-access=registration|year=1962|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>  famously argued that, admittedly within legal parameters, the sole responsibility of business was to generate profit for shareholders the idea that businesses\u2019 responsibility extends beyond this has existed for decades and is most frequently encountered in the concept of [[corporate social responsibility]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=A.|title=Corporate Social Responsibility|journal=Business & Society|year=1998|volume=38|issue=3|series=3|pages=268\u2013295|doi=10.1177/000765039903800303|hdl=10806/4019|url=http://fox.leuphana.de/portal/de/publications/corporate-social-responsibility(4867aa3c-0ae1-4923-93e6-b51346e8ef49).html}}</ref> There are numerous ways businesses can and do engage in activities that are not intended to benefit shareholders and management, at least not in the short term. However, often acts of corporate social responsibility are undertaken because of the perceived benefit to business. Usually in hospitality this relates to the cost reductions associated with improved energy efficiency<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pizam|first=A.|title=Editorial: Green hotels: A fad, ploy or fact of life?|journal=International Journal of Hospitality Management|year=2009|volume=28|series=1|pages=1|doi=10.1016/j.ijhm.2008.09.001}}</ref>  but may also relate to, for example, the rise in [[ethical consumerism]] and the view that being seen to be a responsible business is beneficial to revenue growth.\n\nAs per the Cape Town Declaration on Responsible Tourism, responsible hospitality is culturally sensitive. Instead of then calling for the unachievable, responsible hospitality simply makes the case for more responsible forms of hospitality, hospitality that benefits locals first, and visitors second. Certainly, all forms of hospitality can be improved and managed so that negative impacts are minimized whilst striving for a maximization of positive impacts on the environment.\n\n==Hospitality Education==\nMinistry of Tourism, Government of India has mentioned that some of the hospitality management/ culinary training institutes in India will no longer make it mandatory for students to engage in non-vegetarian cooking. The student will be given an option to choose vegetarian cooking. IHMCTAN Ahmedabad, IHMCTAN Bhopal and IHMCTAN Jaipur are the hospitality training institutes that offer a vegetarian choice, and this practice will be extended to all IHMCTANs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofjaipur.com/news/2016/07/13/vegetarian-cooking-courses-to-be-introduced-in-hotel-management-institutes/|title=Vegetarian Cooking Courses to be Introduced in Hotel Management Institutes - City of Jaipur|website=www.cityofjaipur.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nFundamental research was presented in the book \u00abSustainable tourism development: theory, methodology, business realities\u00bb ({{lang-uk|\u00ab\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0443: \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f, \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0457 \u0431\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443\u00bb}}))<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|first=T|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0443: \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f, \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0457 \u0431\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443|year=2006|publisher=\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432. \u043d\u0430\u0446. \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433.-\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043d. \u0443\u043d-\u0442|location=\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432|pages=537}}</ref> by Ukrainian scientist Professor Tetiana Tkachenko in 2006 \u0443ear (with corrections and additions in 2009<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|first=T|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0443: \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f, \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0457 \u0431\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443|year=2009|publisher=\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432. \u043d\u0430\u0446. \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433.-\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043d. \u0443\u043d-\u0442|location=\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432|pages=463}}</ref>).

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place.

Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun.

In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying. Like ''say'', ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' occur before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  I'm '''like''' \"I'm so sorry you had to wait\"<ref name=\"frederica\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency<ref name=\"frederica\"/>, though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n'''Japanese:'''\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker AKK=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || AKK || nikundeiru || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi''''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways such as through additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or required endings of verbs. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows where the source of the quotation is from. <ref name=\"SRL Ev>{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs. <ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |page=59-81}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Quotations}}\n{{div col}}\n*[[Adage]]\n*[[Aphorism]]\n*[[Block quotation]]\n*[[Epigram]]\n*[[Fallacy of quoting out of context]]\n*[[Saying|Maxim (saying)]]\n*[[Musical quotation]]\n*[[Nested quotation]]\n*[[Proverb]]\n*[[Scare quotes]]\n*[[Sic]]\n*[[Use\u2013mention distinction]]\n*[[Quotation mark]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

The family are watching the launch in their home when they see the rocketship explode on their TV screens. 8 months later, it is revealed that Alex is applying to Greenhouse Academy to honour his mother\u2019s memory. Hayley drives Alex to Greenhouse Academy. Upon arrival, Alex introduces himself to Daniel, captain of The Eagles basketball team. He then proceeds to take the written test, whilst other main characters are introduced \u2013 including members of both the Eagles and the Ravens (the two opposing clubhouses at the Academy). Alex partakes in the physical test to join the Eagles but is sabotaged by Daniel, whilst Hayley watches from the sidelines and meets Leo, captain of the Ravens. Louis Osmond, head of Greenhouse Academy, offers both Woods siblings a place at Greenhouse, Alex in the Eagles and Hayley in the Ravens.

Though there is still tension between Alex and Daniel, Sophie, a member of the Eagles and writer for the official Greenhouse blog, befriends Alex. The Opening Challenge between the Eagles and the Ravens commences, and Hayley and Alex address the rivalry between their two clubhouses. To win the Challenge, they must solve a riddle to find a key, unlock a case and ring the gong. Hayley reluctantly joins the search on the beach to solve the first part of the riddle. Meanwhile, Sophie comforts Alex when he is teased by the other Eagles about the blog post. Leo and Hayley solve the riddle and the Ravens are crowned winners of the Opening Challenge. At the Woods home, Carter has contacted his ex-colleague and FBI agent about a suspected break-in. It is revealed that a woman named Judy hired the intruder to delete all files on the Woods family computer that included her name. Later, it is revealed that Judy is Daniel\u2019s mother and she has a secret agenda with the Dean of the Academy that is endangered by the appearance of Alex and Hayley.\n| LineColor       = 9F0000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Breaking and Entering\n| DirectedBy      = Roee Florentin\n| WrittenBy       = Giora Chamizer & Paula Yoo\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|9|8}}\n| ShortSummary    = Daniel is seen to be suffering from pain in his leg, and soon, Daniel\u2019s girlfriend Brooke Osmond becomes suspicious.

The relationship between Hayley and Leo also grows as he tries to cheer her up by playing music and teaching her some chords. The Eagles want revenge after losing the Opening Challenge, so convince Alex to steal a key from his sister to get into the Ravens' clubhouse. The Eagles vandalise the Raven\u2019s clubhouse whilst they sleep. The FBI agent from the Woods home is seen at Greenhouse, searching for a Park Ranger\u2019s lost taser as part of a missing person's case.

Leo and Hayley discover that Hayley\u2019s missing key was used to open the Raven\u2019s clubhouse when the Eagles sneaked in. They realise it must have been Alex who took Hayley\u2019s key, so she confronts him. Hayley decides to leave Greenhouse Academy that night and leaves Alex a note. The next day, the Ravens get revenge on the Eagles. Brooke confronts Daniel about the taser but the conversation ends in an argument. A fisherman finds the missing taser washed up on the beach and the FBI focus their search away from the Academy. Whilst at home, Hayley confronts her father about his current mindset, accusing him of being stuck in the past whilst he has himself and his children to care for.

It is discovered that the infection in Daniel\u2019s leg is due to a taser barb, confirming Brooke\u2019s suspicions. The Ravens begin to celebrate the Eagles misfortune, aside from Leo who tries to talk to the Eagles. Daniel wakes up in the hospital and reveals how he found the taser. Meanwhile back at the Academy, Max and Emma, both Ravens, compete in a heated chess game. The FBI discover that the taser barb was destroyed on the way to the lab so there is nothing to link Daniel to the crime. Judy and a rogue FBI agent are behind its destruction. Daniel begins the recovery process, but as punishment for not telling the truth earlier, the head of Greenhouse demotes Daniel from his captain of the Eagles position.

Daniel is upset after his demotion and argues with Brooke. Alex convinces Daniel that his best friend, Parker, would be a good choice for the new captain of the Eagles as he can be easily manipulated to enforce Daniel\u2019s rules. At first, Parker is unsure but eventually agrees. An FBI agent and Brooke begin separately investigating the explosion that destroyed the taser barb. Brooke updates Sophie and tells Sophie her theories surrounding the taser barb destruction. Leo and Hayley decide their relationship will go no further. Sophie decides to run for the Eagles captain position. At the beach near Greenhouse Academy, there is an underground lair where Judy and Marcus, the groundskeeper at the Greenhouse, conspire.

The family are watching the launch in their home when they see the rocketship explode on their TV screens. 8 months later, it is revealed that Alex is applying to Greenhouse Academy to honour his mother\u2019s memory. Hayley drives Alex to Greenhouse Academy. Upon arrival, Alex introduces himself to Daniel, captain of The Eagles basketball team. He then proceeds to take the written test, whilst other main characters are introduced \u2013 including members of both the Eagles and the Ravens (the two opposing clubhouses at the Academy). Alex partakes in the physical test to join the Eagles but is sabotaged by Daniel, whilst Hayley watches from the sidelines and meets Leo, captain of the Ravens. Louis Osmond, head of Greenhouse Academy, offers both Woods siblings a place at Greenhouse, Alex in the Eagles and Hayley in the Ravens.

Though there is still tension between Alex and Daniel, Sophie, a member of the Eagles and writer for the official Greenhouse blog, befriends Alex. The Opening Challenge between the Eagles and the Ravens commences, and Hayley and Alex address the rivalry between their two clubhouses. To win the Challenge, they must solve a riddle to find a key, unlock a case and ring the gong. Hayley reluctantly joins the search on the beach to solve the first part of the riddle. Meanwhile, Sophie comforts Alex when he is teased by the other Eagles about the blog post. Leo and Hayley solve the riddle and the Ravens are crowned winners of the Opening Challenge. At the Woods home, Carter has contacted his ex-colleague and FBI agent about a suspected break-in. It is revealed that a woman named Judy hired the intruder to delete all files on the Woods family computer that included her name. Later, it is revealed that Judy is Daniel\u2019s mother and she has a secret agenda with the Dean of the Academy that is endangered by the appearance of Alex and Hayley.\n| LineColor       = 9F0000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Breaking and Entering\n| DirectedBy      = Roee Florentin\n| WrittenBy       = Giora Chamizer & Paula Yoo\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|9|8}}\n| ShortSummary    = Daniel is seen to be suffering from pain in his leg, and soon, Daniel\u2019s girlfriend Brooke Osmond becomes suspicious.

The relationship between Hayley and Leo also grows as he tries to cheer her up by playing music and teaching her some chords. The Eagles want revenge after losing the Opening Challenge, so convince Alex to steal a key from his sister to get into the Ravens' clubhouse. The Eagles vandalise the Raven\u2019s clubhouse whilst they sleep. The FBI agent from the Woods home is seen at Greenhouse, searching for a Park Ranger\u2019s lost taser as part of a missing person's case. They suspect Jackie is behind the lost taser but she refuses to take the lie detector test to prove her innocence.

Leo and Hayley discover that Hayley\u2019s missing key was used to open the Raven\u2019s clubhouse when the Eagles sneaked in. They realise it must have been Alex who took Hayley\u2019s key, so she confronts him. Hayley decides to leave Greenhouse Academy that night and leaves Alex a note. The next day, the Ravens get revenge on the Eagles. Brooke confronts Daniel about the taser but the conversation ends in an argument. A fisherman finds the missing taser washed up on the beach and the FBI focus their search away from the Academy. Whilst at home, Hayley confronts her father about his current mindset, accusing him of being stuck in the past whilst he has himself and his children to care for.

It is discovered that the infection in Daniel\u2019s leg is due to a taser barb, confirming Brooke\u2019s suspicions. The Ravens begin to celebrate the Eagles misfortune, aside from Leo who tries to talk to the Eagles. Daniel wakes up in the hospital and reveals how he found the taser. Meanwhile back at the Academy, Max and Emma, both Ravens, compete in a heated chess game. The FBI discover that the taser barb was destroyed on the way to the lab so there is nothing to link Daniel to the crime. Judy and a rogue FBI agent are behind its destruction. Daniel begins the recovery process, but as punishment for not telling the truth earlier, the head of Greenhouse demotes Daniel from his captain of the Eagles position.

Daniel is upset after his demotion and argues with Brooke. Alex convinces Daniel that his best friend, Parker, would be a good choice for the new captain of the Eagles as he can be easily manipulated to enforce Daniel\u2019s rules. At first, Parker is unsure but eventually agrees. An FBI agent and Brooke begin separately investigating the explosion that destroyed the taser barb. Brooke updates Sophie and tells Sophie her theories surrounding the taser barb destruction. Leo and Hayley decide their relationship will go no further. Sophie decides to run for the Eagles captain position. At the beach near Greenhouse Academy, there is an underground lair where Judy and Marcus, the groundskeeper at the Greenhouse, conspire.
