The modern city of Beit Shemesh was founded in 1950.\n\n==Etymology==\nBeit Shemesh means \"house of the sun\" or \"temple of the sun\" in Hebrew. The Bronze-Age city was originally named after the [[Canaan]]ite sun-goddess [[Shapash (Canaanite goddess)|Shapash]], sometimes called Shemesh, who was worshipped there in antiquity.<ref name=\"MFA\"/>\n\nThe name Beth-Shemesh was shared by (at least) two other places in [[Israel (region)|Israel]] and one more in Egypt.<ref>\nBibleHub.com, ''Beth Shemesh'', quoting [[Strong's Concordance]] etc.  [http://biblehub.com/hebrew/1053.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908171104/http://biblehub.com/hebrew/1053.htm |date=8 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Amarna letters]] Shamash is mentioned several times, along with Addu, as one of the greatest gods: the [[Pharaoh]] is \"like Addu and Shamash\"{{dubious|1.

The ruins of the ancient biblical city of the Canaanites and [[Israelites]] are located at a site called Tel Beit Shemesh in [[Modern Hebrew]] and Tell er-Rumeileh in [[Arabic]], a [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] located near the modern city.<ref name=\"MFA\"/>\n\n====Book of Joshua====\nBeit Shemesh is first mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the [[Book of Joshua]] ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 15:10}}), as a city in the territory of the [[tribe of Judah]] on the border with the [[tribe of Dan]]. In {{bibleverse||Joshua|21:16|HE}}, this city was set aside as one of the [[13 Kohanic cities]] for the priests of the [[Levite|tribe of Levi]], the [[Kohen|Kohanim]].\n\nAnother city by the same name, Beit Shemesh, is later mentioned in {{bibleverse||Joshua|19:38|HE}}, being situated in the territory of the [[tribe of Naphtali]].\n\n====Book of Samuel====\nThe city located in the territorial bounds of the tribe of Judah is mentioned in the 6th chapter of [[1 Samuel]] as being the first city encountered by the [[Ark of the Covenant]] on its way back from [[Philistines|Philistia]] after having been [[Philistine captivity of the Ark|captured]] by the [[Philistines]] in battle ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|6:12-21|NKJV}}). The stone on which the Ark was placed is recorded as still being located there at the time of writing the [[Books of Samuel]]. In the [[King James Version]] this stone is described as \"the great stone of Abel\" ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|6:18|NKJV}}).\n\n====Book of Kings====\nIn {{Bibleref2|2 Kings 14}}, Beit Shemesh is again mentioned as being the site of the battle between King [[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]] of [[Judea]] and King [[Jehoash of Israel|Jehoash]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]].\n\n====Assyrian destruction to Early Second Temple period====\nAfter the destruction of much of Judah by [[Sennacherib]] in 701 BCE, the city was abandoned for a while, but there seems to have been an attempt by a group of Judahites at resettling Beth Shemesh, judging by the refurbishing of the water reservoir in the 7th century BCE.<ref name=\"TAU2000\"/> However, after the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] conquest of Judah in the early 580s, either the new Babylonian rulers, or the nearby Philistine metropolis of Ekron favoured by them, apparently put an end to the initiative by sealing and covering over the vital water reservoir,<ref name=\"TAU2000\">\nShlomo Bunimovitz and Zvi Lederman, ''Beth-Shemesh: A Biblical Border City between Judah and Philistia'', Tel Aviv University, 2000  [http://www.tau.ac.il/~archpubs/projects/bethshemesh_project.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005085705/http://www.tau.ac.il/~archpubs/projects/bethshemesh_project.html |date=5 October 2016 }}, retrieved 2016-09-01\n</ref> which was not uncovered until 2004.

In 1952 the first permanent houses were built in Beit Shemesh. Prior to 1948 the Ramat Beit Shemesh neighborhood area was the site belonging to the Arab village [[Bayt Nattif]]. This village was built on remnants of an ancient Judean town, with various remnants of Jewish settlement from the time, such as a mosaic floor, wineries and other remains, especially from the period of the [[Hasmonean]] kings and earlier.

The bones of animals found in the 12th\u201311th centuries BCE layer indicate a diet typical of the [[Israelites]] who inhabited the hill country in this period.

According to [[Haaretz]], \"excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal.\"<ref name=\"Hasson\">\n{{cite news|last=Hasson|first=Nir|title=National Seal found by Israeli archeologists may give substance to Samson legend|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/seal-found-by-israeli-archeologists-may-give-substance-to-samson-legend-1.454504|accessdate=3 September 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=30 Jul 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116053009/http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/seal-found-by-israeli-archeologists-may-give-substance-to-samson-legend-1.454504|archive-date=16 November 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref>\n\nAnimal bones found nearby may also be a clue to boundary disputes between different cultures.

In {{bibleverse||Joshua|21:16|HE}}, this city was set aside as one of the [[13 Kohanic cities]] for the priests of the [[Levite|tribe of Levi]], the [[Kohen|Kohanim]].\n\nAnother city by the same name, Beit Shemesh, is later mentioned in {{bibleverse||Joshua|19:38|HE}}, being situated in the territory of the [[tribe of Naphtali]].\n\n====Book of Samuel====\nThe city located in the territorial bounds of the tribe of Judah is mentioned in the 6th chapter of [[1 Samuel]] as being the first city encountered by the [[Ark of the Covenant]] on its way back from [[Philistines|Philistia]] after having been [[Philistine captivity of the Ark|captured]] by the [[Philistines]] in battle ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|6:12-21|NKJV}}). The stone on which the Ark was placed is recorded as still being located there at the time of writing the [[Books of Samuel]]. In the [[King James Version]] this stone is described as \"the great stone of Abel\" ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|6:18|NKJV}}).\n\n====Book of Kings====\nIn {{Bibleref2|2 Kings 14}}, Beit Shemesh is again mentioned as being the site of the battle between King [[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]] of [[Judea]] and King [[Jehoash of Israel|Jehoash]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]].\n\n====Assyrian destruction to Early Second Temple period====\nAfter the destruction of much of Judah by [[Sennacherib]] in 701 BCE, the city was abandoned for a while, but there seems to have been an attempt by a group of Judahites at resettling Beth Shemesh, judging by the refurbishing of the water reservoir in the 7th century BCE.<ref name=\"TAU2000\"/> However, after the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] conquest of Judah in the early 580s, either the new Babylonian rulers, or the nearby Philistine metropolis of Ekron favoured by them, apparently put an end to the initiative by sealing and covering over the vital water reservoir,<ref name=\"TAU2000\">\nShlomo Bunimovitz and Zvi Lederman, ''Beth-Shemesh: A Biblical Border City between Judah and Philistia'', Tel Aviv University, 2000  [http://www.tau.ac.il/~archpubs/projects/bethshemesh_project.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005085705/http://www.tau.ac.il/~archpubs/projects/bethshemesh_project.html |date=5 October 2016 }}, retrieved 2016-09-01\n</ref> which was not uncovered until 2004.

In 1952 the first permanent houses were built in Beit Shemesh. Prior to 1948 the Ramat Beit Shemesh neighborhood area was the site belonging to the Arab village [[Bayt Nattif]]. This village was built on remnants of an ancient Judean town, with various remnants of Jewish settlement from the time, such as a mosaic floor, wineries and other remains, especially from the period of the [[Hasmonean]] kings and earlier.

The only remnants of a [[Defensive wall|fortified city]] with an advanced water system, from the time of the early [[Kingdom of Judah]] was found here. The bones of animals found in the 12th\u201311th centuries BCE layer indicate a diet typical of the [[Israelites]] who inhabited the hill country in this period. These together with the pottery finds indicate the cultural influences on the inhabitants of this border town.

The seal was found on the floor of a house at Beit Shemesh and is dated to the 12th century BCE. According to [[Haaretz]], \"excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal.\"<ref name=\"Hasson\">\n{{cite news|last=Hasson|first=Nir|title=National Seal found by Israeli archeologists may give substance to Samson legend|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/seal-found-by-israeli-archeologists-may-give-substance-to-samson-legend-1.454504|accessdate=3 September 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=30 Jul 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116053009/http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/seal-found-by-israeli-archeologists-may-give-substance-to-samson-legend-1.454504|archive-date=16 November 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref>\n\nAnimal bones found nearby may also be a clue to boundary disputes between different cultures.

The Gabrieli\u00f1o Indians migrated to the place now called Bell in 500 BC. Spaniards have been living in this area of California since the mid-18th century. Among the early Spanish settlers was one of California's first families, the [[Lugo]]s. While stationed at [[Mission San Antonio de Padua]] near [[Salinas, California|Salinas]], California, Francisco Lugo's first California son, Antonio Maria Lugo was born in 1775.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bell.k12.ca.us/decades/history/timeline.htm |title=Timeline |publisher=Bell.k12.ca.us |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822150646/http://www.bell.k12.ca.us/decades/history/timeline.htm |archivedate=August 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> That son became Don Antonio Maria Lugo, Spanish aristocrat and soldier, who settled on 30,000 acres of land that encompasses what is now the city of Bell.

The grant was confirmed by the Mexican governor in 1838. By 1865, the Lugo family's fortune had dwindled and most of the Rancho was sold for less than a dollar per acre. The Lugo family did manage to retain its home, built about 1810, which is the now oldest house in Los Angeles County. The original adobe house was on Gage Avenue.<ref name=\"cityofbell.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofbell.org/|title=City of Bell - Home|website=www.cityofbell.org}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1870 and 1890, settlers arrived to the area and among those was the city's founder. In 1876, the pioneer residents for whom the city is named, [[James George Bell]] and his wife Susan Abia Hollenbeck Bell, and their two children, Maude Elizabeth and Alphonzo Sr. moved from [[Los Angeles]] where they lived for a short period with Susan's brother, [[John Edward Hollenbeck|John Hollenbeck]], in their Victorian style home \u2014 the Bell House, now a historic landmark located at 4401 East Gage Avenue.<ref name=\"cityofbell.org\"/> On April 6, 2000, the Bell House was dedicated as a California State Historical Resource.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n[[Image:Bell House.jpg|thumb|left|James George Bell House]]\n\nThey acquired about 360 acres (145.7&nbsp;ha) of land and in the next decade, helped in its development as a small farming and cattle raising community. The Bell Family lived at the [[John Edward Hollenbeck|Hollenbeck]]\u2019s \u201cTown House\u201d on 4th and Breed Street until they moved into the \u201cranch\u201d Bell House in 1876.

In 1898, the town's name was changed from Rancho San Antonio to Bell, in honor of its pioneer founders.<ref name=\"cityofbell.org\"/>\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the Bell area was a sparsely settled countryside with a scattering of houses, including the Bell family's home. Between 1900 and 1915, more people settled into the area. More homes, schools, churches and a library were built, and several small businesses were established by 1913. The citizens agreed to provide all facilities and services for the library, except for the books.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1935, an explosive growth in population occurred in the Bell area. Old and new residents built new businesses, established schools, and founded community organizations, such as the Bell [[Chamber of Commerce]] and the Woman's Club. An area-wide sanitation district was formed in 1923 to provide sewer facilities.\n\nIn 1924, George O. Wheeler founded the ''Industrial Post'', the local newspaper. By the early 1960s, the ''Bell Industrial Post'' had become the ''Bell-[[Maywood, California|Maywood]]-[[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]] Industrial Post''. It was later renamed the ''Community News'', and became part of the Los Cerritos Community Newspaper Group. In 1998 it was sold again.

Among the early Spanish settlers was one of California\u2019s first families, the [[Lugo]]s.

The grant was confirmed by the Mexican governor in 1838. By 1865, the Lugo family's fortune had dwindled and most of the Rancho was sold for less than a dollar per acre. The Lugo family did manage to retain its home, built about 1810, which is the now oldest house in Los Angeles County. The original adobe house was on Gage Avenue.<ref name=\"cityofbell.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofbell.org/|title=City of Bell - Home|website=www.cityofbell.org}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1870 and 1890, settlers arrived to the area and among those was the city\u2019s founder. In 1876, the pioneer residents for whom the city is named, [[James George Bell]] and his wife Susan Abia Hollenbeck Bell, and their two children, Maude Elizabeth and Alphonzo Sr. moved from [[Los Angeles]] where they lived for a short period with Susan's brother, [[John Edward Hollenbeck|John Hollenbeck]], in their Victorian style home \u2014 the Bell House, now a historic landmark located at 4401 East Gage Avenue.<ref name=\"cityofbell.org\"/> On April 6, 2000, the Bell House was dedicated as a California State Historical Resource.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n[[Image:Bell House.jpg|thumb|left|James George Bell House]]\n\nThey acquired about 360 acres (145.7&nbsp;ha) of land and in the next decade, helped in its development as a small farming and cattle raising community.

Between 1900 and 1915, more people settled into the area. More homes, schools, churches and a library were built, and several small businesses were established by 1913. The citizens agreed to provide all facilities and services for the library, except for the books.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1935, an explosive growth in population occurred in the Bell area. Old and new residents built new businesses, established schools, and founded community organizations, such as the Bell [[Chamber of Commerce]] and the Woman's Club. An area-wide sanitation district was formed in 1923 to provide sewer facilities.\n\nIn 1924, George O. Wheeler founded the ''Industrial Post'', the local newspaper. By the early 1960s, the ''Bell Industrial Post'' had become the ''Bell-[[Maywood, California|Maywood]]-[[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]] Industrial Post''. It was later renamed the ''Community News'', and became part of the Los Cerritos Community Newspaper Group. In 1998 it was sold again.
