Terrain parks have their roots in [[skatepark]]s and many of the features are common to both.\n\nFrom their inception to as recently as the 1980s, ski areas generally banned jumping and any kind of aerial maneuvers, usually under penalty of revoking the offender's lift ticket.  By the 1990s, most areas provided snow features specifically catering to aerial snowsports.  One of the first in-bounds terrain parks was the snowboard park built in 1990 at Vail's (Colorado) resort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transworldsnowboarding.com/article.jsp?ID=1000020997 |title=Snowboard History Timeline Part 3(1990's)}}</ref>  The park was copied soon in other resorts.  Today most resorts have terrain parks, with many having multiple parks of various difficulty. Some resorts are almost exclusively terrain parks such as Echo Mountain Park in Evergreen, Colorado and Snow Park in Wanaka, New Zealand.  In Colorado there has been a recent trend for defunct resorts such as Squaw Pass (now Echo Mountain Park) to be reopened, catering to terrain park users.\n\n==History==\nThe first known terrain park (then called a \u2018snowboard park\u2019) was built at [http://www.bearvalley.com/ Bear Valley Ski Area] (California) in the 1989-90 season. It was the brainchild of Bear Valley's Marketing Director Sean McMahon and California snowboarder and contest organizer Mike McDaniel.\n\nMcMahon's idea was to create an area of the mountain specifically for snowboarders\u2014modeled after the skateparks of the 1970s, featuring jumps, jibs, and a [[halfpipe]]\u2014that would bring new customers to the small, family operated ski area in the Central Sierra. He enlisted the help of McDaniel, who had experience building snowboard-specific terrain features such as halfpipes and jumps, through his work organizing early snowboard events. McDaniel in turn, brought in snowboard pioneers Mike Chantry and Keith Kimmel to consult on the design and construction of the park, to be located on the front side of Bear Valley's upper mountain.\n\nA surface lift was installed to bring snowboarders from the bottom of the area back to the top, without having to take a chair lift to the top of the mountain. Kim Krause, who had run lifts in other areas of the resort, was brought on as the park's first lift operator.\n\nIt became apparent that the park would need ongoing construction, grooming, and maintenance, and McDaniel was hired by Bear Valley in the fall of 1989 to be Snowboard Park Manager. The new mountain attraction was dubbed the \u201cPolar Park.\u201d Opening day in late November 1989 featured a demonstration by professional snowboarders Damian Sanders, Terry Kidwell, [[Noah Salasnek]], Mike and Tina Basich and others. The event was covered by [[Thrasher Magazine]], International Snowboard Magazine and local media.\n\n==Difficulty==\nTerrain parks (in the United States and Canada) have designations with respect to safety similar to standard alpine slopes.  They differ in their designation and degrees of difficulty.  They are identified with orange ovals to differentiate them from standard slopes, and are further distinguished by large, medium, or small features.  While features vary between resorts, commonly small features are short jumps and rails that are at the slope surface,  Medium features are {{convert|10|to|30|ft|m|adj=on}} high jumps along with jibs requiring small jumps to mount.  Large features include {{convert|30|to|90|ft|m|adj=on}} jumps along with complex jibs and large vertical pipes.\n\n\"Progression parks\" are easier terrain parks, meant for those just starting to ride these features.\n\n==Jibs==\n[[Image:Levi 293.JPG|thumb|Skier on funbox in terrain park in [[Levi, Finland]]]]\nJibs are any type of fixture which can be ridden with the board/skis either parallel or perpendicular to the snow surface, ridden while spinning around on, or ridden and jumped or tricked from.  Many jib features resemble outdoor items used when snowboarding in urban areas, such as stair handrails, benches, tables, etc.  In the park these feature consist of:\n\n;Rail: A metal feature, either rounded or with a flat surface, which a skier or snowboarder can slide across (called \"jibbing\"). Many people confuse rails with wider surfaces with boxes, however these are not, and are just rails with a little UHMWPE on top.\n;Box: Similar to a rail, but wider with an [[UHMWPE|ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)]] surface. May or may not have metal edges. ''Compare [[Funbox]], for skateboarding.''\n;Table Top: Similar to a box, but much wider. Commonly used by beginners who want to become comfortable with box type surfaces before moving on to real boxes. Table Tops are very wide and therefore allow a skier or snowboarder to slide across the surface and is difficult to fall on.\n;Trees: used as natural surfaces and can be found either on or off the trails.\nRails and boxes have many different shapes and sizes: straight, sloped, curved (often called a \"Rainbow\"), or kinked.  Rails, especially rainbow, will also be seen curving over obstacles or vehicles.\n;Park Bench and Picnic Table: A funbox type feature that resembles a park bench or picnic table.  The edges are made of metal rails and the surfaces of UHMWPE.  These features provide multiple sliding surfaces.\n;Mail Box: A large diameter metal pipe of varying lengths with a cross-section resembling a mail box.\n;Wall ride: A vertical, or near-vertical, wall-like surface. Most wall rides have another similar surface at the top that is angled down towards the wall, but more perpendicular to the ground (like a sideways funbox attached to the top of the wall ride)\n;Barrels: A more recent addition to terrain parks, barrels are features usually shaped like garbage cans or vertical cylinders with a small jump leading up to it. This feature is jibbed by going off the jump and tapping it in various ways with your skis or snowboard. Variations include spinning to and from the barrel, tapping with different parts of the skis or stalling on top of the barrel.\n;Rainbow:  A box or rail that has a hump like a \"rainbow.\"\n;Kink: \nA box or rail that has one or more \"kinks\". A kink is a sudden change in angle of a sliding surface. An example of a kinked feature is a F-D-F (flat-down-flat).\n;Pole Jam: \nA rail that is stuck into a jump at an upward angle\n;Tap Feature:\nA feature that comes in many shapes and sizes and is meant to be tapped with either the tail or tip end of skis or snowboards.\n\n==Jumps==\nJumps in terrain parks can range from five feet to 100 feet & above, and will vary park to park and resort to resort.  In contrast to jibs, typically being manufactured off-site of steel and plastic, jumps are most commonly constructed entirely of snow or snow with a base of dirt.  Tricks such as grabs, twists, spins and flips are often performed while in the air from a jump.  Types of jumps in a park may consist of:\n\n;Tabletop: A jump that looks somewhat like a table or trapezoid in which one takes off from an incline (the lip), clear a flat part (the table), and lands on a downslope (the landing)\n;Step-down: A jump in which the landing is lower than the takeoff\n;Step-up: A jump in which the landing is higher than the takeoff\n;Gap: A jump that has a gap in between the take off and landing, instead of a table\n;Hip: A jump with one landing, which is perpendicular to the take off\n;Spine: A jump with two landings, which are perpendicular to the take off. Similar to a hip, but with a landing on both sides.\n;Channel gap: Looks like a wide jump cut at the middle, so it becomes a gap between the two jumps\n\n==Vertical==\n;[[Half-pipe]]:  A downhill trough with vertical lips on each side, resembling half of a cylinder. ''See also: [[Superpipe]]''\n;Quarter-pipe:  A vertical lip with the intention that the user launch straight into the air, then land on the same lip.\n\n==Terrain park only areas==\nTerrain park only areas which are similar to regular resorts are becoming more common and are increasing in popularity. These areas typically have jumps and features on all trails and are generally smaller than most resorts.  While their size may be less than that of larger resorts these areas are more appealing to terrain park riders as they are typically cheaper, have more extreme or uncommon features, and have music played over loud speakers throughout the area.  These areas are generally rider owned and operated.

Relations began in the late 18th and early 19th century, with the diplomatic but force-backed missions of U.S. ship captains [[James Glynn]] and [[Matthew C. Perry]] to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].\n\nThe countries maintained relatively cordial relations after that. Potential disputes were resolved. Japan acknowledged American control of Hawaii and the Philippines and the United States reciprocated regarding Korea. Disagreements about Japanese immigration to the U.S. were resolved in 1907. The two were allies against Germany in [[World War I]].\n\nStarting in 1931, tensions escalated. Japanese actions against China in 1931 and especially after 1937 during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] caused the United States, along with its allies Britain and the Netherlands, to cut off the oil and steel Japan needed for their military conquests. Japan responded with attacks on the Allies, including [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941]], which heavily damaged the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]], opening the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] of [[World War II]]. The United States made a massive investment in naval power and systematically destroyed Japan's offensive capabilities while [[island hopping campaign|island hopping]] across the Pacific. To force a surrender, the Americans systematically bombed Japanese cities, culminating in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] in August 1945. [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]], and was subjected to seven years of [[Occupation of Japan|military occupation]] by the United States, during which the American occupiers under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] eliminated the military factor and rebuilt the economic and political systems so as to transform Japan into a democracy.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s Japan, while neutral, grew rapidly by supplying American wars in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].  The trade relationship has particularly prospered since then, with Japanese automobiles and consumer electronics being especially popular, and Japan became the world's second economic power after the United States. (In 2010 it dropped to third place after China).\n\nFrom the late 20th century and onwards, the United States and Japan have firm and very active political, economic and military relationships. The United States considers Japan to be one of its closest allies and partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/14/obama-us-will-stand-longtime-ally-japan/|title=Obama: US will stand by longtime ally Japan|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/06/23/us-korea-north-usa-japan-idUSN2328607520080623|title=Rice says U.S. won't forget Japanese abductees|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=17 September 2014|date=2008-06-23}}</ref>  Japan is currently one of the most pro-American nations in the world, with 67% of Japanese viewing the United States favorably, according to a 2018 Pew survey;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2018/11/12/views-of-the-u-s-and-president-trump/|title=Japanese views of U.S., Trump|last=NW|first=1615 L.

Historian John Davidann argues that the evangelical American YMCA missionaries linked Protestantism with American nationalism. They wanted converts to choose \"Jesus over Japan\".  The Christians in Japan, although small minority, held a strong connection to the ancient \"bushido\" tradition of warrior ethics that undergirded Japanese nationalism.

However, they identified a long-term threat from the colonial powers, especially Britain, the United States, the Netherlands and France, as deliberately blocking Japan's aspirations, especially regarding control of China. The goal became \"Asia for the Asians\" as Japan began mobilizing anti-colonial sentiment in India and Southeast Asia. Japan took control of Manchuria in 1931 over the strong objections of the League of Nations, Britain and especially the United States. In 1937, it seized control of the main cities on the East Coast of China, over strong American protests.  Japanese leaders thought their deeply Asian civilization gave it a natural right to this control and refused to negotiate Western demands that it withdraw from China.<ref>John T.

The United States had a powerful navy in the Pacific, and it was working closely with the British and the Dutch governments.  When Japan seized Indochina (now Vietnam) in 1940\u201341, the United States, along with Australia, Britain and the [[Dutch government in exile]], boycotted Japan via a trade embargo.  They cut off 90% of Japan's oil supply, and Japan had to either withdraw from China or go to war with the US and Britain as well as China to get the oil.\n\nUnder the Washington Naval treaty of 1922 and the London Naval treaty, the American navy was to be equal to the Japanese navy by a ratio of 10:6.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pelz, Stephen E.

President Roosevelt imposed increasingly stringent economic sanctions intended to deprive Japan of the oil and steel, as well as dollars, it needed to continue its war in China. Japan reacted by forging an alliance with Germany and Italy in 1940, known as the [[Tripartite Pact]], which worsened its relations with the US. In July 1941, the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands froze all Japanese assets and cut off oil shipments\u2014Japan had little oil of its own.<ref>Conrad Totman, ''A History of Japan'' (2005). pp 554\u2013556.</ref>\n\nJapan had conquered all of Manchuria and most of coastal China by 1939, but the Allies refused to recognize the conquests and stepped up their commitment.<ref>Herbert Feis, ''China Tangle: The American Effort in China from Pearl Harbor to the Marshall Mission'' (1953) [http://press.princeton.edu/TOCs/c517.html contents]</ref> President Franklin Roosevelt arranged for American pilots and ground crews to set up an aggressive Chinese Air Force nicknamed the [[Flying Tigers]] that would not only defend against Japanese air power but also start bombing the Japanese islands.<ref>Daniel Ford, ''Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941-1942'' (2016).</ref>\n\nDiplomacy provided very little space for the adjudication of the deep differences between Japan and the United States.  The United States was firmly and almost unanimously committed to defending the integrity of China.  The isolationism that characterized the strong opposition of many Americans toward war in Europe did not apply to Asia.  Japan had no friends in the United States, nor in Great Britain, nor the Netherlands.  The United States had not yet declared war on Germany, but was closely collaborating with Britain and the Netherlands regarding the Japanese threat.  The United States started to move its newest B-17 heavy bombers to bases in the Philippines, well within range of Japanese cities.  The goal was deterrence of any Japanese attacks to the south.  Furthermore, plans were well underway to ship American air forces to China, where American pilots in Chinese uniforms flying American warplanes, were preparing to bomb Japanese cities well before Pearl Harbor.<ref>Michael Schaller, \"American Air Strategy in China, 1939-1941: The Origins of Clandestine Air Warfare\" ''American Quarterly'' 28#1 (1976), pp. 3-19 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2712474  in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Martha Byrd, ''Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger'' (2003).</ref>\n\nGreat Britain, although realizing it could not defend Hong Kong, was confident in its abilities to defend its major base in Singapore and the surrounding Malaya Peninsula.

Their role was to delay the Japanese invasion long enough to destroy the oil wells, drilling equipment, refineries and pipelines that were the main target of Japanese attacks.\n\nDecisions in Tokyo were controlled by the Army, and then rubber-stamped by Emperor Hirohito; the Navy also had a voice.  However the civilian government and diplomats were largely ignored.  The Army saw the conquest of China as its primary mission, but operations in Manchuria had created a long border with the Soviet Union.  Informal, large-scale military confrontations with the Soviet forces at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Nomonhan]] in summer 1939 demonstrated that the  Soviets possessed a decisive military superiority.  Even though it would help Germany's war against Russia after June 1941, the Japanese army refused to go north.\n\nThe Japanese realized the urgent need for oil, over 90% of which was supplied by the United States, Britain and the Netherlands.  From the Army's perspective, a secure fuel supply was essential for the warplanes, tanks and trucks\u2014as well as the Navy's warships and warplanes.  The solution was to send the Navy south, to seize the oilfields in the Dutch East Indies and nearby British colonies. Some admirals and many civilians, including Prime Minister [[Konoe Fumimaro]], believed that a war with the U.S. would end in defeat. The alternative was loss of honor and power.<ref>Haruo Tohmatsu and H. P.

However, they did not speak for the Army leadership, which made the decisions.

Both sides interred enemy aliens. Superior American military production supported a campaign of island-hopping in the Pacific and heavy bombardment of cities in Okinawa and the Japanese mainland. The strategy was broadly successful as the Allies gradually occupied territories and moved toward the home islands, intending massive invasions beginning in fall 1945. Japanese resistance remained fierce. The [[Pacific War]] lasted until September 1, 1945, when Japan surrendered in response to the American [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] \u2013 among the most controversial acts in [[military history]] \u2013 and the Soviet entry into the Asian theater of war following the surrender of Germany.\n\nThe official [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] was signed on September 2, and the United States subsequently [[Occupation of Japan|occupied]] Japan in its entirety.\n\n[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|The [[Fat Man]] [[mushroom cloud]] resulting from the [[nuclear explosion]] over [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] rises 18 km (11 mi, 60,000 ft) into the air from the [[hypocenter]].]]\n\n==Post\u2013World War II period==\n[[File:Shiro-ishii.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shir\u014d Ishii]], commander of [[Unit 731]], was granted immunity and recruited by the United States]]\nHistorian [[Akira Iriye]] argues that World War II and the  Occupation decisively shaped bilateral relations after 1945.  He presents the oil crisis of 1941 as the confrontation of two diametrically opposed concepts of Asian Pacific order. Japan was militaristic, and sought to create and control a self-sufficient economic region in Southeast Asia. Franklin D Roosevelt and his successors were internationalists seeking an open international economic order. The war reflected the interplay of military, economic, political, and ideological factors. The postwar era led to a radical change in bilateral relations from stark hostility to close friendship and political alliance. The United States was now the world's strongest military and economic power. Japan under American tutelage 1945-1951, but then entirely on its own, rejected militarism, embraced democracy and became dedicated to two international policies: economic development and pacifism. Postwar relations between the two countries reached an unprecedented level of compatibility that peaked around 1970. Since then, Japan has become an economic superpower while the United States lost its status as the global economic hegemon. Consequently, their approaches to major issues of foreign policy have diverged. China now is the third player in East Asia, and quite independent of both the United States and Japan. Nevertheless, the strong history of close economic and political relations, and increasingly common set of cultural values continues to provide robust support for continued bilateral political cooperation.<ref>Akira Iriye, \"Pearl Harbor: A Fifty-Year Perspective\" ''Amerikastudien'' (1993)) 38#1 13-24.</ref>\n\n===Post\u2013World War II occupation period===\n{{Main|Occupation of Japan}}\n\nAt the end of the [[Second World War]], Japan was occupied by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], led by the United States with contributions from Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. This was the first time since the unification of Japan that the island nation had been occupied by a foreign power. The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]], signed on September 8, 1951, marked the end of the Allied occupation, and when it went into effect on April 28, 1952, Japan was once again an independent state, and an ally of the United States. Economic growth in the United States occurred and made the Automobile industry boom in 1946.\n\n===1950s: After the occupation===\n{{Main|Treaty of San Francisco|United States Forces Japan}}\nIn the years after [[World War II]], Japan's relations with the United States were placed on an equal footing for the first time at the end of the occupation by the Allied forces in April 1952. This equality, the legal basis of which was laid down in the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan|peace treaty signed by forty-eight Allied nations and Japan]], was initially largely nominal. A favorable Japanese balance of payments with the United States was achieved in 1954, mainly as a result of United States military and aid spending in Japan.<ref>LaFeber, ''The Clash: US-Japanese Relations Throughout History'' ch 10</ref>\n\nThe Japanese people's feeling of dependence lessened gradually as the disastrous results of World War II subsided into the background and trade with the United States expanded.  Self-confidence grew as the country applied its resources and organizational skill to regaining economic health. This situation gave rise to a general desire for greater independence from United States influence. During the 1950s and 1960s, this feeling was especially evident in the Japanese attitude toward United States military bases on the four main islands of Japan and in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying the southern two-thirds of the [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThe government had to balance left-wing pressure advocating dissociation from the United States allegedly 'against the realities' of the need for military protection. Recognizing the popular desire for the return of the Ryukyu Islands and the Bonin Islands (also known as the [[Ogasawara Islands]]), the United States as early as 1953 relinquished its control of the [[Amami]] group of islands at the northern end of the Ryukyu Islands. But the United States made no commitment to return Okinawa, which was then under United States military administration for an indefinite period as provided in Article 3 of the peace treaty. Popular agitation culminated in a unanimous resolution adopted by the [[Japanese diet|Diet]] in June 1956, calling for a return of Okinawa to Japan.\n\n===1960s: Military alliance and return of territories===\nBilateral talks on revising the 1952 security pact began in 1959, and the new [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security]] was signed in Washington on January 19, 1960. When the pact was submitted to the Diet for ratification on February 5, it became the subject of bitter debate over the Japan\u2013United States relationship and the occasion for violence in an all-out effort by the leftist opposition to prevent its passage. It was finally approved by the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] on May 20. [[Japan Socialist Party]] deputies boycotted the lower house session and tried to prevent the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] deputies from entering the chamber; they were forcibly removed by the police. Massive demonstrations and rioting by students and trade unions followed. These outbursts prevented a scheduled visit to Japan by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and precipitated the resignation of Prime Minister [[Kishi Nobusuke]], but not before the treaty was passed by default on June 19, when the [[House of Councillors]] failed to vote on the issue within the required thirty days after lower house approval.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">LaFeber, ''The Clash: US-Japanese Relations Throughout History'' ch 11</ref>\n\nUnder the treaty, both parties assumed an obligation to assist each other in case of armed attack on territories under Japanese administration. (It was understood, however, that Japan could not come to the defense of the United States because it was constitutionally forbidden to send armed forces overseas (Article 9). In particular, the constitution forbids the maintenance of \"land, sea, and air forces.\" It also expresses the Japanese people's renunciation of \"the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes\". Accordingly, the Japanese find it difficult to send their \"self-defense\" forces overseas, even for peace-keeping purposes.) The scope of the new treaty did not extend to the Ryukyu Islands, but an appended minute made clear that in case of an armed attack on the islands, both governments would consult and take appropriate action. Notes accompanying the treaty provided for prior consultation between the two governments before any major change occurred in the deployment of United States troops or equipment in Japan. Unlike the 1952 security pact, the new treaty provided for a ten-year term, after which it could be revoked upon one year's notice by either party. The treaty included general provisions on the further development of international cooperation and on improved future economic cooperation.\n\nBoth countries worked closely to fulfill the United States promise, under Article 3 of the peace treaty, to return all Japanese territories acquired by the United States in war. In June 1968, the United States returned the [[Bonin Islands]] (including [[Iwo Jima]]) to Japanese administration control. In 1969, the Okinawa reversion issue and Japan's security ties with the United States became the focal points of partisan political campaigns. The situation calmed considerably when Prime Minister Sato Eisaku visited Washington in November 1969, and in a joint communiqu\u00e9 signed by him and President [[Richard Nixon]], announced the United States agreement to return Okinawa to Japan in 1972. In June 1971, after eighteen months of negotiations, the two countries signed an agreement providing for the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/><ref>Gavan McCormack, and Satoko Oka Norimatsu, ''Resistant Islands: Okinawa Confronts Japan and the United States'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe Japanese government's firm and voluntary endorsement of the security treaty and the settlement of the Okinawa reversion question meant that two major political issues in Japan\u2013United States relations were eliminated. But new issues arose. In July 1971, the Japanese government was surprised by Nixon's dramatic announcement of his forthcoming [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to the People's Republic of China]]. Many Japanese were chagrined by the failure of the United States to consult in advance with Japan before making such a fundamental change in foreign policy. The following month, the government was again surprised to learn that, without prior consultation, the United States had imposed a 10 percent surcharge on imports, a decision certain to hinder Japan's exports to the United States. Relations between Tokyo and Washington were further strained by the monetary crisis involving the December 1971 revaluation of the Japanese yen.\n\nThese events of 1971 marked the beginning of a new stage in relations, a period of adjustment to a changing world situation that was not without episodes of strain in both political and economic spheres, although the basic relationship remained close. The political issues between the two countries were essentially security-related and derived from efforts by the United States to induce Japan to contribute more to its own defense and to regional security. The economic issues tended to stem from the ever-widening United States trade and payments deficits with Japan, which began in 1965 when Japan reversed its imbalance in trade with the United States and, for the first time, achieved an export surplus.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nHeavy American military spending in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) and the Vietnam War (1965\u201373) provided a major stimulus to the Japanese economy.<ref>T. R. H.  Havens, ''Fire Across the Sea: The Vietnam War and Japan, 1965\u20131975'' (1987)</ref>\n\n===1970s: Vietnam War and Middle-East crisis===\nThe United States withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975 and the end of the [[Vietnam War]] meant that the question of Japan's role in the security of East Asia and its contributions to its own defense became central topics in the dialogue between the two countries. American dissatisfaction with Japanese defense efforts began to surface in 1975 when Secretary of Defense [[James R. Schlesinger]] publicly stigmatized Japan. The Japanese government, constrained by constitutional limitations and strongly pacifist public opinion, responded slowly to pressures for a more rapid buildup of its [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]] (SDF). It steadily increased its budgetary outlays for those forces, however, and indicated its willingness to shoulder more of the cost of maintaining the United States military bases in Japan. In 1976 the United States and Japan formally established a subcommittee for defense cooperation, in the framework of a bilateral Security Consultative Committee provided for under the 1960 security treaty. This subcommittee, in turn, drew up new Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense Cooperation, under which military planners of the two countries have conducted studies relating to joint military action in the event of an armed attack on Japan.<ref>T. R. H. Havens, ''Fire Across the Sea: The Vietnam War and Japan, 1965\u20131975'' (1987)</ref><ref>LaFeber, ''The Clash: US-Japanese Relations Throughout History'' ch 12</ref>\n\nOn the economic front, Japan sought to ease trade frictions by agreeing to Orderly Marketing Arrangements, which limited exports on products whose influx into the United States was creating political problems. In 1977 an Orderly Marketing Arrangement limiting Japanese color television exports to the United States was signed, following the pattern of an earlier disposition of the textile problem. Steel exports to the United States were also curtailed, but the problems continued as disputes flared over United States restrictions on Japanese development of nuclear fuel- reprocessing facilities, Japanese restrictions on certain agricultural imports, such as beef and oranges, and liberalization of capital investment and government procurement within Japan.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tan Loong-Hoe|author2=Chia Siow Yue|title=Trade, Protectionism, and Industrial Adjustment in Consumer Electronics: Asian Responses to North America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZPzzk0QC0UC&pg=PA4|year=1989|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|page=4|isbn=9789813035263}}</ref>\n\nUnder American pressure Japan worked toward a comprehensive security strategy with closer cooperation with the United States for a more reciprocal and autonomous basis. This policy was put to the test in November 1979, when radical Iranians seized the United States embassy in Tehran, taking sixty hostages. Japan reacted by condemning the action as a violation of international law. At the same time, Japanese trading firms and oil companies reportedly purchased Iranian oil that had become available when the United States banned oil imported from Iran. This action brought sharp criticism from the United States of Japanese government \"insensitivity\" for allowing the oil purchases and led to a Japanese apology and agreement to participate in sanctions against Iran in concert with other United States allies.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Carol Gluck|author2=Stephen R.

Japan was prompt and effective in announcing and implementing sanctions against the Soviet Union following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. In 1981, in response to United States requests, it accepted greater responsibility for defense of seas around Japan, pledged greater support for United States forces in Japan, and persisted with a steady buildup of the SDF.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gluck|author2=Graubard|title=Showa: The Japan of Hirohito|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGNdWCIT-ScC&pg=PA172|pages=172\u201373|isbn=9780393310641|year=1992}}</ref>\n\n===1980s: Rise of the falcons===\nA qualitatively new stage of Japan-United States cooperation in world affairs appeared to be reached in late 1982 with the election of Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]]. Officials of the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration worked closely with their Japanese counterparts to develop a personal relationship between the two leaders based on their common security and international outlook. President Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone enjoyed a particularly close relationship.  It was Nakasone that backed Reagan to deploy Pershing missiles in Europe at the 1983 [[9th G7 summit]].  Nakasone reassured United States leaders of Japan's determination against the Soviet threat, closely coordinated policies with the United States toward Asian trouble spots such as the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia, and worked cooperatively with the United States in developing China policy. The Japanese government welcomed the increase of American forces in Japan and the western Pacific, continued the steady buildup of the SDF, and positioned Japan firmly on the side of the United States against the threat of Soviet international expansion. Japan continued to cooperate closely with United States policy in these areas following Nakasone's term of office, although the political leadership scandals in Japan in the late 1980s (i.e. the [[Recruit scandal]]) made it difficult for newly elected President [[George H. W. Bush]] to establish the same kind of close personal ties that marked the Reagan years.\n\nA specific example of Japan's close cooperation with the United States included its quick response to the United States' call for greater host nation support from Japan following the rapid realignment of Japan-United States currencies in the mid-1980s due to the Plaza and Louvre Accords. The currency realignment resulted in a rapid rise of United States costs in Japan, which the Japanese government, upon United States request, was willing to offset. Another set of examples was provided by Japan's willingness to respond to United States requests for foreign assistance to countries considered of strategic importance to the West. During the 1980s, United States officials voiced appreciation for Japan's \"strategic aid\" to countries such as [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], and [[Jamaica]]. Prime Minister [[Kaifu Toshiki]]'s pledges of support for [[Eastern Europe|East European]] and [[Middle East]]ern countries in 1990 fit the pattern of Japan's willingness to share greater responsibility for world stability. Another example of US-Japan cooperation is through energy cooperation. In 1983 a US-Japan working group, chaired by [[William Flynn Martin]], produced the Reagan-Nakasone Joint Statement on Japan-United States Energy Cooperation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joint Statement on Japan-United States Energy Cooperation|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1983/111183b.htm|work=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=11 November 1983}}</ref> Other instances of energy relations is shown through the US-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement of 1987 which was an agreement concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy.<ref>{{cite web|title=AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OP JAPAN AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY|url=http://www.jnmcc.or.jp/pdf/nichi_bei_kyoutei.pdf|work=Nuclear Material Control Center|publisher=Nuclear Material Control Center|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=18 October 1988}}</ref> Testimony by William Flynn Martin, US Deputy Secretary of Energy, outlined the highlights of the nuclear agreement, including the benefits to both countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=United States-Japan Nuclear Co-operation Agreement|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Congressional%20Testimony/Testimony%20as%20Deputy%20Secretary,%20DOE/12-16-87%20%E2%80%93%20US-Japan%20Nuclear%20Cooperation%20Agreement%20%E2%80%93%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs.pdf|work=Washington Policy & Analysis|publisher=Washington Policy & Analysis, Inc|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=2 March 1988|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211085616/http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Congressional%20Testimony/Testimony%20as%20Deputy%20Secretary,%20DOE/12-16-87%20%E2%80%93%20US-Japan%20Nuclear%20Cooperation%20Agreement%20%E2%80%93%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Reagan Japanese Meetings London 1984.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] greeting leaders including Prime Minister Nakasone, Foreign Minister Abe, Finance Minister Takashita in London in 1984]]\nDespite complaints from some Japanese businesses and diplomats, the Japanese government remained in basic agreement with United States policy toward China and Indochina. The government held back from large-scale aid efforts until conditions in China and Indochina were seen as more compatible with Japanese and United States interests. Of course, there also were instances of limited Japanese cooperation. Japan's response to the United States decision to help to protect tankers in the Persian Gulf during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u201388) was subject to mixed reviews. Some United States officials stressed the positive, noting that Japan was unable to send military forces because of constitutional reasons but compensated by supporting the construction of a navigation system in the Persian Gulf, providing greater host nation support for United States forces in Japan, and providing loans to Oman and Jordan. Japan's refusal to join even in a mine-sweeping effort in the Persian Gulf was an indication to some United States officials of Tokyo's unwillingness to cooperate with the United States in areas of sensitivity to Japanese leaders at home or abroad.\n\nThe main area of noncooperation with the United States in the 1980s was Japanese resistance to repeated United States efforts to get Japan to open its market more to foreign goods and to change other economic practices seen as adverse to United States economic interests. A common pattern was followed. The Japanese government was sensitive to political pressures from important domestic constituencies that would be hurt by greater openness. In general, these constituencies were of two types\u2014those representing inefficient or \"declining\" producers, manufacturers, and distributors, who could not compete if faced with full foreign competition; and those up-and-coming industries that the Japanese government wished to protect from foreign competition until they could compete effectively on world markets. To deal with domestic pressures while trying to avoid a break with the United States, the Japanese government engaged in protracted negotiations. This tactic bought time for declining industries to restructure themselves and new industries to grow stronger. Agreements reached dealt with some aspects of the problems, but it was common for trade or economic issues to be dragged out in talks over several years, involving more than one market-opening agreement. Such agreements were sometimes vague and subject to conflicting interpretations in Japan and the United States.\n\nGrowing interdependence was accompanied by markedly changing circumstances at home and abroad that were widely seen to have created a crisis in Japan\u2013United States relations in the late 1980s. United States government officials continued to emphasize the positive aspects of the relationship but warned that there was a need for \"a new conceptual framework\". [[The Wall Street Journal]] publicized a series of lengthy reports documenting changes in the relationship in the late 1980s and reviewing the considerable debate in Japan and the United States over whether a closely cooperative relationship was possible or appropriate for the 1990s. An authoritative review of popular and media opinion, published in 1990 by the Washington-based Commission on US-Japan Relations for the Twenty-first Century, was concerned with preserving a close Japan\u2013United States relationship. It warned of a \"new orthodoxy\" of \"suspicion, criticism and considerable self-justification\", which it said was endangering the fabric of Japan\u2013United States relations.\n\nThe relative economic power of Japan and the United States was undergoing sweeping change, especially in the 1980s. This change went well beyond the implications of the United States trade deficit with Japan, which had remained between US$40 billion and US$48 billion annually since the mid-1980s. The persisting United States trade and budget deficits of the early 1980s led to a series of decisions in the middle of the decade that brought a major realignment of the value of Japanese and United States currencies. The stronger Japanese currency gave Japan the ability to purchase more United States goods and to make important investments in the United States. By the late 1980s, Japan was the main international creditor.\n\nJapan's growing investment in the United States\u2014it was the second largest investor after Britain\u2014led to complaints from some American constituencies. Moreover, Japanese industry seemed well positioned to use its economic power to invest in the high-technology products in which United States manufacturers were still leaders. The United States's ability to compete under these circumstances was seen by many Japanese and Americans as hampered by heavy personal, government, and business debt and a low savings rate.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe and the growing preoccupation of Soviet leaders with massive internal political and economic difficulties forced the Japanese and United States governments to reassess their longstanding alliance against the Soviet threat. Officials of both nations had tended to characterize the security alliance as the linchpin of the relationship, which should have priority over economic and other disputes. Some Japanese and United States officials and commentators continued to emphasize the common dangers to Japan- United States interests posed by the continued strong Soviet military presence in Asia. They stressed that until Moscow followed its moderation in Europe with major demobilization and reductions in its forces positioned against the United States and Japan in the Pacific, Washington and Tokyo needed to remain militarily prepared and vigilant.\n\nIncreasingly, however, other perceived benefits of close Japan-United States security ties were emphasized. The alliance was seen as deterring other potentially disruptive forces in East Asia, notably the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ([[North Korea]]). Some United States officials noted that the alliance helped keep Japan's potential military power in check and under the supervision of the United States.\n\n===21st century: Stronger alliance in the context of a rising China===\n[[File:US Navy 070817-N-8534H-001 Ryoichi Kabaya, the Mayor of Yokosuka City, throws the opening pitch to Capt.

Japan and the U.S. share many cultural links, including a love for [[baseball]] imported from the US.]]\n\nBy the late 1990s and beyond, the US-Japan relationship had been improved and strengthened. The major cause of friction in the relationship, e.g. trade disputes, became less problematic as China displaced Japan as the greatest economic threat to the U.S. Meanwhile, though in the immediate post\u2013Cold War period the security alliance suffered from a lack of a defined threat, the emergence of North Korea as a belligerent rogue state and China's economic and military expansion provided a purpose to strengthen the relationship. While the foreign policy of the administration of President George W. Bush put a strain on some of the United States' international relations, the alliance with Japan became stronger, as evidenced in the [[Deployment of Japanese troops to Iraq]] and the joint development of anti-missile defense systems. The notion that Japan is becoming the \"Great Britain of the Pacific\", or the key and pivotal ally of the U.S. in the region, is frequently alluded to in international studies,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Not quite the 'Great Britain of the Far East': Japan's security, the US-Japan alliance and the 'war on terror' in East Asia|volume=20|pages=325\u2013338|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1050/|journal=Warwick Research Archive Portal (WRAP)|publisher=University of Warwick|accessdate=7 December 2013|author=Christopher W.

United States agricultural products were a leading import in 1990 (US$8.5 billion as measured by United States export statistics), made up of meat (US$1.5 billion), fish (US$1.8 million), grains (US$2.4 billion), and soybeans (US$8.8 billion). Imports of manufactured goods were mainly in the category of machinery and transportation equipment, rather than consumer goods.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 1990 Japan imported US$11.1 billion of machinery from the United States, of which computers and computer parts (US$3.9 billion) formed the largest single component. In the category of transportation equipment, Japan imported US$3.3 billion of aircraft and parts (automobiles and parts accounted for only US$1.8 billion).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nJapan's exports to the United States were almost entirely manufactured goods.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Automobiles were by far the largest single category, amounting to US$21.5 billion in 1990, or 24% of total Japanese exports to the United States.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Automotive parts accounted for another US$10.7 billion. Other major items were office machinery (including computers), which totaled US$8.6 billion in 1990, telecommunications equipment (US$4.1 billion) and power-generating machinery (US$451 million).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nFrom the mid-1960s, the trade balance has been in Japan's favor. According to Japanese data, its surplus with the United States grew from US$380 million in 1970 to nearly US$48 billion in 1988, declining to approximately US$38 billion in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} United States data on the trade relationship (which differ slightly because each nation includes transportation costs on the import side but not the export side) also show a rapid deterioration of the imbalance in the 1980s, from a Japanese surplus of US$10 billion in 1980 to one of US$60 billion in 1987, with an improvement to one of US$37.7 billion in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Trade frictions===\nNotable outpourings of United States congressional and media rhetoric critical of Japan accompanied the disclosure in 1987 that Toshiba had illegally sold sophisticated machinery of United States origin to the Soviet Union, which reportedly allowed Moscow to make submarines quiet enough to avoid United States detection, and the United States congressional debate in 1989 over the Japan-United States agreement to develop a new fighter aircraft\u2014the [[Mitsubishi F-2|FSX]]\u2014for the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]].<ref>Packard, George R.

The total value of cumulative investments of this kind was US$8.7 billion in 1980. By 1990, it had grown to US$83.1 billion. United States data identified Japan as the second largest investor in the United States; it had about half the value of investments of Britain, but more than those of the Netherlands, Canada, or West Germany. Much of Japan's investment in the United States in the late 1980s was in the commercial sector, providing the basis for distribution and sale of Japanese exports to the United States. Wholesale and retail distribution accounted for 32.2% of all Japanese investments in the United States in 1990, while manufacturing accounted for 20.6%. Real estate became a popular investment during the 1980s, with cumulative investments rising to US$15.2 billion by 1988, or 18.4% of total direct investment in the United States.\n\n===Energy===\nThe US and Japan find themselves in fundamentally different situations regarding energy and energy security.  Cooperation in energy has moved from conflict (the embargo of Japanese oil was the trigger that launched the Pearl Harbor attack) to cooperation with two significant agreements being signed during the 1980s: the Reagan-Nakasone Energy Cooperation Agreement and the US-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement of 1987 (allowing the Japanese to reprocess nuclear fuels).<ref>Roger Buckley, ''U. S.-Japan Alliance Diplomacy, 1945-1990'' (1995) p 144</ref>\n\nFurther cooperation occurred during the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] with US troops aiding the victims of the disaster zone and US scientists from the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] advising on the response to the nuclear incident at Fukushima.

The pact was replaced in 1960 by the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security]], which declares that both nations will maintain and develop their capacities to resist armed attack in common and that each recognizes that an armed attack on either one in territories administered by Japan will be considered dangerous to the safety of the other. The Agreed Minutes to the treaty specified that the Japanese government must be consulted prior to major changes in United States force deployment in Japan or to the use of Japanese bases for combat operations other than in defense of Japan itself. However, Japan was relieved by its constitutional prohibition of participating in external military operations from any obligation to defend the United States if it were attacked outside of Japanese territories. In 1990 the Japanese government expressed its intention to continue to rely on the treaty's arrangements to guarantee national security.<ref>Anthony Difilippo, ''The Challenges of the U.S.-Japan Military Arrangement'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe Agreed Minutes under Article 6 of the 1960 treaty contain a status-of-forces agreement on the stationing of United States forces in Japan, with specifics on the provision of facilities and areas for their use and on the administration of Japanese citizens employed in the facilities. Also covered are the limits of the two countries' jurisdictions over crimes committed in Japan by United States military personnel.\n\nThe Mutual Security Assistance Pact of 1952 initially involved a military aid program that provided for Japan's acquisition of funds, mat\u00e9riel, and services for the nation's essential defense. Although Japan no longer received any aid from the United States by the 1960s, the agreement continued to serve as the basis for purchase and licensing agreements ensuring interoperability of the two nations' weapons and for the release of classified data to Japan, including both international intelligence reports and classified technical information.\n\nAs of 2014 the United States had 50,000 troops in Japan, the headquarters of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US 7th Fleet]] and more than 10,000 Marines. In May 2014 it was revealed the United States was deploying two unarmed [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk|Global Hawk long-distance surveillance drones]] to Japan with the expectation they would engage in surveillance missions over [[China]] and [[North Korea]].<ref name=\"JapanDrones\">{{cite news|title=Advanced US drones deployed in Japan to keep watch on China, North Korea|url=http://www.thejapannews.net/index.php/sid/222467199/scat/c4f2dd8ca8c78044/ht/Advanced-US-drones-deployed-in-Japan-to-keep-watch-on-China-North-Korea|accessdate=31 May 2014|publisher=The Japan News.Net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531162651/http://www.thejapannews.net/index.php/sid/222467199/scat/c4f2dd8ca8c78044/ht/Advanced-US-drones-deployed-in-Japan-to-keep-watch-on-China-North-Korea|archive-date=31 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the beginning of October 2018 the new Japanese Mobile Amphibious Forces held joint exercises with the US marines in the Japanese prefecture of Kagoshima, the purpose of which was to work out the actions in defense of remote territories.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20181014/k10011671211000.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014083818/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20181014/k10011671211000.html |archive-date=2018-10-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa)===\nOkinawa is the site of major American military bases that have caused problems, as Japanese and Okinawans have protested their presence for decades. In secret negotiations that began in 1969 Washington sought unrestricted use of its bases for possible conventional combat operations in Korea, Taiwan, and South Vietnam, as well as the emergency re-entry and transit rights of nuclear weapons. However anti-nuclear sentiment was strong in Japan and the government wanted the U.S. to remove all nuclear weapons from Okinawa. In the end, the United States and Japan agreed to maintain bases that would allow the continuation of American deterrent capabilities in East Asia. In 1972 the [[Ryukyu Islands]], including [[Okinawa]], reverted to Japanese control and the provisions of the 1960 security treaty were extended to cover them. The United States retained the right to station forces on these islands.<ref>Yukinori Komine, \"Okinawa Confidential, 1969: Exploring the Linkage between the Nuclear Issue and the Base Issue,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (2013) 37#4 pp 807-840.</ref>\n\nMilitary relations improved after the mid-1970s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1960 the Security Consultative Committee, with representatives from both countries, was set up under the 1960 security treaty to discuss and coordinate security matters concerning both nations. In 1976 a subcommittee of that body prepared the Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense Cooperation that were approved by the full committee in 1978 and later approved by the National Defense Council and cabinet. The guidelines authorized unprecedented activities in joint defense planning, response to an armed attack on Japan, and cooperation on situations in Asia and the Pacific region that could affect Japan's security.\n\nA dispute that had boiled since 1996 regarding a base with 18,000 U.S. Marines had temporarily been resolved in late 2013.

Relations began in the late 18th and early 19th century, with the diplomatic but force-backed missions of U.S. ship captains [[James Glynn]] and [[Matthew C. Perry]] to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].\n\nThe countries maintained relatively cordial relations after that. Potential disputes were resolved. Japan acknowledged American control of Hawaii and the Philippines and the United States reciprocated regarding Korea. Disagreements about Japanese immigration to the U.S. were resolved in 1907. The two were allies against Germany in [[World War I]].\n\nStarting in 1931, tensions escalated. Japanese actions against China in 1931 and especially after 1937 during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] caused the United States, along with its allies Britain and the Netherlands, to cut off the oil and steel Japan needed for their military conquests. Japan responded with attacks on the Allies, including [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941]], which heavily damaged the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]], opening the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] of [[World War II]]. The United States made a massive investment in naval power and systematically destroyed Japan's offensive capabilities while [[island hopping campaign|island hopping]] across the Pacific. To force a surrender, the Americans systematically bombed Japanese cities, culminating in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] in August 1945. [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]], and was subjected to seven years of [[Occupation of Japan|military occupation]] by the United States, during which the American occupiers under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] eliminated the military factor and rebuilt the economic and political systems so as to transform Japan into a democracy.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s Japan, while neutral, grew rapidly by supplying American wars in [[Korean War|Korea]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].  The trade relationship has particularly prospered since then, with Japanese automobiles and consumer electronics being especially popular, and Japan became the world's second economic power after the United States. (In 2010 it dropped to third place after China).\n\nFrom the late 20th century and onwards, the United States and Japan have firm and very active political, economic and military relationships. The United States considers Japan to be one of its closest allies and partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/14/obama-us-will-stand-longtime-ally-japan/|title=Obama: US will stand by longtime ally Japan|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/06/23/us-korea-north-usa-japan-idUSN2328607520080623|title=Rice says U.S. won't forget Japanese abductees|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=17 September 2014|date=2008-06-23}}</ref>  Japan is currently one of the most pro-American nations in the world, with 67% of Japanese viewing the United States favorably, according to a 2018 Pew survey;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2018/11/12/views-of-the-u-s-and-president-trump/|title=Japanese views of U.S., Trump|last=NW|first=1615 L.

His goal was to open commerce and more profoundly to introduce Western morals and values. The treaty gave priority to American interests over Japan's. Perry's was used before 1945 to rouse Japanese resentment against the United States and the West; an unintended consequence was to facilitate Japanese militarism.<ref>George Feifer,  \"Perry and Pearl: The unintended consequence.\" ''World Policy Journal'' 24.3 (2007): 103-110 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40210226 online].</ref>\n\n[[Townsend Harris]] (1804\u201378) served 1856-1861 as the first American diplomat after Perry left.<ref>Tyler Dennett, ''Americans in Eastern Asia: a critical study of United States' policy in the Far East in the nineteenth century'' (1922) pp 347-66.</ref> He won the confidence of the Japanese leaders, who asked his advice on how to deal with Europeans.

Previously, President Taft had managed to halt similar legislation but President [[Woodrow Wilson]] paid little attention until Tokyo's protest arrived. He then sent Secretary of State [[William Jennings Bryan]] to California; Bryan was unable to get California to relax the restrictions.  Wilson did not use any of the legal remedies available to overturn the California law on the basis that it violated the 1911 treaty with Japan.

When they returned home, they were often invited to give local lectures on what Japan was really like. In Japan they set up organizations such as colleges and civic groups.  Historian John Davidann argues that the evangelical American YMCA missionaries linked Protestantism with American nationalism. They wanted converts to choose \"Jesus over Japan\".  The Christians in Japan, although small minority, held a strong connection to the ancient \"bushido\" tradition of warrior ethics that undergirded Japanese nationalism. By the 1920s the nationalism theme had been dropped<ref>Jon Thares Davidann,  \"The American YMCA in Meiji Japan: God's Work Gone Awry.\" ''Journal of World History'' (1995) 6#1: 107-125.

However, they identified a long-term threat from the colonial powers, especially Britain, the United States, the Netherlands and France, as deliberately blocking Japan's aspirations, especially regarding control of China. The goal became \"Asia for the Asians\" as Japan began mobilizing anti-colonial sentiment in India and Southeast Asia. Japan took control of Manchuria in 1931 over the strong objections of the League of Nations, Britain and especially the United States. In 1937, it seized control of the main cities on the East Coast of China, over strong American protests.  Japanese leaders thought their deeply Asian civilization gave it a natural right to this control and refused to negotiate Western demands that it withdraw from China.<ref>John T.

The United States had a powerful navy in the Pacific, and it was working closely with the British and the Dutch governments.  When Japan seized Indochina (now Vietnam) in 1940\u201341, the United States, along with Australia, Britain and the [[Dutch government in exile]], boycotted Japan via a trade embargo.  They cut off 90% of Japan's oil supply, and Japan had to either withdraw from China or go to war with the US and Britain as well as China to get the oil.\n\nUnder the Washington Naval treaty of 1922 and the London Naval treaty, the American navy was to be equal to the Japanese navy by a ratio of 10:6.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pelz, Stephen E.

President Roosevelt imposed increasingly stringent economic sanctions intended to deprive Japan of the oil and steel, as well as dollars, it needed to continue its war in China. Japan reacted by forging an alliance with Germany and Italy in 1940, known as the [[Tripartite Pact]], which worsened its relations with the US. In July 1941, the United States, Great Britain, and the Netherlands froze all Japanese assets and cut off oil shipments\u2014Japan had little oil of its own.<ref>Conrad Totman, ''A History of Japan'' (2005). pp 554\u2013556.</ref>\n\nJapan had conquered all of Manchuria and most of coastal China by 1939, but the Allies refused to recognize the conquests and stepped up their commitment.<ref>Herbert Feis, ''China Tangle: The American Effort in China from Pearl Harbor to the Marshall Mission'' (1953) [http://press.princeton.edu/TOCs/c517.html contents]</ref> President Franklin Roosevelt arranged for American pilots and ground crews to set up an aggressive Chinese Air Force nicknamed the [[Flying Tigers]] that would not only defend against Japanese air power but also start bombing the Japanese islands.<ref>Daniel Ford, ''Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941-1942'' (2016).</ref>\n\nDiplomacy provided very little space for the adjudication of the deep differences between Japan and the United States.  The United States was firmly and almost unanimously committed to defending the integrity of China.  The isolationism that characterized the strong opposition of many Americans toward war in Europe did not apply to Asia.  Japan had no friends in the United States, nor in Great Britain, nor the Netherlands.  The United States had not yet declared war on Germany, but was closely collaborating with Britain and the Netherlands regarding the Japanese threat.  The United States started to move its newest B-17 heavy bombers to bases in the Philippines, well within range of Japanese cities.  The goal was deterrence of any Japanese attacks to the south.  Furthermore, plans were well underway to ship American air forces to China, where American pilots in Chinese uniforms flying American warplanes, were preparing to bomb Japanese cities well before Pearl Harbor.<ref>Michael Schaller, \"American Air Strategy in China, 1939-1941: The Origins of Clandestine Air Warfare\" ''American Quarterly'' 28#1 (1976), pp. 3-19 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2712474  in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Martha Byrd, ''Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger'' (2003).</ref>\n\nGreat Britain, although realizing it could not defend Hong Kong, was confident in its abilities to defend its major base in Singapore and the surrounding Malaya Peninsula.

Woodburn Kirby, ''The War Against Japan:  Volume I: The Loss of Singapore'' (HM Stationery Office, 195) pp 454-74.</ref>\n\nThe Netherlands, with its homeland overrun by Germany, had a small Navy to defend the Dutch East Indies.  Their role was to delay the Japanese invasion long enough to destroy the oil wells, drilling equipment, refineries and pipelines that were the main target of Japanese attacks.\n\nDecisions in Tokyo were controlled by the Army, and then rubber-stamped by Emperor Hirohito; the Navy also had a voice.  However the civilian government and diplomats were largely ignored.  The Army saw the conquest of China as its primary mission, but operations in Manchuria had created a long border with the Soviet Union.  Informal, large-scale military confrontations with the Soviet forces at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Nomonhan]] in summer 1939 demonstrated that the  Soviets possessed a decisive military superiority.  Even though it would help Germany's war against Russia after June 1941, the Japanese army refused to go north.\n\nThe Japanese realized the urgent need for oil, over 90% of which was supplied by the United States, Britain and the Netherlands.  From the Army's perspective, a secure fuel supply was essential for the warplanes, tanks and trucks\u2014as well as the Navy's warships and warplanes.  The solution was to send the Navy south, to seize the oilfields in the Dutch East Indies and nearby British colonies. Some admirals and many civilians, including Prime Minister [[Konoe Fumimaro]], believed that a war with the U.S. would end in defeat. The alternative was loss of honor and power.<ref>Haruo Tohmatsu and H. P. Willmott, ''A Gathering Darkness: The Coming of War to the Far East and the Pacific'' (2004)</ref>\n\nWhile the admirals were dubious about their long-term ability to confront the American and British navies, they hoped that a knockout blow destroying the American fleet at Pearl Harbor would bring the enemy to the negotiating table for a favorable outcome.<ref>Dorothy Borg and Shumpei Okamoto, eds.

However, they did not speak for the Army leadership, which made the decisions. By early October both sides realized that no compromises were possible between the Japan's commitment to conquer China, and America's commitment to defend China.

Both sides interred enemy aliens. Superior American military production supported a campaign of island-hopping in the Pacific and heavy bombardment of cities in Okinawa and the Japanese mainland. The strategy was broadly successful as the Allies gradually occupied territories and moved toward the home islands, intending massive invasions beginning in fall 1945. Japanese resistance remained fierce. The [[Pacific War]] lasted until September 1, 1945, when Japan surrendered in response to the American [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] \u2013 among the most controversial acts in [[military history]] \u2013 and the Soviet entry into the Asian theater of war following the surrender of Germany.\n\nThe official [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] was signed on September 2, and the United States subsequently [[Occupation of Japan|occupied]] Japan in its entirety.\n\n[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|The [[Fat Man]] [[mushroom cloud]] resulting from the [[nuclear explosion]] over [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] rises 18 km (11 mi, 60,000 ft) into the air from the [[hypocenter]].]]\n\n==Post\u2013World War II period==\n[[File:Shiro-ishii.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shir\u014d Ishii]], commander of [[Unit 731]], was granted immunity and recruited by the United States]]\nHistorian [[Akira Iriye]] argues that World War II and the  Occupation decisively shaped bilateral relations after 1945.  He presents the oil crisis of 1941 as the confrontation of two diametrically opposed concepts of Asian Pacific order. Japan was militaristic, and sought to create and control a self-sufficient economic region in Southeast Asia. Franklin D Roosevelt and his successors were internationalists seeking an open international economic order. The war reflected the interplay of military, economic, political, and ideological factors. The postwar era led to a radical change in bilateral relations from stark hostility to close friendship and political alliance. The United States was now the world's strongest military and economic power. Japan under American tutelage 1945-1951, but then entirely on its own, rejected militarism, embraced democracy and became dedicated to two international policies: economic development and pacifism. Postwar relations between the two countries reached an unprecedented level of compatibility that peaked around 1970. Since then, Japan has become an economic superpower while the United States lost its status as the global economic hegemon. Consequently, their approaches to major issues of foreign policy have diverged. China now is the third player in East Asia, and quite independent of both the United States and Japan. Nevertheless, the strong history of close economic and political relations, and increasingly common set of cultural values continues to provide robust support for continued bilateral political cooperation.<ref>Akira Iriye, \"Pearl Harbor: A Fifty-Year Perspective\" ''Amerikastudien'' (1993)) 38#1 13-24.</ref>\n\n===Post\u2013World War II occupation period===\n{{Main|Occupation of Japan}}\n\nAt the end of the [[Second World War]], Japan was occupied by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], led by the United States with contributions from Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. This was the first time since the unification of Japan that the island nation had been occupied by a foreign power. The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]], signed on September 8, 1951, marked the end of the Allied occupation, and when it went into effect on April 28, 1952, Japan was once again an independent state, and an ally of the United States. Economic growth in the United States occurred and made the Automobile industry boom in 1946.\n\n===1950s: After the occupation===\n{{Main|Treaty of San Francisco|United States Forces Japan}}\nIn the years after [[World War II]], Japan's relations with the United States were placed on an equal footing for the first time at the end of the occupation by the Allied forces in April 1952. This equality, the legal basis of which was laid down in the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan|peace treaty signed by forty-eight Allied nations and Japan]], was initially largely nominal. A favorable Japanese balance of payments with the United States was achieved in 1954, mainly as a result of United States military and aid spending in Japan.<ref>LaFeber, ''The Clash: US-Japanese Relations Throughout History'' ch 10</ref>\n\nThe Japanese people's feeling of dependence lessened gradually as the disastrous results of World War II subsided into the background and trade with the United States expanded.  Self-confidence grew as the country applied its resources and organizational skill to regaining economic health. This situation gave rise to a general desire for greater independence from United States influence. During the 1950s and 1960s, this feeling was especially evident in the Japanese attitude toward United States military bases on the four main islands of Japan and in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying the southern two-thirds of the [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThe government had to balance left-wing pressure advocating dissociation from the United States allegedly 'against the realities' of the need for military protection. Recognizing the popular desire for the return of the Ryukyu Islands and the Bonin Islands (also known as the [[Ogasawara Islands]]), the United States as early as 1953 relinquished its control of the [[Amami]] group of islands at the northern end of the Ryukyu Islands. But the United States made no commitment to return Okinawa, which was then under United States military administration for an indefinite period as provided in Article 3 of the peace treaty. Popular agitation culminated in a unanimous resolution adopted by the [[Japanese diet|Diet]] in June 1956, calling for a return of Okinawa to Japan.\n\n===1960s: Military alliance and return of territories===\nBilateral talks on revising the 1952 security pact began in 1959, and the new [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security]] was signed in Washington on January 19, 1960. When the pact was submitted to the Diet for ratification on February 5, it became the subject of bitter debate over the Japan\u2013United States relationship and the occasion for violence in an all-out effort by the leftist opposition to prevent its passage. It was finally approved by the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] on May 20. [[Japan Socialist Party]] deputies boycotted the lower house session and tried to prevent the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] deputies from entering the chamber; they were forcibly removed by the police. Massive demonstrations and rioting by students and trade unions followed. These outbursts prevented a scheduled visit to Japan by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and precipitated the resignation of Prime Minister [[Kishi Nobusuke]], but not before the treaty was passed by default on June 19, when the [[House of Councillors]] failed to vote on the issue within the required thirty days after lower house approval.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">LaFeber, ''The Clash: US-Japanese Relations Throughout History'' ch 11</ref>\n\nUnder the treaty, both parties assumed an obligation to assist each other in case of armed attack on territories under Japanese administration. (It was understood, however, that Japan could not come to the defense of the United States because it was constitutionally forbidden to send armed forces overseas (Article 9). In particular, the constitution forbids the maintenance of \"land, sea, and air forces.\" It also expresses the Japanese people's renunciation of \"the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes\". Accordingly, the Japanese find it difficult to send their \"self-defense\" forces overseas, even for peace-keeping purposes.) The scope of the new treaty did not extend to the Ryukyu Islands, but an appended minute made clear that in case of an armed attack on the islands, both governments would consult and take appropriate action. Notes accompanying the treaty provided for prior consultation between the two governments before any major change occurred in the deployment of United States troops or equipment in Japan. Unlike the 1952 security pact, the new treaty provided for a ten-year term, after which it could be revoked upon one year's notice by either party. The treaty included general provisions on the further development of international cooperation and on improved future economic cooperation.\n\nBoth countries worked closely to fulfill the United States promise, under Article 3 of the peace treaty, to return all Japanese territories acquired by the United States in war. In June 1968, the United States returned the [[Bonin Islands]] (including [[Iwo Jima]]) to Japanese administration control. In 1969, the Okinawa reversion issue and Japan's security ties with the United States became the focal points of partisan political campaigns. The situation calmed considerably when Prime Minister Sato Eisaku visited Washington in November 1969, and in a joint communiqu\u00e9 signed by him and President [[Richard Nixon]], announced the United States agreement to return Okinawa to Japan in 1972. In June 1971, after eighteen months of negotiations, the two countries signed an agreement providing for the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/><ref>Gavan McCormack, and Satoko Oka Norimatsu, ''Resistant Islands: Okinawa Confronts Japan and the United States'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe Japanese government's firm and voluntary endorsement of the security treaty and the settlement of the Okinawa reversion question meant that two major political issues in Japan\u2013United States relations were eliminated. But new issues arose. In July 1971, the Japanese government was surprised by Nixon's dramatic announcement of his forthcoming [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to the People's Republic of China]]. Many Japanese were chagrined by the failure of the United States to consult in advance with Japan before making such a fundamental change in foreign policy. The following month, the government was again surprised to learn that, without prior consultation, the United States had imposed a 10 percent surcharge on imports, a decision certain to hinder Japan's exports to the United States. Relations between Tokyo and Washington were further strained by the monetary crisis involving the December 1971 revaluation of the Japanese yen.\n\nThese events of 1971 marked the beginning of a new stage in relations, a period of adjustment to a changing world situation that was not without episodes of strain in both political and economic spheres, although the basic relationship remained close. The political issues between the two countries were essentially security-related and derived from efforts by the United States to induce Japan to contribute more to its own defense and to regional security. The economic issues tended to stem from the ever-widening United States trade and payments deficits with Japan, which began in 1965 when Japan reversed its imbalance in trade with the United States and, for the first time, achieved an export surplus.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nHeavy American military spending in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353) and the Vietnam War (1965\u201373) provided a major stimulus to the Japanese economy.<ref>T. R. H.  Havens, ''Fire Across the Sea: The Vietnam War and Japan, 1965\u20131975'' (1987)</ref>\n\n===1970s: Vietnam War and Middle-East crisis===\nThe United States withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975 and the end of the [[Vietnam War]] meant that the question of Japan's role in the security of East Asia and its contributions to its own defense became central topics in the dialogue between the two countries. American dissatisfaction with Japanese defense efforts began to surface in 1975 when Secretary of Defense [[James R. Schlesinger]] publicly stigmatized Japan. The Japanese government, constrained by constitutional limitations and strongly pacifist public opinion, responded slowly to pressures for a more rapid buildup of its [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]] (SDF). It steadily increased its budgetary outlays for those forces, however, and indicated its willingness to shoulder more of the cost of maintaining the United States military bases in Japan. In 1976 the United States and Japan formally established a subcommittee for defense cooperation, in the framework of a bilateral Security Consultative Committee provided for under the 1960 security treaty. This subcommittee, in turn, drew up new Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense Cooperation, under which military planners of the two countries have conducted studies relating to joint military action in the event of an armed attack on Japan.<ref>T. R. H. Havens, ''Fire Across the Sea: The Vietnam War and Japan, 1965\u20131975'' (1987)</ref><ref>LaFeber, ''The Clash: US-Japanese Relations Throughout History'' ch 12</ref>\n\nOn the economic front, Japan sought to ease trade frictions by agreeing to Orderly Marketing Arrangements, which limited exports on products whose influx into the United States was creating political problems. In 1977 an Orderly Marketing Arrangement limiting Japanese color television exports to the United States was signed, following the pattern of an earlier disposition of the textile problem. Steel exports to the United States were also curtailed, but the problems continued as disputes flared over United States restrictions on Japanese development of nuclear fuel- reprocessing facilities, Japanese restrictions on certain agricultural imports, such as beef and oranges, and liberalization of capital investment and government procurement within Japan.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tan Loong-Hoe|author2=Chia Siow Yue|title=Trade, Protectionism, and Industrial Adjustment in Consumer Electronics: Asian Responses to North America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZPzzk0QC0UC&pg=PA4|year=1989|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|page=4|isbn=9789813035263}}</ref>\n\nUnder American pressure Japan worked toward a comprehensive security strategy with closer cooperation with the United States for a more reciprocal and autonomous basis. This policy was put to the test in November 1979, when radical Iranians seized the United States embassy in Tehran, taking sixty hostages. Japan reacted by condemning the action as a violation of international law. At the same time, Japanese trading firms and oil companies reportedly purchased Iranian oil that had become available when the United States banned oil imported from Iran. This action brought sharp criticism from the United States of Japanese government \"insensitivity\" for allowing the oil purchases and led to a Japanese apology and agreement to participate in sanctions against Iran in concert with other United States allies.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Carol Gluck|author2=Stephen R.

Japan was prompt and effective in announcing and implementing sanctions against the Soviet Union following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. In 1981, in response to United States requests, it accepted greater responsibility for defense of seas around Japan, pledged greater support for United States forces in Japan, and persisted with a steady buildup of the SDF.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gluck|author2=Graubard|title=Showa: The Japan of Hirohito|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGNdWCIT-ScC&pg=PA172|pages=172\u201373|isbn=9780393310641|year=1992}}</ref>\n\n===1980s: Rise of the falcons===\nA qualitatively new stage of Japan-United States cooperation in world affairs appeared to be reached in late 1982 with the election of Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]]. Officials of the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration worked closely with their Japanese counterparts to develop a personal relationship between the two leaders based on their common security and international outlook. President Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone enjoyed a particularly close relationship.  It was Nakasone that backed Reagan to deploy Pershing missiles in Europe at the 1983 [[9th G7 summit]].  Nakasone reassured United States leaders of Japan's determination against the Soviet threat, closely coordinated policies with the United States toward Asian trouble spots such as the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia, and worked cooperatively with the United States in developing China policy. The Japanese government welcomed the increase of American forces in Japan and the western Pacific, continued the steady buildup of the SDF, and positioned Japan firmly on the side of the United States against the threat of Soviet international expansion. Japan continued to cooperate closely with United States policy in these areas following Nakasone's term of office, although the political leadership scandals in Japan in the late 1980s (i.e. the [[Recruit scandal]]) made it difficult for newly elected President [[George H. W. Bush]] to establish the same kind of close personal ties that marked the Reagan years.\n\nA specific example of Japan's close cooperation with the United States included its quick response to the United States' call for greater host nation support from Japan following the rapid realignment of Japan-United States currencies in the mid-1980s due to the Plaza and Louvre Accords. The currency realignment resulted in a rapid rise of United States costs in Japan, which the Japanese government, upon United States request, was willing to offset. Another set of examples was provided by Japan's willingness to respond to United States requests for foreign assistance to countries considered of strategic importance to the West. During the 1980s, United States officials voiced appreciation for Japan's \"strategic aid\" to countries such as [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], and [[Jamaica]]. Prime Minister [[Kaifu Toshiki]]'s pledges of support for [[Eastern Europe|East European]] and [[Middle East]]ern countries in 1990 fit the pattern of Japan's willingness to share greater responsibility for world stability. Another example of US-Japan cooperation is through energy cooperation. In 1983 a US-Japan working group, chaired by [[William Flynn Martin]], produced the Reagan-Nakasone Joint Statement on Japan-United States Energy Cooperation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joint Statement on Japan-United States Energy Cooperation|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1983/111183b.htm|work=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=11 November 1983}}</ref> Other instances of energy relations is shown through the US-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement of 1987 which was an agreement concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy.<ref>{{cite web|title=AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OP JAPAN AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY|url=http://www.jnmcc.or.jp/pdf/nichi_bei_kyoutei.pdf|work=Nuclear Material Control Center|publisher=Nuclear Material Control Center|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=18 October 1988}}</ref> Testimony by William Flynn Martin, US Deputy Secretary of Energy, outlined the highlights of the nuclear agreement, including the benefits to both countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=United States-Japan Nuclear Co-operation Agreement|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Congressional%20Testimony/Testimony%20as%20Deputy%20Secretary,%20DOE/12-16-87%20%E2%80%93%20US-Japan%20Nuclear%20Cooperation%20Agreement%20%E2%80%93%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs.pdf|work=Washington Policy & Analysis|publisher=Washington Policy & Analysis, Inc|accessdate=7 December 2013|date=2 March 1988|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211085616/http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Congressional%20Testimony/Testimony%20as%20Deputy%20Secretary,%20DOE/12-16-87%20%E2%80%93%20US-Japan%20Nuclear%20Cooperation%20Agreement%20%E2%80%93%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Reagan Japanese Meetings London 1984.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] greeting leaders including Prime Minister Nakasone, Foreign Minister Abe, Finance Minister Takashita in London in 1984]]\nDespite complaints from some Japanese businesses and diplomats, the Japanese government remained in basic agreement with United States policy toward China and Indochina. The government held back from large-scale aid efforts until conditions in China and Indochina were seen as more compatible with Japanese and United States interests. Of course, there also were instances of limited Japanese cooperation. Japan's response to the United States decision to help to protect tankers in the Persian Gulf during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u201388) was subject to mixed reviews. Some United States officials stressed the positive, noting that Japan was unable to send military forces because of constitutional reasons but compensated by supporting the construction of a navigation system in the Persian Gulf, providing greater host nation support for United States forces in Japan, and providing loans to Oman and Jordan. Japan's refusal to join even in a mine-sweeping effort in the Persian Gulf was an indication to some United States officials of Tokyo's unwillingness to cooperate with the United States in areas of sensitivity to Japanese leaders at home or abroad.\n\nThe main area of noncooperation with the United States in the 1980s was Japanese resistance to repeated United States efforts to get Japan to open its market more to foreign goods and to change other economic practices seen as adverse to United States economic interests. A common pattern was followed. The Japanese government was sensitive to political pressures from important domestic constituencies that would be hurt by greater openness. In general, these constituencies were of two types\u2014those representing inefficient or \"declining\" producers, manufacturers, and distributors, who could not compete if faced with full foreign competition; and those up-and-coming industries that the Japanese government wished to protect from foreign competition until they could compete effectively on world markets. To deal with domestic pressures while trying to avoid a break with the United States, the Japanese government engaged in protracted negotiations. This tactic bought time for declining industries to restructure themselves and new industries to grow stronger. Agreements reached dealt with some aspects of the problems, but it was common for trade or economic issues to be dragged out in talks over several years, involving more than one market-opening agreement. Such agreements were sometimes vague and subject to conflicting interpretations in Japan and the United States.\n\nGrowing interdependence was accompanied by markedly changing circumstances at home and abroad that were widely seen to have created a crisis in Japan\u2013United States relations in the late 1980s. United States government officials continued to emphasize the positive aspects of the relationship but warned that there was a need for \"a new conceptual framework\". [[The Wall Street Journal]] publicized a series of lengthy reports documenting changes in the relationship in the late 1980s and reviewing the considerable debate in Japan and the United States over whether a closely cooperative relationship was possible or appropriate for the 1990s. An authoritative review of popular and media opinion, published in 1990 by the Washington-based Commission on US-Japan Relations for the Twenty-first Century, was concerned with preserving a close Japan\u2013United States relationship. It warned of a \"new orthodoxy\" of \"suspicion, criticism and considerable self-justification\", which it said was endangering the fabric of Japan\u2013United States relations.\n\nThe relative economic power of Japan and the United States was undergoing sweeping change, especially in the 1980s. This change went well beyond the implications of the United States trade deficit with Japan, which had remained between US$40 billion and US$48 billion annually since the mid-1980s. The persisting United States trade and budget deficits of the early 1980s led to a series of decisions in the middle of the decade that brought a major realignment of the value of Japanese and United States currencies. The stronger Japanese currency gave Japan the ability to purchase more United States goods and to make important investments in the United States. By the late 1980s, Japan was the main international creditor.\n\nJapan's growing investment in the United States\u2014it was the second largest investor after Britain\u2014led to complaints from some American constituencies. Moreover, Japanese industry seemed well positioned to use its economic power to invest in the high-technology products in which United States manufacturers were still leaders. The United States's ability to compete under these circumstances was seen by many Japanese and Americans as hampered by heavy personal, government, and business debt and a low savings rate.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe and the growing preoccupation of Soviet leaders with massive internal political and economic difficulties forced the Japanese and United States governments to reassess their longstanding alliance against the Soviet threat. Officials of both nations had tended to characterize the security alliance as the linchpin of the relationship, which should have priority over economic and other disputes. Some Japanese and United States officials and commentators continued to emphasize the common dangers to Japan- United States interests posed by the continued strong Soviet military presence in Asia. They stressed that until Moscow followed its moderation in Europe with major demobilization and reductions in its forces positioned against the United States and Japan in the Pacific, Washington and Tokyo needed to remain militarily prepared and vigilant.\n\nIncreasingly, however, other perceived benefits of close Japan-United States security ties were emphasized. The alliance was seen as deterring other potentially disruptive forces in East Asia, notably the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ([[North Korea]]). Some United States officials noted that the alliance helped keep Japan's potential military power in check and under the supervision of the United States.\n\n===21st century: Stronger alliance in the context of a rising China===\n[[File:US Navy 070817-N-8534H-001 Ryoichi Kabaya, the Mayor of Yokosuka City, throws the opening pitch to Capt.

Is.jpg|thumb|A Japanese mayor throws a [[Pitch (baseball)|pitch]] to a U.S. Navy captain. Japan and the U.S. share many cultural links, including a love for [[baseball]] imported from the US.]]\n\nBy the late 1990s and beyond, the US-Japan relationship had been improved and strengthened. The major cause of friction in the relationship, e.g. trade disputes, became less problematic as China displaced Japan as the greatest economic threat to the U.S. Meanwhile, though in the immediate post\u2013Cold War period the security alliance suffered from a lack of a defined threat, the emergence of North Korea as a belligerent rogue state and China's economic and military expansion provided a purpose to strengthen the relationship. While the foreign policy of the administration of President George W. Bush put a strain on some of the United States' international relations, the alliance with Japan became stronger, as evidenced in the [[Deployment of Japanese troops to Iraq]] and the joint development of anti-missile defense systems. The notion that Japan is becoming the \"Great Britain of the Pacific\", or the key and pivotal ally of the U.S. in the region, is frequently alluded to in international studies,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Not quite the 'Great Britain of the Far East': Japan's security, the US-Japan alliance and the 'war on terror' in East Asia|volume=20|pages=325\u2013338|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1050/|journal=Warwick Research Archive Portal (WRAP)|publisher=University of Warwick|accessdate=7 December 2013|author=Christopher W.

United States agricultural products were a leading import in 1990 (US$8.5 billion as measured by United States export statistics), made up of meat (US$1.5 billion), fish (US$1.8 million), grains (US$2.4 billion), and soybeans (US$8.8 billion).

The total value of cumulative investments of this kind was US$8.7 billion in 1980. By 1990, it had grown to US$83.1 billion. United States data identified Japan as the second largest investor in the United States; it had about half the value of investments of Britain, but more than those of the Netherlands, Canada, or West Germany. Much of Japan's investment in the United States in the late 1980s was in the commercial sector, providing the basis for distribution and sale of Japanese exports to the United States. Wholesale and retail distribution accounted for 32.2% of all Japanese investments in the United States in 1990, while manufacturing accounted for 20.6%. Real estate became a popular investment during the 1980s, with cumulative investments rising to US$15.2 billion by 1988, or 18.4% of total direct investment in the United States.\n\n===Energy===\nThe US and Japan find themselves in fundamentally different situations regarding energy and energy security.  Cooperation in energy has moved from conflict (the embargo of Japanese oil was the trigger that launched the Pearl Harbor attack) to cooperation with two significant agreements being signed during the 1980s: the Reagan-Nakasone Energy Cooperation Agreement and the US-Japan Nuclear Cooperation Agreement of 1987 (allowing the Japanese to reprocess nuclear fuels).<ref>Roger Buckley, ''U.

The pact was replaced in 1960 by the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security]], which declares that both nations will maintain and develop their capacities to resist armed attack in common and that each recognizes that an armed attack on either one in territories administered by Japan will be considered dangerous to the safety of the other. The Agreed Minutes to the treaty specified that the Japanese government must be consulted prior to major changes in United States force deployment in Japan or to the use of Japanese bases for combat operations other than in defense of Japan itself. However, Japan was relieved by its constitutional prohibition of participating in external military operations from any obligation to defend the United States if it were attacked outside of Japanese territories. In 1990 the Japanese government expressed its intention to continue to rely on the treaty's arrangements to guarantee national security.<ref>Anthony Difilippo, ''The Challenges of the U.S.-Japan Military Arrangement'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe Agreed Minutes under Article 6 of the 1960 treaty contain a status-of-forces agreement on the stationing of United States forces in Japan, with specifics on the provision of facilities and areas for their use and on the administration of Japanese citizens employed in the facilities. Also covered are the limits of the two countries' jurisdictions over crimes committed in Japan by United States military personnel.\n\nThe Mutual Security Assistance Pact of 1952 initially involved a military aid program that provided for Japan's acquisition of funds, mat\u00e9riel, and services for the nation's essential defense. Although Japan no longer received any aid from the United States by the 1960s, the agreement continued to serve as the basis for purchase and licensing agreements ensuring interoperability of the two nations' weapons and for the release of classified data to Japan, including both international intelligence reports and classified technical information.\n\nAs of 2014 the United States had 50,000 troops in Japan, the headquarters of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US 7th Fleet]] and more than 10,000 Marines. In May 2014 it was revealed the United States was deploying two unarmed [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk|Global Hawk long-distance surveillance drones]] to Japan with the expectation they would engage in surveillance missions over [[China]] and [[North Korea]].<ref name=\"JapanDrones\">{{cite news|title=Advanced US drones deployed in Japan to keep watch on China, North Korea|url=http://www.thejapannews.net/index.php/sid/222467199/scat/c4f2dd8ca8c78044/ht/Advanced-US-drones-deployed-in-Japan-to-keep-watch-on-China-North-Korea|accessdate=31 May 2014|publisher=The Japan News.Net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531162651/http://www.thejapannews.net/index.php/sid/222467199/scat/c4f2dd8ca8c78044/ht/Advanced-US-drones-deployed-in-Japan-to-keep-watch-on-China-North-Korea|archive-date=31 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the beginning of October 2018 the new Japanese Mobile Amphibious Forces held joint exercises with the US marines in the Japanese prefecture of Kagoshima, the purpose of which was to work out the actions in defense of remote territories.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20181014/k10011671211000.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014083818/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20181014/k10011671211000.html |archive-date=2018-10-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa)===\nOkinawa is the site of major American military bases that have caused problems, as Japanese and Okinawans have protested their presence for decades. In secret negotiations that began in 1969 Washington sought unrestricted use of its bases for possible conventional combat operations in Korea, Taiwan, and South Vietnam, as well as the emergency re-entry and transit rights of nuclear weapons. However anti-nuclear sentiment was strong in Japan and the government wanted the U.S. to remove all nuclear weapons from Okinawa. In the end, the United States and Japan agreed to maintain bases that would allow the continuation of American deterrent capabilities in East Asia. In 1972 the [[Ryukyu Islands]], including [[Okinawa]], reverted to Japanese control and the provisions of the 1960 security treaty were extended to cover them. The United States retained the right to station forces on these islands.<ref>Yukinori Komine, \"Okinawa Confidential, 1969: Exploring the Linkage between the Nuclear Issue and the Base Issue,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (2013) 37#4 pp 807-840.</ref>\n\nMilitary relations improved after the mid-1970s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1960 the Security Consultative Committee, with representatives from both countries, was set up under the 1960 security treaty to discuss and coordinate security matters concerning both nations. In 1976 a subcommittee of that body prepared the Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense Cooperation that were approved by the full committee in 1978 and later approved by the National Defense Council and cabinet. The guidelines authorized unprecedented activities in joint defense planning, response to an armed attack on Japan, and cooperation on situations in Asia and the Pacific region that could affect Japan's security.\n\nA dispute that had boiled since 1996 regarding a base with 18,000 U.S. Marines had temporarily been resolved in late 2013.
