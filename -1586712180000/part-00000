It was produced by Gary Nardino Productions, in association with two separate divisions of [[Paramount Pictures]]: first by the [[Paramount Video]] division (1984\u201386) and by [[Paramount Television]] (1987\u201389). The show focuses on the three Waters brothers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Development===\n[[David Lloyd (writer)|David Lloyd]], [[Greg Antonacci]] and Gary Nardino respectively created and developed ''Brothers'' in 1982, with the same format as what made it to the air. Lloyd, a veteran TV writer known for his work on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Taxi]]'' and the then-new NBC sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'', had the premise for this series suggested to him by his employers, TV producers [[Ed. Weinberger]] and [[Stan Daniels]]. Wishing to develop a new screenplay with a revolutionary theme, Lloyd took to Weinberger and Daniels' idea about exploring familial relationships with the presence of a major\u2014and controversial\u2014life change, that of a relative finally coming out and addressing his [[homosexuality]]. Lloyd fully developed the idea and assumed full creation credit for the project. He then partnered himself with current Paramount Television president Nardino, who was looking to form an independent production company (he would leave Paramount in July 1983 to form Gary Nardino Productions),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/gary-nardino-dead-at-62-1117467318/|title=Gary Nardino dead at 62|author=Nick Madigan|work=Variety}}</ref> and Antonacci, a young actor-turned-director and producer, to write a pilot script with a modern, relevant point of view. The relationship of three adult brothers, inseparable and living in a world strongly underscored by masculinity, who soon have to confront the youngest brother's decision to be [[openly gay]], quickly came to fruition in the screenplay aptly titled ''Brothers''.\n\nThe project was originally shopped around to broadcast networks [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], in hopes of being picked up for the [[1983-84 United States network television schedule|1983 fall television season]]. NBC agreed to screen the pilot due to Lloyd's work on ''Taxi'' and ''Cheers'' (both of which had aired on NBC during the 1982\u20131983 season), and due to the insistence of Weinberger and Daniels. The network suits (then headed by [[Brandon Tartikoff]]) saw the charm of the content, but were concerned about how homosexuality was going to be portrayed. NBC did put ''Brothers'' in the running of fall 1983 pilots, but ultimately passed on it, instead choosing a series from Weinberger, ''[[Mr. Smith (TV series)|Mr. Smith]]'', in its place. Lloyd, Antonacci and Nardino then offered ''Brothers'' to ABC, who instantly shot it down because of its dealings of gay themes. The creative team refused to give up hope on the project, and the same was said for its three leads, which from the beginning were [[Robert Walden]] (fresh off his [[Emmy Award]]-winning role of Joe Rossi on [[CBS]]' ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]''), [[Paul Regina]] and [[Brandon Maggart]]. As the producers tried to find a new outlet to pitch it to, development was put on hold, allowing Regina to co-star in CBS' short-lived ''[[Zorro and Son]]'' (1983), and Maggart to assume a role on NBC's ''[[Jennifer Slept Here]]'' (1983\u20131984).\n\nEventually, Lloyd and company were approached by Showtime, who at the time had successfully begun to venture into the new field of original pay-cable TV series. In 1983, the channel had been the first in history to revive a canceled network series for original cable broadcasts, with ''[[The Paper Chase (TV series)|The Paper Chase]]'' (which originally ran on CBS in 1978-1979). Showtime's mission was to produce and pick up original programming that was outside the boundaries of standard network TV fare, and saw ''Brothers'' perfectly fitting that mold. Both parties struck a deal that had its cast paid at the same rate as network stars, with a full out 26-episode order from the start. Fortunately, Lloyd didn't have to scramble around to recast two of his stars, since Regina and Maggart both saw their series get canceled, so his original choices were back in place. With the series' premiere in the summer of 1984, Showtime now boasted one more first&nbsp;\u2014 the first original situation comedy on cable TV.\n\nSaid Robert Walden of his experience working on Showtime, \"There are fewer cooks in the kitchen, and the writers have more freedom. There's also something to be said for playing to 5 million or 6 million viewers instead of 30 million. You're reaching a higher common denominator.\"<ref name = NYT /> Since [[Nielsen Media Research]] had not yet adapted its ratings system to measure audience levels on premium cable, Showtime relied on [[qualitative research]] rather than sheer statistical reports. \"We have research firms that do telephone interviews with our subscribers,\"<ref name = NYT /> explained Peter Chernin, a Showtime programming executive. \"They call people and ask them how much they like particular shows. We also take into account the opinions of our local affiliates. All of them rated ''Brothers'' very highly.\"<ref name = NYT >{{cite news  |author=Stephen Farber|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/16/arts/brothers-success-hints-at-cable-s-new-role.html |title='Brothers' Success Hints at Cable's New Role |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 16, 1985 |accessdate=2015-09-16}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the policies set at rival [[HBO]], who had no intention of preparing any of their first forays into original series for syndication, Showtime had the market in mind as soon as they picked up ''Brothers''. Since ''Brothers'' had such a successful first season by pay-cable standards, channel execs announced two unprecedented moves in the spring of 1985: not only would ''Brothers'' have a renewal for 50 more episodes, but the series would begin airing episodes simultaneously in broadcast syndication that November. Showtime giving the series such a large vote of confidence with two-season renewal was so history-making that never had a broadcast network given a series such an expansive episode order after its freshman year.\n\nHBO criticized their competitor's decision over the early syndication airing of ''Brothers'', stating that they would never engage in such a practice with any of their original series. They felt it would destroy subscription rates and revenue if the public could watch one of their series for free on a local broadcast station, rather than pay monthly to view it on HBO. Showtime later recanted their 1985 syndication rollout for ''Brothers'', and then fought back by saying that their subscribers had a five-year head start on all their shows, which were all prepped for syndication and of which would enter it after those five years. Their defense also included the facts that the parent studios of their shows would continue to receive royalties from strong rerun performance in syndication, and that the latter market would attract higher-profile writers and directors to ensure a more quality production. The alternative, as Showtime put it, would be not prepping series for syndication and thus taking a gamble on a relatively unknown or untested creative team.\n\nAs premium cable found its way with successful original programming, HBO would follow suit in what Showtime realized all along concerning syndication, and both would find that concurrent airings of cable series on broadcast TV wasn't so risky. In 1988, Showtime made history once again when they struck a deal with the young [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] to begin airing their ''Brothers'' stablemate, the smash hit ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', on Sunday nights in order to raise Fox's profile among the broadcast networks. Not only did ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' fulfill its mission for Fox, but it actually increased interest in Showtime, and subscription rates benefited.\n\n==Synopsis==\nSet in south [[Philadelphia]], ''Brothers'' centered on the lives and relationships of the Waters brothers; oldest brother Lou ([[Brandon Maggart]]), a somewhat uncouth, but well-meaning [[construction foreman]]; middle brother Joe ([[Robert Walden]]), a retired [[placekicker]] for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and owner of a sports bar called ''The Point After''; and the youngest brother, Cliff ([[Paul Regina]]), a sports journalism major and later, an aspiring chef.\n\nIn the premiere episode, Cliff shocks his family when he runs away from the altar on his wedding day. Instead of getting married, Cliff reveals to his family that he is [[gay]].\n\nThe pilot and following episodes centered on the efforts of Joe and Lou coming to terms with Cliff's long-held secret of his true [[sexual orientation]], with both coping in their own unique way. Joe, who was definitely more sensible and open-minded, didn't see Cliff's sudden declaration of homosexuality robbing any aspect of their relationship. Lou assured his baby brother \"Cliffie\" that he loved and respected him no matter what, but was convinced early on that what Cliff was feeling was just a phase, and came up with numerous efforts to \"cure\" him of being gay. Cliff's relationship with the both of them was part brotherly, but also that of fathers and son, since Lou and Joe had almost 20 years on Cliff (their mother died when Cliff was an infant, followed a few years later by their dad; Lou and Joe raised Cliff for the majority of his youth). He was very much independent minded, and kidded around with his brothers in the usual way siblings do, but at times looked to them for guidance and was very much overprotected by Lou and Joe.\n\nCliff, earnest, bright and very much determined to lead a fulfilled life now that he truly found himself, took many a stand on same-sex issues and discussions; throughout the first season, whenever a situation or argument ensued regarding his decisions in life, Cliff gave heartfelt statements on how proud and secure he was being his true self, and that nothing anyone could do could possibly change his inner desires. When the series began, he was still in college, majoring in sports journalism, while working part-time for Joe at ''The Point After''. Following Cliff's first failed attempt at marriage, he resumed splitting rent with Joe in his sleek uptown apartment.\n\n[[Philip Charles MacKenzie]] played Cliff's out-and-proud new friend Donald Maltby, a successful writer/magazine editor whom Cliff sought out friendship with for advice and support in the time leading up to his coming out. During and after the fact, Donald continued to be Cliff's voice of reason as he learned to navigate his way around the [[LGBT]] world. It was an otherwise unlikely friendship, but Donald's fey, queen-like behavior versus the masculinity of Cliff never got in the way, surprisingly. Donald's womanly flamboyance always unnerved Lou, and caused some mild, but humorous friction between them. However, Donald always managed to get the last laugh on Lou with his sharp humor. He lived in a cozy loft apartment which was another common setting for the stories. Cliff and Donald sometimes frequented The Velvet Spike, a local gay club/bar.\n\nOther characters included Joe's teenage daughter Penny ([[Hallie Todd]]), who was becoming independent at a faster rate than Joe anticipated; and ''The Point After'' waitress, Kelly Hall ([[Robin Riker]]), who traded zingers with them all while acting as a mediator between the Waters brothers when necessary. Seen in sporadic guest appearances all through the series was Lou's long-time wife Flo ([[Carol Locatell]]), who only showed up whenever she and Lou were having some sort of marriage dispute. These were usually worked out within the space of a single episode, but their \"hot and cold\" behavior became one of the show's key running gags. Lou and Flo had three kids\u2014Bucky, Flo, Jr. and Louella\u2014who were originally all referred to and never seen. Bucky, however, would make the first of two guest appearances beginning in the second season, as played by [[John Putch]]. A [[seminary]] student, Bucky went on sabbatical from the ministry and paid his family a visit in the season two episode \"Father, Father\", and appeared again in the fourth season [[Thanksgiving]] episode, unexpectedly dropping into town to surprise everyone.\n\n===Themes and evolution===\nOriginally, the storylines  on ''Brothers'' were permeated with exclusively gay themes, as Cliff and Donald's dating exploits were featured, along with the heterosexual characters' involvement in such stories. This sprung forth the show's knack for providing a blurred line of differences between the mating habits and culture of both sexualities. Examples of topical gay stories included Cliff's casual intimate encounters with men and the points he still wanted to learn; Lou and Donald's efforts to infiltrate crooked local police officers who refused to help Cliff, when he was attacked by two [[homophobia|homophobic men]]; Donald's coaching Joe into accurately convincing a former teammate that he was gay, in order to form a closer bond with the recently outed teammate; and in the second season, when Cliff landed a boyfriend in well-to-do Winston March III (guest star [[John Furey]]), who helped him become even more comfortable in his identity. Winston initiated a passionate kiss with him, at a function he hosted, in front of Cliff's entire family.\n\nStereotypes of both sexualities, both positive and negative, were for the most part avoided, and if they appeared, were not emphasized at the expense of comedy so they would not detract from the meaningful, character-driven dialogue. While a steep gay slant in the stories was present, they were not depicted only from the gay point of view; all characters' points of view in stories which explored sexuality shared the spotlight from episode to episode, sometimes shifting back and forth within a single episode. The series, as a result, was recognized as being clever and complex in this regard.\n\nHowever, after the first two seasons, the writers started to downplay the wall-to-wall gay stories in favor of ones that were neutral to homosexual/heterosexual overtones. Just as this took place, additional characters started entering their own long-term relationships, which were depicted in a more standard sitcom fashion without sexuality being the key topic in an episode. Also, with ''Brothers'' being a Showtime original series, the allowance of strong language was taken advantage of heavily during the first and second seasons. By season three, with Paramount Television serious about the show's future in reruns, the scripts were cleaned up as well over the concern that the constant editing of coarse dialogue (Joe's habitual exclaiming of \"[[bitch (insult)|son of a bitch]]\" and \"[[fuck]]\" and \"[[shit]]\" peppered in accordingly) would be bad for syndication and revenues.\n\n===Later seasons===\nAt the start of the third season, Joe began dating a voluptuous beauty named Sam ([[Mary Ann Pascal]]), a very materialistic [[real estate agent]] who was not only content with the physical aspect of their relationship, but also out to reap the benefits of an ex-pro athlete's bank account. During their mating dance, Sam became another regular patron at ''The Point After'', where at times she found herself in competition with Kelly over practically everything. Penny, who had rapidly matured from a gentle, innocent high school senior to a wild, vivacious party girl with a punk hairdo, began working as a dancer at Girls, Girls, Girls & Beer, a local dance hall, during her sophomore year in college. Everyone else on the scene had mates that came and went, and Joe was no exception with Sam, as they were on-again, off-again for a while; while Sam chose not to play the field, Joe dated others. In the fourth-season premiere, perky, cultured Ann Marie Wagner (guest star [[Judith-Marie Bergan]]) showed up, as a girlfriend of Joe's who had been with him for six months. Joe and Annie decided to get married during the course of the episode, but after much meddling from a jealous Sam, and a discouraging ceremony speech from Donald (who presided over the restaurant ceremony), the two called it off. A few episodes later, Joe went into overdrive dating both Annie and Sam, but felt guilty; when he went to break the news to Annie that he had been playing her, she revealed that she had been cheating too, so the two parted ways mutually, leaving Sam, who encouraged an open relationship, as Joe's only romantic focus.\n\nIn time, Joe and Sam discovered that they had a whole lot more in common beyond money and status, and love blossomed. Kelly and Sam even learned to put their feuding aside, forming sort of a \"girls' club\" together with Penny and Donald. Meanwhile, Cliff, who graduated from college early in the fourth season, was on the verge on launching his journalism career with a local newspaper when he had an epiphany-\u2013that he suddenly had the affinity for cooking\u2014and announced to everyone that he was enrolling in culinary school. Joe, Lou, and especially Donald tried to save him for turning down the offer to work at the paper, but in the end, decided to throw caution to the wind after tasting Cliff's impressive tomato sauce. Later that year, after dating many young men on the fast track, aspiring yuppie Penny fell for none other than Jim Grant ([[Tommy Hinkley]]), a construction worker from Lou's company. Jim was actually from a very wealthy family, but loved the laborer's life better, resulting in his turning down the opportunity to helm his family's million-dollar enterprise in order to be truly happy. Their romance lasted a single season. It was also at this time that the youngest of Lou's kids, athletic teenage prodigy Louella ([[Yeardley Smith]]), became a regular.\n\nThe fourth-season finale saw ''The Point After'' get upgraded to a three-star establishment by a local Philadelphia food publication, and Joe quickly received an offer by another top restaurateur for a huge buyout of his place. During the celebration of the three-star news at Donald's, everyone was shocked at the offer given to Joe, and Kelly expressed her worry over losing her job. After a series of flashbacks chronicling memorable moments the cast had at ''The Point After'', Joe ripped up the papers granting its sale, and it was assumed as the episode came to an end that the gang would remain intact. However, as the fifth season began in June 1988, Kelly was no longer around (Robin Riker-Hasley had left the series). At this time, Sam, whom Joe had still been going steady with, revealed she was pregnant. Joe didn't take the news too well at first, since new fatherhood wasn't exactly in his game plan. Sam was dead set against [[abortion]], and ended up giving Joe an ultimatum&nbsp;\u2014 either he opened up his mind to having a new family, or she left him to raise the child alone. Joe chose to stand by Sam, and the two rushed off to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to tie the knot. Through the next few months he had many adjustments to make, but when their daughter, whom they named Caroline, was born in the December 2, 1988 episode, Joe was more than ready to embrace her. Lou, Cliff and Penny all shared the designation of being Caroline's guardian, in case anything ever happened to her parents. Baby Caroline (who was named after executive producer Gary Nardino's daughter) was played in her birth episode by boy and girl twins Charles and Cathryn Hacker, but for the remainder of the series, was played by Cathryn alone.\n\nAs Joe and Sam were busy adjusting to married life, as well as preparing to bring in the newest addition to the Waters family, Cliff found himself getting promoted to manager of ''The Point After'' while continuing in culinary school. On the side, he was gradually building his own catering business from scratch, at times joining his services in with the restaurant's catering in order to turn over larger profits. Penny found a new love interest in Mike Chandler ([[Timothy Williams (actor)|Timothy Williams]]), a suitor that Joe had an extremely hard time having around. Mike happened to be the lawyer hired by Penny's mother, Joe's ex-wife Janey (who was played in a 1985 guest appearance by [[Rebecca Balding]], Walden's former ''[[Lou Grant]]'' co-star) to retrieve part of Joe's pro football salary that she had yet to receive as a part of her divorce settlement with him. During their legal dealings, Penny moved out of Janey's house when her mother remarried on a whim, and got her own studio apartment. She graduated from college the following spring, and was hired as a junior writer for a big-time advertising firm.\n\nOther developments included Donald's close brush with a career in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], when he was hired to meet with a veteran movie actress in hopes of writing her biography. After getting lost in all of Tinseltown's glitz and glamour, Donald decided on his own will that Philly was where he truly belonged, and hired a \"stringer\" writer to collaborate on the biography project so he could return home. In November 1988, Lou was promoted to project designer in the offices of the large corporation that now owned Santini Construction. He was bribed into taking the promotion to keep quiet about an increase in accidents happening down at the job sites, as a result of inferior conditions and materials the new company provided. Upon finding this out, Lou was faced with a moral dilemma, and ended up quitting after 28 years on the job. He worked many odd jobs to compensate for his loss of income, before Donald proposed a business deal in which he found homeowners who needed private renovating done by a craftsman of Lou's expertise. A local mansion renovation job put Lou on the map, allowing him to buy out Donald's share in the partnership so he could become a stand-alone private contractor. Also, after his own steady succession of casual intimate encounters and regular boyfriends, Cliff's valiant search for Mr. Right continued, with a lot of help and advice from his family and friends.\n\n===Very special episodes===\nA couple of [[Very special episode|special episodes]] dealt with one of Joe's former teammates coming out, then feeling forced to admit that he was [[HIV]]-positive. Bubba Dean (guest star [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]]) actually revealed to Joe in a first-season episode that he was gay and had been holding a long-time torch for him. Then in a second season appearance, out of his fear of potentially spreading the virus, Bubba drops the news of his HIV infection at a party thrown by Donald. Since HIV and [[AIDS]] were not widely known to most Americans at the time, this episode had Joe learning about HIV and AIDS to better understand what his friend was going through so that he could offer support, as well as educating the public about HIV and AIDS and dispelling the myths about those who had contracted it and how it could be contracted.\n\nAnother episode in this category occurred in the second season, when Cliff learned that Connie (guest star [[Wendie Jo Sperber]]), his former fianc\u00e9e whom he stood up at the altar in the pilot episode (although she was not seen in the pilot), was paying him a surprise visit after having spent a year being depressed&nbsp;\u2014 and gaining a lot of weight as the result of it. Cliff hesitated in making contact with her, but due to everyone's prompting they finally met face to face, and had a lot of hard feelings to address.\n\nVeteran actress [[Billie Bird]] was the subject of a couple of two-parter episodes. Bird first appeared in the third season two-parter \"Whose 'Golden Years' Is It Anyway?\" (aired September 17 and 24, 1986), as Donald's Aunt Wilhelmina, who escapes to Philadelphia, and her nephew, when her family places her in a nursing home. Wilhelmina strikes up a friendship with Lou and ends up convincing him to keep her from being carted off back to the home; they promptly end up on the run without letting their family and friends know of their whereabouts. In the second part of this episode, an arrest warrant is brought out for Lou. Exactly a year later in season four, Wilhelmina shows up again in the two-parter \"Las Vegas Serenade\" (aired September 11 and 18, 1987), albeit through a VHS tape sent to Donald. It turned out to be her video will, which arrived with an urn of her ashes. Wilhelmina, in advance right before her death, set up an all-expenses paid trip to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] which the entire cast embarked on, with the exception of Kelly (Robin Riker began her temporary leave of absence with this episode). Donald and the gang were instructed by Wilhelmina to spread her ashes into the courtyard of the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino]] while in Vegas. The trip was shot on location, mostly at the latter resort, and featured cameo appearances by [[Paul Anka]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].\n\nThe fifth-season episode \"L.A. Maltby\" (aired September 1988), in which Donald travels out to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] for the job offer of a lifetime, was perceived to be an attempt at a ''Brothers'' spin-off starring Philip Charles MacKenzie, centering on Donald's new glitz-filled life and career on the West Coast. Since the Hollywood storyline concluded in the same episode, with Donald choosing to return to Philadelphia, it is presumed that removing such an integral character from ''Brothers'' would have hurt the show, which was already undergoing many changes that year (read above). Since it was announced several months later that production on the series would end after five seasons, it can also be figured that hiring a replacement comic foil, or \"contrast\"-type character to play off the show's leads, wouldn't have been worth casting, even for almost 20 more episodes of ''Brothers''.\n\n==Scheduling==\nAfter premiering in July 1984, ''Brothers'' completed the run of its first season of 14 episodes in December of that year, with the now-popular ''Brothers Christmas Special'' (featuring guest star [[Andy Garc\u00eda]]) serving as the season finale. Beginning in May 1985 and through the end of the 1987 season, Showtime usually ran new episodes of ''Brothers'' on a May to December season schedule, a common free-form timetable for any cable network. Each of the second through fourth seasons consisted of a 25 episode order with the final fifth season having the standard 25 episodes that other American series utilized.\n\nThe fifth season had its premiere moved up to June in 1988, and had its episodes spread out over the course of a year, with one or two new episodes airing each month. The pace of new episodes eased down during this season, first and foremost because of the [[1988 Writers Guild of America Strike]] putting a halt to production during a portion of the season. After the strike ended, Showtime announced that ''Brothers'' was ending its run in 1989; episodes continued to air intermittently, since Showtime wanted a clear-cut five-year run while giving viewers enough to a chance to bid farewell to the series. The 25th episode of the fifth season, \"The Road Yet Taken\", was finally reached on May 5, 1989, and was the official series finale of ''Brothers''. Then, a few weeks later on June 1, a \"lost episode\" produced during season three entitled \"I Remember But I Don't Like It\" aired. The episode featured most of the season three regulars, including [[Robin Riker]] but sans [[Mary Ann Pascal]], and focused on Lou and Donald's most severe disagreement yet. As the others tried to figure out why the two were so angry at each other, a clip montage of Lou and Donald's relationship through the first three seasons was featured. Showtime presumably felt that this lost episode also served as a tribute to one of the show's key elements\u2014the association between Lou and Donald. Showtime continued to air ''Brothers'' repeats on its schedule through late 1989.\n\nFor the majority of its original run, ''Brothers'' had aired Wednesday nights at 8/7c on Showtime, with episodes from its current season being repeated in various late night slots during the week on the premium cable network's schedule.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Walden]] as Joe Waters\n* [[Paul Regina]] as Cliff Waters\n* [[Brandon Maggart]] as Lou Waters\n* [[Philip Charles MacKenzie]] as Donald Maltby\n* [[Hallie Todd]] as Penny Waters\n* [[Robin Riker]] as Kelly Hall (Seasons 1\u20134)\n* [[Mary Ann Pascal]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Booke Waters (Seasons 3\u20135)\n* [[Yeardley Smith]] as Louella Waters (Seasons 4\u20135)\n* [[Tommy Hinkley]] as Jim Grant (Season 4)\n* [[Timothy Williams (actor)|Timothy Williams]] as Mike Chandler (Season 5)\n* Cathryn Hacker as Caroline Waters (Season 5)\n\n==Production notes==\n\n===Opening sequence and presentation===\nThe ''Brothers'' title theme was a jazzy, synthesized piece written by Marcus Barone, Joe Diamond and Gloria Nissenson, with opening vocals performed by Barone.\n\nAs the title sequence opens, videotaped exterior scenes of Philadelphia are shown one at a time as the show's title is spelled out, one letter at a time, across the screen. The title formation is set on a half-circular curve. During this, lead singer Barone has a conversation with two other men in preparation for them to sing the theme song with him. Apparently, they are supposed to be posing as the Waters brothers, to give viewers the illusion that they, and not the hired singers, are the ones harmonizing the tune. Following this, a chorus of ''shoop-do-wah''s serve as a bridge between the dialogue and the main part of the song.\n\nThe opening credits featured an artistic montage of actual photos from [[Robert Walden|Walden]], [[Paul Regina|Regina]], and [[Brandon Maggart|Maggart]]'s childhood and young adult years (although the first photo of young Lou in the sequence was actually that of Brandon Maggart's son, [[Garett Maggart]], when he was a baby). Also featured was 16mm film footage of young Paul Regina, labeled on a film strip in the sequence as \"Cliff, age 4 yrs\". This montage segued into a group photo of the Waters brothers in the current day, which in turn displayed singular portraits of them one at a time as their credits were given on screen. All cast member photos were set against a blue background. A time-lapsed animation version of the group photo then lifts up to reveal multiple photos of the brothers in various scenes from the show's set. From the pilot episode through the end of season three, Robin Riker and Hallie Todd's names were listed at the bottom of this section, while the pictures floated against a sky background.\n\nThe final part of the opening sequence is a videotaped scene of the Waters brothers, finishing their lip-syncing of the show's theme song in front of a candy store named \"Babe's\". For the first two seasons, \"and [[Philip Charles MacKenzie]] as Donald\" appeared during this scene, followed by creator and producer credits before the sequence faded. During the entire third season, a computerized blue background with a digital cut-out of MacKenzie appeared with his credit before cutting to the \"Babe's\" scene. Starting with the fourth-season premiere, the photos of [[Robin Riker]] (now credited as Robin Riker-Hasley) and [[Hallie Todd]] were featured for the first time over the floating pictures animation, flipping up one at a time, until the last photo is that of MacKenzie, who now appears in a proper portrait. The last three cast portraits were set in blue backgrounds to match those of Walden, Regina, and Maggart's. Also, from this point on, creator and producing credits no longer appeared in the opening's last scene.\n\nFor the eleven episodes of season four that Riker-Hasley did not appear in, her photo and credit were removed from the intro, with only Todd and MacKenzie showing up in the latter half. This short-lived version of the intro had the dark blue backgrounds removed from Todd and MacKenzie, revealing the natural light-blue backgrounds of their photos instead. For season four, episode twenty-five, which was Riker-Hasley's return to the show, as well as her last appearance, the intro that was used in season four, episodes one through fourteen returned. In season five, after Riker-Hasley's departure, Mary Ann Pascal's photo was added into the sequence, between Todd and MacKenzie. The latter three cast photos in general were all new (with Todd's and MacKenzie's updated from the season four versions), and featured more natural backgrounds in gray/light blue/white tones. They filled the entire screen, as the floating pictures animation was completely eliminated.\n\nThree different credit fonts were utilized on ''Brothers'' simultaneously. The opening sequence used orange-gold hued Collegiate font for the title and credits; a font famously associated with sports teams (as well as colleges and universities), it was used to represent the show's underlying image of masculinity\u2014brotherhood, ''The Point After'', sports and Joe's past [[NFL]] glory. First and final scene production credits were set in [[Cooper Black]] font, orange during the first two and a half seasons, then in yellow from the middle of season three until the end (black shadowing was added at the start of season four). Closing credits all through the run appeared in thin yellow [[Helvetica]], and were carded in groups over scenes from the current episode. An instrumental cut of the opening theme, dominated by [[saxophone]], was used for the closing.\n\nUpon the show's fall 1989 debut in syndication, the opening title sequence was truncated so that the only visuals featured in the first half were the title formation over the scenes of Philadelphia, the single photos of Walden, Regina and Maggart, and the time-lapsed group photo of the Waters brothers. The theme itself began from the ''\"Gonna meet the family...\"'' line, and ran up to ''\"Where it counts, behind the scenes, we're brothers\"'' line when the time-lapsed family photo was reached. During the last three cast credits and ending scene, the song picked up from the ''\"Life is full of stress and strife...\"'' line and ran through the end, unedited.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n===Series

It was produced by Gary Nardino Productions, in association with two separate divisions of [[Paramount Pictures]]: first by the [[Paramount Video]] division (1984\u201386) and by [[Paramount Television]] (1987\u201389). The show focuses on the three Waters brothers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Development===\n[[David Lloyd (writer)|David Lloyd]], [[Greg Antonacci]] and Gary Nardino respectively created and developed ''Brothers'' in 1982, with the same format as what made it to the air. Lloyd, a veteran TV writer known for his work on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Taxi]]'' and the then-new NBC sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'', had the premise for this series suggested to him by his employers, TV producers [[Ed. Weinberger]] and [[Stan Daniels]]. Wishing to develop a new screenplay with a revolutionary theme, Lloyd took to Weinberger and Daniels' idea about exploring familial relationships with the presence of a major\u2014and controversial\u2014life change, that of a relative finally coming out and addressing his [[homosexuality]]. Lloyd fully developed the idea and assumed full creation credit for the project. He then partnered himself with current Paramount Television president Nardino, who was looking to form an independent production company (he would leave Paramount in July 1983 to form Gary Nardino Productions),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/gary-nardino-dead-at-62-1117467318/|title=Gary Nardino dead at 62|author=Nick Madigan|work=Variety}}</ref> and Antonacci, a young actor-turned-director and producer, to write a pilot script with a modern, relevant point of view. The relationship of three adult brothers, inseparable and living in a world strongly underscored by masculinity, who soon have to confront the youngest brother's decision to be [[openly gay]], quickly came to fruition in the screenplay aptly titled ''Brothers''.\n\nThe project was originally shopped around to broadcast networks [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], in hopes of being picked up for the [[1983-84 United States network television schedule|1983 fall television season]]. NBC agreed to screen the pilot due to Lloyd's work on ''Taxi'' and ''Cheers'' (both of which had aired on NBC during the 1982-83 season), and due to the insistence of Weinberger and Daniels. The network suits (then headed by [[Brandon Tartikoff]]) saw the charm of the content, but were concerned about how homosexuality was going to be portrayed. NBC did put ''Brothers'' in the running of fall 1983 pilots, but ultimately passed on it, instead choosing a series from Weinberger, ''[[Mr. Smith (TV series)|Mr. Smith]]'', in its place. Lloyd, Antonacci and Nardino then offered ''Brothers'' to ABC, who instantly shot it down because of its dealings of gay themes. The creative team refused to give up hope on the project, and the same was said for its three leads, which from the beginning were [[Robert Walden]] (fresh off his [[Emmy Award]]-winning role of Joe Rossi on [[CBS]]' ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]''), [[Paul Regina]] and [[Brandon Maggart]]. As the producers tried to find a new outlet to pitch it to, development was put on hold, allowing Regina to co-star in CBS' short-lived ''[[Zorro and Son]]'' (1983), and Maggart to assume a role on NBC's ''[[Jennifer Slept Here]]'' (1983\u201384).\n\nEventually, Lloyd and company were approached by Showtime, who at the time had successfully begun to venture into the new field of original pay-cable TV series. In 1983, the channel had been the first in history to revive a canceled network series for original cable broadcasts, with ''[[The Paper Chase (TV series)|The Paper Chase]]'' (which originally ran on CBS in 1978-79). Showtime's mission was to produce and pick up original programming that was outside the boundaries of standard network TV fare, and saw ''Brothers'' perfectly fitting that mold. Both parties struck a deal that had its cast paid at the same rate as network stars, with a full out 26-episode order from the start. Fortunately, Lloyd didn't have to scramble around to recast two of his stars, since Regina and Maggart both saw their series get canceled, so his original choices were back in place. With the series' premiere in the summer of 1984, Showtime now boasted one more first&nbsp;\u2014 the first original situation comedy on cable TV.\n\nSaid Robert Walden of his experience working on Showtime, \"There are fewer cooks in the kitchen, and the writers have more freedom. There's also something to be said for playing to 5 million or 6 million viewers instead of 30 million. You're reaching a higher common denominator.\"<ref name = NYT /> Since [[Nielsen Media Research]] had not yet adapted its ratings system to measure audience levels on premium cable, Showtime relied on [[qualitative research]] rather than sheer statistical reports. \"We have research firms that do telephone interviews with our subscribers,\"<ref name = NYT /> explained Peter Chernin, a Showtime programming executive. \"They call people and ask them how much they like particular shows. We also take into account the opinions of our local affiliates. All of them rated ''Brothers'' very highly.\"<ref name = NYT >{{cite news  |author=Stephen Farber|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/16/arts/brothers-success-hints-at-cable-s-new-role.html |title='Brothers' Success Hints at Cable's New Role |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 16, 1985 |accessdate=2015-09-16}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the policies set at rival [[HBO]], who had no intention of preparing any of their first forays into original series for syndication, Showtime had the market in mind as soon as they picked up ''Brothers''. Since ''Brothers'' had such a successful first season by pay-cable standards, channel execs announced two unprecedented moves in the spring of 1985: not only would ''Brothers'' have a renewal for 50 more episodes, but the series would begin airing episodes simultaneously in broadcast syndication that November. Showtime giving the series such a large vote of confidence with two-season renewal was so history-making that never had a broadcast network given a series such an expansive episode order after its freshman year.\n\nHBO criticized their competitor's decision over the early syndication airing of ''Brothers'', stating that they would never engage in such a practice with any of their original series. They felt it would destroy subscription rates and revenue if the public could watch one of their series for free on a local broadcast station, rather than pay monthly to view it on HBO. Showtime later recanted their 1985 syndication rollout for ''Brothers'', and then fought back by saying that their subscribers had a five-year head start on all their shows, which were all prepped for syndication and of which would enter it after those five years. Their defense also included the facts that the parent studios of their shows would continue to receive royalties from strong rerun performance in syndication, and that the latter market would attract higher-profile writers and directors to ensure a more quality production. The alternative, as Showtime put it, would be not prepping series for syndication and thus taking a gamble on a relatively unknown or untested creative team.\n\nAs premium cable found its way with successful original programming, HBO would follow suit in what Showtime realized all along concerning syndication, and both would find that concurrent airings of cable series on broadcast TV wasn't so risky. In 1988, Showtime made history once again when they struck a deal with the young [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] to begin airing their ''Brothers'' stablemate, the smash hit ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', on Sunday nights in order to raise Fox's profile among the broadcast networks. Not only did ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' fulfill its mission for Fox, but it actually increased interest in Showtime, and subscription rates benefited.\n\n==Synopsis==\nSet in south [[Philadelphia]], ''Brothers'' centered on the lives and relationships of the Waters brothers; oldest brother Lou ([[Brandon Maggart]]), a somewhat uncouth, but well-meaning [[construction foreman]]; middle brother Joe ([[Robert Walden]]), a retired [[placekicker]] for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and owner of a sports bar called ''The Point After''; and the youngest brother, Cliff ([[Paul Regina]]), a sports journalism major and later, an aspiring chef.\n\nIn the premiere episode, Cliff shocks his family when he runs away from the altar on his wedding day. Instead of getting married, Cliff reveals to his family that he is [[gay]].\n\nThe pilot and following episodes centered on the efforts of Joe and Lou coming to terms with Cliff's long-held secret of his true [[sexual orientation]], with both coping in their own unique way. Joe, who was definitely more sensible and open-minded, didn't see Cliff's sudden declaration of homosexuality robbing any aspect of their relationship. Lou assured his baby brother \"Cliffie\" that he loved and respected him no matter what, but was convinced early on that what Cliff was feeling was just a phase, and came up with numerous efforts to \"cure\" him of being gay. Cliff's relationship with the both of them was part brotherly, but also that of fathers and son, since Lou and Joe had almost 20 years on Cliff (their mother died when Cliff was an infant, followed a few years later by their dad; Lou and Joe raised Cliff for the majority of his youth). He was very much independent minded, and kidded around with his brothers in the usual way siblings do, but at times looked to them for guidance and was very much overprotected by Lou and Joe.\n\nCliff, earnest, bright and very much determined to lead a fulfilled life now that he truly found himself, took many a stand on same-sex issues and discussions; throughout the first season, whenever a situation or argument ensued regarding his decisions in life, Cliff gave heartfelt statements on how proud and secure he was being his true self, and that nothing anyone could do could possibly change his inner desires. When the series began, he was still in college, majoring in sports journalism, while working part-time for Joe at ''The Point After''. Following Cliff's first failed attempt at marriage, he resumed splitting rent with Joe in his sleek uptown apartment.\n\n[[Philip Charles MacKenzie]] played Cliff's out-and-proud new friend Donald Maltby, a successful writer/magazine editor whom Cliff sought out friendship with for advice and support in the time leading up to his coming out. During and after the fact, Donald continued to be Cliff's voice of reason as he learned to navigate his way around the [[LGBT]] world. It was an otherwise unlikely friendship, but Donald's fey, queen-like behavior versus the masculinity of Cliff never got in the way, surprisingly. Donald's womanly flamboyance always unnerved Lou, and caused some mild, but humorous friction between them. However, Donald always managed to get the last laugh on Lou with his sharp humor. He lived in a cozy loft apartment which was another common setting for the stories. Cliff and Donald sometimes frequented The Velvet Spike, a local gay club/bar.\n\nOther characters included Joe's teenage daughter Penny ([[Hallie Todd]]), who was becoming independent at a faster rate than Joe anticipated; and ''The Point After'' waitress, Kelly Hall ([[Robin Riker]]), who traded zingers with them all while acting as a mediator between the Waters brothers when necessary. Seen in sporadic guest appearances all through the series was Lou's long-time wife Flo ([[Carol Locatell]]), who only showed up whenever she and Lou were having some sort of marriage dispute. These were usually worked out within the space of a single episode, but their \"hot and cold\" behavior became one of the show's key running gags. Lou and Flo had three kids\u2014Bucky, Flo, Jr. and Louella\u2014who were originally all referred to and never seen. Bucky, however, would make the first of two guest appearances beginning in the second season, as played by [[John Putch]]. A [[seminary]] student, Bucky went on sabbatical from the ministry and paid his family a visit in the season two episode \"Father, Father\", and appeared again in the fourth season [[Thanksgiving]] episode, unexpectedly dropping into town to surprise everyone.\n\n===Themes and evolution===\nOriginally, the storylines  on ''Brothers'' were permeated with exclusively gay themes, as Cliff and Donald's dating exploits were featured, along with the heterosexual characters' involvement in such stories. This sprung forth the show's knack for providing a blurred line of differences between the mating habits and culture of both sexualities. Examples of topical gay stories included Cliff's casual intimate encounters with men and the points he still wanted to learn; Lou and Donald's efforts to infiltrate crooked local police officers who refused to help Cliff, when he was attacked by two [[homophobia|homophobic men]]; Donald's coaching Joe into accurately convincing a former teammate that he was gay, in order to form a closer bond with the recently outed teammate; and in the second season, when Cliff landed a boyfriend in well-to-do Winston March III (guest star [[John Furey]]), who helped him become even more comfortable in his identity. Winston initiated a passionate kiss with him, at a function he hosted, in front of Cliff's entire family.\n\nStereotypes of both sexualities, both positive and negative, were for the most part avoided, and if they appeared, were not emphasized at the expense of comedy so they would not detract from the meaningful, character-driven dialogue. While a steep gay slant in the stories was present, they were not depicted only from the gay point of view; all characters' points of view in stories which explored sexuality shared the spotlight from episode to episode, sometimes shifting back and forth within a single episode. The series, as a result, was recognized as being clever and complex in this regard.\n\nHowever, after the first two seasons, the writers started to downplay the wall-to-wall gay stories in favor of ones that were neutral to homosexual/heterosexual overtones. Just as this took place, additional characters started entering their own long-term relationships, which were depicted in a more standard sitcom fashion without sexuality being the key topic in an episode. Also, with ''Brothers'' being a Showtime original series, the allowance of strong language was taken advantage of heavily during the first and second seasons. By season three, with Paramount Television serious about the show's future in reruns, the scripts were cleaned up as well over the concern that the constant editing of coarse dialogue (Joe's habitual exclaiming of \"[[bitch (insult)|son of a bitch]]\" and \"[[fuck]]\" and \"[[shit]]\" peppered in accordingly) would be bad for syndication and revenues.\n\n===Later seasons===\nAt the start of the third season, Joe began dating a voluptuous beauty named Sam ([[Mary Ann Pascal]]), a very materialistic [[real estate agent]] who was not only content with the physical aspect of their relationship, but also out to reap the benefits of an ex-pro athlete's bank account. During their mating dance, Sam became another regular patron at ''The Point After'', where at times she found herself in competition with Kelly over practically everything. Penny, who had rapidly matured from a gentle, innocent high school senior to a wild, vivacious party girl with a punk hairdo, began working as a dancer at Girls, Girls, Girls & Beer, a local dance hall, during her sophomore year in college. Everyone else on the scene had mates that came and went, and Joe was no exception with Sam, as they were on-again, off-again for a while; while Sam chose not to play the field, Joe dated others. In the fourth-season premiere, perky, cultured Ann Marie Wagner (guest star [[Judith-Marie Bergan]]) showed up, as a girlfriend of Joe's who had been with him for six months. Joe and Annie decided to get married during the course of the episode, but after much meddling from a jealous Sam, and a discouraging ceremony speech from Donald (who presided over the restaurant ceremony), the two called it off. A few episodes later, Joe went into overdrive dating both Annie and Sam, but felt guilty; when he went to break the news to Annie that he had been playing her, she revealed that she had been cheating too, so the two parted ways mutually, leaving Sam, who encouraged an open relationship, as Joe's only romantic focus.\n\nIn time, Joe and Sam discovered that they had a whole lot more in common beyond money and status, and love blossomed. Kelly and Sam even learned to put their feuding aside, forming sort of a \"girls' club\" together with Penny and Donald. Meanwhile, Cliff, who graduated from college early in the fourth season, was on the verge on launching his journalism career with a local newspaper when he had an epiphany-\u2013that he suddenly had the affinity for cooking\u2014and announced to everyone that he was enrolling in culinary school. Joe, Lou, and especially Donald tried to save him for turning down the offer to work at the paper, but in the end, decided to throw caution to the wind after tasting Cliff's impressive tomato sauce. Later that year, after dating many young men on the fast track, aspiring yuppie Penny fell for none other than Jim Grant ([[Tommy Hinkley]]), a construction worker from Lou's company. Jim was actually from a very wealthy family, but loved the laborer's life better, resulting in his turning down the opportunity to helm his family's million-dollar enterprise in order to be truly happy. Their romance lasted a single season. It was also at this time that the youngest of Lou's kids, athletic teenage prodigy Louella ([[Yeardley Smith]]), became a regular.\n\nThe fourth-season finale saw ''The Point After'' get upgraded to a three-star establishment by a local Philadelphia food publication, and Joe quickly received an offer by another top restaurateur for a huge buyout of his place. During the celebration of the three-star news at Donald's, everyone was shocked at the offer given to Joe, and Kelly expressed her worry over losing her job. After a series of flashbacks chronicling memorable moments the cast had at ''The Point After'', Joe ripped up the papers granting its sale, and it was assumed as the episode came to an end that the gang would remain intact. However, as the fifth season began in June 1988, Kelly was no longer around (Robin Riker-Hasley had left the series). At this time, Sam, whom Joe had still been going steady with, revealed she was pregnant. Joe didn't take the news too well at first, since new fatherhood wasn't exactly in his game plan. Sam was dead set against [[abortion]], and ended up giving Joe an ultimatum&nbsp;\u2014 either he opened up his mind to having a new family, or she left him to raise the child alone. Joe chose to stand by Sam, and the two rushed off to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to tie the knot. Through the next few months he had many adjustments to make, but when their daughter, whom they named Caroline, was born in the December 2, 1988 episode, Joe was more than ready to embrace her. Lou, Cliff and Penny all shared the designation of being Caroline's guardian, in case anything ever happened to her parents. Baby Caroline (who was named after executive producer Gary Nardino's daughter) was played in her birth episode by boy and girl twins Charles and Cathryn Hacker, but for the remainder of the series, was played by Cathryn alone.\n\nAs Joe and Sam were busy adjusting to married life, as well as preparing to bring in the newest addition to the Waters family, Cliff found himself getting promoted to manager of ''The Point After'' while continuing in culinary school. On the side, he was gradually building his own catering business from scratch, at times joining his services in with the restaurant\u2019s catering in order to turn over larger profits. Penny found a new love interest in Mike Chandler ([[Timothy Williams (actor)|Timothy Williams]]), a suitor that Joe had an extremely hard time having around. Mike happened to be the lawyer hired by Penny's mother, Joe's ex-wife Janey (who was played in a 1985 guest appearance by [[Rebecca Balding]], Walden's former ''[[Lou Grant]]'' co-star) to retrieve part of Joe's pro football salary that she had yet to receive as a part of her divorce settlement with him. During their legal dealings, Penny moved out of Janey's house when her mother remarried on a whim, and got her own studio apartment. She graduated from college the following spring, and was hired as a junior writer for a big-time advertising firm.\n\nOther developments included Donald's close brush with a career in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], when he was hired to meet with a veteran movie actress in hopes of writing her biography. After getting lost in all of Tinseltown's glitz and glamour, Donald decided on his own will that Philly was where he truly belonged, and hired a \"stringer\" writer to collaborate on the biography project so he could return home. In November 1988, Lou was promoted to project designer in the offices of the large corporation that now owned Santini Construction. He was bribed into taking the promotion to keep quiet about an increase in accidents happening down at the job sites, as a result of inferior conditions and materials the new company provided. Upon finding this out, Lou was faced with a moral dilemma, and ended up quitting after 28 years on the job. He worked many odd jobs to compensate for his loss of income, before Donald proposed a business deal in which he found homeowners who needed private renovating done by a craftsman of Lou's expertise. A local mansion renovation job put Lou on the map, allowing him to buy out Donald's share in the partnership so he could become a stand-alone private contractor. Also, after his own steady succession of casual intimate encounters and regular boyfriends, Cliff's valiant search for Mr. Right continued, with a lot of help and advice from his family and friends.\n\n===Very special episodes===\nA couple of [[Very special episode|special episodes]] dealt with one of Joe's former teammates coming out, then feeling forced to admit that he was [[HIV]]-positive. Bubba Dean (guest star [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]]) actually revealed to Joe in a first-season episode that he was gay and had been holding a long-time torch for him. Then in a second season appearance, out of his fear of potentially spreading the virus, Bubba drops the news of his HIV infection at a party thrown by Donald. Since HIV and [[AIDS]] were not widely known to most Americans at the time, this episode had Joe learning about HIV and AIDS to better understand what his friend was going through so that he could offer support, as well as educating the public about HIV and AIDS and dispelling the myths about those who had contracted it and how it could be contracted.\n\nAnother episode in this category occurred in the second season, when Cliff learned that Connie (guest star [[Wendie Jo Sperber]]), his former fianc\u00e9e whom he stood up at the altar in the pilot episode (although she was not seen in the pilot), was paying him a surprise visit after having spent a year being depressed&nbsp;\u2014 and gaining a lot of weight as the result of it. Cliff hesitated in making contact with her, but due to everyone's prompting they finally met face to face, and had a lot of hard feelings to address.\n\nVeteran actress [[Billie Bird]] was the subject of a couple of two-parter episodes. Bird first appeared in the third season two-parter \"Whose 'Golden Years' Is It Anyway?\" (aired September 17 and 24, 1986), as Donald's Aunt Wilhelmina, who escapes to Philadelphia, and her nephew, when her family places her in a nursing home. Wilhelmina strikes up a friendship with Lou and ends up convincing him to keep her from being carted off back to the home; they promptly end up on the run without letting their family and friends know of their whereabouts. In the second part of this episode, an arrest warrant is brought out for Lou. Exactly a year later in season four, Wilhelmina shows up again in the two-parter \"Las Vegas Serenade\" (aired September 11 and 18, 1987), albeit through a VHS tape sent to Donald. It turned out to be her video will, which arrived with an urn of her ashes. Wilhelmina, in advance right before her death, set up an all-expenses paid trip to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] which the entire cast embarked on, with the exception of Kelly (Robin Riker began her temporary leave of absence with this episode). Donald and the gang were instructed by Wilhelmina to spread her ashes into the courtyard of the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino]] while in Vegas. The trip was shot on location, mostly at the latter resort, and featured cameo appearances by [[Paul Anka]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].\n\nThe fifth-season episode \"L.A. Maltby\" (aired September 1988), in which Donald travels out to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] for the job offer of a lifetime, was perceived to be an attempt at a ''Brothers'' spin-off starring Philip Charles MacKenzie, centering on Donald's new glitz-filled life and career on the West Coast. Since the Hollywood storyline concluded in the same episode, with Donald choosing to return to Philadelphia, it is presumed that removing such an integral character from ''Brothers'' would have hurt the show, which was already undergoing many changes that year (read above). Since it was announced several months later that production on the series would end after five seasons, it can also be figured that hiring a replacement comic foil, or \"contrast\"-type character to play off the show's leads, wouldn't have been worth casting, even for almost 20 more episodes of ''Brothers''.\n\n==Scheduling==\nAfter premiering in July 1984, ''Brothers'' completed the run of its first season of 14 episodes in December of that year, with the now-popular ''Brothers Christmas Special'' (featuring guest star [[Andy Garc\u00eda]]) serving as the season finale. Beginning in May 1985 and through the end of the 1987 season, Showtime usually ran new episodes of ''Brothers'' on a May to December season schedule, a common free-form timetable for any cable network. Each of the second through fourth seasons consisted of a 25 episode order with the final fifth season having the standard 25 episodes that other American series utilized.\n\nThe fifth season had its premiere moved up to June in 1988, and had its episodes spread out over the course of a year, with one or two new episodes airing each month. The pace of new episodes eased down during this season, first and foremost because of the [[1988 Writers Guild of America Strike]] putting a halt to production during a portion of the season. After the strike ended, Showtime announced that ''Brothers'' was ending its run in 1989; episodes continued to air intermittently, since Showtime wanted a clear-cut five-year run while giving viewers enough to a chance to bid farewell to the series. The 25th episode of the fifth season, \"The Road Yet Taken\", was finally reached on May 5, 1989, and was the official series finale of ''Brothers''. Then, a few weeks later on June 1, a \"lost episode\" produced during season three entitled \"I Remember But I Don't Like It\" aired. The episode featured most of the season three regulars, including [[Robin Riker]] but sans [[Mary Ann Pascal]], and focused on Lou and Donald's most severe disagreement yet. As the others tried to figure out why the two were so angry at each other, a clip montage of Lou and Donald's relationship through the first three seasons was featured. Showtime presumably felt that this lost episode also served as a tribute to one of the show's key elements\u2014the association between Lou and Donald. Showtime continued to air ''Brothers'' repeats on its schedule through late 1989.\n\nFor the majority of its original run, ''Brothers'' had aired Wednesday nights at 8/7c on Showtime, with episodes from its current season being repeated in various late night slots during the week on the premium cable network's schedule.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Walden]] as Joe Waters\n* [[Paul Regina]] as Cliff Waters\n* [[Brandon Maggart]] as Lou Waters\n* [[Philip Charles MacKenzie]] as Donald Maltby\n* [[Hallie Todd]] as Penny Waters\n* [[Robin Riker]] as Kelly Hall (Seasons 1\u20134)\n* [[Mary Ann Pascal]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Booke Waters (Seasons 3\u20135)\n* [[Yeardley Smith]] as Louella Waters (Seasons 4\u20135)\n* [[Tommy Hinkley]] as Jim Grant (Season 4)\n* [[Timothy Williams (actor)|Timothy Williams]] as Mike Chandler (Season 5)\n* Cathryn Hacker as Caroline Waters (Season 5)\n\n==Production notes==\n\n===Opening sequence and presentation===\nThe ''Brothers'' title theme was a jazzy, synthesized piece written by Marcus Barone, Joe Diamond and Gloria Nissenson, with opening vocals performed by Barone.\n\nAs the title sequence opens, videotaped exterior scenes of Philadelphia are shown one at a time as the show's title is spelled out, one letter at a time, across the screen. The title formation is set on a half-circular curve. During this, lead singer Barone has a conversation with two other men in preparation for them to sing the theme song with him. Apparently, they are supposed to be posing as the Waters brothers, to give viewers the illusion that they, and not the hired singers, are the ones harmonizing the tune. Following this, a chorus of ''shoop-do-wah''s serve as a bridge between the dialogue and the main part of the song.\n\nThe opening credits featured an artistic montage of actual photos from [[Robert Walden|Walden]], [[Paul Regina|Regina]], and [[Brandon Maggart|Maggart]]'s childhood and young adult years (although the first photo of young Lou in the sequence was actually that of Brandon Maggart's son, [[Garett Maggart]], when he was a baby). Also featured was 16mm film footage of young Paul Regina, labeled on a film strip in the sequence as \"Cliff, age 4 yrs\". This montage segued into a group photo of the Waters brothers in the current day, which in turn displayed singular portraits of them one at a time as their credits were given on screen. All cast member photos were set against a blue background. A time-lapsed animation version of the group photo then lifts up to reveal multiple photos of the brothers in various scenes from the show's set. From the pilot episode through the end of season three, Robin Riker and Hallie Todd's names were listed at the bottom of this section, while the pictures floated against a sky background.\n\nThe final part of the opening sequence is a videotaped scene of the Waters brothers, finishing their lip-syncing of the show's theme song in front of a candy store named \"Babe's\". For the first two seasons, \"and [[Philip Charles MacKenzie]] as Donald\" appeared during this scene, followed by creator and producer credits before the sequence faded. During the entire third season, a computerized blue background with a digital cut-out of MacKenzie appeared with his credit before cutting to the \"Babe's\" scene. Starting with the fourth-season premiere, the photos of [[Robin Riker]] (now credited as Robin Riker-Hasley) and [[Hallie Todd]] were featured for the first time over the floating pictures animation, flipping up one at a time, until the last photo is that of MacKenzie, who now appears in a proper portrait. The last three cast portraits were set in blue backgrounds to match those of Walden, Regina, and Maggart's. Also, from this point on, creator and producing credits no longer appeared in the opening's last scene.\n\nFor the eleven episodes of season four that Riker-Hasley did not appear in, her photo and credit were removed from the intro, with only Todd and MacKenzie showing up in the latter half. This short-lived version of the intro had the dark blue backgrounds removed from Todd and MacKenzie, revealing the natural light-blue backgrounds of their photos instead. For season four, episode twenty-five, which was Riker-Hasley's return to the show, as well as her last appearance, the intro that was used in season four, episodes one through fourteen returned. In season five, after Riker-Hasley's departure, Mary Ann Pascal's photo was added into the sequence, between Todd and MacKenzie. The latter three cast photos in general were all new (with Todd's and MacKenzie's updated from the season four versions), and featured more natural backgrounds in gray/light blue/white tones. They filled the entire screen, as the floating pictures animation was completely eliminated.\n\nThree different credit fonts were utilized on ''Brothers'' simultaneously. The opening sequence used orange-gold hued Collegiate font for the title and credits; a font famously associated with sports teams (as well as colleges and universities), it was used to represent the show's underlying image of masculinity\u2014brotherhood, ''The Point After'', sports and Joe's past [[NFL]] glory. First and final scene production credits were set in [[Cooper Black]] font, orange during the first two and a half seasons, then in yellow from the middle of season three until the end (black shadowing was added at the start of season four). Closing credits all through the run appeared in thin yellow [[Helvetica]], and were carded in groups over scenes from the current episode. An instrumental cut of the opening theme, dominated by [[saxophone]], was used for the closing.\n\nUpon the show's fall 1989 debut in syndication, the opening title sequence was truncated so that the only visuals featured in the first half were the title formation over the scenes of Philadelphia, the single photos of Walden, Regina and Maggart, and the time-lapsed group photo of the Waters brothers. The theme itself began from the ''\"Gonna meet the family...\"'' line, and ran up to ''\"Where it counts, behind the scenes, we're brothers\"'' line when the time-lapsed family photo was reached. During the last three cast credits and ending scene, the song picked up from the ''\"Life is full of stress and strife...\"'' line and ran through the end, unedited.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n===Series

Bush administration]] avoided using the label \"[[prisoner of war]]\" when discussing the detainees held at Bagram, preferring to immediately classify them as \"[[unlawful enemy combatants]]\". This way, it is not necessary under the [[Geneva Conventions]] to have a [[competent tribunal]] determine their classification. (In previous conflicts such as the [[Vietnam War]], [[Army Regulation 190-8 Tribunal]]s determined the status of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].)\n\nThe administration also initially argued that these detainees could not access the US legal system. However, the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' confirmed that captives in US jurisdiction did indeed have the right to access US courts. ''Rasul v. Bush'' determined that the [[Executive Branch]] did not have the authority, under the [[United States Constitution]], to suspend the right for detainees to submit [[habeas corpus|writs of ''habeas corpus'']].\n\nAnother consequence of the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Rasul v. Bush'' was the establishment of [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s to review and confirm the information that initially led each captive to be classified as an enemy combatant. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) convened these tribunals for every captive in Guantanamo Bay, but they did not apply to Bagram. The current legal process governing the status of Bagram captives is the Enemy Combatant Review Board, described by [[Eliza Griswold]] in ''[[The New Republic]]'':\n\n{{Quote|Prisoners don't even have the limited access to lawyers available to prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo. Nor do they have the right to Combatant Status Review Tribunals, which Guant\u00e1namo detainees won in the 2004 Supreme Court ruling in ''Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.'' Instead, if a combat commander chooses, he can convene an Enemy Combatant Review Board (ECRB), at which the detainee has no right to a personal advocate, no chance to speak in his own defense, and no opportunity to review the evidence against him. The detainee isn't even allowed to attend.

The Americans say it is impossible to build legal cases against all prisoners arrested in battlefield conditions.

Allen, the American military commander in Afghanistan, over the weekend and apparently prompted the downgraded American presence at the ceremony.<ref name=\"NYT20120910\" />\n\nThe transition of prisons from American to Afghanistan control means prisoners leave their cells in one of the remaining American-controlled buildings and are taken to new cells in a building controlled by Afghans, but where American personnel will still be present in an advisory role until at least March 2013 under the March 9, 2012, agreement.

The U.S. has been holding detainees in internment at Bagram for years. Although the Afghan government agreed to embrace an internment system by signing the accord in March, some top Afghan officials and legal experts contend it violates the Afghan constitution, the report said.

Bush administration]] avoided using the label \"[[prisoner of war]]\" when discussing the detainees held at Bagram, preferring to immediately classify them as \"[[unlawful enemy combatants]]\". This way, it is not necessary under the [[Geneva Conventions]] to have a [[competent tribunal]] determine their classification. (In previous conflicts such as the [[Vietnam War]], [[Army Regulation 190-8 Tribunal]]s determined the status of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].)\n\nThe administration also initially argued that these detainees could not access the US legal system. However, the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' confirmed that captives in US jurisdiction did indeed have the right to access US courts. ''Rasul v. Bush'' determined that the [[Executive Branch]] did not have the authority, under the [[United States Constitution]], to suspend the right for detainees to submit [[habeas corpus|writs of ''habeas corpus'']].\n\nAnother consequence of the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Rasul v. Bush'' was the establishment of [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s to review and confirm the information that initially led each captive to be classified as an enemy combatant. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) convened these tribunals for every captive in Guantanamo Bay, but they did not apply to Bagram. The current legal process governing the status of Bagram captives is the Enemy Combatant Review Board, described by [[Eliza Griswold]] in ''[[The New Republic]]'':\n\n{{Quote|Prisoners don't even have the limited access to lawyers available to prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo. Nor do they have the right to Combatant Status Review Tribunals, which Guant\u00e1namo detainees won in the 2004 Supreme Court ruling in ''Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.''

The Americans say it is impossible to build legal cases against all prisoners arrested in battlefield conditions.

Allen, the American military commander in Afghanistan, over the weekend and apparently prompted the downgraded American presence at the ceremony.<ref name=\"NYT20120910\" />\n\nThe transition of prisons from American to Afghanistan control means prisoners leave their cells in one of the remaining American-controlled buildings and are taken to new cells in a building controlled by Afghans, but where American personnel will still be present in an advisory role until at least March 2013 under the March 9, 2012, agreement.

The U.S. has been holding detainees in internment at Bagram for years. Although the Afghan government agreed to embrace an internment system by signing the accord in March, some top Afghan officials and legal experts contend it violates the Afghan constitution, the report said.

It was originally released as the B-side to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" in April 1972 and subsequently appeared on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. It was later issued as a single in 1976 to promote the ''[[Changesonebowie]]'' compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of \"[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\" as the B-side. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]] \u2013 at [[Trident Studios]] in London towards the end of the album's sessions. It was originally offered to the English band [[Mott the Hoople]], who declined and recorded Bowie's \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" instead. It is a [[glam rock]] song that is influenced by [[Little Richard]] and [[the Velvet Underground]]. Lyrically, the song contains a reference to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and the famous lyric \"wham bam, thank you, ma'am!\"\n\n\"Suffragette City\" has received critical acclaim, with many praising the guitar work, the band's performance, false ending, famous lyric and the song's power. It has subsequently been called one of Bowie's greatest songs by multiple publications. It was performed frequently by Bowie throughout his concert tours. The song has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012 for its 40th anniversary; this remaster was later included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Suffragette City\" was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before recording it himself, Bowie offered it to the band [[Mott the Hoople]], who he greatly admired,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} if they would forgo their plan to break up.

He argues that the ''Mary Poppins'' song had more to do with women's liberation than \"Suffragette City\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=167}} The song contains the lyric \"Ah droogie, don't crash here\", a direct reference to the [[Anthony Burgess]] novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'': [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation]] was a major influence on Ziggy Stardust's cultural grab-bag, dictating both costumes and pre-show music on tour.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} The song was written only a few months after the film's release in 1971.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=112}} The \"sexually charged\" famous hook \"wham bam, thank you, ma'am!\" previously appeared as the title of a song on jazz bassist [[Charles Mingus]]' 1961 album ''[[Oh Yeah (Charles Mingus album)|Oh Yeah]]'', as well as a 1967 song by the [[Small Faces]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=167}} Bowie also uses the \"hey man!\" backing vocals from [[the Velvet Underground]]'s 1968 song \"[[White Light/White Heat (song)|White Light/White Heat]]\",<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\" /> a line from the 1970 song \"[[I Found Out]]\" by [[John Lennon]], a [[Marc Bolan]]-esque boogie, \"some [[Flamin' Groovies]] speed, some [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] swagger,\" and a \"dose of [[hard rock]] theatrics\" to close.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=167}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Suffragette City\" was originally released as the B-side of \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199).<ref name=\"B-side\" /> It was subsequently released as the 10th and penultimate track on the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', between \"[[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]\" and \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\", on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> It was later issued as a single on 9 July 1976 by RCA (as RCA 2726) to promote the ''[[Changesonebowie]]'' compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of the ''[[Station to Station]]'' track \"[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"A-side\" /> The single failed to chart.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}}\n\nSince release, \"Suffragette City\" has received critical acclaim, with many praising the guitar work, the band's performance, false ending, famous lyric and the song's power.

It was originally released as the B-side to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" in April 1972 and subsequently appeared on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. It was later issued as a single in 1976 to promote the ''[[Changesonebowie]]'' compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of \"[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\" as the B-side. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]] \u2013 at [[Trident Studios]] in London towards the end of the album's sessions. It was originally offered to the English band [[Mott the Hoople]], who declined and recorded Bowie's \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" instead. It is a [[glam rock]] song that is influenced by [[Little Richard]] and [[the Velvet Underground]]. Lyrically, the song contains a reference to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and the famous lyric \"wham bam, thank you, ma'am!\"\n\n\"Suffragette City\" has received critical acclaim, with many praising the guitar work, the band's performance, false ending, famous lyric and the song's power. It has subsequently been called one of Bowie's greatest songs by multiple publications. It was performed frequently by Bowie throughout his concert tours. The song has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012 for its 40th anniversary; this remaster was later included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Suffragette City\" was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before recording it himself, Bowie offered it to the band [[Mott the Hoople]], who he greatly admired,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} if they would forgo their plan to break up.

The song features one of Bowie's earliest uses of the ARP synthesiser, which would later become the backbone of his [[Berlin Trilogy]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} The instrument was used to mimic a [[saxophone]], which underscores the guitar throughout. Bowie thought of the riff, Scott used the ARP located at Trident to find the right sound, and Ronson played the notes.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}} The backing vocals move from the left channel in the first verse to the right in the second.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}} According to biographer [[Peter Doggett]], while other rock songs such as [[the Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Brown Sugar (Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]\" and [[the Kinks]]' \"[[All Day and All of the Night]]\" use a standard three-chord structure spaced \"two and three semitones apart\" (such as E-G-A or A-G-C), \"Suffragette City\" uses tighter two-semitone gaps (F-G-A), which \"leaves the ear to expect a softer A minor as the root of the song, only for a decisive A major chord to appear instead.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}} He believes that this decision gives the track its \"unrelenting power\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}} The track has [[acoustic guitar]] from Bowie, but is mostly buried in the mix under Ronson's electric guitar.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=167}} After a false ending, Bowie cries \"wham bam, thank you, ma'am!\" before the band gets back into the groove, finishing the track with Bowie shrieking \"Suffragette!\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=168}}\n\nAccording to Doggett, before \"Suffragette City\", the only popular song to contain \"suffragette\" in its title was the song \"[[Sister Suffragette]]\" from the 1964 film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.

{"title_page": "Elizabeth Paston", "text_new": "'''Elizabeth Paston''' (1429 \u2013 1 February 1488) was a member of the English gentry who is regularly referred to in the extensive collection of [[Paston Letters]]. She was the only daughter of a Norfolk lawyer, [[William Paston (died 1444)|William Paston]] and Agnes Barry. In her late teens and twenties she resisted marriage to several men proposed by her mother and brothers, before marrying [[Robert Poynings|Sir Robert Poynings]] in 1458, with whom she had a son [[Edward Poynings]].{{sfn|Davis|1971|p=lvi}}\n\nFollowing her husband's death at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] in 1461,{{sfn|Fleming|2004}} she spent a period as a widow before marrying [[George Browne (died 1483)|George Browne]] by whom she had two further children. Browne's execution in 1483 following his involvement in a rebellion against Richard III left her a widow again.{{sfn|Davis|1971|p=lvi}}\n\n== Family ==\nElizabeth Paston, born 1429{{sfn|Davis|1971|p=lv}} in Norfolk, was the middle child and only daughter of William Paston, Justice of the Common Pleas, and Agnes Barry, the daughter and co-heir of Sir Edmund Barry (d. 1433) of Hertfordshire. Elizabeth had four brothers, the eldest of whom, [[John Paston (died 1466)]], succeeded her father in 1444 as heir and head of the family.{{sfn|Castor|2005|p=32}}\n\n=== Marriage proposals and marriages ===\nBy the standards of the time Elizabeth Paston married late; she was nearly 30 when she married in 1458. Her father William had left her \u00a3200 towards her marriage in his will, provided that she married according to the advice of her mother and his other executors.{{sfn|Richmond|1990|p=178}} Potential marriages had been under discussion from at least the time she was nineteen in 1449 when marriage was proposed with a fifty-year-old widower Stephen Scrope, whose stepfather [[John Fastolf]] was John Paston's chief patron.{{sfn|Castor|2005|pp=106\u20139}}\n\nElizabeth was being harshly treated at home by her mother, Agnes, who, as her cousin Elizabeth Clere reported in a letter of 1449, beat her regularly.{{sfn|Castor|2005|p=96}} However, her brother John, who was responsible for organising her dowry, was slow to do so. Various suitors were put forward during the 1450s but marriage did not materialise until 1458 when Elizabeth married Robert Poynings, one of the younger sons of a Sussex landowner.{{sfn|Richmond|1990|pp=180\u201381}} It may not have been a love match{{sfn|Castor|2005|p=111}} but within a year she had a son, Edward Poynings. Edward was born in 1459, only months before Robert Poynings was killed fighting on the Yorkist side at the second battle of St Albans.{{sfn|Castor|2005|p=142}}\n\nElizabeth was left a widow to bring up their son. Edward Poynings was to become a trusted administrator of King Henry VII.  In his role as deputy lord lieutenant in Ireland he was responsible for the famous \"[[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]]\" which clearly subordinated the Anglo-Irish and the Irish to the authority of the English parliament.{{sfn|Ellis|2004}}\n\nElizabeth Poynings (nee Paston) was a widow for over a decade, until she remarried in 1471 to George Browne, landowner of Betchworth in Surrey.{{sfn|Richmond|1996|p=233}} With Browne Elizabeth had two further children, a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Mary.

She was the only daughter of a Norfolk lawyer, [[William Paston (died 1444)|William Paston]] and Agnes Barry. In her late teens and twenties she resisted marriage to several men proposed by her mother and brothers, before marrying [[Robert Poynings|Sir Robert Poynings]] in 1458, with whom she had a son [[Edward Poynings]].{{sfn|Davis|1971|p=lvi}} \n\nFollowing her husband's death at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] in 1461,{{sfn|Fleming|2004}} she spent a period as a widow before marrying [[George Browne (died 1483)|George Browne]] by whom she had two further children. Browne's execution in 1483 following his involvement in a rebellion against Richard III left her a widow again.{{sfn|Davis|1971|p=lvi}}\n\n== Family ==\nElizabeth Paston, born 1429{{sfn|Davis|1971|p=lv}} in Norfolk, was the middle child and only daughter of William Paston, Justice of the Common Pleas, and Agnes Barry, the daughter and co-heir of Sir Edmund Barry (d. 1433) of Hertfordshire. Elizabeth had four brothers, the eldest of whom, [[John Paston (died 1466)]], succeeded her father in 1444 as heir and head of the family.{{sfn|Castor|2005|p=32}}\n\n=== Marriage proposals and marriages ===\nBy the standards of the time Elizabeth Paston married late; she was nearly 30 when she married in 1458. Her father William had left her \u00a3200 towards her marriage in his will, provided that she married according to the advice of her mother and his other executors.{{sfn|Richmond|1990|p=178}} Potential marriages had been under discussion from at least the time she was nineteen in 1449 when marriage was proposed with a fifty-year-old widower Stephen Scrope, whose stepfather [[John Fastolf]] was John Paston's chief patron.{{sfn|Castor|2005|pp=106\u20139}} \n\nElizabeth was being harshly treated at home by her mother, Agnes, who, as her cousin Elizabeth Clere reported in a letter of 1449, beat her regularly.{{sfn|Castor|2005|p=96}} However, her brother John, who was responsible for organising her dowry, was slow to do so. Various suitors were put forward during the 1450s but marriage did not materialise until 1458 when Elizabeth married Robert Poynings, one of the younger sons of a Sussex landowner.{{sfn|Richmond|1990|pp=180\u201381}} It may not have been a love match{{sfn|Castor|2005|p=111}} but within a year she had a son, Edward Poynings. Edward was born in 1459, only months before Robert Poynings was killed fighting on the Yorkist side at the second battle of St Albans.{{sfn|Castor|2005|p=142}} \n\nElizabeth was left a widow to bring up their son. Edward Poynings was to become a trusted administrator of King Henry VII.  In his role as deputy lord lieutenant in Ireland he was responsible for the famous \"[[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]]\" which clearly subordinated the Anglo-Irish and the Irish to the authority of the English parliament.{{sfn|Ellis|2004}}\n\nElizabeth Poynings (nee Paston) was a widow for over a decade, until she remarried in 1471 to George Browne, landowner of Betchworth in Surrey.{{sfn|Richmond|1996|p=233}} With Browne Elizabeth had two further children, a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Mary. Browne was actively involved in politics, both local and national.
