This software can be used to create or edit [[vector graphics]] such as illustrations, diagrams, line arts, charts, logos, icons and complex paintings. Inkscape's primary vector graphics format is [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG); however, many other formats can be imported and exported.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://inkscape.org/about/features/|title = Inkscape Features |accessdate = 13 January 2020|website = Inkscape.org }}</ref>\n\nInkscape can [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] primitive vector shapes (e.g. rectangles, ellipses, polygons, arcs, spirals, stars and 3D boxes) and text. These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear [[color gradient]]s and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. Embedding and optional [[image tracing|tracing]] of [[raster graphics]] is also supported, enabling the editor to create vector graphics from photos and other raster sources. Created shapes can be further manipulated with transformations, such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing.\n\n==History==\nInkscape began in 2003 as a [[code fork]] of the [[Sodipodi]] project.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#how-did-inkscape-start | title = FAQ | publisher = Inkscape Project | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> Sodipodi, developed since 1999, was itself based on [[Raph Levien]]'s Gill (GNOME Illustration Application).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://linux.omnipotent.net/article.php?article_id=12529 | title = Linux.com Interviews Lauris Kaplinski | publisher = Linux.com | date = 2001-09-24 | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Inkscape [[FAQ]] interprets the word ''Inkscape'' as a compound of ''ink'' and ''{{linktext|scape}}''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#What_does_%22Inkscape%22_mean? | title = FAQ | publisher = Inkscape Project | accessdate = 2016-02-10 | quote = What does 'Inkscape' mean? [...] The name is made up of the two English words 'ink' and 'scape'. Ink is a common substance for drawings, and is used when the sketched work is ready to be permanently committed to paper, and thus evokes the idea that Inkscape is ready for production work. A scape is a view of a large number of objects, such as a landscape or ocean-scape, and thus alludes to the object-oriented nature of vector imagery.}}</ref><ref>Compare {{linktext | -scape}}</ref>\n\nFour former Sodipodi developers (Ted Gould, Bryce Harrington, [[Nathan Hurst]], and ''MenTaLguY'') led the fork; they identified differences over project objectives, openness to third-party contributions, and technical disagreements as their reasons for forking. With Inkscape, they said they would focus development on implementing the complete SVG standard, whereas Sodipodi development emphasized developing a general-purpose vector graphics editor, possibly at the expense of SVG.<ref>{{cite web | title = Announcing new project (sodipodi mailing list) | url = http://sourceforge.net/p/sodipodi/mailman/message/10064135/ | date = 2003-11-06 | accessdate = 2015-12-09 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the fork, Inkscape's developers changed it greatly: they changed the programming language from [[C (programming language)|C]] to [[C++]]; adopted the [[GTK]] (formerly GIMP Toolkit) toolkit C++ bindings ([[gtkmm]]); redesigned its [[user interface]], and added a number of new features.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/SodiPodi#Inkscape_Sodipodi_Comparison | title = Inkscape Sodipodi Comparison | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> Notably, Inkscape's implementation of the SVG standard, although incomplete, has shown gradual improvement.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_SVG_features_does_Inkscape_implement.3F |title= Frequently asked questions - Inkscape Wiki |publisher= Wiki.inkscape.org |date= 2012-07-29 |accessdate= 2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nSince 2005, Inkscape has participated in the [[Google Summer of Code]] program.<ref>{{cite web | title = Google's Summer of Code | publisher = Inkscape wiki | url = http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Googles_Summer_Of_Code | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704225718/http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Googles_Summer_Of_Code | archivedate = 2007-07-04 }}</ref>\n\nUp until the end of November 2007, Inkscape's [[source code repository]] was hosted by [[SourceForge]]. Thereafter it moved to [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Inkscape moving to Launchpad\n | url   = http://blog.launchpad.net/general/inkscape-moving-to-launchpad}}</ref> In June 2017, it moved to [[GitLab]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Inkscape moves to GitLab\n | url   = https://inkscape.org/en/news/2017/06/10/inkscape-moves-gitlab/}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Object creation===\n[[File:Inkscape 0.48.2 with librsvg workarounds.svg|thumb|right|Inkscape 0.48.2, showing a rectangle (selected with the select tool), an ellipse, a star and two text objects]]\n\nInkscape workflow is based around vector objects. Included tools allow manipulating primitive vector shapes\u2014e.g. rectangles, ellipses and arcs\u2014and more complex objects, like 3D boxes with adjustable perspectives, stars, polygons and spirals. Inkscape also has rendering feature that can create objects like [[Barcode|barcodes]], calendars, grids, [[Gear|gears]] or [[Roulette (curve)|roulette curves]] (using [[spirograph]] tool). These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear [[Color gradient|color gradients]] and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. All of those can be further edited by transformations\u2014such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing\u2014or by editing paths.\n\nOther tools allow creating [[Composite B\u00e9zier curve|B\u00e9zier curves]], freehand drawing of lines (pencil), or calligraphic (brush-like) strokes which support a [[graphics tablet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/calligraphy/tutorial-calligraphy.html|title=Inkscape tutorial: Calligraphy|last=|first=|date=|website=inkscape.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>\n\nInkscape is able to write and edit text with tools available for changing font, spacing, kerning, rotation, flowing along the path or into a shape. Text can be converted to paths for further editing. The program also has a layers (as well as an objects) feature that allows the user to organize objects in a preferred stacking order in the canvas. Objects can be made visible/invisible and locked/unlocked through these features.\n\nSymbol libraries enable Inkscape to use existing symbols like [[Logic gate#Symbols|logic-gate symbols]] or [[DOT pictograms]]. Additional libraries can be included by user.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/SymbolsDialog|title=SymbolsDialog - Inkscape Wiki|website=wiki.inkscape.org|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nInkscape supports [[image tracing]], the process of extracting vector graphics from raster sources.\n\nClones are child objects of an original parent object. Different transformations can be applied to them, such as: size, position, rotation, blur, [[Alpha channel|opacity]], color and symmetry. Clones are updated live whenever the parent object changes.\n\n===Object manipulation===\nEvery object in the drawing can be subjected to arbitrary [[affine transformation]]s: moving, rotating, scaling, skewing and a configurable matrix{{Clarify|reason=matrix is not transformation. [[Affine transformation matrix]] is a thing. Does Inkscape support it?|date=December 2019}}. Transformation parameters can be specified numerically. Transformations can snap to angles, grids, guidelines and nodes of other objects, or be aligned in specified direction, spaced equally, scattered at random.\n\nObjects can be grouped together. Groups of objects behave similarly to objects. Objects in a group can be edited without having to ungroup them first.\n\nThe [[Z-order]] determines the order in which objects are drawn on the canvas. Objects with a high Z-order are drawn on top of objects lower in the Z-order. Order of objects can be managed either using layers, or by manually moving the object up and down in the Z-order. Layers can be locked or hidden, preventing modifying and accidental selection.\n\n''Create Tiled Clones'' tool allows to create symmetrical or grid-like drawings using various [[wallpaper group|plane symmetries]].\n\nAppearance of objects can be further changed by using [[image mask|masks]] and [[clipping path]]s, which can be created from arbitrary objects, including groups.\n\nThe style attributes are 'attached' to the source object, so after cutting/copying an object onto the clipboard, the style's attributes can be pasted to another object.\n\n===Operations on paths===\n{{Prose|date=January 2020|section}}{{Overly detailed|section|details=|date=January 2020}}\nInkscape has a comprehensive tool set to edit paths (as they are the basic element of a vector file):\n* ''Edit Path by Node tool'': allows for the editing of single or multiple paths and or their associated node(s). There are four types of path nodes; Cusp (corner), Smooth, Symmetric and Auto-Smooth. Editing is available for the positioning of nodes and their associated handles (angle and length) for Linear and [[Bezier curve|B\u00e9zier]] paths or [[Euler spiral|Spiro curves]]. A path segment can also be adjusted by dragging (left click + hold). When multiple nodes are selected, they can be moved, scaled and rotated using [[keyboard shortcut]] or mouse controls.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inkscape Keyboard Layout|url=https://openclipart.org/detail/188861/inkscape-keyboard-layout-v0484|website=openclipart.org|publisher=creative commons|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> Additional nodes can be inserted into paths at arbitrary or even placements, and an effect can be used to insert nodes at predefined intervals. When nodes are deleted, the handles on remaining ones are adjusted to preserve the original shape as closely as possible.\n* ''Tweak tool (sculpting/painting)'': provides whole object(s) or node editing regions (parts) of an object. It can push, repel/attract, randomize positioning, shrink/enlarge, rotate, copy/delete selected whole objects. With parts of a path you can push, shrink/enlarge, repel/attract, roughen edges, blur and color. Nodes are dynamically created and deleted when needed while using this tool, so it can also be used on simple paths without pre-processing.\n* ''Path-Offsets; Outset, Inset, Linked or Dynamic'': can create a Linked or Dynamic (unlinked) Inset and or an Outset of an existing path which can then be fine tuned using the given Shape or Node tool. Creating a Linked Offset of a path will update whenever the original is modified. Making symmetrical (i.e., picture frame) graphics easier to edit.\n* ''Path-Conversion; Object to Path'': conversions of Objects; Shapes (square, circle, etc.) or Text into paths.\n* ''Path-Conversion; Stroke to Path'': conversions of the Stroke of a shape to a path.\n* ''Path-Simplify'': a given path's node count will reduce while preserving the shape.\n* ''Path-Operations'' ([[Boolean algebra|boolean operations]]): use of multiple objects to Union, Difference, Intersection, Exclusion, Division and Cut Path.\n\nInkscape includes a feature called ''Live Path Effects'' (LPE), which can apply various modifiers to a path. Envelope Deformation is available via the Path Effects and provides a perspective effect. There are more than a dozen of these live path effects. LPE can be stacked onto a single object and have interactive live on canvas and menu-based editing of the effects.\n\n===File formats===\n{{Update|type=section|date=January 2020|reason=Inkscape supports more formats}}\nInkscape's primary format is [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG) version 1.1, meaning that it can create and edit with the abilities and within the constraints of this format. Any other format must either be imported (converted to SVG) or exported (converted from SVG). The SVG format is using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) standard internally. Inkscape's implementation of SVG and CSS standards is incomplete. Most notably, it does not support [[Scalable Vector Graphics#Scripting and animation|animation]] natively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animation|url=https://inkscape.org/en/learn/animation/|website=Inkscape|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref> Inkscape has multilingual support, particularly for [[complex scripts]]. Formats that used the UniConvertor library are not supported in the upcoming 1.0 release. A workaround is to have a parallel installation of version 0.92.x. <ref>https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Release_notes/1.0#Dropped_Extensions</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Inkscape file format support\n!

(2Geom is a computational geometry library, originally developed for Inkscape. While developed for Inkscape it is a library that can be used from any application. It provides support for basic geometric algebra, paths, distortions, boolean operations, plotting implicit functions, non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and more. 2Geom is free software released under LGPL 2.1 or MPL 1.1.)<ref>https://github.com/inkscape/lib2geom</ref><ref>https://inkscape.org/news/2018/11/11/graphics-math-library-2geoms-first-release-availab/</ref>\n\n==Interface and usability==\n{{Cleanup-PR|section|date=January 2020}}\nOne of the main priorities of the Inkscape project is interface consistency and [[usability]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#How_did_Inkscape_start? | title = Inkscape FAQ, How did Inkscape start? | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref> This includes efforts to follow the [[GNOME]] [[human interface guidelines]], universal keyboard accessibility, and convenient on-canvas editing. Inkscape has achieved significant progress in usability since the project started.\n\nThe number of floating dialog boxes has been reduced, with their functions available using keyboard shortcuts or in the docked toolbars in the editing window. The tool bar controls at the top of the window always display the controls relevant to the current tool.\n\nAll vector transformations, scale, rotation and positioning (minus skewing) have keyboard shortcuts with consistent modifiers (<kbd>Alt</kbd> transforms by 1 screen pixel at the current zoom, <kbd>Shift</kbd> multiplies the transformation by 10, etc.). These keys work on nodes in Node tool as well as on objects in the Selector Tool. The most common operations (such as transformations, zooming, z-order) have convenient one-key shortcuts.\n\nInkscape provides ''mouse over'' tooltips and ''status bar'' hints for all buttons, controls, commands, keys, and on-canvas handles. The status bar hint messages are dynamic: A given object can display up to four hints while editing it with just one tool. The hints update based on two items \u2013 the tool being used, and the type of object/node/handle being edited\u2014text, shapes, paths, node types, etc. It comes with a complete keyboard and mouse reference (in HTML and SVG)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/doc/keys091.html | title = Inkscape keyboard and mouse reference | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref> and several interactive tutorials in SVG.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/tutorials/ | title = Inkscape tutorials web page | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref>\n\nThe interface of [[Sodipodi]] (Inkscape's predecessor) was based on those of [[CorelDRAW]] and [[GIMP]].

This software can be used to create or edit [[vector graphics]] such as illustrations, diagrams, line arts, charts, logos, icons and complex paintings. Inkscape's primary vector graphics format is [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG); however, many other formats can be imported and exported.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://inkscape.org/about/features/|title = Inkscape Features |accessdate = 13 January 2020|website = Inkscape.org }}</ref>\n\nInkscape can [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] primitive vector shapes (e.g. rectangles, ellipses, polygons, arcs, spirals, stars and 3D boxes) and text. These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear [[color gradient]]s and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. Embedding and optional [[image tracing|tracing]] of [[raster graphics]] is also supported, enabling the editor to create vector graphics from photos and other raster sources. Created shapes can be further manipulated with transformations, such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing.\n\n==History==\nInkscape began in 2003 as a [[code fork]] of the [[Sodipodi]] project.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#how-did-inkscape-start | title = FAQ | publisher = Inkscape Project | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> Sodipodi, developed since 1999, was itself based on [[Raph Levien]]'s Gill (GNOME Illustration Application).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://linux.omnipotent.net/article.php?article_id=12529 | title = Linux.com Interviews Lauris Kaplinski | publisher = Linux.com | date = 2001-09-24 | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref>\n\nThe Inkscape [[FAQ]] interprets the word ''Inkscape'' as a compound of ''ink'' and ''{{linktext|scape}}''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#What_does_%22Inkscape%22_mean? | title = FAQ | publisher = Inkscape Project | accessdate = 2016-02-10 | quote = What does 'Inkscape' mean? [...] The name is made up of the two English words 'ink' and 'scape'. Ink is a common substance for drawings, and is used when the sketched work is ready to be permanently committed to paper, and thus evokes the idea that Inkscape is ready for production work. A scape is a view of a large number of objects, such as a landscape or ocean-scape, and thus alludes to the object-oriented nature of vector imagery.}}</ref><ref>Compare {{linktext | -scape}}</ref>\n\nFour former Sodipodi developers (Ted Gould, Bryce Harrington, [[Nathan Hurst]], and ''MenTaLguY'') led the fork; they identified differences over project objectives, openness to third-party contributions, and technical disagreements as their reasons for forking. With Inkscape, they said they would focus development on implementing the complete SVG standard, whereas Sodipodi development emphasized developing a general-purpose vector graphics editor, possibly at the expense of SVG.<ref>{{cite web | title = Announcing new project (sodipodi mailing list) | url = http://sourceforge.net/p/sodipodi/mailman/message/10064135/ | date = 2003-11-06 | accessdate = 2015-12-09 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the fork, Inkscape's developers changed it greatly: they changed the programming language from [[C (programming language)|C]] to [[C++]]; adopted the [[GTK+]] (formerly GIMP Toolkit) toolkit C++ bindings ([[gtkmm]]); redesigned its [[user interface]], and added a number of new features.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/SodiPodi#Inkscape_Sodipodi_Comparison | title = Inkscape Sodipodi Comparison | accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> Notably, Inkscape's implementation of the SVG standard, although incomplete, has shown gradual improvement.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_SVG_features_does_Inkscape_implement.3F |title= Frequently asked questions - Inkscape Wiki |publisher= Wiki.inkscape.org |date= 2012-07-29 |accessdate= 2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nSince 2005, Inkscape has participated in the [[Google Summer of Code]] program.<ref>{{cite web | title = Google's Summer of Code | publisher = Inkscape wiki | url = http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Googles_Summer_Of_Code | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704225718/http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Googles_Summer_Of_Code | archivedate = 2007-07-04 }}</ref>\n\nUp until the end of November 2007, Inkscape's [[source code repository]] was hosted by [[SourceForge]]. Thereafter it moved to [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Inkscape moving to Launchpad\n | url   = http://blog.launchpad.net/general/inkscape-moving-to-launchpad}}</ref> In June 2017, it moved to [[GitLab]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Inkscape moves to GitLab\n | url   = https://inkscape.org/en/news/2017/06/10/inkscape-moves-gitlab/}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Object creation===\n[[File:Inkscape 0.48.2 with librsvg workarounds.svg|thumb|right|Inkscape 0.48.2, showing a rectangle (selected with the select tool), an ellipse, a star and two text objects]]\n\nInkscape workflow is based around vector objects. Included tools allow manipulating primitive vector shapes\u2014e.g. rectangles, ellipses and arcs\u2014and more complex objects, like 3D boxes with adjustable perspectives, stars, polygons and spirals. Inkscape also has rendering feature that can create objects like [[Barcode|barcodes]], calendars, grids, [[Gear|gears]] or [[Roulette (curve)|roulette curves]] (using [[spirograph]] tool). These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear [[Color gradient|color gradients]] and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. All of those can be further edited by transformations\u2014such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing\u2014or by editing paths.\n\nOther tools allow creating [[Composite B\u00e9zier curve|B\u00e9zier curves]], freehand drawing of lines (pencil), or calligraphic (brush-like) strokes which support a [[graphics tablet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/calligraphy/tutorial-calligraphy.html|title=Inkscape tutorial: Calligraphy|last=|first=|date=|website=inkscape.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>\n\nInkscape is able to write and edit text with tools available for changing font, spacing, kerning, rotation, flowing along the path or into a shape. Text can be converted to paths for further editing. The program also has a layers (as well as an objects) feature that allows the user to organize objects in a preferred stacking order in the canvas. Objects can be made visible/invisible and locked/unlocked through these features.\n\nSymbol libraries enable Inkscape to use existing symbols like [[Logic gate#Symbols|logic-gate symbols]] or [[DOT pictograms]]. Additional libraries can be included by user.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/SymbolsDialog|title=SymbolsDialog - Inkscape Wiki|website=wiki.inkscape.org|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nInkscape supports [[image tracing]], the process of extracting vector graphics from raster sources.\n\nClones are child objects of an original parent object. Different transformations can be applied to them, such as: size, position, rotation, blur, [[Alpha channel|opacity]], color and symmetry. Clones are updated live whenever the parent object changes.\n\n===Object manipulation===\nEvery object in the drawing can be subjected to arbitrary [[affine transformation]]s: moving, rotating, scaling, skewing and a configurable matrix{{Clarify|reason=matrix is not transformation. [[Affine transformation matrix]] is a thing. Does Inkscape support it?|date=December 2019}}. Transformation parameters can be specified numerically. Transformations can snap to angles, grids, guidelines and nodes of other objects, or be aligned in specified direction, spaced equally, scattered at random.\n\nObjects can be grouped together. Groups of objects behave similarly to objects. Objects in a group can be edited without having to ungroup them first.\n\nThe [[Z-order]] determines the order in which objects are drawn on the canvas. Objects with a high Z-order are drawn on top of objects lower in the Z-order. Order of objects can be managed either using layers, or by manually moving the object up and down in the Z-order. Layers can be locked or hidden, preventing modifying and accidental selection.\n\n''Create Tiled Clones'' tool allows to create symmetrical or grid-like drawings using various [[wallpaper group|plane symmetries]].\n\nAppearance of objects can be further changed by using [[image mask|masks]] and [[clipping path]]s, which can be created from arbitrary objects, including groups.\n\nThe style attributes are 'attached' to the source object, so after cutting/copying an object onto the clipboard, the style's attributes can be pasted to another object.\n\n===Operations on paths===\n{{Prose|date=January 2020|section}}{{Overly detailed|section|details=|date=January 2020}}\nInkscape has a comprehensive tool set to edit paths (as they are the basic element of a vector file):\n* ''Edit Path by Node tool'': allows for the editing of single or multiple paths and or their associated node(s). There are four types of path nodes; Cusp (corner), Smooth, Symmetric and Auto-Smooth. Editing is available for the positioning of nodes and their associated handles (angle and length) for Linear and [[Bezier curve|B\u00e9zier]] paths or [[Euler spiral|Spiro curves]]. A path segment can also be adjusted by dragging (left click + hold). When multiple nodes are selected, they can be moved, scaled and rotated using [[keyboard shortcut]] or mouse controls.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inkscape Keyboard Layout|url=https://openclipart.org/detail/188861/inkscape-keyboard-layout-v0484|website=openclipart.org|publisher=creative commons|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref> Additional nodes can be inserted into paths at arbitrary or even placements, and an effect can be used to insert nodes at predefined intervals. When nodes are deleted, the handles on remaining ones are adjusted to preserve the original shape as closely as possible.\n* ''Tweak tool (sculpting/painting)'': provides whole object(s) or node editing regions (parts) of an object. It can push, repel/attract, randomize positioning, shrink/enlarge, rotate, copy/delete selected whole objects. With parts of a path you can push, shrink/enlarge, repel/attract, roughen edges, blur and color. Nodes are dynamically created and deleted when needed while using this tool, so it can also be used on simple paths without pre-processing.\n* ''Path-Offsets; Outset, Inset, Linked or Dynamic'': can create a Linked or Dynamic (unlinked) Inset and or an Outset of an existing path which can then be fine tuned using the given Shape or Node tool. Creating a Linked Offset of a path will update whenever the original is modified. Making symmetrical (i.e., picture frame) graphics easier to edit.\n* ''Path-Conversion; Object to Path'': conversions of Objects; Shapes (square, circle, etc.) or Text into paths.\n* ''Path-Conversion; Stroke to Path'': conversions of the Stroke of a shape to a path.\n* ''Path-Simplify'': a given path's node count will reduce while preserving the shape.\n* ''Path-Operations'' ([[Boolean algebra|boolean operations]]): use of multiple objects to Union, Difference, Intersection, Exclusion, Division and Cut Path.\n\nInkscape includes a feature called ''Live Path Effects'' (LPE), which can apply various modifiers to a path. Envelope Deformation is available via the Path Effects and provides a perspective effect. There are more than a dozen of these live path effects. LPE can be stacked onto a single object and have interactive live on canvas and menu-based editing of the effects.\n\n===File formats===\n{{Update|type=section|date=January 2020|reason=Inkscape supports more formats}}\nInkscape's primary format is [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG) version 1.1, meaning that it can create and edit with the abilities and within the constraints of this format. Any other format must either be imported (converted to SVG) or exported (converted from SVG). The SVG format is using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) standard internally. Inkscape's implementation of SVG and CSS standards is incomplete. Most notably, it does not support [[Scalable Vector Graphics#Scripting and animation|animation]] natively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animation|url=https://inkscape.org/en/learn/animation/|website=Inkscape|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref> Inkscape has multilingual support, particularly for [[complex scripts]]. Formats that used the UniConvertor library are not supported in the upcoming 1.0 release. A workaround is to have a parallel installation of version 0.92.x. <ref>https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Release_notes/1.0#Dropped_Extensions</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Inkscape file format support\n!

(2Geom is a computational geometry library, originally developed for Inkscape. While developed for Inkscape it is a library that can be used from any application. It provides support for basic geometric algebra, paths, distortions, boolean operations, plotting implicit functions, non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and more. 2Geom is free software released under LGPL 2.1 or MPL 1.1.)<ref>https://github.com/inkscape/lib2geom</ref><ref>https://inkscape.org/news/2018/11/11/graphics-math-library-2geoms-first-release-availab/</ref>\n\n==Interface and usability==\n{{Cleanup-PR|section|date=January 2020}}\nOne of the main priorities of the Inkscape project is interface consistency and [[usability]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inkscape.org/en/learn/faq/#How_did_Inkscape_start? | title = Inkscape FAQ, How did Inkscape start? | publisher = Inkscape Project | date = | accessdate = 2015-08-16}}</ref> This includes efforts to follow the [[GNOME]] [[human interface guidelines]], universal keyboard accessibility, and convenient on-canvas editing. Inkscape has achieved significant progress in usability since the project started.\n\nThe number of floating dialog boxes has been reduced, with their functions available using keyboard shortcuts or in the docked toolbars in the editing window. The tool bar controls at the top of the window always display the controls relevant to the current tool.\n\nAll vector transformations, scale, rotation and positioning (minus skewing) have keyboard shortcuts with consistent modifiers (<kbd>Alt</kbd> transforms by 1 screen pixel at the current zoom, <kbd>Shift</kbd> multiplies the transformation by 10, etc.). These keys work on nodes in Node tool as well as on objects in the Selector Tool. The most common operations (such as transformations, zooming, z-order) have convenient one-key shortcuts.\n\nInkscape provides ''mouse over'' tooltips and ''status bar'' hints for all buttons, controls, commands, keys, and on-canvas handles.

Dunlap]] of [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], who also designed the [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]] courthouse.  It was constructed by A. E. Kemmer at a cost of about $250,000 from 1916 to 1917.  The exterior is understated, but the interior is surprisingly elaborate, including a stained glass dome over a mosaic tile floor.\n\nThis building is the county's third courthouse.  The first was built in 1831\u20131838.  It was replaced by a brick structure in 1856; this building was designed by M. J. McBird of [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]] and had a tower at each corner, including a clock tower.  The 730-pound bell from the first courthouse was made in Cincinnati in 1836 and given by Sheriff Samuel Davis Gresham, and was used in the second courthouse until 1916.  While the bell was in transit to [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] by boat, the boat sank; the bell was later recovered from the [[Ohio River]].

The exterior is understated, but the interior is surprisingly elaborate, including a stained glass dome over a mosaic tile floor.\n\nThis building is the county's third courthouse.  The first was built in 1831\u20131838.  It was replaced by a brick structure in 1856; this building was designed by M. J. McBird of [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]] and had a tower at each corner, including a clock tower.  The 730-pound bell from the first courthouse was made in Cincinnati in 1836 and given by Sheriff Samuel Davis Gresham, and was used in the second courthouse until 1916.  While the bell was in transit to [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] by boat, the boat sank; the bell was later recovered from the [[Ohio River]].

Composed in 1968\u201369 for [[orchestra]] and eight [[electronic amplifier|amplified]] [[Singing|voices]], it is a musically innovative post-serial classical work, with multiple vocalists commenting about musical (and other) topics as the piece twists and turns through a seemingly neurotic journey of [[Musical quotation|quotations]] and dissonant passages. The eight voices are not used in a traditional classical way; they frequently do not sing at all, but speak, whisper and shout words by [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], whose ''[[The Raw and the Cooked|Le cru et le cuit]]'' provides much of the text, excerpts from [[Samuel Beckett]]'s novel ''[[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'', instructions from the scores of [[Gustav Mahler]] and other writings.\n\n[[Leonard Bernstein]] states in the text version of his [[Charles Eliot Norton lectures]] from 1973 that ''Sinfonia'' was representative of the new direction classical music was taking after the pessimistic decade of the sixties {{Harv |Bernstein|1976| p=423}}.\n\n==Premieres==\nOriginally commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]] for its 125th anniversary, ''Sinfonia'' was premiered on October 10, 1968 by the orchestra and [[The Swingle Singers]], with Berio conducting. At the time, the work was still in four movements. In the months after the premiere Berio added a fifth movement, which was first played when ''Sinfonia'' was performed during the 1969 [[Donaueschingen Festival]] by the [[Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Ernest Bour]], and subsequently in London at the July 22 [[The Proms|Promenade concert]], with the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] and Swingle Singers conducted by the composer {{harv|Anon.|1969}}. The New York Philharmonic first played the five movement version of ''Sinfonia'' on October 8, 1970, conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]], to whom the work is dedicated.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe ''Sinfonia'' is scored for a large orchestra {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n;Soloists:\n:8 voices\n\n;[[Woodwind]]s\n:1 [[piccolo]]\n:3 [[flutes]]\n:2 [[oboes]]\n:1 [[cor anglais]]\n:1 [[Clarinet in E-flat|clarinet in E{{Music|flat}}]]\n:3 [[soprano clarinet|soprano clarinets]] in B{{Music|flat}}\n:1 [[alto saxophone]]\n:1 [[tenor saxophone]]\n:2 [[bassoons]]\n:1 [[contrabassoon]]\n\n;[[Brass instrument|Brass]]\n:4 [[French horn|horns]]\n:4 [[trumpets]] in C\n:3 [[trombones]]\n:1 [[bass tuba]]\n{{col-2}}\n;[[Percussion]]\n:3 players:\n#[[timpani]], [[glockenspiel]], [[tam-tam]] (large), [[snare drum]], [[bongos]]\n#[[marimba]], tam-tam (medium), [[sizzle cymbal]], [[bass drum]], snare drum, [[tambourine]], 3 [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood blocks]], [[Clapper (musical instrument)|whip]], [[g\u00fciro]], [[sleigh bell]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]\n#[[vibraphone]], tam-tam (small), [[cymbal]], bass drum, snare drum, bongos, tambourine, [[castanets]], g\u00fciro, sleigh bells, 2 triangles\n;[[Keyboard instrument|Keyboard]]\n:1 [[electric harpsichord]]\n:1 [[piano]]\n:1 [[electric organ]]\n\n;[[String instrument|Strings]]\n:1 [[harp]]\n\n:24 [[violins]] in three groups\n:8 [[violas]]\n:8 [[celli]]\n:8 [[double basses]]\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Movements==\nThe work is in five movements:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|[untitled]\n|O King\n|In ruhig fliessender Bewegung\n|[untitled]\n|[untitled]\n}}\n\nThe first movement primarily uses a French text source and the third movement primarily uses English text sources.  The text for the second movement is limited to the phonemes of the title, \"O Martin Luther King.\"  The remaining movements are primarily instrumental with occasional vocal elements.  The overall form of the piece is an arch form with elements of the first movement reflected in the fifth and connections between the second and fourth.  The third movement, a study of inter-relations, stands on its own.\n===First movement===\nIn the first movement of ''Sinfonia'', Berio uses texts from ''[[The Raw and the Cooked|Le cru et le cuit]]'' (''The Raw and the Cooked'') by the French anthropologist [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]. The form of the piece is also inspired by L\u00e9vi-Strauss, who in his work on [[mythology]] had found that many myths were structured like musical compositions, with some myths having a \"[[fugue|fugal]]\" form and others resembling a [[Sonata form|sonata]]. One mythical transformation however, had a structure for which he was not able to find a musical equivalent {{Harv |L\u00e9vi-Strauss|Eribon|1991| p=177}}, and Berio himself said that he used this form in his ''Sinfonia''\u2014though L\u00e9vi-Strauss did not initially notice this. Interviewed by Didier Eribon, L\u00e9vi-Strauss said:\n\n:[Y]ou know that Berio used ''The Raw and the Cooked'' in his ''Sinfonia''. A part of the text is recited, accompanied by the music. I admit that I did not grasp the reason for this choice. During an interview a musicologist asked me about it, and I answered that the book had just come out and the composer had probably used it because it was at hand. Now, a few months ago Berio, whom I don't know, sent me a very disgruntled letter. He had read the interview, several years after the fact, and assured me that the movement of this symphony offered the musical counterpart of the mythical transformation I was revealing. He included a book by a musicologist {{Harv |Osmond-Smith|1985}} who had demonstrated the fact. I apologized for the misunderstanding, which was, I said, the result of my lack of musical training, but I'm still baffled. {{Harv |L\u00e9vi-Strauss|Eribon|1991| p=178}}\n\n===Second movement: O King===\nIn 1968, Berio completed ''[[O King (Berio)|O King]]'', a work dedicated to the memory of [[Martin Luther King]] {{harv|Berio|1986}}. This movement exists in two versions: one for voice, [[flute]], [[clarinet]], [[violin]], [[cello]] and [[piano]], the other for eight voices and [[orchestra]]. The orchestral version of ''O King'' was, shortly after its completion, integrated into ''Sinfonia''. It uses a fair amount of whole tone scale motives (which also appears in the quote from ''[[Le Sacre du Printemps]]'' in the third movement).\n\n===Third movement===\nIn the third movement of ''Sinfonia'' Berio lays the groundwork by quoting multiple excerpts from the third movement scherzo from Mahler's [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 2]] and has the orchestra play a slightly cut-up, re-shuffled and occasionally re-orchestrated version of it. Many have described Berio's third movement as a \"musical collage\", in essence using an \"Ivesian\" approach to the entire movement (American composer [[Charles Ives]] in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Ives)|Symphony No. 2]] first used musical quotation techniques on a grand scale at the turn of the 20th century about 65 years earlier).\n\nThe orchestra plays snatches of [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[La Valse]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', as well as quotations from [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and many others (including Berio himself) creating a dense [[collage]], occasionally to humorous effect. When one of the reciters says \"I have a present for you\", the orchestra follows immediately with the introductory chord from ''Don'', the first movement from ''[[Pli selon pli]]'' by [[Pierre Boulez]].\n\nThe quoted fragments are often chosen because they bear a rhythmic or melodic likeness to Mahler's scherzo. For example, Berio uses a violin line from the second movement of [[Alban Berg]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|violin concerto]] with chromatically descending sixteenth notes two measures before a similarly descending line appears in Mahler's scherzo. This is then accompanied by another violin descent, taken from [[Johannes Brahms]]' [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|violin concerto]] {{Harv |Schwartz|Godfrey|1993| p=378}}. The text from Beckett at this point begins, \"So after a period of immaculate silence there seemed\", but, instead of continuing the quotation (\"a feeble cry was heard by me\"), Berio substitutes the words \"to be a violin concerto being played in the other room in three quarters\" and then, after the Berg quotation, alto 2 insists on \"two violin concertos\", at the point where Berg is interrupted by Brahms {{harv|Hicks|1980\u201381|p=214}}.\n\nThe eight individual voices simultaneously recite texts from various sources, most notably the first page of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]. Other text fragments include references to [[James Joyce]], [[graffiti]] Berio noticed during the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] protests in Paris, notes from Berio's diary {{Harv |Schwartz|Godfrey|1993| p=376}}, and stage direction by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky|Mayakovsky]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}<!--Not verified by Schwartz and Godfrey.-->\n\nBerio himself describes the movement as a \"Voyage to [[Kythira|Cythera]]\" {{Harv |Berio|Dalmonte|Varga|1985| p=108}} in which a ship filled with gifts is headed towards the island dedicated to the goddess of love.\n\n====Musical quotations====\nA partial list of [[musical quotation]]s used in the third movement of ''Sinfonia'' in order of their appearance:\n*[[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Five Pieces for Orchestra]]'', fourth movement, \"Peripetie\" (violent scale from bars 2\u20133 played by the brass), in bars 1\u20136\n* A brief quotation from the beginning of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 4]] in bars 2\u201310\n* [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'', second movement, \"Jeux de vagues\" (opening measures), in bars 4\u20135\n*[[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 2 (Resurrection)]]'', third movement (the only quotation that is ongoing) entering in bar 7, from where it continues to the end of the movement, though not always audibly {{harv|Hicks|1980\u201381|p=212}}\n*[[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''[[Kammermusik (Hindemith)|Kammermusik No. 4]]''\n*[[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9]]'', flute solo from the Pantomime\n*Debussy's \"Jeux de vagues\" returns\n*[[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''id\u00e9e fixe'' from the ''[[Symphonie Fantastique]]'' (played by the flutes and oboes), in bar 106\n*[[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[La Valse]]'' (orchestra plays octave motif with [[piccolo]] playing a chromatic scale)\n*[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring|Le Sacre du Printemps]]'' (the \"Dance of the Earth\" sequence at the end of the first tableau), bars 170\u201385\n*Stravinsky's ''[[Agon (Stravinsky)|Agon]]'' (upper [[oboe]] part from the \"Double pas de quatre\" as well the castanet part from the \u201cBransle Gai\u201d)\n*[[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (one of the waltzes composed for the opera)\n*another extract from Ravel's ''La Valse''\n*a [[chorale]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]\n*the end of the second movement of Bach's First  Brandenburg Concerto\n*[[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (the drowning scene late in the third act)\n*[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral]]'' Symphony, second movement (melody stated with the clarinets)\n*Resumption of Hindemith's ''Kammermusik No. 4'' in the solo violin, starting in bar 429\n*Another quotation from Beethoven's ''Pastoral'' Symphony, ending in bar 448\n*Brief recapitulation of the opening of the movement: Schoenberg's \"Peripetie\", Debussy's ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'' (this time from the third movement \"Dialogue du vent et de la mer\"), starting at bar 488\n*[[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]]'s ''[[Pli Selon Pli]]'', very first chord of the entire piece from the first movement (\"Don\")\n*[[Anton Webern]]'s Cantata No. 2, Op. 31, fifth movement (opening), in bars 547\u201354\n*[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Gruppen (Stockhausen)|Gruppen]]'' for three orchestras (during the introductions of the vocalists near the end, bars 555\u201360)\n\n<!-- It's worth noting that more than a few of the quoted pieces were performed from time to time in the CBS TV series [[Young People's Concerts]].

Composed in 1968\u201369 for [[orchestra]] and eight [[electronic amplifier|amplified]] [[Singing|voices]], it is a musically innovative post-serial classical work, with multiple vocalists commenting about musical (and other) topics as the piece twists and turns through a seemingly neurotic journey of [[Musical quotation|quotations]] and dissonant passages. The eight voices are not used in a traditional classical way; they frequently do not sing at all, but speak, whisper and shout words by [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], whose ''[[The Raw and the Cooked|Le cru et le cuit]]'' provides much of the text, excerpts from [[Samuel Beckett]]'s novel ''[[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'', instructions from the scores of [[Gustav Mahler]] and other writings.\n\n[[Leonard Bernstein]] states in the text version of his [[Charles Eliot Norton lectures]] from 1973 that ''Sinfonia'' was representative of the new direction classical music was taking after the pessimistic decade of the sixties {{Harv |Bernstein|1976| p=423}}.\n\n==Premieres==\nOriginally commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]] for its 125th anniversary, ''Sinfonia'' was premiered on October 10, 1968 by the orchestra and [[The Swingle Singers]], with Berio conducting. At the time, the work was still in four movements. In the months after the premiere Berio added a fifth movement, which was first played when ''Sinfonia'' was performed during the 1969 [[Donaueschingen Festival]] by the [[Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Ernest Bour]], and subsequently in London at the July 22 [[The Proms|Promenade concert]], with the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] and Swingle Singers conducted by the composer {{harv|Anon.|1969}}. The New York Philharmonic first played the five movement version of ''Sinfonia'' on October 8, 1970, conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]], to whom the work is dedicated.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe ''Sinfonia'' is scored for a large orchestra {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n;Soloists:\n:8 voices\n\n;[[Woodwind]]s\n:1 [[piccolo]]\n:3 [[flutes]]\n:2 [[oboes]]\n:1 [[cor anglais]]\n:1 [[Clarinet in E-flat|clarinet in E{{Music|flat}}]]\n:3 [[soprano clarinet|soprano clarinets]] in B{{Music|flat}}\n:1 [[alto saxophone]]\n:1 [[tenor saxophone]]\n:2 [[bassoons]]\n:1 [[contrabassoon]]\n\n;[[Brass instrument|Brass]]\n:4 [[French horn|horns]]\n:4 [[trumpets]] in C\n:3 [[trombones]]\n:1 [[bass tuba]]\n{{col-2}}\n;[[Percussion]]\n:3 players:\n#[[timpani]], [[glockenspiel]], [[tam-tam]] (large), [[snare drum]], [[bongos]]\n#[[marimba]], tam-tam (medium), [[sizzle cymbal]], [[bass drum]], snare drum, [[tambourine]], 3 [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood blocks]], [[Clapper (musical instrument)|whip]], [[g\u00fciro]], [[sleigh bell]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]\n#[[vibraphone]], tam-tam (small), [[cymbal]], bass drum, snare drum, bongos, tambourine, [[castanets]], g\u00fciro, sleigh bells, 2 triangles\n;[[Keyboard instrument|Keyboard]]\n:1 [[electric harpsichord]]\n:1 [[piano]]\n:1 [[electric organ]]\n\n;[[String instrument|Strings]]\n:1 [[harp]]\n\n:24 [[violins]] in three groups\n:8 [[violas]]\n:8 [[celli]]\n:8 [[double basses]]\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Movements==\nThe work is in five movements:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|[untitled]\n|O King\n|In ruhig fliessender Bewegung\n|[untitled]\n|[untitled]\n}}\n\nThe first movement primarily uses a French text source and the third movement primarily uses English text sources.  The text for the second movement is limited to the phonemes of the title, \"O Martin Luther King.\"  The remaining movements are primarily instrumental with occasional vocal elements.  The overall form of the piece is an arch form with elements of the first movement reflected in the fifth and connections between the second and fourth.  The third movement, a study of inter-relations, stands on its own.\n===First movement===\nIn the first movement of ''Sinfonia'', Berio uses texts from ''[[The Raw and the Cooked|Le cru et le cuit]]'' (''The Raw and the Cooked'') by the French anthropologist [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]. The form of the piece is also inspired by L\u00e9vi-Strauss, who in his work on [[mythology]] had found that many myths were structured like musical compositions, with some myths having a \"[[fugue|fugal]]\" form and others resembling a [[Sonata form|sonata]]. One mythical transformation however, had a structure for which he was not able to find a musical equivalent {{Harv |L\u00e9vi-Strauss|Eribon|1991| p=177}}, and Berio himself said that he used this form in his ''Sinfonia''\u2014though L\u00e9vi-Strauss did not initially notice this. Interviewed by Didier Eribon, L\u00e9vi-Strauss said:\n\n:[Y]ou know that Berio used ''The Raw and the Cooked'' in his ''Sinfonia''. A part of the text is recited, accompanied by the music. I admit that I did not grasp the reason for this choice. During an interview a musicologist asked me about it, and I answered that the book had just come out and the composer had probably used it because it was at hand. Now, a few months ago Berio, whom I don't know, sent me a very disgruntled letter. He had read the interview, several years after the fact, and assured me that the movement of this symphony offered the musical counterpart of the mythical transformation I was revealing. He included a book by a musicologist {{Harv |Osmond-Smith|1985}} who had demonstrated the fact. I apologized for the misunderstanding, which was, I said, the result of my lack of musical training, but I'm still baffled. {{Harv |L\u00e9vi-Strauss|Eribon|1991| p=178}}\n\n===Second movement: O King===\nIn 1968, Berio completed ''[[O King (Berio)|O King]]'', a work dedicated to the memory of [[Martin Luther King]] {{harv|Berio|1986}}. This movement exists in two versions: one for voice, [[flute]], [[clarinet]], [[violin]], [[cello]] and [[piano]], the other for eight voices and [[orchestra]]. The orchestral version of ''O King'' was, shortly after its completion, integrated into ''Sinfonia''. It uses a fair amount of whole tone scale motives (which also appears in the quote from ''[[Le Sacre du Printemps]]'' in the third movement).\n\n===Third movement===\nIn the third movement of ''Sinfonia'' Berio lays the groundwork by quoting multiple excerpts from the third movement scherzo from Mahler's [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 2]] and has the orchestra play a slightly cut-up, re-shuffled and occasionally re-orchestrated version of it. Many have described Berio's third movement as a \"musical collage\", in essence using an \"Ivesian\" approach to the entire movement (American composer [[Charles Ives]] in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Ives)|Symphony No. 2]] first used musical quotation techniques on a grand scale at the turn of the 20th century about 65 years earlier).\n\nThe orchestra plays snatches of [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[La Valse]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', as well as quotations from [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and many others (including Berio himself) creating a dense [[collage]], occasionally to humorous effect. When one of the reciters says \"I have a present for you\", the orchestra follows immediately with the introductory chord from ''Don'', the first movement from ''[[Pli selon pli]]'' by [[Pierre Boulez]].\n\nThe quoted fragments are often chosen because they bear a rhythmic or melodic likeness to Mahler's scherzo. For example, Berio uses a violin line from the second movement of [[Alban Berg]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|violin concerto]] with chromatically descending sixteenth notes two measures before a similarly descending line appears in Mahler's scherzo. This is then accompanied by another violin descent, taken from [[Johannes Brahms]]' [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|violin concerto]] {{Harv |Schwartz|Godfrey|1993| p=378}}. The text from Beckett at this point begins, \"So after a period of immaculate silence there seemed\", but, instead of continuing the quotation (\"a feeble cry was heard by me\"), Berio substitutes the words \"to be a violin concerto being played in the other room in three quarters\" and then, after the Berg quotation, alto 2 insists on \"two violin concertos\", at the point where Berg is interrupted by Brahms {{harv|Hicks|1980\u201381|p=214}}.\n\nThe eight individual voices simultaneously recite texts from various sources, most notably the first page of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]].

Berio may very well have been inspired by viewing these performances as he was living in the United States at the time.

It begins again with a Mahler quotation\u2014the chorus taken from the end of the \"Resurrection\" symphony.  The voices make use of various vocal effects, including whispers, syllabic fragments, and distortions of previous textual material.\n\n===Fifth movement===\nThis movement was added by Berio a year later, intended to balance the first four. The movement revisits the text from the previous sections, organizing the material in a more orderly fashion to create what Berio calls \"narrative substance.\"\n\nIt opens with a quotation from L\u00e9vi-Strauss that is at the same time a veiled reference to Mahler's second symphony: the fifth movement of ''Sinfonia'' opens with the words \"rose de sang\" (French for \"rose of blood\"), and the fourth movement of Mahler's symphony begins with the words \"O R\u00f6schen rot!\" (German for \"O red rosebud!\") {{Harv |Berio|Dalmonte|Varga|1985| p=109}}.\n\n==Discography==\n===Four movement version===\n* New York Philharmonic, Swingle Singers, cond.

He played [[List of Law & Order: UK characters#Detective Sergeant Joseph \"Joe\" Hawkins|DS Joe Hawkins]] in the TV series ''[[Law & Order: UK]]''. He is also known for playing Nathan Carter in the [[CBBC]] TV series ''[[4 O'Clock Club]]'' from 2012 to 2015.\n\nHe also voiced a number of episodes of the popular show ''Funny Animals: Unleashed''. This show was aired via 4MUSIC.\n\n==Early life==\nDoc Brown was born Ben Bailey Smith, son of a [[Jamaica]]n immigrant, Yvonne Bailey, and an Englishman, Harvey Smith, who was 30 years his wife's senior. Raised in the [[Willesden]] area of north-west London, Smith is the younger brother of novelist and essayist [[Zadie Smith]].<ref name=\"barton\">{{cite news|last=Barton|first=Laura|title=We are family: Award-winning novelist Zadie Smith talks to up-and-coming British rapper Doc Brown, better known to her as Ben, her younger brother|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/04/poetry.popandrock|accessdate=28 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 March 2005}}</ref><ref>Duerden, Nick (6 February 2013), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/ben-bailey-smith-out-of-the-shadow-into-the-limelight-8482205.html \"Ben Bailey Smith: Out of the shadow, into the limelight\"], ''The Independent''.</ref> Smith attended [[Hampstead School]] and Malorees Junior School along with his sister, and was often seen in her shadow. Upon leaving school, Smith decided to pursue a musical career as a rapper. Doc Brown is a graduate of the [[University of East Anglia]]. He abandoned his drama degree halfway through to study American history. Explaining his stage name, he has said: \"Doc Brown's been my nickname since school, after the scientist in ''[[Back to the Future]]'', because I was gangly and geeky. When I started doing rap battles in my teens, it became my hip-hop handle and it's stuck.\"<ref name=Hogan>Hogan, Michael (14 April 2013), [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/apr/14/doc-brown-standup-comedian-interview \"Doc Brown: 'I'm an accidental comedian.

Smith became a recurring battle champion at the fledgling competition \"Jump Off\" in 2003, when the now international event was housed underneath [[Yo! Sushi]] on [[Poland Street]] in London's [[Soho]], moving to the [[Swiss Centre, London|Swiss Centre]] in [[Leicester Square]]. The following year, Smith's growing reputation as a personality of the underground scene made him the host of a monthly event at his friend's record shop Deal Real on Great Marlborough Court, off [[Carnaby Street]] in the West End.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite web |url=http://www.docbrown.co.uk/about/ |title=Biography |publisher=Doc Brown website|accessdate=12 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022101057/http://www.docbrown.co.uk/about/ |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Deal Real Records===\nThe night was loosely named \"Friday Night Live\" and initially acted as a platform for aspiring young artists from the UK to perform at an open mic, hosted by Smith. In an interview from 2006, he stated he provided \"light relief mixed with an authority necessary to marshal what was always a pretty raucous night\". The night was also notable for being the venue where Smith discovered a 16-year-old [[Lowkey]], whom he promptly featured on his first break-out single \"Donnie's Lament\", and who went on to be one of the most respected political rappers in the UK and internationally.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nThe popularity of the monthly event soared and soon Deal Real was attracting hip-hop celebrities from the US, performing in the store to promote their own European tours. The first to perform were the [[Jungle Brothers]]. Others included [[Pete Rock]] and [[CL Smooth]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Gza]], the [[Black Eyed Peas]], [[Rhymefest]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Canibus]] and [[Cee Lo]], as well as a host of DJs including [[Mark Ronson]].<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nIt was in the shop that Smith met Ronson for the first time, caught in an impromptu rap battle with Chicago rapper, who Smith admitted \"beat him on his home turf\". However, Ronson recalled Smith\u2019s ability to please a crowd with both good humour and a level of self-deprecation often unusual to the Rap genre, and invited him to join a live setup that would form the basis of Ronson\u2019s second studio album ''[[Version (album)|Version]]''.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nThe first gig Smith performed with Ronson was at the Fabric nightclub in the Barbican area of east central London. The line-up consisted of Ronson on guitar, [[Daniel Merriweather]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Tawiah|Beverly Tawiah]] on vocals, former Jamiroquai bassist [[Stuart Zender]] and the Scottish brass section The Haggis Horns.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nSmith continued to tour with the band until early 2007, rapping on stage alongside [[Lily Allen]] on the [[Kaiser Chiefs]] cover \"[[Oh My God (Kaiser Chiefs song)|Oh My God]]\", providing the [[Ghostface Killah]] vocals for the song \"[[Ooh Wee (Mark Ronson song)|Ooh Wee]]\" and performing his own lyrics on the instrumental cover of Kasabian's \"LSF\".<ref name=\"About\" />\n\n===Studio releases===\nThe first breakthrough record and Smith\u2019s biggest hit to date was a track entitled \"Donnie\u2019s Lament\", better known as the \"Mad World Remix\" due to its extensive sampling of that year's Christmas number one \"[[Mad World]]\", performed by [[Gary Jules]], originally by [[Tears for Fears]].<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nIts sample led to legal issues with the label Sanctuary, who did not sanction the remix, despite Smith's appeal to them. Smith was therefore unable to recoup any money despite the popularity of his version. The song had a level of mainstream airplay unusual for UK rap at the time, being championed by Jo Wiley and [[Jonathan Ross]] among others. Some commentators have argued that the song helped raise awareness of the genre as a whole and earmarked a new wave of British rap artists. The song also provided a cameo for a 16-year-old rapper named Lowkey, who today is cited as one of the most politically influential rappers in the UK, Europe and particularly the Middle East, where his tireless campaigning for Palestinian rights among other things has been lauded by many.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nOn the back of the track's small success, Smith released three full-length offerings: ''Citizen Smith Volume One'', ''The Document'' and ''Citizen Smith Volume Two''. It was during his work with the producer Mark Ronson that he was inspired to create the album ''Another Way'', which features no samples and mostly live studio music. Having moved into stand-up, then television and film, the album is as yet unreleased and has built a cult status among fans, many of whom have dubbed ''Another Way'' \"the farewell album\".<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nIn July 2011, a short film was released to accompany the song \"Blighty\", a track from the unreleased album. The film features an interview with Smith at the end credits, in which he describes the film as an open project for young people to interpret his lyrics visually. The film was directed by photographer Kwame Lestrade and was shot with the aid of various young people as part of a lottery-funded youth project.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\n==Comedy==\nLate in 2007, a chance phonecall from former BBC Radio 1 host and comedy writer Danny Robins, for whom Smith had previously written some spoof music, led to Smith working as a script consultant on Robins' [[BBC Radio 4]] sitcom ''Rudy's Rare Records'', a vehicle for veteran UK comedian [[Lenny Henry]]. This eventually led to walk-on roles and more editing and writing work on other Radio 4 comedy shows, including ''Music Therapy'' and ''[[Look Away Now]]''.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nEncouraged by producers at the BBC, Smith attended a BBC industry gig in January 2008 at a small venue in London\u2019s [[Great Portland Street]] named The Albany, where he performed a comic song and told an anecdote regarding being the first rapper to work for Radio 4. By his own admissions in an interview from 2009, Smith claimed he \"ran out of things to say\" and called for the audience to offer words, names and places, with which he improvised a comic rap. According to Smith, the venue managers were impressed and invited him to perform a short set at a late-night variety show named ''Spank!''<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nSmith then entered a national talent competition for comedians called \"[[So You Think You're Funny?]]\" and his third ever stand-up gig was in the first round of the competition in spring 2008 at the Hobgoblin Pub in [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]], south-east London. Smith eventually made the last eight at the grand final in Edinburgh that August, an event in which by his own admission he \"froze up\", delivering what he saw as a disappointing performance.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nRegardless, the performance led to interest from bookers, and Smith began a new incarnation as a professional comedian in October 2008. Since then, he has performed at the prestigious Tartan Ribbon event at the Edinburgh Festival, debuted his own one-man show \"Unfamous\", which sold out its run at both the [[Pleasance Theatre]], Edinburgh, and London\u2019s [[Soho Theatre]]. He also gave a one-off performance of Unfamous at the Elgar rooms in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in March 2011. In April 2011, Smith was invited to take the show to the Melbourne International Festival for one month.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\n==Film and television==\nAs an actor, Smith has played roles in the acclaimed BBC series ''[[Rev. (TV series)|Rev]]'' and ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]]'', as well as [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Inbetweeners]]''. He also provided voices for the characters Budge and Koggs on the cult CBBC series ''[[Big Babies]]'', for which he also sang the theme tune. In 2013 Smith also guest starred in the [[Channel 4]] comedy-drama series ''[[Derek]]'', in which he played a young man sentenced to community service in a nursing home.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nIn film, he has played a role in Ben Miller\u2019s ''Huge'' as well as a co-starring role in the thriller ''Other Side of the Game''. Smith is also credited as a songwriter on the [[Joe Cornish]]-directed film ''[[Attack the Block]]'' (2011). The character \"Hi Hatz\" is often seen and heard playing songs he has recorded. These were written and recorded by Smith and re-voiced by the actor Jumayn Hunter.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nSmith created a 78-episode teen comedy-drama for the BBC called ''[[4 O'Clock Club]]'', on which he is also the co-writer and co-musical director.

He played [[List of Law & Order: UK characters#Detective Sergeant Joseph \"Joe\" Hawkins|DS Joe Hawkins]] in the TV series ''[[Law & Order: UK]]''. He is also known for playing Nathan Carter in the [[CBBC]] TV series ''[[4 O'Clock Club]]'' from 2012 to 2015.\n\nHe also voiced a number of episodes of the popular show ''Funny Animals: Unleashed''. This show was aired via 4MUSIC.\n\n==Early life==\nDoc Brown was born Ben Bailey Smith, son of a [[Jamaica]]n immigrant, Yvonne Bailey, and an Englishman, Harvey Smith, who was 30 years his wife's senior. Raised in the [[Willesden]] area of north-west London, Smith is the younger brother of novelist and essayist [[Zadie Smith]].<ref name=\"barton\">{{cite news|last=Barton|first=Laura|title=We are family: Award-winning novelist Zadie Smith talks to up-and-coming British rapper Doc Brown, better known to her as Ben, her younger brother|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/04/poetry.popandrock|accessdate=28 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 March 2005}}</ref><ref>Duerden, Nick (6 February 2013), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/ben-bailey-smith-out-of-the-shadow-into-the-limelight-8482205.html \"Ben Bailey Smith: Out of the shadow, into the limelight\"], ''The Independent''.</ref> Smith attended [[Hampstead School]] and Malorees Junior School along with his sister, and was often seen in her shadow. Upon leaving school, Smith decided to pursue a musical career as a rapper. Doc Brown is a graduate of the [[University of East Anglia]]. He abandoned his drama degree halfway through to study American history. Explaining his stage name, he has said: \"Doc Brown's been my nickname since school, after the scientist in ''[[Back to the Future]]'', because I was gangly and geeky. When I started doing rap battles in my teens, it became my hip-hop handle and it's stuck.\"<ref name=Hogan>Hogan, Michael (14 April 2013), [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/apr/14/doc-brown-standup-comedian-interview \"Doc Brown: 'I'm an accidental comedian.

Smith became a recurring battle champion at the fledgling competition \"Jump Off\" in 2003, when the now international event was housed underneath [[Yo! Sushi]] on [[Poland Street]] in London's [[Soho]], moving to the [[Swiss Centre, London|Swiss Centre]] in [[Leicester Square]]. The following year, Smith's growing reputation as a personality of the underground scene made him the host of a monthly event at his friend's record shop Deal Real on Great Marlborough Court, off [[Carnaby Street]] in the West End.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite web |url=http://www.docbrown.co.uk/about/ |title=Biography |publisher=Doc Brown website|accessdate=12 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022101057/http://www.docbrown.co.uk/about/ |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Deal Real Records===\nThe night was loosely named \"Friday Night Live\" and initially acted as a platform for aspiring young artists from the UK to perform at an open mic, hosted by Smith. In an interview from 2006, he stated he provided \"light relief mixed with an authority necessary to marshal what was always a pretty raucous night\". The night was also notable for being the venue where Smith discovered a 16-year-old [[Lowkey]], whom he promptly featured on his first break-out single \"Donnie's Lament\", and who went on to be one of the most respected political rappers in the UK and internationally.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nThe popularity of the monthly event soared and soon Deal Real was attracting hip-hop celebrities from the US, performing in the store to promote their own European tours. The first to perform were the [[Jungle Brothers]]. Others included [[Pete Rock]] and [[CL Smooth]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Gza]], the [[Black Eyed Peas]], [[Rhymefest]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Canibus]] and [[Cee Lo]], as well as a host of DJs including [[Mark Ronson]].<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nIt was in the shop that Smith met Ronson for the first time, caught in an impromptu rap battle with Chicago rapper, who Smith admitted \"beat him on his home turf\". However, Ronson recalled Smith\u2019s ability to please a crowd with both good humour and a level of self-deprecation often unusual to the Rap genre, and invited him to join a live setup that would form the basis of Ronson\u2019s second studio album ''[[Version (album)|Version]]''.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nThe first gig Smith performed with Ronson was at the Fabric nightclub in the Barbican area of east central London. The line-up consisted of Ronson on guitar, [[Daniel Merriweather]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Tawiah|Beverly Tawiah]] on vocals, former Jamiroquai bassist [[Stuart Zender]] and the Scottish brass section The Haggis Horns.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nSmith continued to tour with the band until early 2007, rapping on stage alongside [[Lily Allen]] on the [[Kaiser Chiefs]] cover \"[[Oh My God (Kaiser Chiefs song)|Oh My God]]\", providing the [[Ghostface Killah]] vocals for the song \"[[Ooh Wee (Mark Ronson song)|Ooh Wee]]\" and performing his own lyrics on the instrumental cover of Kasabian's \"LSF\".<ref name=\"About\" />\n\n===Studio releases===\nThe first breakthrough record and Smith\u2019s biggest hit to date was a track entitled \"Donnie\u2019s Lament\", better known as the \"Mad World Remix\" due to its extensive sampling of that year's Christmas number one \"[[Mad World]]\", performed by [[Gary Jules]], originally by [[Tears for Fears]].<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nIts sample led to legal issues with the label Sanctuary, who did not sanction the remix, despite Smith's appeal to them. Smith was therefore unable to recoup any money despite the popularity of his version. The song had a level of mainstream airplay unusual for UK rap at the time, being championed by Jo Wiley and [[Jonathan Ross]] among others. Some commentators have argued that the song helped raise awareness of the genre as a whole and earmarked a new wave of British rap artists. The song also provided a cameo for a 16-year-old rapper named Lowkey, who today is cited as one of the most politically influential rappers in the UK, Europe and particularly the Middle East, where his tireless campaigning for Palestinian rights among other things has been lauded by many.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nOn the back of the track's small success, Smith released three full-length offerings: ''Citizen Smith Volume One'', ''The Document'' and ''Citizen Smith Volume Two''. It was during his work with the producer Mark Ronson that he was inspired to create the album ''Another Way'', which features no samples and mostly live studio music. Having moved into stand-up, then television and film, the album is as yet unreleased and has built a cult status among fans, many of whom have dubbed ''Another Way'' \"the farewell album\".<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nIn July 2011, a short film was released to accompany the song \"Blighty\", a track from the unreleased album. The film features an interview with Smith at the end credits, in which he describes the film as an open project for young people to interpret his lyrics visually. The film was directed by photographer Kwame Lestrade and was shot with the aid of various young people as part of a lottery-funded youth project.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\n==Comedy==\nLate in 2007, a chance phonecall from former BBC Radio 1 host and comedy writer Danny Robins, for whom Smith had previously written some spoof music, led to Smith working as a script consultant on Robins' [[BBC Radio 4]] sitcom ''Rudy's Rare Records'', a vehicle for veteran UK comedian [[Lenny Henry]]. This eventually led to walk-on roles and more editing and writing work on other Radio 4 comedy shows, including ''Music Therapy'' and ''[[Look Away Now]]''.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nEncouraged by producers at the BBC, Smith attended a BBC industry gig in January 2008 at a small venue in London\u2019s [[Great Portland Street]] named The Albany, where he performed a comic song and told an anecdote regarding being the first rapper to work for Radio 4. By his own admissions in an interview from 2009, Smith claimed he \"ran out of things to say\" and called for the audience to offer words, names and places, with which he improvised a comic rap. According to Smith, the venue managers were impressed and invited him to perform a short set at a late-night variety show named ''Spank!''<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nSmith then entered a national talent competition for comedians called \"[[So You Think You're Funny?]]\" and his third ever stand-up gig was in the first round of the competition in spring 2008 at the Hobgoblin Pub in [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]], south-east London. Smith eventually made the last eight at the grand final in Edinburgh that August, an event in which by his own admission he \"froze up\", delivering what he saw as a disappointing performance.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nRegardless, the performance led to interest from bookers, and Smith began a new incarnation as a professional comedian in October 2008. Since then, he has performed at the prestigious Tartan Ribbon event at the Edinburgh Festival, debuted his own one-man show \"Unfamous\", which sold out its run at both the [[Pleasance Theatre]], Edinburgh, and London\u2019s [[Soho Theatre]]. He also gave a one-off performance of Unfamous at the Elgar rooms in the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in March 2011. In April 2011, Smith was invited to take the show to the Melbourne International Festival for one month.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\n==Film and television==\nAs an actor, Smith has played roles in the acclaimed BBC series ''[[Rev. (TV series)|Rev]]'' and ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]]'', as well as [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Inbetweeners]]''. He also provided voices for the characters Budge and Koggs on the cult CBBC series ''[[Big Babies]]'', for which he also sang the theme tune. In 2013 Smith also guest starred in the [[Channel 4]] comedy-drama series ''[[Derek]]'', in which he played a young man sentenced to community service in a nursing home.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nIn film, he has played a role in Ben Miller\u2019s ''Huge'' as well as a co-starring role in the thriller ''Other Side of the Game''. Smith is also credited as a songwriter on the [[Joe Cornish]]-directed film ''[[Attack the Block]]'' (2011). The character \"Hi Hatz\" is often seen and heard playing songs he has recorded. These were written and recorded by Smith and re-voiced by the actor Jumayn Hunter.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nSmith created a 78-episode teen comedy-drama for the BBC called ''[[4 O'Clock Club]]'', on which he is also the co-writer and co-musical director. He runs his own production company named Bust-A-Gut Ltd, which&nbsp;\u2013 while focusing on television and film&nbsp;\u2013 has also re-released the back catalogue of his music.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nMost recently, he has delved deeper into dramatic acting, starring in the [[Frank Spotnitz]] television show ''[[Hunted (2012 TV series)|Hunted]]'', a thriller for [[Cinemax]].

Pata\u00f1jali acknowledged that Prakrit is the first language, one instinctively adopted by every child with all its imperfections and later leads to the problems of interpretation and misunderstanding. The purifying structure of the Sanskrit language removes these imperfections. The early Sanskrit grammarian [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]] states, for example, that much in the Prakrit languages is etymologically rooted in Sanskrit, but involve \"loss of sounds\" and corruptions that result from a \"disregard of the grammar\". Da\u1e47\u1e0din acknowledged that there are words and confusing structures in Prakrit that thrive independent of Sanskrit. This view is found in the writing of Bharata Muni, the author of the ancient ''[[Natyasastra|N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra]]'' text.

There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the Celtick [sic], though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the Old Persian might be added to the same family.\n|William Jones, 1786|quoted by Thomas Burrow in ''The Sanskrit Language''{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=6}}}}\n\nIn order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]] states that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the north-west sometime during the early second millennium BCE. Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]], vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European [[Uralic languages]], and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna.{{sfn|Colin P.

A part of the difficulty is the lack of sufficient textual, archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the ancient Prakrit languages with rare exceptions such as Pali, leading to a tendency of [[anachronism|anachronistic]] errors.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Sanskrit and Prakrit languages may be divided into Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE\u2013600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan (600 BCE\u20131000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (1000 CE\u2013current), each can further be subdivided in early, middle or second, and late evolutionary substages.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nVedic Sanskrit belongs to the early Old Indo-Aryan while Classical Sanskrit to the later Old Indo-Aryan stage. The evidence for Prakrits such as Pali (Theravada Buddhism) and Ardhamagadhi (Jainism), along with Magadhi, Maharashtri, Sinhala, Sauraseni and Niya (Gandhari), emerge in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage in two versions\u2014archaic and more formalized\u2014that may be placed in early and middle substages of the 600 BCE\u20131000 CE period.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Two literary Indic languages can be traced to the late Middle Indo-Aryan stage and these are Apabhramsa and Elu (a form of literary Sinhalese). Numerous North, Central, Eastern and Western Indian languages, such as Hindi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Nepali, Braj, Awadhi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, and others belong to the New Indo-Aryan stage.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nThere is an extensive overlap in the vocabulary, phonetics and other aspects of these New Indo-Aryan languages with Sanskrit, but it is neither universal nor identical across the languages. They likely emerged from a synthesis of the ancient Sanskrit language traditions and an admixture of various regional dialects. Each language has some unique and regionally creative aspects, with unclear origins. Prakrit languages do have a grammatical structure, but like the Vedic Sanskrit, it is far less rigorous than Classical Sanskrit. The roots of all Prakrit languages may be in the Vedic Sanskrit and ultimately the Indo-Aryan language, their structural details vary from the Classical Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Woolner1986p3\"/>{{sfn|Colin P.

The consonantal system is the same, though it systematically enlarged the inventory of distinct sounds. For example, Sanskrit added a voiceless aspirated \"t\u02b0\", to the voiceless \"t\", voiced \"d\" and voiced aspirated \"d\u02b0\" found in PIE languages.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nThe most significant and distinctive phonological development in Sanskrit is vowel-merger, states Stephanie Jamison\u2014an Indo-European linguist specializing in Sanskrit literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} The short ''*e'', ''*o'' and ''*a'', all merge as ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit, while long ''*\u0113'', ''*\u014d'' and ''*\u0101'', all merge as long ''\u0101'' (\u0906). These mergers occurred very early and significantly impacted Sanskrit's morphological system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} Some phonological developments in it mirror those in other PIE languages. For example, the labiovelars merged with the plain velars as in other satem languages. The secondary palatalization of the resulting segments is more thorough and systematic within Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} A series of retroflex dental stops were innovated in Sanskrit to more thoroughly articulate sounds for clarity. For example, unlike the loss of the morphological clarity from vowel contraction that is found in early Greek and related southeast European languages, Sanskrit deployed ''*y'', ''*w'', and ''*s'' intervocalically to provide morphological clarity.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Vowels===\n\nThe cardinal vowels (''svaras'') ''i'' (\u0907), ''u'' (\u0909), ''a'' (\u0905) distinguish length in Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman|Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=1\u20139}} The short ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit is a closer vowel than \u0101, equivalent to schwa. The mid-vowels \u0113 (\u090f) and \u014d (\u0913) in Sanskrit are monophthongizations of the Indo-Iranian diphthongs ''*ai'' and ''*au''. The Old Iranian language preserved ''*ai'' and ''*au''.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}} The Sanskrit vowels are inherently long, though often transcribed ''e'' and ''o'' without the diacritic. The vocalic liquid ''r\u0325'' in Sanskrit is a merger of PIE ''*r\u0325'' and ''*l\u0325''. The long ''r\u0325'' is an innovation and it is used in a few analogically generated morphological categories.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Michael Coulson|Richard Gombrich|James Benson|2011|pp=21\u201336}}{{sfn|Colin P.

Masica|1993|pp=160\u2013161}} The northwestern, the central and the eastern Sanskrit dialects have had a historic confusion between \"r\" and \"l\". The Paninian system that followed the central dialect preserved the distinction, likely out of reverence for the Vedic Sanskrit that distinguished the \"r\" and \"l\". However, the northwestern dialect only had \"r\", while the eastern dialect probably only had \"l\", states Masica. Thus literary works from different parts of ancient India appear inconsistent in their use of \"r\" and \"l\", resulting in doublets that is occasionally semantically differentiated.{{sfn|Colin P.

All the retroflexes in Sanskrit are in \"origin conditioned alternants of dentals, though from the beginning of the language they have a qualified independence\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nRegarding the palatal plosives, the pronunciation is a matter of debate. In contemporary attestation, the palatal plosives are a regular series of palatal stops, supported by most Sanskrit sandhi rules.  However, the reflexes in descendant languages, as well as a few of the sandhi rules regarding ''ch'', could suggest an affricate pronunciation. \n\n''jh'' was a marginal phoneme in Sanskrit, hence its phonology is more difficult to reconstruct; it was more commonly employed in the Middle Indo-Aryan languages as a result of phonological processes resulting in the phoneme.\n\nThe palatal nasal is a conditioned variant of n occurring next to palatal obstruents.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}} The ''anusvara'' that Sanskrit deploys is a conditioned alternant of postvocalic nasals, under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}} Its ''visarga'' is a word-final or morpheme-final conditioned alternant of s and r under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = '''The system of Sanskrit Sounds'''<br />[The] order of Sanskrit sounds works along three principles: it goes from simple to complex; it goes from the back to the front of the mouth; and it groups similar sounds together. [...] Among themselves, both the vowels and consonants are ordered according to where in the mouth they are pronounced, going from back to front.\n |source = \u2014 A. M.

Ruppel|2017|pp=18\u201319}}\n |width = 28%\n |bgcolor=#FFE0BB\n |align  = right\n}}\nThe voiceless aspirated series is also an innovation in Sanskrit but is significantly rarer than the other three series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nWhile the Sanskrit language organizes sounds for expression beyond those found in the PIE language, it retained many features found in the Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. An example of a similar process in all three, states Jamison, is the retroflex sibilant \u0282 being the automatic product of dental s following i, u, r, and k (mnemonically \"ruki\").{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n===Phonological alternations, sandhi rules===\nSanskrit deploys extensive phonological alternations on different linguistic levels through ''sandhi'' rules (literally, the rules of \"putting together, union, connection, alliance\"). This is similar to the English alteration of \"going to\" as ''gonna'', states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} The Sanskrit language accepts such alterations within it, but offers formal rules for the ''sandhi'' of any two words next to each other in the same sentence or linking two sentences. The external ''sandhi'' rules state that similar short vowels coalesce into a single long vowel, while dissimilar vowels form glides or undergo diphthongization.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} Among the consonants, most external ''sandhi'' rules recommend regressive assimilation for clarity when they are voiced. According to Jamison, these rules ordinarily apply at compound seams and morpheme boundaries.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} In Vedic Sanskrit, the external ''sandhi'' rules are more variable than in Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=11}}\n\nThe internal ''sandhi'' rules are more intricate and account for the root and the canonical structure of the Sanskrit word. These rules anticipate what are now known as the [[Bartholomae's law]] and [[Grassmann's law]]. For example, states Jamison, the \"voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated obstruents of a positional series regularly alternate with each other (p \u2248 b \u2248 b\u02b0; t \u2248 d \u2248 d\u02b0, etc.; note, however, c \u2248 j \u2248 h), such that, for example, a morpheme with an underlying voiced aspirate final may show alternants{{clarify|date=March 2019|reason=alternations?}} with all three stops under differing internal sandhi conditions\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}} The velar series (k, g, g\u02b0) alternate with the palatal series (c, j, h), while the structural position of the palatal series is modified into a retroflex cluster when followed by dental. This rule create two morphophonemically distinct series from a single palatal series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nVocalic alternations in the Sanskrit morphological system is termed \"strengthening\", and called ''guna'' and ''vriddhi'' in the preconsonantal versions. There is an equivalence to terms deployed in Indo-European descriptive grammars, wherein Sanskrit's unstrengthened state is same as the zero-grade, ''guna'' corresponds to normal-grade, while ''vriddhi'' is same as the lengthened-state.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The qualitative ablaut is not found in Sanskrit just like it is absent in Iranian, but Sanskrit retains quantitative ablaut through vowel strengthening.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The transformations between unstrengthened to ''guna'' is prominent in the morphological system, states Jamison, while ''vriddhi'' is a particularly significant rule when adjectives of origin and appurtenance are derived. The manner in which this is done slightly differs between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}}{{sfn|Colin P.

Similarly, the syllable may have an internal vowel of any weight. The Vedic Sanskrit shows traces of following the Sievers-Edgerton Law, but Classical Sanskrit doesn't. Vedic Sanskrit has a pitch accent system, states Jamison, which were acknowledged by Panini, but in his Classical Sanskrit the accents disappear.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} Most Vedic Sanskrit words have one accent. However, this accent is not phonologically predictable, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} It can fall anywhere in the word and its position often conveys morphological and syntactic information.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} According to Masica, the presence of an accent system in Vedic Sanskrit is evidenced from the markings in the Vedic texts. This is important because of Sanskrit's connection to the PIE languages and comparative Indo-European linguistics.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nSanskrit, like most early Indo-European languages, lost the so-called \"laryngeal consonants (cover-symbol ''*H'') present in the Proto-Indo-European\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} This significantly impacted the evolutionary path of the Sanskrit phonology and morphology, particularly in the variant forms of roots.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n==Morphology==\n{{Main|Sanskrit grammar}}\n{{See also|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}\nThe basis of Sanskrit morphology is the root, states Jamison, \"a morpheme bearing lexical meaning\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} The verbal and nominal stems of Sanskrit words are derived from this root through the phonological vowel-gradation processes, the addition of affixes, verbal and nominal stems. It then adds an ending to establish the grammatical and syntactic identity of the stem. According to Jamison, the \"three major formal elements of the morphology are (i) root, (ii) affix, and (iii) ending; and they are roughly responsible for (i) lexical meaning, (ii) derivation, and (iii) inflection respectively\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nA Sanskrit word has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Affix''{{su|b=0-n}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=0\u20131}}\n\nThe root structure has certain phonological constraints. Two of the most important constraints of a \"root\" is that it does not end in a short \"a\" (\u0905) and that it is monosyllabic.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} In contrast, the affixes and endings commonly do. The affixes in Sanskrit are almost always suffixes, with exceptions such as the augment \"a-\" added as prefix to past tense verb forms and the \"-na/n-\" infix in single verbal present class, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nA verb in Sanskrit has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Tense-Aspect}} + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Mood}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=Personal-Number-Voice}}\n\nAccording to Ruppel, verbs in Sanskrit express the same information as other Indo-European languages such as English.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\"/> Sanskrit verbs describe an action or occurrence or state, its embedded morphology informs as to \"who is doing it\" (person or persons), \"when it is done\" (tense) and \"how it is done\" (mood, voice). The Indo-European languages differ in the detail. For example, the Sanskrit language attaches the affixes and ending to the verb root, while the English language adds small independent words before the verb. In Sanskrit, these elements co-exist within the word.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\">{{cite book|author=A. M.

The finite verbs of Classical Sanskrit have the following grammatical categories: person, number, voice, tense-aspect, and mood. According to Jamison, a portmanteau morpheme generally expresses the person-number-voice in Sanskrit, and sometimes also the ending or only the ending. The mood of the word is embedded in the affix.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nThese elements of word architecture are the typical building blocks in Classical Sanskrit, but in Vedic Sanskrit these elements fluctuate and are unclear. For example, in the ''Rigveda'' [[preverb]]s regularly occur in [[tmesis]], states Jamison, which means they are \"separated from the finite verb\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} This indecisiveness is likely linked to Vedic Sanskrit's attempt to incorporate accent. With nonfinite forms of the verb and with nominal derivatives thereof, states Jamison, \"preverbs show much clearer univerbation in Vedic, both by position and by accent, and by Classical Sanskrit, tmesis is no longer possible even with finite forms\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nWhile roots are typical in Sanskrit, some words do not follow the canonical structure.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} A few forms lack both inflection and root. Many words are inflected (and can enter into derivation) but lack a recognizable root. Examples from the basic vocabulary include kinship terms such as ''m\u0101tar-'' (mother), ''nas-'' (nose), ''\u015bvan-'' (dog). According to Jamison, pronouns and some words outside the semantic categories also lack roots, as do the numerals. Similarly, the Sanskrit language is flexible enough to not mandate inflection.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe Sanskrit words can contain more than one affix that interact with each other. Affixes in Sanskrit can be athematic as well as thematic, according to Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Athematic affixes can be alternating. Sanskrit deploys eight cases, namely nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nStems, that is \"root + affix\", appear in two categories in Sanskrit: vowel stems and consonant stems. Unlike some Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, according to Jamison, \"Sanskrit has no closed set of conventionally denoted noun declensions\". Sanskrit includes a fairly large set of stem-types.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=17\u201318}} The linguistic interaction of the roots, the phonological segments, lexical items and the grammar for the Classical Sanskrit consist of four Paninian components. These, states Paul Kiparsky, are the ''Astadhyaayi'', a comprehensive system of 4,000 grammatical rules, of which a small set are frequently used; ''Sivasutras'', an inventory of ''anubandhas'' (markers) that partition phonological segments for efficient abbreviations through the ''pratyharas'' technique; ''Dhatupatha'', a list of 2,000 verbal roots classified by their morphology and syntactic properties using diacritic markers, a structure that guides its writing systems; and, the ''Ganapatha'', an inventory of word groups, classes of lexical systems.<ref name=Kiparsky59>{{cite book|author=Paul Kiparsky|editor=E.F.K.

These differ in the types of endings and what these endings mark in the grammatical context.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} Pronouns and nouns share the same grammatical categories, though they may differ in inflection. Verb-based adjectives and participles are not formally distinct from nouns. Adverbs are typically frozen case forms of adjectives, states Jamison, and \"nonfinite verbal forms such as infinitives and gerunds also clearly show frozen nominal case endings\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n===Tense and voice===\nThe Sanskrit language includes five tenses: present, future, past imperfect, past [[aorist]] and past perfect.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> It outlines three types of voices: active, passive and the middle.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> The middle is also referred to as the mediopassive, or more formally in Sanskrit as ''parasmaipada'' (word for another) and ''atmanepada'' (word for oneself).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|+Voice in Sanskrit, Stephanie Jamison{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|Ruppel gives the following endings for the \"present indicative active\" in the Sanskrit language: 1st dual: -va\u1e25, 1st plural: -ma\u1e25, 2nd dual: -tha\u1e25, 2nd plural: -tha and so on.{{sfn|A.

For example, the ''Rigveda'' includes perfect and a marginal pluperfect. Classical Sanskrit simplifies the \"present\" system down to two tenses, the perfect and the imperfect, while the \"aorist\" stems retain the aorist tense and the \"perfect\" stems retain the perfect and marginal pluperfect.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=21}} The classical version of the language has elaborate rules for both voice and the tense-aspect system to emphasize clarity, and this is more elaborate than other Indo-European languages. The evolution of these systems can be seen from the earliest layers of the Vedic literature to the late Vedic literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Gender, mood===\nSanskrit recognizes three numbers\u2014singular, dual, and plural.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} The dual is a fully functioning category, used beyond naturally paired objects such as hands or eyes, extending to any collection of two. The elliptical dual is notable in the Vedic Sanskrit, according to Jamison, where a noun in the dual signals a paired opposition.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Illustrations include ''dy\u0101v\u0101'' (literally, \"the two heavens\" for heaven-and-earth), ''m\u0101tar\u0101'' (literally, \"the two mothers\" for mother-and-father).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} A verb may be singular, dual or plural, while the person recognized in the language are forms of \"I\", \"you\", \"he/she/it\", \"we\" and \"they\".<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\nThere are three persons in Sanskrit: first, second and third.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}} Sanskrit uses the 3\u00d73 grid formed by the three numbers and the three persons parameters as the paradigm and the basic building block of its verbal system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nThe Sanskrit language incorporates three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} All nouns have inherent gender, but with some exceptions, personal pronouns have no gender. Exceptions include demonstrative and anaphoric pronouns.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Derivation of a word is used to express the feminine. Two most common derivations come from feminine-forming suffixes, the ''-\u0101-'' (\u0906, R\u0101dh\u0101) and ''-\u012b-'' (\u0908, Rukm\u012bn\u012b). The masculine and neuter are much simpler, and the difference between them is primarily inflectional.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman| Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=59, 79, 91, 113}} Similar affixes for the feminine are found in many Indo-European languages, states Burrow, suggesting links of the Sanskrit to its PIE heritage.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|pp= 191\u2013194}}\n\nPronouns in Sanskrit include the personal pronouns of the first and second persons, unmarked for gender, and a larger number of gender-distinguishing pronouns and adjectives.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Examples of the former include ''ah\u00e1m'' (first singular), ''vay\u00e1m'' (first plural) and ''y\u016by\u00e1m'' (second plural). The latter can be demonstrative, deictic or anaphoric.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Both the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit share the ''s\u00e1/t\u00e1m'' pronominal stem, and this is the closest element to a third person pronoun and an article in the Sanskrit language, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nIndicative, potential and imperative are the three mood forms in Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\n===Prosody, meter===\n{{main|Sanskrit prosody}}\nThe Sanskrit language formally incorporates [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]].<ref name=jameslochtefeldsca140/> By the late Vedic era, this developed into a field of study and it was central to the composition of the Hindu literature including the later Vedic texts.

The purifying structure of the Sanskrit language removes these imperfections.

There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the Celtick [sic], though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the Old Persian might be added to the same family.\n|William Jones, 1786|quoted by Thomas Burrow in ''The Sanskrit Language''{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=6}}}}\n\nIn order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]] states that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the north-west sometime during the early second millennium BCE. Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]], vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European [[Uralic languages]], and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna.{{sfn|Colin P.

It is the Indo-Aryan branch that moved into eastern Iran and the south into the Indian subcontinent in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE.

A part of the difficulty is the lack of sufficient textual, archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the ancient Prakrit languages with rare exceptions such as Pali, leading to a tendency of [[anachronism|anachronistic]] errors.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Sanskrit and Prakrit languages may be divided into Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE\u2013600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan (600 BCE\u20131000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (1000 CE\u2013current), each can further be subdivided in early, middle or second, and late evolutionary substages.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nVedic Sanskrit belongs to the early Old Indo-Aryan while Classical Sanskrit to the later Old Indo-Aryan stage. The evidence for Prakrits such as Pali (Theravada Buddhism) and Ardhamagadhi (Jainism), along with Magadhi, Maharashtri, Sinhala, Sauraseni and Niya (Gandhari), emerge in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage in two versions\u2014archaic and more formalized\u2014that may be placed in early and middle substages of the 600 BCE\u20131000 CE period.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Two literary Indic languages can be traced to the late Middle Indo-Aryan stage and these are Apabhramsa and Elu (a form of literary Sinhalese). Numerous North, Central, Eastern and Western Indian languages, such as Hindi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Nepali, Braj, Awadhi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, and others belong to the New Indo-Aryan stage.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nThere is an extensive overlap in the vocabulary, phonetics and other aspects of these New Indo-Aryan languages with Sanskrit, but it is neither universal nor identical across the languages. They likely emerged from a synthesis of the ancient Sanskrit language traditions and an admixture of various regional dialects. Each language has some unique and regionally creative aspects, with unclear origins.

The consonantal system is the same, though it systematically enlarged the inventory of distinct sounds. For example, Sanskrit added a voiceless aspirated \"t\u02b0\", to the voiceless \"t\", voiced \"d\" and voiced aspirated \"d\u02b0\" found in PIE languages.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nThe most significant and distinctive phonological development in Sanskrit is vowel-merger, states Stephanie Jamison\u2014an Indo-European linguist specializing in Sanskrit literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} The short ''*e'', ''*o'' and ''*a'', all merge as ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit, while long ''*\u0113'', ''*\u014d'' and ''*\u0101'', all merge as long ''\u0101'' (\u0906). These mergers occurred very early and significantly impacted Sanskrit's morphological system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} Some phonological developments in it mirror those in other PIE languages. For example, the labiovelars merged with the plain velars as in other satem languages. The secondary palatalization of the resulting segments is more thorough and systematic within Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} A series of retroflex dental stops were innovated in Sanskrit to more thoroughly articulate sounds for clarity. For example, unlike the loss of the morphological clarity from vowel contraction that is found in early Greek and related southeast European languages, Sanskrit deployed ''*y'', ''*w'', and ''*s'' intervocalically to provide morphological clarity.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Vowels===\n\nThe cardinal vowels (''svaras'') ''i'' (\u0907), ''u'' (\u0909), ''a'' (\u0905) distinguish length in Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman|Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=1\u20139}} The short ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit is a closer vowel than \u0101, equivalent to schwa. The mid-vowels \u0113 (\u090f) and \u014d (\u0913) in Sanskrit are monophthongizations of the Indo-Iranian diphthongs ''*ai'' and ''*au''. The Old Iranian language preserved ''*ai'' and ''*au''.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}} The Sanskrit vowels are inherently long, though often transcribed ''e'' and ''o'' without the diacritic. The vocalic liquid ''r\u0325'' in Sanskrit is a merger of PIE ''*r\u0325'' and ''*l\u0325''. The long ''r\u0325'' is an innovation and it is used in a few analogically generated morphological categories.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Michael Coulson|Richard Gombrich|James Benson|2011|pp=21\u201336}}{{sfn|Colin P.

Masica|1993|pp=160\u2013161}} The northwestern, the central and the eastern Sanskrit dialects have had a historic confusion between \"r\" and \"l\". The Paninian system that followed the central dialect preserved the distinction, likely out of reverence for the Vedic Sanskrit that distinguished the \"r\" and \"l\". However, the northwestern dialect only had \"r\", while the eastern dialect probably only had \"l\", states Masica. Thus literary works from different parts of ancient India appear inconsistent in their use of \"r\" and \"l\", resulting in doublets that is occasionally semantically differentiated.{{sfn|Colin P.

All the retroflexes in Sanskrit are in \"origin conditioned alternants of dentals, though from the beginning of the language they have a qualified independence\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nRegarding the palatal plosives, the pronunciation is a matter of debate. In contemporary attestation, the palatal plosives are a regular series of palatal stops, supported by most Sanskrit sandhi rules.  However, the reflexes in descendant languages, as well as a few of the sandhi rules regarding ''ch'', could suggest an affricate pronunciation. \n\n''jh'' was a marginal phoneme in Sanskrit, hence its phonology is more difficult to reconstruct; it was more commonly employed in the Middle Indo-Aryan languages as a result of phonological processes resulting in the phoneme.\n\nThe palatal nasal is a conditioned variant of n occurring next to palatal obstruents.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}} The ''anusvara'' that Sanskrit deploys is a conditioned alternant of postvocalic nasals, under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}} Its ''visarga'' is a word-final or morpheme-final conditioned alternant of s and r under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = '''The system of Sanskrit Sounds'''<br />[The] order of Sanskrit sounds works along three principles: it goes from simple to complex; it goes from the back to the front of the mouth; and it groups similar sounds together.

Ruppel|2017|pp=18\u201319}}\n |width = 28%\n |bgcolor=#FFE0BB\n |align  = right\n}}\nThe voiceless aspirated series is also an innovation in Sanskrit but is significantly rarer than the other three series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nWhile the Sanskrit language organizes sounds for expression beyond those found in the PIE language, it retained many features found in the Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. An example of a similar process in all three, states Jamison, is the retroflex sibilant \u0282 being the automatic product of dental s following i, u, r, and k (mnemonically \"ruki\").{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n===Phonological alternations, sandhi rules===\nSanskrit deploys extensive phonological alternations on different linguistic levels through ''sandhi'' rules (literally, the rules of \"putting together, union, connection, alliance\"). This is similar to the English alteration of \"going to\" as ''gonna'', states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} The Sanskrit language accepts such alterations within it, but offers formal rules for the ''sandhi'' of any two words next to each other in the same sentence or linking two sentences. The external ''sandhi'' rules state that similar short vowels coalesce into a single long vowel, while dissimilar vowels form glides or undergo diphthongization.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} Among the consonants, most external ''sandhi'' rules recommend regressive assimilation for clarity when they are voiced. According to Jamison, these rules ordinarily apply at compound seams and morpheme boundaries.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} In Vedic Sanskrit, the external ''sandhi'' rules are more variable than in Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=11}}\n\nThe internal ''sandhi'' rules are more intricate and account for the root and the canonical structure of the Sanskrit word. These rules anticipate what are now known as the [[Bartholomae's law]] and [[Grassmann's law]]. For example, states Jamison, the \"voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated obstruents of a positional series regularly alternate with each other (p \u2248 b \u2248 b\u02b0; t \u2248 d \u2248 d\u02b0, etc.; note, however, c \u2248 j \u2248 h), such that, for example, a morpheme with an underlying voiced aspirate final may show alternants{{clarify|date=March 2019|reason=alternations?}} with all three stops under differing internal sandhi conditions\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}} The velar series (k, g, g\u02b0) alternate with the palatal series (c, j, h), while the structural position of the palatal series is modified into a retroflex cluster when followed by dental. This rule create two morphophonemically distinct series from a single palatal series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nVocalic alternations in the Sanskrit morphological system is termed \"strengthening\", and called ''guna'' and ''vriddhi'' in the preconsonantal versions. There is an equivalence to terms deployed in Indo-European descriptive grammars, wherein Sanskrit's unstrengthened state is same as the zero-grade, ''guna'' corresponds to normal-grade, while ''vriddhi'' is same as the lengthened-state.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The qualitative ablaut is not found in Sanskrit just like it is absent in Iranian, but Sanskrit retains quantitative ablaut through vowel strengthening.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The transformations between unstrengthened to ''guna'' is prominent in the morphological system, states Jamison, while ''vriddhi'' is a particularly significant rule when adjectives of origin and appurtenance are derived. The manner in which this is done slightly differs between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}}{{sfn|Colin P.

Similarly, the syllable may have an internal vowel of any weight. The Vedic Sanskrit shows traces of following the Sievers-Edgerton Law, but Classical Sanskrit doesn't. Vedic Sanskrit has a pitch accent system, states Jamison, which were acknowledged by Panini, but in his Classical Sanskrit the accents disappear.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} Most Vedic Sanskrit words have one accent. However, this accent is not phonologically predictable, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} It can fall anywhere in the word and its position often conveys morphological and syntactic information.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} According to Masica, the presence of an accent system in Vedic Sanskrit is evidenced from the markings in the Vedic texts. This is important because of Sanskrit's connection to the PIE languages and comparative Indo-European linguistics.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nSanskrit, like most early Indo-European languages, lost the so-called \"laryngeal consonants (cover-symbol ''*H'') present in the Proto-Indo-European\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} This significantly impacted the evolutionary path of the Sanskrit phonology and morphology, particularly in the variant forms of roots.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n==Morphology==\n{{Main|Sanskrit grammar}}\n{{See also|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}\nThe basis of Sanskrit morphology is the root, states Jamison, \"a morpheme bearing lexical meaning\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} The verbal and nominal stems of Sanskrit words are derived from this root through the phonological vowel-gradation processes, the addition of affixes, verbal and nominal stems. It then adds an ending to establish the grammatical and syntactic identity of the stem. According to Jamison, the \"three major formal elements of the morphology are (i) root, (ii) affix, and (iii) ending; and they are roughly responsible for (i) lexical meaning, (ii) derivation, and (iii) inflection respectively\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nA Sanskrit word has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Affix''{{su|b=0-n}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=0\u20131}}\n\nThe root structure has certain phonological constraints. Two of the most important constraints of a \"root\" is that it does not end in a short \"a\" (\u0905) and that it is monosyllabic.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} In contrast, the affixes and endings commonly do. The affixes in Sanskrit are almost always suffixes, with exceptions such as the augment \"a-\" added as prefix to past tense verb forms and the \"-na/n-\" infix in single verbal present class, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nA verb in Sanskrit has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Tense-Aspect}} + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Mood}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=Personal-Number-Voice}}\n\nAccording to Ruppel, verbs in Sanskrit express the same information as other Indo-European languages such as English.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\"/> Sanskrit verbs describe an action or occurrence or state, its embedded morphology informs as to \"who is doing it\" (person or persons), \"when it is done\" (tense) and \"how it is done\" (mood, voice). The Indo-European languages differ in the detail. For example, the Sanskrit language attaches the affixes and ending to the verb root, while the English language adds small independent words before the verb. In Sanskrit, these elements co-exist within the word.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\">{{cite book|author=A. M.

The finite verbs of Classical Sanskrit have the following grammatical categories: person, number, voice, tense-aspect, and mood. According to Jamison, a portmanteau morpheme generally expresses the person-number-voice in Sanskrit, and sometimes also the ending or only the ending. The mood of the word is embedded in the affix.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nThese elements of word architecture are the typical building blocks in Classical Sanskrit, but in Vedic Sanskrit these elements fluctuate and are unclear. For example, in the ''Rigveda'' [[preverb]]s regularly occur in [[tmesis]], states Jamison, which means they are \"separated from the finite verb\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} This indecisiveness is likely linked to Vedic Sanskrit's attempt to incorporate accent. With nonfinite forms of the verb and with nominal derivatives thereof, states Jamison, \"preverbs show much clearer univerbation in Vedic, both by position and by accent, and by Classical Sanskrit, tmesis is no longer possible even with finite forms\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nWhile roots are typical in Sanskrit, some words do not follow the canonical structure.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} A few forms lack both inflection and root. Many words are inflected (and can enter into derivation) but lack a recognizable root. Examples from the basic vocabulary include kinship terms such as ''m\u0101tar-'' (mother), ''nas-'' (nose), ''\u015bvan-'' (dog). According to Jamison, pronouns and some words outside the semantic categories also lack roots, as do the numerals. Similarly, the Sanskrit language is flexible enough to not mandate inflection.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe Sanskrit words can contain more than one affix that interact with each other. Affixes in Sanskrit can be athematic as well as thematic, according to Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Athematic affixes can be alternating. Sanskrit deploys eight cases, namely nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nStems, that is \"root + affix\", appear in two categories in Sanskrit: vowel stems and consonant stems. Unlike some Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, according to Jamison, \"Sanskrit has no closed set of conventionally denoted noun declensions\". Sanskrit includes a fairly large set of stem-types.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=17\u201318}} The linguistic interaction of the roots, the phonological segments, lexical items and the grammar for the Classical Sanskrit consist of four Paninian components. These, states Paul Kiparsky, are the ''Astadhyaayi'', a comprehensive system of 4,000 grammatical rules, of which a small set are frequently used; ''Sivasutras'', an inventory of ''anubandhas'' (markers) that partition phonological segments for efficient abbreviations through the ''pratyharas'' technique; ''Dhatupatha'', a list of 2,000 verbal roots classified by their morphology and syntactic properties using diacritic markers, a structure that guides its writing systems; and, the ''Ganapatha'', an inventory of word groups, classes of lexical systems.<ref name=Kiparsky59>{{cite book|author=Paul Kiparsky|editor=E.F.K.

These differ in the types of endings and what these endings mark in the grammatical context.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} Pronouns and nouns share the same grammatical categories, though they may differ in inflection. Verb-based adjectives and participles are not formally distinct from nouns. Adverbs are typically frozen case forms of adjectives, states Jamison, and \"nonfinite verbal forms such as infinitives and gerunds also clearly show frozen nominal case endings\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n===Tense and voice===\nThe Sanskrit language includes five tenses: present, future, past imperfect, past [[aorist]] and past perfect.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> It outlines three types of voices: active, passive and the middle.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> The middle is also referred to as the mediopassive, or more formally in Sanskrit as ''parasmaipada'' (word for another) and ''atmanepada'' (word for oneself).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|+Voice in Sanskrit, Stephanie Jamison{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|Ruppel gives the following endings for the \"present indicative active\" in the Sanskrit language: 1st dual: -va\u1e25, 1st plural: -ma\u1e25, 2nd dual: -tha\u1e25, 2nd plural: -tha and so on.{{sfn|A.

For example, the ''Rigveda'' includes perfect and a marginal pluperfect. Classical Sanskrit simplifies the \"present\" system down to two tenses, the perfect and the imperfect, while the \"aorist\" stems retain the aorist tense and the \"perfect\" stems retain the perfect and marginal pluperfect.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=21}} The classical version of the language has elaborate rules for both voice and the tense-aspect system to emphasize clarity, and this is more elaborate than other Indo-European languages. The evolution of these systems can be seen from the earliest layers of the Vedic literature to the late Vedic literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Gender, mood===\nSanskrit recognizes three numbers\u2014singular, dual, and plural.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} The dual is a fully functioning category, used beyond naturally paired objects such as hands or eyes, extending to any collection of two. The elliptical dual is notable in the Vedic Sanskrit, according to Jamison, where a noun in the dual signals a paired opposition.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Illustrations include ''dy\u0101v\u0101'' (literally, \"the two heavens\" for heaven-and-earth), ''m\u0101tar\u0101'' (literally, \"the two mothers\" for mother-and-father).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} A verb may be singular, dual or plural, while the person recognized in the language are forms of \"I\", \"you\", \"he/she/it\", \"we\" and \"they\".<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\nThere are three persons in Sanskrit: first, second and third.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}} Sanskrit uses the 3\u00d73 grid formed by the three numbers and the three persons parameters as the paradigm and the basic building block of its verbal system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nThe Sanskrit language incorporates three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} All nouns have inherent gender, but with some exceptions, personal pronouns have no gender. Exceptions include demonstrative and anaphoric pronouns.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Derivation of a word is used to express the feminine. Two most common derivations come from feminine-forming suffixes, the ''-\u0101-'' (\u0906, R\u0101dh\u0101) and ''-\u012b-'' (\u0908, Rukm\u012bn\u012b). The masculine and neuter are much simpler, and the difference between them is primarily inflectional.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman| Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=59, 79, 91, 113}} Similar affixes for the feminine are found in many Indo-European languages, states Burrow, suggesting links of the Sanskrit to its PIE heritage.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|pp= 191\u2013194}}\n\nPronouns in Sanskrit include the personal pronouns of the first and second persons, unmarked for gender, and a larger number of gender-distinguishing pronouns and adjectives.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Examples of the former include ''ah\u00e1m'' (first singular), ''vay\u00e1m'' (first plural) and ''y\u016by\u00e1m'' (second plural). The latter can be demonstrative, deictic or anaphoric.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Both the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit share the ''s\u00e1/t\u00e1m'' pronominal stem, and this is the closest element to a third person pronoun and an article in the Sanskrit language, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nIndicative, potential and imperative are the three mood forms in Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\n===Prosody, meter===\n{{main|Sanskrit prosody}}\nThe Sanskrit language formally incorporates [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]].<ref name=jameslochtefeldsca140/> By the late Vedic era, this developed into a field of study and it was central to the composition of the Hindu literature including the later Vedic texts.

Further, a closer examination reveals that they all have the similar basic graphic principles, the same ''varnamala'' (literally, \"garland of letters\") alphabetic ordering following the same logical phonetic order, easing the work of historic skilled scribes writing or reproducing Sanskrit works across the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=70\u201371, 75\u201376 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}}{{refn|group=note|Salomon states that these shared graphic principles that combine syllabic and alphabetic writing are distinctive for Indic scripts when contrasted with other major world languages.

The system most commonly used today is the IAST ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]]), which has been the academic standard since 1888. [[ASCII]]-based transliteration schemes have also evolved because of difficulties representing Sanskrit characters in computer systems. These include [[Harvard-Kyoto]] and [[ITRANS]], a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the Internet, especially in Usenet and in email, for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues. With the wide availability of [[Unicode]]-aware web browsers, IAST has become common online. It is also possible to type using an [[alphanumeric keyboard]] and transliterate to Devanagari using software like Mac OS X's international support.\n\nEuropean scholars in the 19th century generally preferred Devanagari for the transcription and reproduction of whole texts and lengthy excerpts. However, references to individual words and names in texts composed in European Languages were usually represented with Roman transliteration. From the 20th century onwards, because of production costs, textual editions edited by Western scholars have mostly been in [[Romanised]] transliteration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shashir.autodidactus.org/shashir_umich/sanskrit_transcription.html|title=Modern Transcription of Sanskrit|publisher=autodidactus.org}}</ref>\n\n===Epigraphy===\nThe earliest known stone inscriptions in Sanskrit are in the Brahmi script from the first century BCE.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86\u201387}}{{refn|group=note|Some scholars date these to the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|authorlink=Jan Gonda|title=Visnuism and Sivaism: A Comparison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khrmDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA166|year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4742-8082-2|pages=166 note 243}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Hegarty|title=Religion, Narrative and Public Imagination in South Asia: Past and Place in the Sanskrit Mahabharata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMSoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-64589-1|pages=46 note 118}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=note|Prakrit inscriptions of ancient India, such as those of Ashoka, are older.

The closest major town to the village is [[Shotts]] {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} to the south east and [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]] {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} to the north west.\n\nSalsburgh is perhaps best known for the Kirk O' Shott's Church (affectionately known as \"The M8 Church\") which sits on a [[hillock]] and is fairly visible as visitors enter the village from the east on the [[B7066 road|B7066]] [[Whitburn, West Lothian|Whitburn]] to [[Newhouse, North Lanarkshire|Newhouse]] road.\n\nThere has been a community in the area for over 600 years, although the present village dates back to 1729. At that time only a row of four houses existed, named \"Muirhall, Girdhimstrait, Merchanthall and Craighead\". Craighead was home to a Mr. Young and his wife Sally, and when Young sold some of his land to construct more houses it was decided that it would be named \"Sallysburgh\". Through time the name was shortened to Salsburgh.\n\nStreets around the village are named after significant natives from its past relating to industry, mining, farming and agriculture all of which are part of the village's rich tapestry and make-up.\n\nSalsburgh has various scenic walks, picturesque views for miles and areas which have remained untampered with by man such as the Riven Loch where much wildlife can be discovered.\n\nThe village is also well known and publicised as being rich in [[folklore]], stories and tales of a giant (see [[Bertram de Shotts]], a haunted cemetery [[Shottskirk]]\nand a mysterious grey figure purported to be a lady<ref>https://en-gb.facebook.com/Salsburgh/posts/1228431727257142</ref> are well published on the internet and indeed one caller to a local late night call in talk show on the now defunct [[Scot FM]] made a distressed call to the show stating they had just hit a mysterious grey figure, but upon going to make sure they were ok, the individual had just simply vanished into thin air.\n\n==Coal mining==\n\n===Duntilland===\nDuntilland Colliery began production in 1896 with a workforce of just under 200. Their main production was specializing in coal types of/in manufacturing, anthracite and steam. It closed in 1951 and was owned and operated by Coltness Iron Co. Ltd.\n\n===Fortissat===\nFortissat Colliery began production in 1870 with a workforce of just under 300. Their main production was specializing in coal types of/in-house and steam. It closed in 1949 and was owned and operated by Shotts Iron Co. Ltd.\n\n===Ardenrigg===\nArdenrigg Colliery began production in 1926 with a workforce of just under 300. Their main production was specializing in coal types of/in anthracite. It closed in 1963 and was owned and operated by Ardenrigg Coal Co. Ltd.\n\n===Dewshill===\nDewshill Collierie began production in 1896. The population of their workforce is not known. Their main production was specializing in coal types of/in anthracite. It closed in 1943 after being redeveloped in 1923 and was owned and operated by Coltness Iron Co. Ltd. The pumping shaft eventually sunk in 1957.\n\n===Hirstrigg===\nHirstrigg Collierie began production sometime around after 1880 with a work force of between 200 and 300. It is not known what coal type they specialized in. It was originally owned and operated by Hirst Coal Co. Ltd (Glasgow) then latterly became under the ownership of Garscube Coal Co. Ltd (Edinburgh). It closed sometime around the 1940s.<ref>http://www.salsburghheritagegroup.co.uk/13.html</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Kirk O' Shott's (Shottskirk) Public/Primary School===\nKirk O' Shott's is the name of the local school which opened initially in 1700 in a rented building in the southern edge of the old [[Shottskirk]] churchyard; however, it was decided that a new school would be built opposite the church on what is now Newmill Canthill Road. It officially opened in 1799.\n\nDue to an increase in school roll the original school was deemed no longer viable. A new school was built to the east end of the village and was opened in August 1912 as Shottskirk Public School,<ref>[http://www.friendsofkirkoshottsschool.co.uk Shottskirk Public School]</ref> which later reverted to its original roots as Kirk O' Shott's in 1958 as a junior / secondary school.\n\nKirk O' Shott's Public School still thrives today as a busy public primary school serving the local community of Salsburgh and surrounding hamlets and proudly celebrated its centenary on 12 August 2012. Kirk O' Shott's remains a public school open to all denominations.\n\n===Kirk O' Shott's (Shottskirk) Parish Church===\nKirk O' Shott's Parish Church is the name of the local church which serves the parish of Salsburgh, Shotts and surrounding area. The church was formerly a Catholic place of worship under the name St. Catherines, taken from Catherine of Sienna. About 550 years ago Bothwell and Shotts formed one parish which stretched from the Clyde to Linlithgowshire, and from the North to the South Calder. In this large area there were four places of worship, one of which was situated in the middle Bothwellmuir at \"a desert place called Bertram-Shotts\". Bertram was reputed to be a giant who lived in the area and terrorised travellers on the Glasgow/Edinburgh road. A reward was offered for his capture - dead or alive - and was claimed by William Muirhead who lay in wait for Bertram when the latter came to his favourite drinking place, a spring of water on the hillside above Shottsburn. He hamstrung him and, as the giant lay laughing up at him, he cut off his head with the words, \"Will ye laugh-up yet?\"\n\nIt was on Bertram's plot of land that St. Catherine's Chapel was built in 1450. It was dedicated to \"the blessed Virgin and Catherine of Sienna\".\n\nAfter the Reformation of 1560, Kirk o\u2019Shotts, otherwise known as [[Shottskirk]] or the affectionately titled \"M8 Church\", became a Protestant place of worship. The old church of St Catherine\u2019s must have suffered many changes and required frequent changes since its foundation, but of these there is no account before 1640. In that year the Presbytery met at Shotts and ordered that the church be repaired and partly rebuilt, but it was more than eight years before the work was completed. The site of the old church is marked by the headstone erected to Samuel Meuros, who was session clerk and school master from 1794 to 1837. He was also Precentor, and it was his wish to be buried where his old desk had stood; thus he lies still at his post. On the back of the stone is the following inscription:\n\n\"Here stood the Precentor\u2019s desk in the Kirk of Bertram Shotts which was rebuilt and extended in 1642\".\n\nThis stone and the burial ground of the Inglises of Murdoston, which was inside the old church, give a clear idea of the site.\n\nShottskirk Cemetery is reported to be haunted by a mysterious grey figure who vanished to and from the mist when a driver reported having hit a grey figure on the B7066 road which runs adjacent to the Church and graveyard.\n\n===St. Catherine's Well / \"Kate's Well\"===\nSt. Catherine's Well or \"[[Kate's Well]]\" is a natural holy spring well on holy ground at the foot of Kirk O'Shott's Parish Church, otherwise known as Shottskirk, in the village of Salsburgh, North Lanarkshire. The well dates back to the 14th century and derives from the church's former past when it was a Catholic place of worship as St. Catherines Chapel which has origins from Catherine of Sienna.\n\nKate's Well was also the scene of the local legendary giant [[Bertram de Shotts]]' demise where his head was decapitated as he drank from the well.\n\n===Skate Park===\nIn November 2019 it was announced that through successful campaigning thanks to the local community council, funding would be released for a new skate park, this will be located to the most eastward (bottom end) side of the King George Fifth park off Main Street and Jock's Road.\n\n===Miner Statue===\nIn November 2019 it was also announced along with the new skate park, would be a new miner statue to commemorate the villages rich mining history.\nThe statue location is being narrowed down to one of two locations, the first being the Jubilee Garden next to the community centre or the second being next to one of the village welcome gateways where it would be seen more prominently.\n\n===The Transmitters===\nSalsburgh is the locale of the twin [[Black Hill transmitting station|BlackHill Transmitters]] due to its high position towering above the M8 motorway opposite the church. They can be seen as far as [[Bathgate]], West Lothian to the east and [[Glasgow]] to the west. The transmitters are quite a prominent feature after dark for miles around, due to the coloured red lights which prevent aircraft from striking the towers.\n\nThe [[Kirk o'Shotts transmitting station]] is also nearby, which formerly carried a TV service and today carries DAB radio.\n\n===Pre-fabricated buildings===\nNot many know that Salsburgh was one of the first places in Scotland to have a \"pre-fab\", a pre-fabricated building with corrugated steel walls built. The first ever pre-fab was built in the village in 1945.<ref>http://www.salsburghheritagegroup.co.uk/images/First-Prefab.jpg?951</ref>\n\n===Schools and nurseries===\n*Kirk O' Shott's Primary School (public, non-denominational)\n*Rowantree Nursery / Kirk O' Shott's Nursery\n\n===Places of worship===\n*Kirk O' Shott's Parish Church (Protestant)\n*Sacred Heart R.C Chapel (Catholic)\n*Salsburgh Gospel Hall (Christian)\n\n==Geography==\n{{Geographic location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring towns, villages and places'''\n|Northwest = [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire]]\n|North     = [[Plains, North Lanarkshire]]\n|Northeast = [[Blackridge, West Lothian]]\n|West      = [[Newhouse, North Lanarkshire|Newhouse]]\n|Centre    = Salsburgh\n|East      = [[Harthill, Scotland]]\n|Southwest = [[Carfin]]\n|South     = [[Hareshaw]]\n|Southeast = [[Shotts]]}}\n\n===Climate===\nSalsburgh has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Salsburgh ({{convert|277|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} asl, averages 1981\u20132010)\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| Jan high C = 4.9\n| Feb high C = 5.2\n| Mar high C = 7.1\n| Apr high C = 10.0\n| May high C = 13.1\n| Jun high C = 15.7\n| Jul high C = 17.5\n| Aug high C = 17.1\n| Sep high C = 14.5\n| Oct high C = 10.9\n| Nov high C = 7.4\n| Dec high C = 5.1\n| year high C = \n| Jan low C = 0.2\n| Feb low C = 0.1\n| Mar low C = 1.1\n| Apr low C = 2.7\n| May low C = 5.4\n| Jun low C = 8.0\n| Jul low C = 9.9\n| Aug low C = 9.7\n| Sep low C = 8.0\n| Oct low C = 5.1\n| Nov low C = 2.4\n| Dec low C = 0.5\n| year low C = \n| Jan rain mm = 105.9\n| Feb rain mm = 77.2\n| Mar rain mm = 93.6\n| Apr rain mm = 62.0\n| May rain mm = 68.6\n| Jun rain mm = 75.9\n| Jul rain mm = 83.4\n| Aug rain mm = 104.3\n| Sep rain mm = 99.5\n| Oct rain mm = 122.9\n| Nov rain mm = 98.5\n| Dec rain mm = 100.9\n| year rain mm = \n| unit rain days = 1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 17.1\n| Feb rain days = 12.8\n| Mar rain days = 15.7\n| Apr rain days = 12.9\n| May rain days = 12.5\n| Jun rain days = 12.9\n| Jul rain days = 13.5\n| Aug rain days = 14.7\n| Sep rain days = 13.9\n| Oct rain days = 16.9\n| Nov rain days = 16.1\n| Dec rain days = 15.5\n| year rain days = \n| source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/uk-climate-averages/gcvjzc679 |title=Salsburgh (North Lanarkshire) UK climate averages |publisher=Met Office |access-date=24 March 2020 |archive-url=http://archive.is/fuQ6I |archive-date=24 March 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Homes==\nThroughout the years there have been a variety of mixed styles of properties in the village, beginning with prefabs (prefabricated structures with tin roofs) which were then replaced with more substantial council authority brick-built homes.\n\nThe village today consists of detached, semi-detached, terraced, bungalows, cottages, miners' row cottages (most of which are council authority and/or privately owned former local authority properties) and also fully renovated former derelict properties and new builds such as Salsburgh Meadows and the new builds situated in sections of Main Street.\n\nThe mix of old (miners' rows) and new (Salsburgh Meadows) makes the village quaint and gives it a certain charm retaining the old buildings from years gone by.\n\nSalsburgh is one of the only places in North Lanarkshire that does not have a gas main, as it was not cost effective when the pipes were being laid.  Services are provided independently by oil/LPG and, surprisingly, coal suppliers.\n\nMost if not all street names within the village have some significance to the village's history and/or former residents.\n\n==Landmarks==\n* [[Shottskirk|Kirk O' Shott's Parish Church: 'The M8 Church']]\n* [[Black Hill transmitting station|Blackhill Transmitters]]\n\nOther landmarks include the footbridge which crosses the B7066 main road, which was struck by a careless crane driver in 2009.<ref>http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/miracle-escape-lorry-destroys-bridge-2832089</ref> It was rebuilt and reopened in 2014.\n\n==Population==\nThe 2001 census recorded a population of 1310.

Shotts was a dreary moorland place on the Great Road of the Shire, which was an important route for tradesman carrying their wares around Scotland. Bertram de Shotts habitually savaged packmen and peddlers for treasure carried along the Great Road, and King James IV of Scotland ordered his death. De Shotts was probably in fact only six or seven feet high, yet his presence merited giant status.\n* [[Jamie Dolan]] (born 22 February 1969 in Salsburgh \u2013 31 August 2008) was a Scottish professional footballer who played for Motherwell, Dundee United, Dunfermline Athletic, Livingston, Forfar Athletic and Partick Thistle\n* [[Nat Muir]] (born 12 March 1958) is a Scottish retired long-distance runner.

A new school was built to the east end of the village and was opened in August 1912 as Shottskirk Public School,<ref>[http://www.friendsofkirkoshottsschool.co.uk Shottskirk Public School]</ref> which later reverted to its original roots as Kirk O' Shott's in 1958 as a junior / secondary school.\n\nKirk O' Shott's Public School still thrives today as a busy public primary school serving the local community of Salsburgh and surrounding hamlets and proudly celebrated its centenary on 12 August 2012. Kirk O' Shott's remains a public school open to all denominations.\n\n===Kirk O' Shott's (Shottskirk) Parish Church===\nKirk O' Shott's Parish Church is the name of the local church which serves the parish of Salsburgh, Shotts and surrounding area. The church was formerly a Catholic place of worship under the name St. Catherines, taken from Catherine of Sienna. About 550 years ago Bothwell and Shotts formed one parish which stretched from the Clyde to Linlithgowshire, and from the North to the South Calder. In this large area there were four places of worship, one of which was situated in the middle Bothwellmuir at \"a desert place called Bertram-Shotts\". Bertram was reputed to be a giant who lived in the area and terrorised travellers on the Glasgow/Edinburgh road. A reward was offered for his capture - dead or alive - and was claimed by William Muirhead who lay in wait for Bertram when the latter came to his favourite drinking place, a spring of water on the hillside above Shottsburn. He hamstrung him and, as the giant lay laughing up at him, he cut off his head with the words, \"Will ye laugh-up yet?\"\n\nIt was on Bertram's plot of land that St. Catherine's Chapel was built in 1450. It was dedicated to \"the blessed Virgin and Catherine of Sienna\".\n\nAfter the Reformation of 1560, Kirk o\u2019Shotts, otherwise known as [[Shottskirk]] or the affectionately titled \"M8 Church\", became a Protestant place of worship. The old church of St Catherine\u2019s must have suffered many changes and required frequent changes since its foundation, but of these there is no account before 1640. In that year the Presbytery met at Shotts and ordered that the church be repaired and partly rebuilt, but it was more than eight years before the work was completed. The site of the old church is marked by the headstone erected to Samuel Meuros, who was session clerk and school master from 1794 to 1837. He was also Precentor, and it was his wish to be buried where his old desk had stood; thus he lies still at his post. On the back of the stone is the following inscription:\n\n\"Here stood the Precentor\u2019s desk in the Kirk of Bertram Shotts which was rebuilt and extended in 1642\".\n\nThis stone and the burial ground of the Inglises of Murdoston, which was inside the old church, give a clear idea of the site.\n\nShottskirk Cemetery is reported to be haunted by a mysterious grey figure who vanished to and from the mist when a driver reported having hit a grey figure on the B7066 road which runs adjacent to the Church and graveyard.\n\n===St. Catherine's Well / \"Kate's Well\"===\nSt. Catherine's Well or \"[[Kate's Well]]\" is a natural holy spring well on holy ground at the foot of Kirk O'Shott's Parish Church, otherwise known as Shottskirk, in the village of Salsburgh, North Lanarkshire. The well dates back to the 14th century and derives from the church's former past when it was a Catholic place of worship as St. Catherines Chapel which has origins from Catherine of Sienna.\n\nKate's Well was also the scene of the local legendary giant [[Bertram de Shotts]]' demise where his head was decapitated as he drank from the well.\n\n===Skate Park===\nIn November 2019 it was announced that through successful campaigning thanks to the local community council, funding would be released for a new skate park, this will be located to the most eastward (bottom end) side of the King George Fifth park off Main Street and Jock's Road.\n\n===Miner Statue===\nIn November 2019 it was also announced along with the new skate park, would be a new miner statue to commemorate the villages rich mining history.\nThe statue location is being narrowed down to one of two locations, the first being the Jubilee Garden next to the community centre or the second being next to one of the village welcome gateways where it would be seen more prominently.\n\n===The Transmitters===\nSalsburgh is the locale of the twin [[Black Hill transmitting station|BlackHill Transmitters]] due to its high position towering above the M8 motorway opposite the church. They can be seen as far as [[Bathgate]], West Lothian to the east and [[Glasgow]] to the west. The transmitters are quite a prominent feature after dark for miles around, due to the coloured red lights which prevent aircraft from striking the towers.\n\nThe [[Kirk o'Shotts transmitting station]] is also nearby, which formerly carried a TV service and today carries DAB radio.\n\n===Pre-fabricated buildings===\nNot many know that Salsburgh was one of the first places in Scotland to have a \"pre-fab\", a pre-fabricated building with corrugated steel walls built. The first ever pre-fab was built in the village in 1945.<ref>http://www.salsburghheritagegroup.co.uk/images/First-Prefab.jpg?951</ref>\n\n===Schools and nurseries===\n*Kirk O' Shott's Primary School (public, non-denominational)\n*Rowantree Nursery / Kirk O' Shott's Nursery\n\n===Places of worship===\n*Kirk O' Shott's Parish Church (Protestant)\n*Sacred Heart R.C Chapel (Catholic)\n*Salsburgh Gospel Hall (Christian)\n\n==Geography==\n{{Geographic location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring towns, villages and places'''\n|Northwest = [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire]]\n|North     = [[Plains, North Lanarkshire]]\n|Northeast = [[Blackridge, West Lothian]]\n|West      = [[Newhouse, North Lanarkshire|Newhouse]]\n|Centre    = Salsburgh\n|East      = [[Harthill, Scotland]]\n|Southwest = [[Carfin]]\n|South     = [[Hareshaw]]\n|Southeast = [[Shotts]]}}\n\n===Climate===\nSalsburgh has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'').\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Salsburgh ({{convert|277|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} asl, averages 1981\u20132010)\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| Jan high C = 4.9\n| Feb high C = 5.2\n| Mar high C = 7.1\n| Apr high C = 10.0\n| May high C = 13.1\n| Jun high C = 15.7\n| Jul high C = 17.5\n| Aug high C = 17.1\n| Sep high C = 14.5\n| Oct high C = 10.9\n| Nov high C = 7.4\n| Dec high C = 5.1\n| year high C = \n| Jan low C = 0.2\n| Feb low C = 0.1\n| Mar low C = 1.1\n| Apr low C = 2.7\n| May low C = 5.4\n| Jun low C = 8.0\n| Jul low C = 9.9\n| Aug low C = 9.7\n| Sep low C = 8.0\n| Oct low C = 5.1\n| Nov low C = 2.4\n| Dec low C = 0.5\n| year low C = \n| Jan rain mm = 105.9\n| Feb rain mm = 77.2\n| Mar rain mm = 93.6\n| Apr rain mm = 62.0\n| May rain mm = 68.6\n| Jun rain mm = 75.9\n| Jul rain mm = 83.4\n| Aug rain mm = 104.3\n| Sep rain mm = 99.5\n| Oct rain mm = 122.9\n| Nov rain mm = 98.5\n| Dec rain mm = 100.9\n| year rain mm = \n| unit rain days = 1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 17.1\n| Feb rain days = 12.8\n| Mar rain days = 15.7\n| Apr rain days = 12.9\n| May rain days = 12.5\n| Jun rain days = 12.9\n| Jul rain days = 13.5\n| Aug rain days = 14.7\n| Sep rain days = 13.9\n| Oct rain days = 16.9\n| Nov rain days = 16.1\n| Dec rain days = 15.5\n| year rain days = \n| source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/uk-climate-averages/gcvjzc679 |title=Salsburgh (North Lanarkshire) UK climate averages |publisher=Met Office |access-date=24 March 2020 |archive-url=http://archive.is/fuQ6I |archive-date=24 March 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Homes==\nThroughout the years there have been a variety of mixed styles of properties in the village, beginning with prefabs (prefabricated structures with tin roofs) which were then replaced with more substantial council authority brick-built homes.\n\nThe village today consists of detached, semi-detached, terraced, bungalows, cottages, miners' row cottages (most of which are council authority and/or privately owned former local authority properties) and also fully renovated former derelict properties and new builds such as Salsburgh Meadows and the new builds situated in sections of Main Street.\n\nThe mix of old (miners' rows) and new (Salsburgh Meadows) makes the village quaint and gives it a certain charm retaining the old buildings from years gone by.\n\nSalsburgh is one of the only places in North Lanarkshire that does not have a gas main, as it was not cost effective when the pipes were being laid.

Shotts was a dreary moorland place on the Great Road of the Shire, which was an important route for tradesman carrying their wares around Scotland. Bertram de Shotts habitually savaged packmen and peddlers for treasure carried along the Great Road, and King James IV of Scotland ordered his death. De Shotts was probably in fact only six or seven feet high, yet his presence merited giant status.\n* [[Jamie Dolan]] (born 22 February 1969 in Salsburgh \u2013 31 August 2008) was a Scottish professional footballer who played for Motherwell, Dundee United, Dunfermline Athletic, Livingston, Forfar Athletic and Partick Thistle\n* [[Nat Muir]] (born 12 March 1958) is a Scottish retired long-distance runner.

According to Greenburg, the trial transcript refers to him on first mention as \"Nat alias Nat Turner\" and subsequently as \"Nat\".  Thomas Ruffin Gray's ''The Confessions of Nat Turner'', which purports to be Turner's confession and account of his life leading up the rebellion, was the most influential source of the name by which he is known, Greenburg writes.</ref> Turner knew little about the background of his father, who was believed to have escaped from slavery when Turner was a young boy.<ref>Greenburg 2003, p. 18.</ref>\n\nTurner spent his entire life in Southampton County, a [[plantation]] area where slaves comprised the majority of the population.<ref>Greenburg 2003, p. 278.</ref> He was identified as having \"natural intelligence and quickness of apprehension, surpassed by few.\"<ref>Bisson, ''Nat Turner: Slave Revolt Leader'' (2005), p. 76.</ref> He learned to read and write at a young age.

According to Greenburg, the trial transcript refers to him on first mention as \"Nat alias Nat Turner\" and subsequently as \"Nat\".  Thomas Ruffin Gray's ''The Confessions of Nat Turner'', which purports to be Turner's confession and account of his life leading up the rebellion, was the most influential source of the name by which he is known, Greenburg writes.</ref> Turner knew little about the background of his father, who was believed to have escaped from slavery when Turner was a young boy.<ref>Greenburg 2003, p. 18.</ref>\n\nTurner spent his entire life in Southampton County, a [[plantation]] area where slaves comprised the majority of the population.<ref>Greenburg 2003, p. 278.</ref> He was identified as having \"natural intelligence and quickness of apprehension, surpassed by few.\"<ref>Bisson, ''Nat Turner: Slave Revolt Leader'' (2005), p. 76.</ref> He learned to read and write at a young age.

His belief in the visions was such that when Turner was 22 years old, he ran away from his owner; he returned a month later after claiming to have received a spiritual revelation. Turner often conducted services, preaching the Bible to his fellow slaves, who dubbed him \"The [[Prophet]]\". Turner garnered white followers such as Etheldred T.

Alfred was married, his wife being the sister of Collan, [[Hexham Abbey|prior of Hexham]]. His date of death is unknown, but he is recorded to be still alive at the time of Bishop \u00c6thelwine (1056\u201371); Crook speculates that he might have died just before the [[Norman Conquest]].<ref name=Crook_p98>Crook 2011, pp. 98\u201399</ref><ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 11\u201312, 14, 24</ref>\n\nAlfred's son Eilaf Larwa and his grandson, also named Eilaf, each succeeded him as the priest at Hexham.<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 11\u201312, 23</ref> A grandson Aldred or Aluredus is also recorded as a shrine keeper.<ref>Crook 2011, p. 101</ref> The saint [[Aelred of Rievaulx|Ailred]], [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbot of [[Rievaulx Abbey|Rievaulx]], was Alfred's great-grandson.<ref name=Offler_p592 /><ref name=Kendall_1984_p11-12 /><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 98, 102</ref>\n\n==Relic collector==\n[[File:Cuthbert and Boisil.jpg|right|thumb|[[Boisil]] greeting [[Cuthbert]] at [[Melrose Abbey]]]]\nAlfred was an assiduous collector of relics of saints for Cuthbert's shrine at Durham as well as the church at Hexham. The medieval specialist [[Bertram Colgrave]] describes him as \"the arch-relic-hunter\", exemplifying the \"rage for relics\" of his time.<ref>Colgrave 1985, pp. 318, 339\u201340</ref> Symeon explicitly records his having [[translation (relic)|ceremonially moved]] (translated) the remains of the following saints, after having been informed of their whereabouts by [[vision (spirituality)|visions]]:<ref name=Kendall_1988_p510 /><ref name=ODonnell_p137-9>O'Donnell 2014, pp. 137\u201339</ref><ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 2\u20133, 12\u201316, 20</ref><ref>Farmer 2011, pp. 2, 34, 52</ref><ref>Colgrave 1985, pp. 318, 246</ref><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 99, 102\u20133</ref>\n*[[Boisil]] (died 661) of [[Melrose Abbey]], mentor to Cuthbert, whose remains were deposited in their own shrine in Durham in around 1020;\n*[[Baldred of Tyninghame|Balther]] (or Baldred; died 756 or 757) of the monastery of Tyningham, named as an [[anchorite]];\n*[[Billfrith|Bilfrid]] (or Billfrith), a Lindisfarne goldsmith and anchorite known for working the ornate case of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], now lost;\n*[[Acca of Hexham|Acca]] (died 740) and [[Alchmund of Hexham|Alchmund]] (or Alcmund; died 780 or 781), two of the Hexham bishops, who were reburied in the church at Hexham in around 1040; according to some sources, parts of their relics were also translated to Durham; \n*[[Oswine of Deira|Oswin]] (died 651), the murdered king of Deira, who had a following at [[Tynemouth]]; \n*the abbesses [[\u00c6bbe of Coldingham|Ebba]] (or \u00c6bbe; died 683) of [[Coldingham]] and \u00c6thelgitha, an otherwise-unknown abbess, possibly also from Coldingham or another Northumberland convent.\n\n===Hexham bishops: Acca, Alchmund and Eata===\nA variant version of the story of [[Alchmund of Hexham]]'s translation is given by an anonymous author, probably from Hexham, in the ''Historia Regum''. The vision of Bishop Alchmund is here given to a person referred to as \"Dregmo\", who summons Alfred to rebury the remains in Hexham church. Alfred complies, but secretly takes a fingerbone, which he plans to take to the shrine in Durham. On the following day the saint's bier proves immovable from the portico; Dregmo has a second vision exposing the theft, to which Alfred readily admits. After the restoration of the fingerbone, the ceremony proceeds unhindered. This version is repeated by [[Aelred of Rievaulx|Ailred of Rievaulx]].<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 12\u201314</ref><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 100\u20131</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Historia Regum'' as well as the accounts of [[Richard of Hexham]] and Ailred of Rievaulx, when [[Acca of Hexham|Bishop Acca]] was reburied in Hexham, several relics were removed undamaged from his grave. These included some of his vestments ([[chasuble]], [[dalmatic]] and [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]]), his [[shroud]] and a silk tunic, as well as a wooden portable altar. The chasuble and portions of his \"face-cloth\" appear in a list of Durham Cathedral's relics compiled in 1383.<ref>Crook 2011, p. 100</ref>\n\nThe 12th-century ''Life of St Eata'' suggests that a third Hexham bishop and saint, [[Eata of Hexham|Eata]] (died 686), might also have been translated within the Hexham church by Alfred, although he is not mentioned in either Symeon's list of saints or Ailred's work. Eata also served as Abbot of Melrose Abbey and Bishop of Lindisfarne, and had taught both Cuthbert and Boisil.<ref>Crook 2011, pp. 101\u20132</ref>\n\n===Theft of Bede===\n[[File:Bede.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bede]]'s tomb at [[Durham Cathedral]]]]\nAlfred is also traditionally reported to have stolen the bones of the scholar and saint [[Bede]] (died 735) from its shrine in [[Monkwearmouth\u2013Jarrow Abbey|Jarrow]], and translated them to Durham in secret.<ref>For example, Offler 1962, pp. 592\u201393; Kendall 1984, pp. 1, 3\u20136; Farmer 2011, p. 40; Colgrave 1985, pp. 339\u201340; Ward 1998, pp. 140\u201341; Crook 2011, pp. 102\u20133.</ref>  Symeon's detailed account is uncharacteristically circumspect. No vision is mentioned. After establishing that Alfred was in the habit of commemorating Bede's death by visiting the Jarrow monastery, it states that one year he arrived back early, having left his companions behind, and never returned to Jarrow. He is then said to have acted as if he had \"secured the object of his desires\", saying when asked about the whereabouts of Bede's bones that they were in Cuthbert's shrine, but enjoining his listeners to keep the matter to themselves. When Cuthbert's coffin was opened a few days before its translation to the Norman cathedral, around half a century after Alfred's death, a little linen bag was discovered, subsequently claimed to contain Bede's bones.<ref name=Kendall_1984_p1,4ff>Kendall 1984, pp. 1, 3\u20136</ref><ref name=Ward_1998_p140-1>Ward 1998, pp. 140\u201341</ref><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 102\u20133</ref> The story has some similarities with the 9th-century theft by Ariviscus of the French [[Saint Faith|Sainte Foy]]'s relics from [[Agen]], [[Aquitaine]].<ref>Kendall 1984, note 82, p. 26</ref>\n\nThe discovery of the bag is also described by an eye-witness to the opening of the coffin in the later \"Miracle 18\" account. The anonymous author states that Bede's bones were known to have been removed from his original burial place in Jarrow; he names Alfred only indirectly as the person who also translated Boisil's remains.<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 8\u20139</ref><ref>Crook 2011, p. 103</ref>\n\nKendall notes that examinations of Cuthbert's coffin in the 1050s are not recorded to have found a linen bag. He considers the tradition of Alfred's secret translation of Bede to be \"probably apocryphal\", inferring that it was invented to provide provenance for the unidentified bones in the linen bag.<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 1, 6, 9, 16\u201319</ref> Some subsequent 20th- and 21st-century scholars have also cast doubts on the story's authenticity.<ref name=Story_2015>Story & Bailey 2015, section \"The Bedan identity of Symeon's bagged bones\" and note 59</ref> Ward describes it as a \"strange story\", and draws attention to its close parallels with the medieval \"pious theft\" literary tradition, a genre that embraces wholly fictional accounts.<ref name=Ward_1998_p140ff /><ref>Geary 2011, pp. 12\u201314</ref> She notes that the earliest written account of the removal of the bones dates from at least 100 years later, there is no external evidence for Alfred's action, and the attendant secrecy meant that the translation did not fulfil its purpose. She suggests another possibility: that monks from Jarrow translated the remains in 1083 when the [[Benedictine]] priory was founded in Durham.<ref name=Ward_1998_p140ff />\n\n==Medieval sources==\n[[File:De Speculo Caritatis.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Aelred of Rievaulx|St Ailred of Rievaulx]], Alfred's great-grandson, is one source for his life]]\nAlfred's history is relatively well attested, being documented in manuscripts including:<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 8, 11\u201312, 14\u201316</ref><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 98\u2013102</ref>\n*''An Account of the Early Provosts of Hexham'' (c. 1100); \n*the ''[[Libellus de exordio]]'' (1104\u201315) of [[Symeon of Durham]]; \n*a section of the multiply authored ''Historia Regum'' (1113\u201364), possibly contributed by someone from Hexham; \n*the anonymous \"Miracle 18\" narrative in ''Capitula de Miraculis et Translationibus Sancti Cuthberti'' (after 1128); \n*the ''History of the Church of Hexham'' (1154\u2013c.1160) by Prior [[Richard of Hexham]]; \n*''On the Saints of Hexham'' (1154\u201367) by [[Aelred of Rievaulx|Ailred of Rievaulx]]; \n*''The Life of St Eata'' (12th century), an anonymous compilation covering the Hexham saints;\n*the ''Libellus de admirandis beati Cuthberti virtutibus quae novellis patratae sunt temporibus'' (c. 1150\u201375) of [[Reginald of Durham]].<ref name=Cuthbert_odnb /> \nAlthough few if any of these writers could have been eye-witnesses to his acts, Symeon's narrative is in part based on the testimony of a monk named as Gamel, possibly one of Alfred's priestly deputies; Richard was acquainted with the second Eilaf, his grandson; and Reginald claims that at least some of his additions were sourced to Ailred and recounted traditions handed down within the family.<ref name=Kendall_1984_p15 /><ref name=Crook_p98 /> Kendall considers that the early Hexham accounts are likely to be independent from Symeon's account, unlike Reginald's significantly later narrative.<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 11\u201312, 14\u201316</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Durham (poem)|''Durham'']], a poem extolling Durham's relic collection\n*[[St Cuthbert's coffin]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n*{{citation |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cmOp0A7acHoC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false |author=Aird, W.

Alfred was married, his wife being the sister of Collan, [[Hexham Abbey|prior of Hexham]]. His date of death is unknown, but he is recorded to be still alive at the time of Bishop \u00c6thelwine (1056\u201371); Crook speculates that he might have died just before the [[Norman Conquest]].<ref name=Crook_p98>Crook 2011, pp. 98\u201399</ref><ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 11\u201312, 14, 24</ref>\n\nAlfred's son Eilaf Larwa and his grandson, also named Eilaf, each succeeded him as the priest at Hexham.<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 11\u201312, 23</ref> A grandson Aldred or Aluredus is also recorded as a shrine keeper.<ref>Crook 2011, p. 101</ref> The saint [[Aelred of Rievaulx|Ailred]], [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbot of [[Rievaulx Abbey|Rievaulx]], was Alfred's great-grandson.<ref name=Offler_p592 /><ref name=Kendall_1984_p11-12 /><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 98, 102</ref>\n\n==Relic collector==\n[[File:Cuthbert and Boisil.jpg|right|thumb|[[Boisil]] greeting [[Cuthbert]] at [[Melrose Abbey]]]]\nAlfred was an assiduous collector of relics of saints for Cuthbert's shrine at Durham as well as the church at Hexham. The medieval specialist [[Bertram Colgrave]] describes him as \"the arch-relic-hunter\", exemplifying the \"rage for relics\" of his time.<ref>Colgrave 1985, pp. 318, 339\u201340</ref> Symeon explicitly records his having [[translation (relic)|ceremonially moved]] (translated) the remains of the following saints, after having been informed of their whereabouts by [[vision (spirituality)|visions]]:<ref name=Kendall_1988_p510 /><ref name=ODonnell_p137-9>O'Donnell 2014, pp. 137\u201339</ref><ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 2\u20133, 12\u201316, 20</ref><ref>Farmer 2011, pp. 2, 34, 52</ref><ref>Colgrave 1985, pp. 318, 246</ref><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 99, 102\u20133</ref>\n*[[Boisil]] (died 661) of [[Melrose Abbey]], mentor to Cuthbert, whose remains were deposited in their own shrine in Durham in around 1020;\n*[[Baldred of Tyninghame|Balther]] (or Baldred; died 756 or 757) of the monastery of Tyningham, named as an [[anchorite]];\n*[[Billfrith|Bilfrid]] (or Billfrith), a Lindisfarne goldsmith and anchorite known for working the ornate case of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], now lost;\n*[[Acca of Hexham|Acca]] (died 740) and [[Alchmund of Hexham|Alchmund]] (or Alcmund; died 780 or 781), two of the Hexham bishops, who were reburied in the church at Hexham in around 1040; according to some sources, parts of their relics were also translated to Durham; \n*[[Oswine of Deira|Oswin]] (died 651), the murdered king of Deira, who had a following at [[Tynemouth]]; \n*the abbesses [[\u00c6bbe of Coldingham|Ebba]] (or \u00c6bbe; died 683) of [[Coldingham]] and \u00c6thelgitha, an otherwise-unknown abbess, possibly also from Coldingham or another Northumberland convent.\n\n===Hexham bishops: Acca, Alchmund and Eata===\nA variant version of the story of [[Alchmund of Hexham]]'s translation is given by an anonymous author, probably from Hexham, in the ''Historia Regum''. The vision of Bishop Alchmund is here given to a person referred to as \"Dregmo\", who summons Alfred to rebury the remains in Hexham church. Alfred complies, but secretly takes a fingerbone, which he plans to take to the shrine in Durham. On the following day the saint's bier proves immovable from the portico; Dregmo has a second vision exposing the theft, to which Alfred readily admits. After the restoration of the fingerbone, the ceremony proceeds unhindered. This version is repeated by [[Aelred of Rievaulx|Ailred of Rievaulx]].<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 12\u201314</ref><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 100\u20131</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Historia Regum'' as well as the accounts of [[Richard of Hexham]] and Ailred of Rievaulx, when [[Acca of Hexham|Bishop Acca]] was reburied in Hexham, several relics were removed undamaged from his grave. These included some of his vestments ([[chasuble]], [[dalmatic]] and [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]]), his [[shroud]] and a silk tunic, as well as a wooden portable altar. The chasuble and portions of his \"face-cloth\" appear in a list of Durham Cathedral's relics compiled in 1383.<ref>Crook 2011, p. 100</ref>\n\nThe 12th-century ''Life of St Eata'' suggests that a third Hexham bishop and saint, [[Eata of Hexham|Eata]] (died 686), might also have been translated within the Hexham church by Alfred, although he is not mentioned in either Symeon's list of saints or Ailred's work. Eata also served as Abbot of Melrose Abbey and Bishop of Lindisfarne, and had taught both Cuthbert and Boisil.<ref>Crook 2011, pp. 101\u20132</ref>\n\n===Theft of Bede===\n[[File:Bede.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bede]]'s tomb at [[Durham Cathedral]]]]\nAlfred is also traditionally reported to have stolen the bones of the scholar and saint [[Bede]] (died 735) from its shrine in [[Monkwearmouth\u2013Jarrow Abbey|Jarrow]], and translated them to Durham in secret.<ref>For example, Offler 1962, pp. 592\u201393; Kendall 1984, pp. 1, 3\u20136; Farmer 2011, p. 40; Colgrave 1985, pp. 339\u201340; Ward 1998, pp. 140\u201341; Crook 2011, pp. 102\u20133.</ref>  Symeon's detailed account is uncharacteristically circumspect. No vision is mentioned. After establishing that Alfred was in the habit of commemorating Bede's death by visiting the Jarrow monastery, it states that one year he arrived back early, having left his companions behind, and never returned to Jarrow. He is then said to have acted as if he had \"secured the object of his desires\", saying when asked about the whereabouts of Bede's bones that they were in Cuthbert's shrine, but enjoining his listeners to keep the matter to themselves. When Cuthbert's coffin was opened a few days before its translation to the Norman cathedral, around half a century after Alfred's death, a little linen bag was discovered, subsequently claimed to contain Bede's bones.<ref name=Kendall_1984_p1,4ff>Kendall 1984, pp. 1, 3\u20136</ref><ref name=Ward_1998_p140-1>Ward 1998, pp. 140\u201341</ref><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 102\u20133</ref> The story has some similarities with the 9th-century theft by Ariviscus of the French [[Saint Faith|Sainte Foy]]'s relics from [[Agen]], [[Aquitaine]].<ref>Kendall 1984, note 82, p. 26</ref>\n\nThe discovery of the bag is also described by an eye-witness to the opening of the coffin in the later \"Miracle 18\" account. The anonymous author states that Bede's bones were known to have been removed from his original burial place in Jarrow; he names Alfred only indirectly as the person who also translated Boisil's remains.<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 8\u20139</ref><ref>Crook 2011, p. 103</ref>\n\nKendall notes that examinations of Cuthbert's coffin in the 1050s are not recorded to have found a linen bag. He considers the tradition of Alfred's secret translation of Bede to be \"probably apocryphal\", inferring that it was invented to provide provenance for the unidentified bones in the linen bag.<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 1, 6, 9, 16\u201319</ref> Some subsequent 20th- and 21st-century scholars have also cast doubts on the story's authenticity.<ref name=Story_2015>Story & Bailey 2015, section \"The Bedan identity of Symeon's bagged bones\" and note 59</ref> Ward describes it as a \"strange story\", and draws attention to its close parallels with the medieval \"pious theft\" literary tradition, a genre that embraces wholly fictional accounts.<ref name=Ward_1998_p140ff /><ref>Geary 2011, pp. 12\u201314</ref> She notes that the earliest written account of the removal of the bones dates from at least 100 years later, there is no external evidence for Alfred's action, and the attendant secrecy meant that the translation did not fulfil its purpose. She suggests another possibility: that monks from Jarrow translated the remains in 1083 when the [[Benedictine]] priory was founded in Durham.<ref name=Ward_1998_p140ff />\n\n==Medieval sources==\n[[File:De Speculo Caritatis.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Aelred of Rievaulx|St Ailred of Rievaulx]], Alfred's great-grandson, is one source for his life]]\nAlfred's history is relatively well attested, being documented in manuscripts including:<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 8, 11\u201312, 14\u201316</ref><ref>Crook 2011, pp. 98\u2013102</ref>\n*''An Account of the Early Provosts of Hexham'' (c. 1100); \n*the ''[[Libellus de exordio]]'' (1104\u201315) of [[Symeon of Durham]]; \n*a section of the multiply authored ''Historia Regum'' (1113\u201364), possibly contributed by someone from Hexham; \n*the anonymous \"Miracle 18\" narrative in ''Capitula de Miraculis et Translationibus Sancti Cuthberti'' (after 1128); \n*the ''History of the Church of Hexham'' (1154\u2013c.1160) by Prior [[Richard of Hexham]]; \n*''On the Saints of Hexham'' (1154\u201367) by [[Aelred of Rievaulx|Ailred of Rievaulx]]; \n*''The Life of St Eata'' (12th century), an anonymous compilation covering the Hexham saints;\n*the ''Libellus de admirandis beati Cuthberti virtutibus quae novellis patratae sunt temporibus'' (c. 1150\u201375) of [[Reginald of Durham]].<ref name=Cuthbert_odnb /> \nAlthough few if any of these writers could have been eye-witnesses to his acts, Symeon's narrative is in part based on the testimony of a monk named as Gamel, possibly one of Alfred's priestly deputies; Richard was acquainted with the second Eilaf, his grandson; and Reginald claims that at least some of his additions were sourced to Ailred and recounted traditions handed down within the family.<ref name=Kendall_1984_p15 /><ref name=Crook_p98 /> Kendall considers that the early Hexham accounts are likely to be independent from Symeon's account, unlike Reginald's significantly later narrative.<ref>Kendall 1984, pp. 11\u201312, 14\u201316</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Durham (poem)|''Durham'']], a poem extolling Durham's relic collection\n*[[St Cuthbert's coffin]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n*{{citation |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cmOp0A7acHoC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false |author=Aird, W.
