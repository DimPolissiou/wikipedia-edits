She is considered to be a central figure in one of the great art movements of the century.  Throughout her career, Noskowiak photographed quite a few subjects those including landscapes, still lives and portraits. Her most well-known, and unacknowledged, portraits are of the author, John Steinbeck. In 1936, Noskowiak was awarded a prize at the annual exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artist. She was also represented in the San Francisco Museum of Art\u2019s 1939 \u201cScenes from San Francisco\u201d exhibit. Ten years before her death, Noskowiak's work was included in a WPA exhibition at the Oakland Museum, in Oakland, California.\n\n\n\n==Life==\n===Early Life===\nNoskowiak was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]. Her father was a landscape gardener who instilled in her an awareness of the land that would later become evident in her photography.<ref name=\"Darsie2002\">{{cite book|author=Darsie Alexander|title=Original Sources: Art and Archives at the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=2002|pages=149}}</ref> In her early years, she moved around the world while her father sought work in Chile, then Panama, before finally settling in Los Angeles, California in 1915.

Upon expressing her interest in photography Hagemeyer, wrote off dream as a joke in his diary. \n\n===Becoming a Photographer===\nIn early April 1929, Noskowiak met photographer [[Edward Weston]] at a party and the two began dating immediately; her eventually becoming his model, muse, pupil, and assistant. Weston first taught her to spot photos--touching up flaws in prints--before he giving her first professional camera. This camera included no film and for several months Noskowiak worked with Weston pretending to photograph while he taught her the mechanics of photography. During her time with Weston Noskowiak's photography developed tremendously showcasing her understanding of craftsmanship, as well as her own style. Several of Weston's works, such as Red Cabbage Halved and Artichoke Halved, were inspired by Noskowiak's early negatives.Weston even once stated: \"Any of these I would sign as my own.\" Dora Hagemeyer (sister-in-law of Johan) wrote that while Noskowiak's photographic style was clean and direct like Weston's, she \"put into her work something which is essentially her own: a subtle and delicate loveliness.\"<ref name=\"Hagemeyer1933\">{{cite journal|first=Dora|last=Hagemeyer|date=8 September 1933|title=Noskowiak Exhibit Important to Art|journal=Carmel Pine Cone|page=4}}</ref>\n==Photography==\n===Group F.64===\nPhotography in the late 1800s and early 1900s was defined by [[pictorialism]], a style that refers to a photographer manipulating an otherwise straightforward photograph in the means of 'creating'.

In 1932 Noskowiak became an organizing member of the short-lived [[Group f/64]], which included such important photographers as [[Ansel Adams]], [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Willard Van Dyke]], Weston and his son [[Brett Weston|Brett]].  Noskowiak's works were shown at Group f/64's inaugural exhibition at San Francisco's M.

She lived another ten years before passing away on April 28, 1975, in Greenbrae, California.  It is hard to say what legacy Noskowiak left behind as the discussion of her work began to dwindle after her break up with Weston.  Though there are a few people, such as the director of Weston Gallery in Carmel Richard Gadd, who believes that Noskowiak forged a path for young photographers.

In 2015, eight of Noskowiak\u2019s works were on view at the Allentown Art Museum in Pennsylvania. The exhibition, named Weston's Women, only acknowledges Noskowiaks and other female artists in their relation to Weston.

A [[hardcore punk]] and [[melodic hardcore]] album, it comprises thirteen tracks that focus on [[melody]], catchy [[hook (music)|hooks]], and rapid-paced [[tempo]]. Social and political issues as well as the concept of self-reflection constitute the majority of the lyrical content.\n\nDissatisfied with ''[[Siren Song of the Counter Culture]]''{{'s}} (2004) producer [[Garth Richardson]], the band members decided to record their next album with [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] and Jason Livermore, the duo that worked on their 2003 album ''[[Revolutions per Minute (Rise Against album)|Revolutions per Minute]]''. ''The Sufferer & the Witness'' sold 48,327 copies in its first week of release, and charted in seven countries, including the United States where it entered at position ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Critical appraisal was mainly positive, with reviewers complimenting Rise Against's ability to mature in its sound while simultaneously retain its punk roots. Reviewers also highlighted the vocals of singer [[Tim McIlrath]] and the production of Stevenson and Livermore.\n\nThree songs from ''The Sufferer & the Witness'' were released as [[single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Ready to Fall]]\", \"[[Prayer of the Refugee]]\", and \"[[The Good Left Undone]]\". All three songs charted on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in the United States, and accompanying [[music video]]s were produced. Rise Against supported the album with [[The Sufferer & the Witness Tour]] throughout the second half of 2006 and all of 2007. During the tour, guitarist Chris Chasse left the band and was replaced by [[Zach Blair]].\n\n==Background and production==\nIn August 2004, Rise Against released its [[record label|major record label]] debut album ''[[Siren Song of the Counter Culture]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/siren-song-of-the-counter-culture-mw0000208423|title=Siren Song of the Counter-Culture - Rise Against|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=April 10, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601063349/http://www.allmusic.com/album/siren-song-of-the-counter-culture-mw0000208423|archivedate=June 1, 2016}}</ref> A [[sleeper hit]] in the United States, it was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], denoting shipments of 500,000 copies.<ref name=\"Metal Hammer\">{{cite web|last=Everly|first=Dave|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-03-28/they-shall-overcome|title=They shall overcome|work=[[Metal Hammer]]|date=March 28, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170306224837/http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-03-28/they-shall-overcome|archivedate=March 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"RIAA\"/> ''Siren Song of the Counter Culture''{{'s}} success was largely due to the breakthrough [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Swing Life Away]]\", an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] [[ballad]] that starkly contrasted the band's typical hardcore oeuvre.<ref name=\"The AV Club Review\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Kyle|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/rise-against-emthe-sufferer-amp-the-witnessem-8854|title=Rise Against: The Sufferer & The Witness|work=[[The A.V.

A [[hardcore punk]] and [[melodic hardcore]] album, it comprises thirteen tracks that focus on [[melody]], catchy [[hook (music)|hooks]], and rapid-paced [[tempo]]. Social and political issues as well as the concept of self-reflection constitute the majority of the lyrical content.\n\nDissatisfied with ''[[Siren Song of the Counter Culture]]''{{'s}} (2004) producer [[Garth Richardson]], the band members decided to record their next album with [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] and Jason Livermore, the duo that worked on their 2003 album ''[[Revolutions per Minute (Rise Against album)|Revolutions per Minute]]''. ''The Sufferer & the Witness'' sold 48,327 copies in its first week of release, and charted in seven countries, including the United States where it entered at position ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Critical appraisal was mainly positive, with reviewers complimenting Rise Against's ability to mature in its sound while simultaneously retain its punk roots. Reviewers also highlighted the vocals of singer [[Tim McIlrath]] and the production of Stevenson and Livermore.\n\nThree songs from ''The Sufferer & the Witness'' were released as [[single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Ready to Fall]]\", \"[[Prayer of the Refugee]]\", and \"[[The Good Left Undone]]\". All three songs charted on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in the United States, and accompanying [[music video]]s were produced. Rise Against supported the album with [[The Sufferer & the Witness Tour]] throughout the second half of 2006 and all of 2007. During the tour, guitarist Chris Chasse left the band and was replaced by [[Zach Blair]].\n\n==Background and production==\nIn August 2004, Rise Against released its [[record label|major record label]] debut album ''[[Siren Song of the Counter Culture]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/siren-song-of-the-counter-culture-mw0000208423|title=Siren Song of the Counter-Culture - Rise Against|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=April 10, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601063349/http://www.allmusic.com/album/siren-song-of-the-counter-culture-mw0000208423|archivedate=June 1, 2016}}</ref> A [[sleeper hit]] in the United States, it was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], denoting shipments of 500,000 copies.<ref name=\"Metal Hammer\">{{cite web|last=Everly|first=Dave|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-03-28/they-shall-overcome|title=They shall overcome|work=[[Metal Hammer]]|date=March 28, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170306224837/http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-03-28/they-shall-overcome|archivedate=March 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"RIAA\"/> ''Siren Song of the Counter Culture''{{'s}} success was largely due to the breakthrough [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Swing Life Away]]\", an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] [[ballad]] that starkly contrasted the band's typical hardcore oeuvre.<ref name=\"The AV Club Review\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Kyle|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/rise-against-emthe-sufferer-amp-the-witnessem-8854|title=Rise Against: The Sufferer & The Witness|work=[[The A.V.

The mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be successfully reacquired on 27 March 1989.

''Phobos 2'' investigated Mars surface and atmosphere and returned 37 images of Phobos<ref name=ScienceMag>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v341/n6243/abs/341585a0.html Nature Publishing Group, Television observations of Phobos]</ref> with a resolution of up to 40 meters.\n\nShortly before the final phase of the mission, during which the spacecraft was to approach within {{val|50|u=m}} of Phobos' surface and release two landers (One, a mobile {{em|hopper}}, the other, a stationary platform) contact with ''Phobos 2'' was lost. The mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be successfully reacquired on 27 March 1989. The cause of the failure was determined to be a malfunction of the on-board [[computer]].<ref name=ScienceMag/>\n\n==Background==\n\nThe intent to carry out a mission with Phobos as the target was first made public 14 November 1984.<ref name=Harvey246 /> Phobos was chosen as the target after in order to avoid directly competing with previous american missions.<ref name=Harvey246 /> Originally a 1986 launch was planned but this latter moved to 1988.<ref name=Harvey246>{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Brian |date=2007 |title=Russian Planetry Exploration History, Development, Legacy and Prospects  |publisher=Springer-Praxis |page=246 |isbn=9780387463438}}</ref>\n\n==Mission profile==\n\nPhobos 2 started to develop problems during the interplanetary flight phase of the mission.<ref name=Harvey253 /> By the time the probe reached mars orbit two of its three computers were not working properly.<ref name=Harvey253 /> One of was completely dead and the second was starting to malfunction.<ref name=Harvey253 /> Since the probe worked on a system of of its computers voting on any decision the one healthy computer would not be able to control the craft since it would be unable to outvote two dead computers.<ref name=Harvey253 /> The craft's high speed transmitter had also developed issues.<ref name=Harvey253>{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Brian |date=2007 |title=Russian Planetry Exploration History, Development, Legacy and Prospects  |publisher=Springer-Praxis |page=253-254 |isbn=9780387463438}}</ref>\n\nPhobos 2 successfully carried out three preliminary encounters with Phobos during which time it was imaged with the Videospectrometric Camera, the Combined Radiometer and Photometer for Mars and the Imaging Spectrometer for Mars.<ref name=Murchiea>{{cite journal |last1=Murchiea |first1=Scott  |last2=Erardb |first2= Stephane |date=September 1996 |title=Spectral Properties and Heterogeneity of Phobos from Measurements byPhobos 2 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103596901426 |journal=Icarus |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=63-86 |doi=10.1006/icar.1996.0142 |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Spacecraft Design==\n===Instruments===\n\nThe ''Phobos 2'' [[Thermal infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrometer]] (ISM) obtained 45000 spectra in the near infrared (from {{val|0.75|to|3.2|u=um}}) in the equatorial areas of Mars, with a spatial resolution ranging from {{val|7|to|25|u=km}}, and 400 spectra of Phobos at 700 m resolution. These observations made it possible to retrieve the first mineralogical maps of the planet and its satellite, and to study the atmosphere of Mars.
