The family held a small ancestral property of servile origin at [[Nogaret]], near Saint-F\u00e9lix-de-Caraman (today's [[Saint-F\u00e9lix-Lauragais]]), from which it took its name. In 1291 Guillaume was professor of [[jurisprudence]] at the [[university of Montpellier]], and in 1296 he became a member of the [[Curia Regis]] at [[Paris]]. From 1306, he was a seigneur of [[Marsillargues]], [[Calvisson]], [[Aujargues]] and [[Cong\u00e9nies]] in [[Languedoc]].\n\n== Councillor to Philip IV ==\nHis name is mainly connected with the quarrel between Philip IV and [[Pope Boniface VIII]]. In 1300 he was sent with an embassy to Boniface, of which he left a picturesque and highly coloured account. His influence over the king dates from February 1303, when he persuaded Philip to consent to the bold plan of seizing Boniface and bringing him forcibly from [[Italy]] to a council in France meant to depose him. On 7 March he received, with three others, a secret commission from the royal chancery to \"go to certain places ... and make such treaties with such persons as seemed good to them.\" On 12 March a solemn royal assembly was held in the [[Louvre]], at which Guillaume de Nogaret read a long series of accusations against Boniface and demanded the calling of a general council to try him.\n\n==Attack on the Pope==\n\nSoon afterwards he went to Italy. By the aid of a Florentine spy, Nogaret gathered a band of adventurers and of enemies of the [[Caetani|Gaetani]] (Boniface's family) in the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. The great Colonna house, in a bitter feud with the Gaetani, was his strongest ally, and [[Sciarra Colonna]] accompanied Nogaret to [[Anagni]], Boniface's birthplace. On 7 September, with their band of some sixteen hundred men, Nogaret and Colonna surprised the little town. Boniface was taken prisoner. Sciarra wished to kill him, but Nogaret's policy was to take him to France and compel him to summon a general council. An army led by King Philip's minister Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna attacked Boniface at his Palace in Anagni next to the Cathedral. The Pope responded with a bull dated 8 September 1303, in which Philip and Nogaret were excommunicated.<ref>[ A. Tomassetti, Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Tomus IV (Augustae Taurinorum 1859), pp. 170-174. The date of September 8 has caused much scholarly controversy. Chamberlain, E.R. \"The Lord of Europe\". The Bad Popes. Barnes and Noble. p. 120. Ian Mortimer: \"Barriers to the Truth\" History Today: 60:12: December 2010: 13]</ref> The French Chancellor and the Colonnas demanded the Pope's resignation; Boniface VIII responded that he would \"sooner die\". In response, Colonna allegedly slapped Boniface, a \"slap\" historically remembered as the schiaffo di Anagni (\"Anagni slap\").\n\nThe tide soon turned, however. On the 9th a concerted rising of the townsmen in support of Boniface put Nogaret and his allies to flight, and the pope was free. His death at Rome on 11 October saved Nogaret. The election of the timid [[pope Benedict XI|Benedict XI]] was the beginning of the triumph of France that lasted through the [[Avignon papacy|Avignon captivity]]. Early in 1304 Nogaret went to [[Languedoc]] to report to Philip IV, and was rewarded by gifts of land and money. Then he was sent back with an embassy to Benedict XI to demand absolution for all concerned in the struggle with Boniface VIII. Benedict refused to meet Nogaret, excepted him from the general absolution he granted on 12 May 1304, and on 7 June issued against him and his associates at Anagni the [[papal bull|bull]] ''Flagitiosum scelus''. Nogaret replied with apologies for his conduct, and when Benedict died on 7 July 1304 Nogaret pointed to his death as a witness to the justice of his cause.\n\nFrench influence led to a Frenchman, Bertrand de Got ([[pope Clement V|Clement V]]), being elected as Benedict's successor. The threat of proceedings against the memory of Boniface was renewed to force Clement to absolve Nogaret, and Clement had given way on this point when the further question of an inquiry into the condition of the [[Knights Templar]] was brought forward by Philip as a preliminary to their arrest and the seizure of their property in October 1307. Nogaret was active in getting the renegade members of the order to give evidence against their fellows, and the proceedings against them bear traces of his unscrupulous and merciless pen. Clement's weak and ineffective resistance to this still further delayed the agreement between him and Philip. Nogaret had become keeper of the seal that year in succession to Pierre de Belleperche.\n\nHis talents as an ''[[Devil's advocate|advocatus diaboli]]'' were given still further employment in the trial of Guichard, bishop of Troyes, charged with various crimes, including [[witchcraft]] and unchastity. The trial, which began in 1308 and lasted till 1313, was a hint to Clement as to what might happen if the oft-repeated threat of a trial of Boniface were carried out. Absolution was obtained from Clement on 27 April 1311. Guillaume de Nogaret was to go on the next [[crusade]] and visit certain places of pilgrimage in France and Spain as a penance, but never did so. He died in 1313 with his tongue horribly thrust out, according to the chronicler [[Jean Desnouelles]]. He retained the seals till his death and was occupied with the king's affairs concerning [[Flanders]] as late as the end of March 1313.\n\n==Literature==\nNogaret is a major character in ''[[Les Rois maudits]]'' (''The Accursed Kings''), a series of historical novels by [[Maurice Druon]], which were adapted into a television [[miniseries]] in 1972 and again in 2005. He is also a major character in ''[[Requiem]]'', by [[Robyn Young]], published by [[Hodder & Stoughton]] in 2008, and the final novel in her ''[[Brethren Trilogy]]''. \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Nogaret, Guillaume de}}\n* Elizabeth A.

They were created by [[Friz Freleng]].\n\n===Biography===\nAs an [[animator]], Friz Freleng enjoyed creating new adversaries for Warners' star [[Bugs Bunny]], since he felt that Bugs' other nemeses, such as [[Beaky Buzzard]] and [[Elmer Fudd]] (who actually appeared in many more Freleng shorts than is commonly realized), were too stupid to give the [[rabbit]] any real challenge. Considered revolutionary for almost all of the late 1940s though he might have been, Freleng's own [[Yosemite Sam]] had not yet been proven capable of fully fulfilling his creator's intentions. Freleng introduced two of these more formidable opponents as a pair of [[gangster]]s in the 1946 film ''[[Racketeer Rabbit]]''. In the film, Bugs decides to find himself a new home, but the one he chooses is unfortunately occupied by a duo of bank robbers. The characters here are called \"Rocky\" (drawn like movie gangster [[Edward G. Robinson]]) and \"Hugo\" (a [[caricature]]d [[Peter Lorre]]). Both gangsters are performed by the Warner studio's longtime chief [[voice actor]], [[Mel Blanc]].\n\n===Appearances===\nFreleng liked the [[Gangster|mobster]] idea, and he used the concept again in the 1950 short ''[[Golden Yeggs]]''. This time, it is [[Porky Pig]] and [[Daffy Duck]] who run afoul of the mob, only this time Rocky has not only one sidekick, but an entire [[gang]]. Freleng also redesigned Rocky for this short, making him a more generalized caricature of the \"tough guy\" gangster rather than Robinson in particular. Freleng used several of the same techniques that would make Sam, his other Bugs villain, such a humorous character: despite Rocky's tough-guy demeanor, everlasting [[cigar]] (or [[cigarette]]) and foppish gangster dress, he really is little more than a dwarf in a much-too-large hat.\n\nIn 1953's ''[[Catty Cornered]]'', Freleng set the mob against another of his comic duos, [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester the Cat]] and [[Tweety Bird]]. Gang leader Rocky, this time aided and abetted by a hulking simpleton named \"Nick\", [[Kidnapping|kidnaps]] Tweety Bird, and when Sylvester's bumbling predations accidentally free the bird, the poor puss is hailed as a hero.\n\nThe duo reappear in 1954's ''[[Bugs and Thugs]]'', this time in the form that Freleng would keep them in for the rest of their run. Rocky is aided by a new thug, \"Mugsy\". Although his body type is similar to that of Nick's, he has less hair and is even less intelligent. Before the Warner studio closed for good in January 1965, Rocky and Mugsy would appear in two more Freleng cartoons: ''[[Bugsy and Mugsy]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Unmentionables]]'' (1963). Mugsy also appears without his boss in a cameo as one of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s guards in the 1956 Freleng short ''[[Napoleon Bunny-Part]]'' and also appeared as a bank robber in ''[[Satan's Waitin']]''.\n\nRocky and Mugsy have also appeared in various ''Looney Tunes''-related merchandise. They are semi-regular characters in ''Looney Tunes'' [[comic book]]s, for example. They also play the villains in the 2002 [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game]] ''[[Loons: The Fight for Fame]]'', a [[Versus fighting game|vs. fighting game]] in which the no-good gangsters attempt to run a film studio into the ground so that they can buy up the [[Stock market|stock]] for next to nothing. Also, in ''[[Bugs Bunny Lost in Time]]'', the pair are bosses of the 1930s era. They also appeared in episodes of ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'' and ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'', as well as made cameo appearances in the movie ''[[Space Jam]]''. In the movie they are spotted wearing rabbit's ears and are shown shocked and terrified when Bugs gets crushed by a Monstar named Pound who was meant to crush Lola, because he and the other Monstars are violating the game which they should immediately lose. Both of them also appeared as kids in an episode of ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'', Stoney and Bugsy (voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]] and [[James Arnold Taylor]]) were brief descendants of Rocky and Mugsy who adopted Pinkster Pig (who was a descendant of [[Porky Pig]]).\n\nRocky and Mugsy recently made cameos in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''. In \"It's a Handbag\", Rocky and Mugsy's pictures were seen in the police's notebook. They were also seen in the Merrie Melodies segment \"Stick to My Guns\", sung by Yosemite Sam in the episode \"Mrs. Porkbunny's\" where Yosemite Sam mentions how he declared his vendetta on the Mafia when Sam threw a garbage can into their house. Around the end of the song, Rocky and Mugsy joined in on the final verse with [[Nasty Canasta]], an angry bride, a female cannibal, a [[grizzly bear]], and Toro the Bull.\n\n===Shorts===\n* ''[[Racketeer Rabbit]]'' (1946) - Features a prototype of Rocky.\n* ''[[Golden Yeggs]]'' (1950) - Rocky's first cartoon, only cartoon paired with Daffy Duck and Porky Pig.\n* ''[[Catty Cornered]]'' (1953) - Only pairing with Sylvester and Tweety.\n* ''[[Bugs and Thugs]]'' (1954) - Mugsy's first cartoon.\n* ''[[Napoleon Bunny-Part]]'' (1956) - Mugsy cameos as a guard.\n* ''[[Bugsy and Mugsy]]'' (1957) \n* ''[[The Unmentionables]]'' (1963) - Final appearance of Rocky and Mugsy.\n\n===Parodies===\nRocky and Mugsy are parodied in the ''[[South Park]]'' characters Nathan and Mimsy in the episode \"[[Crippled Summer]]\", Nathan having been introduced in the earlier episode ''[[Up the Down Steroid]]''. Throughout the episode's storylines, with various campers being parodies of other ''Looney Tunes'' characters, Nathan (Rocky) attempts to arrange fatal accidents for Jimmy Valmer (a counterpart to Bugs Bunny) which get ruined by Mimsy (Mugsy)'s stupidity. Nathan and Mimsy become reoccurring characters following their return appearance in the episode \"[[Handicar]]\". A poster depicting Rocky and Mugsy can be seen on the wall of Nathan's room.\n\n==Blacque Jacque Shellacque==\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Blacque Jacque Shellacque\n| series             = [[Looney Tunes]]\n| image              = \n| caption            = Blacque Jacque Shellacque with [[Bugs Bunny]] as seen in ''[[Bonanza Bunny]]''.\n| creator            = [[Robert McKimson]]<br>[[Tedd Pierce]]\n| voice              = [[Mel Blanc]] (1959\u20131962)<br>[[Billy West]] (1999)<br>[[Maurice LaMarche]] (2003\u20132013)<br>[[Jim Cummings]] (2017-present)\n| species            = [[Human]]\n| gender             = Male\n| occupation         = Criminal\n| nationality        = [[Canadian]]\n}}\nBlacque Jacque Shellacque is a fictional [[cartoon character]] in the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons. He was created by [[Robert McKimson]] and [[Tedd Pierce]], and first appeared in the 1959 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' short ''Bonanza Bunny'' set in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] of 1896.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REaeCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA424&dq=Bonanza+Bunny&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi757jVlIPlAhXWrJ4KHZpWBlAQ6AEwA3oECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=Bonanza%20Bunny&f=false|title=Vitaphone Films: A Catalogue of the Features and Shorts|author=Roy Lieberman|page=328|publisher=[[McFarland Publishing]]|year=2015}}</ref> [[Maurice LaMarche]] voiced the character from 2011-2014 in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMFTDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA371&dq=Blacque+Jacque&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZrKeJk4PlAhWRu54KHTPUBO0Q6AEwA3oECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=Blacque%20Jacque&f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows|author=David Perlmutter|page=371-372|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2018}}</ref> The character was the inspiration for a specific version of five card draw [[poker]] mixed with [[blackjack]] named \"Blacque Jacque Shellacque\" in which the pot is divided between the winning poker hand and the winning blackjack hand.

Also, like Yosemite Sam and many other villains, Blacque Jacque Shellacque does not have a high level of intelligence, preferring to use force instead of strategy to fight Bugs. His usual swear word is ''Sacrebleu'', and he is often portrayed as a thief.<ref>{{cite work|title=Images of life on children's television: sex roles, minorities, and families|author=Francis Earle Barcus|year=1983|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|page=96}}</ref>\n\n===Appearances===\nBlacque Jacque first appeared in ''[[Bonanza Bunny]]'', which takes place in the middle of the [[Klondike gold rush]]. Blacque Jacque attempts to seize Bugs' bag of gold (actually \"a bunch of old rocks and some yellow paint,\" according to Bugs) through card cheating, trickery and out-and-out threats, but Bugs outwits him as always and defeats him by replacing his bag of gold with gunpowder while poking a hole in the bag and tossing a lit match on it, causing a massive explosion.\n\nBlacque Jacque later clashed with Bugs in 1962's ''[[Wet Hare]]'', in which his illegal damming of a river ''(\"I feel like pezky little [[beaver|beav-aire]]!\")'' brings him into conflict with the rabbit\u2014not only because he is committing a crime, but because he has blocked off the waterfall that Bugs uses as a shower. After demolishing several of Blacque Jacque's dams, Bugs turns the tables by damming the river upstream of Jacque's dam. Jacque, unsurprisingly, is enraged and wheels a small cannon along the riverbed to destroy Bugs' dam\u2014but when he does he only reveals another dam further upstream. Jacque blows up several of Bugs' dams in succession and finally follows Bugs all the way to the \"Grand Cooler Dam\" (a pun on the name of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]). Jacque tries to blow it up with his cannon, but the dam is so massive and thick that the cannonball he launches ricochets back into the cannon's barrel and the recoiling force lands both Jacque and the cannon into the back of a waiting [[paddy wagon]], which then takes him away.\n\n===Legacy===\nBlacque Jacque is one of the more obscure ''Looney Tunes'' characters, but he has his share of fans. Canadian television networks in particular put his shorts in regular rotation (on shows such as ''[[The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''), and the cartoons have an unusual number of Canadian references for the time period in which they were made (for example, Bugs claims that he received a call from Jacque's girlfriend, \"Fifi from [[Montreal]]\").\n\nIn the video game ''[[Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time]]'', he appears in various levels as an enemy to defeat. During this appearance, he was voiced by [[Billy West]].\n\nAlthough Blacque Jacque did not appear in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'', he was featured in the film's [[Looney Tunes: Back in Action (video game)|video game adaptation]], voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. He was stealing paintings from the [[Louvre]] and being defeated by [[Bugs Bunny]].\n\nBlacque Jacque Shellacque appears in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'', voiced again by Maurice LaMarche. In this show, Blacque Jacque Shellacque is the cousin of Yosemite Sam. In the episode \"It's a Handbag,\" his picture is seen in a police notebook. In \"Ridiculous Journey,\" Blacque Jacque Shellacque was hunting Hugo the Abominable Snowman in Alaska when he turns his attention towards [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]], [[Tweety]], and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Taz]] and pursues them. Blacque Jacque Shellacque catches up to them on a train heading south and starts hunting them. Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz escape him by detaching the cars that are connected to the train. Blacque Jacque Shellacque then finds them in the cars of the Three Bears and tries to grab them until [[The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)|Baby Bear]] throws him out of their car and off the Golden Gate Bridge. Blacque Jacque Shellacque catches up to them in the desert when they end up in the desert and ends up cutting [[Beaky Buzzard]]'s balloon. Blacque Jacque Shellacque then goes on the attack and manages to catch them. It turns out that Blacque Jacque Shellacque was hired by Bugs Bunny and [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] to rescue them upon the two of them being hooked up by Yosemite Sam.\n\nBlacque Jacque Shellacque appears in ''[[New Looney Tunes]]'', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].\n\n== Pete Puma ==\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Pete Puma\n| series             = [[Looney Tunes]]\n| image              = \n| caption            = \n| first              = ''[[Rabbit's Kin]]'' (1952)\n| creator            = \n| voice              = [[Stan Freberg]] (1952\u20132000)<br>[[Joe Alaskey]] (1991)<br>[[John Kassir]] (2011\u2013present)<br>[[Jess Harnell]] (2015)\n| relatives          = Peter Puma (Father)<br>Pat Puma (mother)<br>Penelope Puma (sister)<br>Paul Puma (cousin)\n| species            = [[Cougar|Puma]]\n}}\n'''Pete Puma''' is a [[cartoon]] [[Cougar|puma]], originally voiced by [[Stan Freberg]]. He debuted in the November 15, 1952 short film ''[[Rabbit's Kin]]''. \n\n<br />\n\n== History ==\nThough Pete Puma made only two appearances, in ''Rabbit's Kin'' and in ''[[Pullet Surprise]]'', he is often vividly remembered by cartoon fans, especially for his bizarre, inhaled, almost choking laugh (based on comedian [[Frank Fontaine]]'s \"Crazy Guggenheim\"  and \"John L.C. Silvoney\" characters). \n\nIn ''Rabbit's Kin,'' Pete is chasing a young rabbit called 'Shorty' who asks [[Bugs Bunny]] for help. Bugs is eager to oblige, and subjects Pete to some of his trademark pranks.\n\nPete Puma's voice was used by [[Daws Butler]] for Sam the Cat in the [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] cartoons ''[[Trick or Tweet]]'' in 1958 and ''[[Mouse and Garden]]'' in 1960. <br />\n\n=== Later appearances ===\nMore recently, he has made occasional appearances on ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' (as the Acme Looniversity janitor), episodes of ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'', co-starred with [[Foghorn Leghorn]] in ''[[Pullet Surprise (film)|Pullet Surprise]]'' (voiced again by Freberg in all of these appearances), made a cameo appearance in the crowd scenes of ''[[Space Jam]]'', ''[[Carrotblanca]]'' (as a waiter), ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]]'' (working as a janitor again), and is a supporting character in the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' comic books.  \n\nPete appears in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' voiced by [[John Kassir]], He is a dimwitted friend of [[Daffy Duck]] and does various jobs around town.  \n\nHe appears in ''[[Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run]]'' voiced by [[Jess Harnell]], He serves as an intern to the Mexican general Foghorn Leghorn. \n\nPete Puma appears in [[New Looney Tunes|''New Looney Tunes'']], voiced again by John Kassir.<br />\n==See also==\n* [[Merrie Melodies]]\n* [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1929\u20131939)]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1940\u20131949)]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1950\u20131959)]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1960\u20131969)]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters}}\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television animation|* Looney Tunes]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes characters| ]]\n[[Category:WarnerMedia-related lists|Looney Tunes characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of animated film characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of Warner Bros. characters|Looney Tunes]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' characters}}\n{{no lead|date=February 2020}}\n==List==\nThis is a list of ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' characters.\n{{dynamiclist}}\n* [[Babbit and Catstello]]\n* [[Barnyard Dawg]]\n* [[Beaky Buzzard]]\n* [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans]]\n* [[Bosko]]\n* [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]]\n* [[Bugs Bunny]]\n* [[Cool Cat (Looney Tunes)|Cool Cat]]\n* [[Claude Cat]]\n* [[Clyde Bunny]]\n* [[Cecil Turtle]]\n* [[Charlie Dog (Looney Tunes)|Charlie Dog]]\n* [[Colonel Shuffle]]\n* [[Conrad the Cat]]\n* [[Daffy Duck]]\n* [[Egghead Jr. (Looney Tunes)|Egghead Jr.]]\n* [[Elmer Fudd]]\n* [[Foghorn Leghorn]]\n* [[Foxy (Merrie Melodies)|Foxy]]\n* [[Claude Cat|Frisky Puppy]]\n* [[Gabby Goat]]\n* [[Goofy Gophers]]\n* [[Goopy Geer]]\n* [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Gossamer]]\n* [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]]\n* [[Hector the Bulldog]]\n* [[Henery Hawk]]\n* [[Hippety Hopper]]\n* [[Honey Bunny]]\n* [[Hubie and Bertie]]\n* [[Hugo the Abominable Snowman]]\n* [[Inki]]\n* [[Marvin the Martian|K-9]]\n* [[Lola Bunny]]\n* [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot]]\n* [[Marvin the Martian]]\n* [[Merlin the Magic Mouse]]\n* [[Michigan J.

Rocky is aided by a new thug, \"Mugsy\". Although his body type is similar to that of Nick's, he has less hair and is even less intelligent. Before the Warner studio closed for good in January 1965, Rocky and Mugsy would appear in two more Freleng cartoons: ''[[Bugsy and Mugsy]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Unmentionables]]'' (1963). Mugsy also appears without his boss in a cameo as one of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s guards in the 1956 Freleng short ''[[Napoleon Bunny-Part]]'' and also appeared as a bank robber in ''[[Satan's Waitin']]''.\n\nRocky and Mugsy have also appeared in various ''Looney Tunes''-related merchandise. They are semi-regular characters in ''Looney Tunes'' [[comic book]]s, for example. They also play the villains in the 2002 [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game]] ''[[Loons: The Fight for Fame]]'', a [[Versus fighting game|vs. fighting game]] in which the no-good gangsters attempt to run a film studio into the ground so that they can buy up the [[Stock market|stock]] for next to nothing. Also, in ''[[Bugs Bunny Lost in Time]]'', the pair are bosses of the 1930s era. They also appeared in episodes of ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'' and ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]'', as well as made cameo appearances in the movie ''[[Space Jam]]''. In the movie they are spotted wearing rabbit's ears and are shown shocked and terrified when Bugs gets crushed by a Monstar named Pound who was meant to crush Lola, because he and the other Monstars are violating the game which they should immediately lose. Both of them also appeared as kids in an episode of ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'', Stoney and Bugsy (voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]] and [[James Arnold Taylor]]) were brief descendants of Rocky and Mugsy who adopted Pinkster Pig (who was a descendant of [[Porky Pig]]).\n\nRocky and Mugsy recently made cameos in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''. In \"It's a Handbag\", Rocky and Mugsy's pictures were seen in the police's notebook. They were also seen in the Merrie Melodies segment \"Stick to My Guns\", sung by Yosemite Sam in the episode \"Mrs. Porkbunny's\" where Yosemite Sam mentions how he declared his vendetta on the Mafia when Sam threw a garbage can into their house. Around the end of the song, Rocky and Mugsy joined in on the final verse with [[Nasty Canasta]], an angry bride, a female cannibal, a [[grizzly bear]], and Toro the Bull.\n\n===Shorts===\n* ''[[Racketeer Rabbit]]'' (1946) - Features a prototype of Rocky.\n* ''[[Golden Yeggs]]'' (1950) - Rocky's first cartoon, only cartoon paired with Daffy Duck and Porky Pig.\n* ''[[Catty Cornered]]'' (1953) - Only pairing with Sylvester and Tweety.\n* ''[[Bugs and Thugs]]'' (1954) - Mugsy's first cartoon.\n* ''[[Napoleon Bunny-Part]]'' (1956) - Mugsy cameos as a guard.\n* ''[[Bugsy and Mugsy]]'' (1957) \n* ''[[The Unmentionables]]'' (1963) - Final appearance of Rocky and Mugsy.\n\n===Parodies===\nRocky and Mugsy are parodied in the ''[[South Park]]'' characters Nathan and Mimsy in the episode \"[[Crippled Summer]]\", Nathan having been introduced in the earlier episode ''[[Up the Down Steroid]]''. Throughout the episode's storylines, with various campers being parodies of other ''Looney Tunes'' characters, Nathan (Rocky) attempts to arrange fatal accidents for Jimmy Valmer (a counterpart to Bugs Bunny) which get ruined by Mimsy (Mugsy)'s stupidity. Nathan and Mimsy become reoccurring characters following their return appearance in the episode \"[[Handicar]]\". A poster depicting Rocky and Mugsy can be seen on the wall of Nathan's room.\n\n==Blacque Jacque Shellacque==\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Blacque Jacque Shellacque\n| series             = [[Looney Tunes]]\n| image              = \n| caption            = Blacque Jacque Shellacque with [[Bugs Bunny]] as seen in ''[[Bonanza Bunny]]''.\n| creator            = [[Robert McKimson]]<br>[[Tedd Pierce]]\n| voice              = [[Mel Blanc]] (1959\u20131962)<br>[[Billy West]] (1999)<br>[[Maurice LaMarche]] (2003\u20132013)<br>[[Jim Cummings]] (2017-present)\n| species            = [[Human]]\n| gender             = Male\n| occupation         = Criminal\n| nationality        = [[Canadian]]\n}}\nBlacque Jacque Shellacque is a fictional [[cartoon character]] in the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons. He was created by [[Robert McKimson]] and [[Tedd Pierce]], and first appeared in the 1959 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' short ''Bonanza Bunny'' set in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] of 1896.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REaeCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA424&dq=Bonanza+Bunny&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi757jVlIPlAhXWrJ4KHZpWBlAQ6AEwA3oECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=Bonanza%20Bunny&f=false|title=Vitaphone Films: A Catalogue of the Features and Shorts|author=Roy Lieberman|page=328|publisher=[[McFarland Publishing]]|year=2015}}</ref> [[Maurice LaMarche]] voiced the character from 2011-2014 in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMFTDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA371&dq=Blacque+Jacque&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZrKeJk4PlAhWRu54KHTPUBO0Q6AEwA3oECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=Blacque%20Jacque&f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows|author=David Perlmutter|page=371-372|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2018}}</ref> The character was the inspiration for a specific version of five card draw [[poker]] mixed with [[blackjack]] named \"Blacque Jacque Shellacque\" in which the pot is divided between the winning poker hand and the winning blackjack hand.

Also, like Yosemite Sam and many other villains, Blacque Jacque Shellacque does not have a high level of intelligence, preferring to use force instead of strategy to fight Bugs. His usual swear word is ''Sacrebleu'', and he is often portrayed as a thief.<ref>{{cite work|title=Images of life on children's television: sex roles, minorities, and families|author=Francis Earle Barcus|year=1983|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|page=96}}</ref>\n\n===Appearances===\nBlacque Jacque first appeared in ''[[Bonanza Bunny]]'', which takes place in the middle of the [[Klondike gold rush]]. Blacque Jacque attempts to seize Bugs' bag of gold (actually \"a bunch of old rocks and some yellow paint,\" according to Bugs) through card cheating, trickery and out-and-out threats, but Bugs outwits him as always and defeats him by replacing his bag of gold with gunpowder while poking a hole in the bag and tossing a lit match on it, causing a massive explosion.\n\nBlacque Jacque later clashed with Bugs in 1962's ''[[Wet Hare]]'', in which his illegal damming of a river ''(\"I feel like pezky little [[beaver|beav-aire]]!\")'' brings him into conflict with the rabbit\u2014not only because he is committing a crime, but because he has blocked off the waterfall that Bugs uses as a shower. After demolishing several of Blacque Jacque's dams, Bugs turns the tables by damming the river upstream of Jacque's dam. Jacque, unsurprisingly, is enraged and wheels a small cannon along the riverbed to destroy Bugs' dam\u2014but when he does he only reveals another dam further upstream. Jacque blows up several of Bugs' dams in succession and finally follows Bugs all the way to the \"Grand Cooler Dam\" (a pun on the name of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]). Jacque tries to blow it up with his cannon, but the dam is so massive and thick that the cannonball he launches ricochets back into the cannon's barrel and the recoiling force lands both Jacque and the cannon into the back of a waiting [[paddy wagon]], which then takes him away.\n\n===Legacy===\nBlacque Jacque is one of the more obscure ''Looney Tunes'' characters, but he has his share of fans. Canadian television networks in particular put his shorts in regular rotation (on shows such as ''[[The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show]]''), and the cartoons have an unusual number of Canadian references for the time period in which they were made (for example, Bugs claims that he received a call from Jacque's girlfriend, \"Fifi from [[Montreal]]\").\n\nIn the video game ''[[Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time]]'', he appears in various levels as an enemy to defeat. During this appearance, he was voiced by [[Billy West]].\n\nAlthough Blacque Jacque did not appear in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'', he was featured in the film's [[Looney Tunes: Back in Action (video game)|video game adaptation]], voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. He was stealing paintings from the [[Louvre]] and being defeated by [[Bugs Bunny]].\n\nBlacque Jacque Shellacque appears in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'', voiced again by Maurice LaMarche. In this show, Blacque Jacque Shellacque is the cousin of Yosemite Sam. In the episode \"It's a Handbag,\" his picture is seen in a police notebook. In \"Ridiculous Journey,\" Blacque Jacque Shellacque was hunting Hugo the Abominable Snowman in Alaska when he turns his attention towards [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]], [[Tweety]], and [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Taz]] and pursues them. Blacque Jacque Shellacque catches up to them on a train heading south and starts hunting them. Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz escape him by detaching the cars that are connected to the train. Blacque Jacque Shellacque then finds them in the cars of the Three Bears and tries to grab them until [[The Three Bears (Looney Tunes)|Baby Bear]] throws him out of their car and off the Golden Gate Bridge. Blacque Jacque Shellacque catches up to them in the desert when they end up in the desert and ends up cutting [[Beaky Buzzard]]'s balloon. Blacque Jacque Shellacque then goes on the attack and manages to catch them. It turns out that Blacque Jacque Shellacque was hired by Bugs Bunny and [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] to rescue them upon the two of them being hooked up by Yosemite Sam.\n\nBlacque Jacque Shellacque appears in ''[[New Looney Tunes]]'', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].\n\n== Pete Puma ==\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Pete Puma\n| series             = [[Looney Tunes]]\n| image              = \n| caption            = \n| first              = ''[[Rabbit's Kin]]'' (1952)\n| creator            = \n| voice              = [[Stan Freberg]] (1952\u20132000)<br>[[Joe Alaskey]] (1991)<br>[[John Kassir]] (2011\u2013present)<br>[[Jess Harnell]] (2015)\n| relatives          = Peter Puma (Father)<br>Pat Puma (mother)<br>Penelope Puma (sister)<br>Paul Puma (cousin)\n| species            = [[Cougar|Puma]]\n}}\n'''Pete Puma''' is a [[cartoon]] [[Cougar|puma]], originally voiced by [[Stan Freberg]]. He debuted in the November 15, 1952 short film ''[[Rabbit's Kin]]''. \n\n<br />\n\n== History ==\nThough Pete Puma made only two appearances, in ''Rabbit's Kin'' and in ''[[Pullet Surprise]]'', he is often vividly remembered by cartoon fans, especially for his bizarre, inhaled, almost choking laugh (based on comedian [[Frank Fontaine]]'s \"Crazy Guggenheim\"  and \"John L.C. Silvoney\" characters). \n\nIn ''Rabbit's Kin,'' Pete is chasing a young rabbit called 'Shorty' who asks [[Bugs Bunny]] for help. Bugs is eager to oblige, and subjects Pete to some of his trademark pranks.\n\nPete Puma's voice was used by [[Daws Butler]] for Sam the Cat in the [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] cartoons ''[[Trick or Tweet]]'' in 1958 and ''[[Mouse and Garden]]'' in 1960. <br />\n\n=== Later appearances ===\nMore recently, he has made occasional appearances on ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' (as the Acme Looniversity janitor), episodes of ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'', co-starred with [[Foghorn Leghorn]] in ''[[Pullet Surprise (film)|Pullet Surprise]]'' (voiced again by Freberg in all of these appearances), made a cameo appearance in the crowd scenes of ''[[Space Jam]]'', ''[[Carrotblanca]]'' (as a waiter), ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]]'' (working as a janitor again), and is a supporting character in the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' comic books.  \n\nPete appears in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' voiced by [[John Kassir]], He is a dimwitted friend of [[Daffy Duck]] and does various jobs around town.  \n\nHe appears in ''[[Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run]]'' voiced by [[Jess Harnell]], He serves as an intern to the Mexican general Foghorn Leghorn. \n\nPete Puma appears in [[New Looney Tunes|''New Looney Tunes'']], voiced again by John Kassir.<br />\n==See also==\n* [[Merrie Melodies]]\n* [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1929\u20131939)]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1940\u20131949)]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1950\u20131959)]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1960\u20131969)]]\n** [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1970\u2013present and miscellaneous)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters}}\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television animation|* Looney Tunes]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes characters| ]]\n[[Category:WarnerMedia-related lists|Looney Tunes characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of animated film characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of Warner Bros. characters|Looney Tunes]]\n", "name_user": "Dinnerandbreakfast", "label": "safe", "comment": "created lead to article", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Looney_Tunes_and_Merrie_Melodies_characters"}

He was born in [[Budapest]] and died in [[Paris]].\n\n== Biography ==\nIsidor Philipp studied [[piano]] under [[Georges Mathias]] (a pupil of [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]]) at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] and won First Prize in piano performance in 1883. Other teachers included [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Stephen Heller]] (a pupil of [[Carl Czerny]], one of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s students) and [[Th\u00e9odore Ritter]] (a pupil of [[Franz Liszt]]). At the Conservatoire, he met fellow student [[Claude Debussy]]. They remained lifelong friends, and Philipp often played his compositions. After Debussy's death, Philipp was regarded as the leading authority on his piano music. After graduating from the Conservatoire, Philipp commenced a career which took him to various European countries, and he was a regular performer at the [[Colonne]], Lamoureux and Conservatoire concerts in Paris. He was able to hear concerts, recitals or master classes by many of the leading pianists of the day, including Liszt and [[Anton Rubinstein]]. He knew [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], a close friend of Chopin's, and was a pall-bearer at Alkan's funeral in 1888; he subsequently edited many of Alkan's works for republication.<ref>Smith (2000) I, 75-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1890 Philipp formed a trio with Loeb and Bertelier which toured for about a decade. He revived the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Instruments \u00e0 Vent from 1896 to 1901. However, he eventually curtailed his concertizing, as he found lasting satisfaction in teaching. He returned to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he was a pre-eminent professor of piano from 1893 to 1934, one of the youngest ever appointed to that institution. From 1921 to 1933, Philipp was also the head of the piano section at the American Conservatory of [[Fontainebleau]], which became famous for starting the careers of many notable American composers. His home in Paris contained many ancient and unusual instruments and other musical artifacts. When the [[Nazis]] entered Paris in World War II and Philipp fled to the United States in 1940, the Nazis confiscated the contents of his apartment.\n\nHe left for the United States in 1941 and taught in New York and L'Alliance Francais in Louiseville, Quebec, Canada. During the war, he taught piano in [[New York City]] and at the [[Conservatoire de musique du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al]]. While he was in New York, he gave recitals with the violinist [[John Corigliano|John Corigliano, Sr.]] (Corigliano was the longtime [[concertmaster]] of the [[New York Philharmonic]]).<ref>[http://www2.inow.com/~starr/Photos/philipp.htm Isidor Philipp, pianist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220530/http://www2.inow.com/~starr/Photos/philipp.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> After the war, he spent the rest of his life between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]].\n\nPhilipp married once but he obtained a [[divorce]] shortly afterwards.\n\nOn 20 March 1955, aged 91, he played the piano part in both [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' D minor Sonata and [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s [[Violin Sonata (Franck)|Violin Sonata]] in New York, returning to Paris a year later. He gave his farewell recital at the age of 92, in Paris. He died there in 1958 after a fall on the Paris metro.<ref name=bach/> He is buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\nIn 197{{when|date=December 2019}} the Isidor Philipp Archives were deposited at the University of Louisville by the American Liszt Society. They gather his compositions for the piano, his exercises and studies, his editions of the works of Franz Liszt, as well as exercises, studies and works on other composers, recordings, correspondence, photographs, and other artifacts.\n\n== The Chopin tradition ==\nPhilipp began piano lessons with George Mathias at age 16. In an interview with E.H. Lampard, a columnist for the St. Catharine's Standard, Harold Bradley, who was a student and associate of Philipp's for over 30 years, stated that it was Mathias who had been the one student of Chopin who absorbed all the wisdom and value in piano pedagogy that Chopin had developed over his life. \"Chopin's fame as a composer has obscured the fact that he was the first and greatest name to adopt the career of piano teaching as a profession. He created an entirely new philosophy of musical thinking, and was the first musician of sufficient stature to be able to penetrate into the thought of the keyboard composers who preceded him to the extent of seeing the individual merits of each. Thus, he extended the dimensions of piano teaching to a point where the whole concept of music education became affected.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nAs most of Chopin's students were amateurs, or died early, Mathias was the only one who could pass on this legacy. Bradley continued, \"This is not to be confused with the mere performance of Chopin's own compositions, but an appreciation of the art of the keyboard composers up to his time and the genius to apply this knowledge. At Chopin's death, it was Mathias who was able to furnish information for the complete publication of his compositions but he also felt an obligation to preserve the contribution Chopin had made as a teacher and artist. Mathias in turn trained young pianists, but it proved to be Isidor Philipp that was best equipped to carry on the Chopin philosophy of teaching. Philipp then worked with Mathias that the latter had worked with Chopin. By the age of 30, because of his studies Mathias and other prominent teachers, Philipp was recognized as the supreme authority on the piano and its literature.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n== Teaching philosophy ==\n{{essay|date=May 2013}}\nIn interviews his students remember him with a great deal of affection and remark about his gentle and patient manner as a teacher. Students commented that he stressed suppleness, firmness, rhythmic exactitude and articulation. He insisted on practicing with the metronome, first slowly, then incrementally faster for all technical exercises and in learning any new piece. He taught that octaves should be played from the wrist, with a motionless arm, and that fingers should attain true independence of one another. Like other great teachers, he did not have a 'system', but taught what the student needed at the time. Paul Loyonnet stated his ideals were velocity, sobriety of expression and the ''jeu perle'' style. As for interpretations, he stressed that the student must know the piece intimately and thoroughly before it can be properly played, but did not force any particular interpretation.\n\nPhilipp's repertoire was wide, from the earliest keyboard masters to contemporary composers. He believed that every pianist should be conversant in all styles and eras of piano, and did not shy from playing [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] or other early composers on a modern grand. One of his teaching points was that pianists should play any piece of music the way the composer intended, and seeking out what the composer intended is often a lifelong process. Nonetheless, each pianist should have his own views on the pieces and not just copy what another has done.\n\nPhilipp wrote, \"The quality most desirable in piano playing is tone. Tone should be worked at from the first, and the pupil must listen attentively to it. To produce a beautiful tone, Thalberg said, 'one should in a way knead the keyboard with a hand of velvet, the key being rather felt than struck.' It is essential to maintain the utmost relaxation in the arms, wrists and hands.\" Fernando Laires said that Philipp insisted that the music and the tone should arise from deep within the piano, not pounded out at the keyboard, and by that he meant that he must come deep within one's soul, not at the fingertips.\n\nRubato, Philipp wrote, does not mean playing out of time, but rather, \"any ritenuto that we may be impelled to make, must be compensated by a corresponding accelerando and also the opposite, the bass keeping exactly the time.\" Although Philipp abhorred distortions in interpreting pieces, he believed that \"even when all the interpretive signs are exactly observed, there remains ample scope for self expression and liberty. You must be living and feeling the drama or the poem or the piece you play, in all its inflections and shades of emotion. What you do not feel yourself, your listeners will not get. You must be fully absorbed in the interpretation.\"<ref>Philipp, \"Some Thoughts on Piano Playing,\" Durand et fils (1928)</ref>\n\nWhen his friend [[Claude Debussy]] was composing new pieces for the piano, he would often ask Philipp for advice on notation so that pianists would be able to better understand his nuances and approach. After considerable deliberation, they both decided that almost no pedal markings should be used in any of the published pieces. Their reasoning is that every piano is different in quality, every room or hall is different in size and resonance, and each pianist has different capabilities. To lock in one form of pedaling to cover all possible circumstances would place the pedaling notation above the effects that Debussy wished to achieve. They decided that pedaling only where it is absolutely necessary, and gave discretion to the pianist to use it as needed. Although this has often been abused by some pianists who use it to cloud the harmonies, or achieve a very dry sound, it remains a point of discussion for every pianist who chooses to perform Debussy's piano works.\n\nHarold Bradley stated that Philipp didn't necessarily always take the 'best' students as his pupils. Sometimes, he would accept a student who had only a few years of instruction and was at the intermediate level, and often he would refuse to teach even top level pianists. For Philipp, the most important attribute of a student wasn't his or her particular level of accomplishment, but whether they were teachable or not. Bradley said that Philipp could often tell a pianist's personality just by listening to him play.  Bradley created an institute (Bradley Institute of Music) that embodied the educational philosophies of Isidor Philipp.<ref>\"World Famous Musicians Teach at Harold Bradley School of Music\", Lockport, N.Y. Union-Sun & Journal, July 20, 1957</ref>  The institute's staff worked closely with Philipp to create a musical education that worked from pre-school aged children on.\n\n== Association, students and friends ==\nPhilipp allowed his name to be associated with the Bradley Institute for Music Education Research, Ltd., which was founded in Paris, in 1930, but moved to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], Canada, under the guidance of his pupil Harold Bradley. The Institute was devoted not only to teaching music, but also to documenting the vast knowledge of teaching traditions that Philipp had learned during his long life. Philipp's friend, violinist John Corigliano, Sr., was among the original Board of Directors. Pianist Grace Barnes and violinist Deryck Aird served as music teachers along with Bradley for several decades.\n\nThe list of Isidor Philipp's students who became notable pianists, composers or conductors is very long, and includes [[Stell Andersen]], Dwight Anderson, Grace Barnes, [[Emma Boynet]], [[Harold Bradley (pianist)]], John Buttrick, [[Serge Conus]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Jeanne-Marie Darr\u00e9]], [[Pierre Dervaux]], [[Ania Dorfmann]], [[Rolande Falcinelli]], [[Felix Fox]], [[Jean Fran\u00e7aix]], [[Henri Gagnon]], [[Florence Parr Gere]], [[Youra Guller]], [[Georges Hugon]], Fernando Laires, Malvina Leshock, [[Yvonne Loriod]], [[Nikita Magaloff]], [[Federico Mompou]], [[L\u00e9o-Pol Morin]], [[Guiomar Novaes]], [[Ozan Marsh]], [[Wilfrid Pelletier]], [[\u00c9mile Poillot]], [[Harrison Potter]], noted philosopher [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Phyllis Sellick]], [[Soulima Stravinsky]], [[Louise Talma]], [[Alexander Tcherepnin]], [[Beveridge Webster]], and [[Victor Young]].<ref>[http://louisville.edu/library/music/coll/philipp.html University of Louisville]</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Federico+Mompou:+Catalonian+composer+magnifico-a0156361347 The Free Library]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/Loriod.htm |title=Yvonne Loriod-Messiaen |access-date=2009-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427073326/http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/Loriod.htm |archive-date=2007-04-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/music/musyoung.xml New York Public Library]</ref><ref>[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/c.asp?c=C203 Hyperion Records]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, many prominent and well established pianists would seek out his advice, particularly on playing French composers, which included [[Claude Debussy]]. Philipp often championed new music throughout his long life, and would frequently edit the works of contemporary composers, such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and [[Maurice Ravel]]. He was close friends with many of the leading pianists and composers of his day, including [[Leopold Godowsky]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]], [[Josef Hofmann]], [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], [[Alfred Cortot]], [[Lazare-L\u00e9vy]], [[Emile-Robert Blanchet]], [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Nadia Boulanger]], [[Jules Massenet]], [[C\u00e9cile Chaminade]], [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]] and [[Charles-Marie Widor]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nPianist [[Rudolf Serkin]] said that not having studied with Philipp was one of the regrets of his life.

He was born in [[Budapest]] and died in [[Paris]].\n\n== Biography ==\nIsidor Philipp studied [[piano]] under [[Georges Mathias]] (a pupil of [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]]) at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] and won First Prize in piano performance in 1883. Other teachers included [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Stephen Heller]] (a pupil of [[Carl Czerny]], one of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s students) and [[Th\u00e9odore Ritter]] (a pupil of [[Franz Liszt]]). At the Conservatoire, he met fellow student [[Claude Debussy]]. They remained lifelong friends, and Philipp often played his compositions. After Debussy's death, Philipp was regarded as the leading authority on his piano music. After graduating from the Conservatoire, Philipp commenced a career which took him to various European countries, and he was a regular performer at the [[Colonne]], Lamoureux and Conservatoire concerts in Paris. He was able to hear concerts, recitals or master classes by many of the leading pianists of the day, including Liszt and [[Anton Rubinstein]]. He knew [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], a close friend of Chopin's, and was a pall-bearer at Alkan's funeral in 1888; he subsequently edited many of Alkan's works for republication.<ref>Smith (2000) I, 75-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1890 Philipp formed a trio with Loeb and Bertelier which toured for about a decade. He revived the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Instruments \u00e0 Vent from 1896 to 1901. However, he eventually curtailed his concertizing, as he found lasting satisfaction in teaching. He returned to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he was a pre-eminent professor of piano from 1893 to 1934, one of the youngest ever appointed to that institution. From 1921 to 1933, Philipp was also the head of the piano section at the American Conservatory of [[Fontainebleau]], which became famous for starting the careers of many notable American composers. His home in Paris contained many ancient and unusual instruments and other musical artifacts. When the [[Nazis]] entered Paris in World War II and Philipp fled to the United States in 1940, the Nazis confiscated the contents of his apartment.\n\nHe left for the United States in 1941 and taught in New York and L'Alliance Francais in Louiseville, Quebec, Canada. During the war, he taught piano in [[New York City]] and at the [[Conservatoire de musique du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al]]. While he was in New York, he gave recitals with the violinist [[John Corigliano|John Corigliano, Sr.]] (Corigliano was the longtime [[concertmaster]] of the [[New York Philharmonic]]).<ref>[http://www2.inow.com/~starr/Photos/philipp.htm Isidor Philipp, pianist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220530/http://www2.inow.com/~starr/Photos/philipp.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> After the war, he spent the rest of his life between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]].\n\nPhilipp married once but he obtained a [[divorce]] shortly afterwards.\n\nOn 20 March 1955, aged 91, he played the piano part in both [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' D minor Sonata and [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s [[Violin Sonata (Franck)|Violin Sonata]] in New York, returning to Paris a year later. He gave his farewell recital at the age of 92, in Paris. He died there in 1958 after a fall on the Paris metro.<ref name=bach/> He is buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\nIn 197{{when|date=December 2019}} the Isidor Philipp Archives were deposited at the University of Louisville by the American Liszt Society. They gather his compositions for the piano, his exercises and studies, his editions of the works of Franz Liszt, as well as exercises, studies and works on other composers, recordings, correspondence, photographs, and other artifacts.\n\n== The Chopin tradition ==\nPhilipp began piano lessons with George Mathias at age 16. In an interview with E.H. Lampard, a columnist for the St. Catharine's Standard, Harold Bradley, who was a student and associate of Philipp's for over 30 years, stated that it was Mathias who had been the one student of Chopin who absorbed all the wisdom and value in piano pedagogy that Chopin had developed over his life. \"Chopin's fame as a composer has obscured the fact that he was the first and greatest name to adopt the career of piano teaching as a profession. He created an entirely new philosophy of musical thinking, and was the first musician of sufficient stature to be able to penetrate into the thought of the keyboard composers who preceded him to the extent of seeing the individual merits of each. Thus, he extended the dimensions of piano teaching to a point where the whole concept of music education became affected.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nAs most of Chopin's students were amateurs, or died early, Mathias was the only one who could pass on this legacy. Bradley continued, \"This is not to be confused with the mere performance of Chopin's own compositions, but an appreciation of the art of the keyboard composers up to his time and the genius to apply this knowledge. At Chopin's death, it was Mathias who was able to furnish information for the complete publication of his compositions but he also felt an obligation to preserve the contribution Chopin had made as a teacher and artist. Mathias in turn trained young pianists, but it proved to be Isidor Philipp that was best equipped to carry on the Chopin philosophy of teaching. Philipp then worked with Mathias that the latter had worked with Chopin. By the age of 30, because of his studies Mathias and other prominent teachers, Philipp was recognized as the supreme authority on the piano and its literature.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n== Teaching philosophy ==\n{{essay|date=May 2013}}\nIn interviews his students remember him with a great deal of affection and remark about his gentle and patient manner as a teacher. Students commented that he stressed suppleness, firmness, rhythmic exactitude and articulation. He insisted on practicing with the metronome, first slowly, then incrementally faster for all technical exercises and in learning any new piece. He taught that octaves should be played from the wrist, with a motionless arm, and that fingers should attain true independence of one another. Like other great teachers, he did not have a 'system', but taught what the student needed at the time. Paul Loyonnet stated his ideals were velocity, sobriety of expression and the ''jeu perle'' style. As for interpretations, he stressed that the student must know the piece intimately and thoroughly before it can be properly played, but did not force any particular interpretation.\n\nPhilipp's repertoire was wide, from the earliest keyboard masters to contemporary composers. He believed that every pianist should be conversant in all styles and eras of piano, and did not shy from playing [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] or other early composers on a modern grand. One of his teaching points was that pianists should play any piece of music the way the composer intended, and seeking out what the composer intended is often a lifelong process. Nonetheless, each pianist should have his own views on the pieces and not just copy what another has done.\n\nPhilipp wrote, \"The quality most desirable in piano playing is tone. Tone should be worked at from the first, and the pupil must listen attentively to it. To produce a beautiful tone, Thalberg said, 'one should in a way knead the keyboard with a hand of velvet, the key being rather felt than struck.' It is essential to maintain the utmost relaxation in the arms, wrists and hands.\" Fernando Laires said that Philipp insisted that the music and the tone should arise from deep within the piano, not pounded out at the keyboard, and by that he meant that he must come deep within one's soul, not at the fingertips.\n\nRubato, Philipp wrote, does not mean playing out of time, but rather, \"any ritenuto that we may be impelled to make, must be compensated by a corresponding accelerando and also the opposite, the bass keeping exactly the time.\" Although Philipp abhorred distortions in interpreting pieces, he believed that \"even when all the interpretive signs are exactly observed, there remains ample scope for self expression and liberty. You must be living and feeling the drama or the poem or the piece you play, in all its inflections and shades of emotion. What you do not feel yourself, your listeners will not get. You must be fully absorbed in the interpretation.\"<ref>Philipp, \"Some Thoughts on Piano Playing,\" Durand et fils (1928)</ref>\n\nWhen his friend [[Claude Debussy]] was composing new pieces for the piano, he would often ask Philipp for advice on notation so that pianists would be able to better understand his nuances and approach. After considerable deliberation, they both decided that almost no pedal markings should be used in any of the published pieces. Their reasoning is that every piano is different in quality, every room or hall is different in size and resonance, and each pianist has different capabilities. To lock in one form of pedaling to cover all possible circumstances would place the pedaling notation above the effects that Debussy wished to achieve. They decided that pedaling only where it is absolutely necessary, and gave discretion to the pianist to use it as needed. Although this has often been abused by some pianists who use it to cloud the harmonies, or achieve a very dry sound, it remains a point of discussion for every pianist who chooses to perform Debussy's piano works.\n\nHarold Bradley stated that Philipp didn't necessarily always take the 'best' students as his pupils. Sometimes, he would accept a student who had only a few years of instruction and was at the intermediate level, and often he would refuse to teach even top level pianists. For Philipp, the most important attribute of a student wasn't his or her particular level of accomplishment, but whether they were teachable or not. Bradley said that Philipp could often tell a pianist's personality just by listening to him play.  Bradley created an institute (Bradley Institute of Music) that embodied the educational philosophies of Isidor Philipp.<ref>\"World Famous Musicians Teach at Harold Bradley School of Music\", Lockport, N.Y. Union-Sun & Journal, July 20, 1957</ref>  The institute's staff worked closely with Philipp to create a musical education that worked from pre-school aged children on.\n\n== Association, students and friends ==\nPhilipp allowed his name to be associated with the Bradley Institute for Music Education Research, Ltd., which was founded in Paris, in 1930, but moved to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], Canada, under the guidance of his pupil Harold Bradley. The Institute was devoted not only to teaching music, but also to documenting the vast knowledge of teaching traditions that Philipp had learned during his long life. Philipp's friend, violinist John Corigliano, Sr., was among the original Board of Directors. Pianist Grace Barnes and violinist Deryck Aird served as music teachers along with Bradley for several decades.\n\nThe list of Isidor Philipp's students who became notable pianists, composers or conductors is very long, and includes [[Stell Andersen]], Dwight Anderson, Grace Barnes, [[Emma Boynet]], [[Harold Bradley (pianist)]], John Buttrick, [[Serge Conus]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Jeanne-Marie Darr\u00e9]], [[Pierre Dervaux]], [[Ania Dorfmann]], [[Rolande Falcinelli]], [[Felix Fox]], [[Jean Fran\u00e7aix]], [[Henri Gagnon]], [[Florence Parr Gere]], [[Youra Guller]], [[Georges Hugon]], Fernando Laires, Malvina Leshock, [[Yvonne Loriod]], [[Nikita Magaloff]], [[Federico Mompou]], [[L\u00e9o-Pol Morin]], [[Guiomar Novaes]], [[Ozan Marsh]], [[Wilfrid Pelletier]], [[\u00c9mile Poillot]], [[Harrison Potter]], noted philosopher [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Phyllis Sellick]], [[Soulima Stravinsky]], [[Louise Talma]], [[Alexander Tcherepnin]], [[Beveridge Webster]], and [[Victor Young]].<ref>[http://louisville.edu/library/music/coll/philipp.html University of Louisville]</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Federico+Mompou:+Catalonian+composer+magnifico-a0156361347 The Free Library]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/Loriod.htm |title=Yvonne Loriod-Messiaen |access-date=2009-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427073326/http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/Loriod.htm |archive-date=2007-04-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/music/musyoung.xml New York Public Library]</ref><ref>[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/c.asp?c=C203 Hyperion Records]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, many prominent and well established pianists would seek out his advice, particularly on playing French composers, which included [[Claude Debussy]]. Philipp often championed new music throughout his long life, and would frequently edit the works of contemporary composers, such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and [[Maurice Ravel]]. He was close friends with many of the leading pianists and composers of his day, including [[Leopold Godowsky]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]], [[Josef Hofmann]], [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], [[Alfred Cortot]], [[Lazare-L\u00e9vy]], [[Emile-Robert Blanchet]], [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Nadia Boulanger]], [[Jules Massenet]], [[C\u00e9cile Chaminade]], [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]] and [[Charles-Marie Widor]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nPianist [[Rudolf Serkin]] said that not having studied with Philipp was one of the regrets of his life.

{"title_page": "Kilroy was here", "text_new": "\n\n> So who was Kilroy? \n> \n> In 1946 the American Transit Association, through its radio program, \"Speak to America ,\" sponsored a nationwide contest to find the real Kilroy, offering a  prize of a real trolley car to the person who could prove himself to be the genuine article. Almost 40 men stepped forward to make that claim, but only James Kilroy from Halifax , Massachusetts , had evidence of his identity.\n>  \n> 'Kilroy' was a 46-year old shipyard worker during the war who worked as a checker at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy . His  job was to go around and check on the number of rivets completed. Riveters were on piecework and got paid by the rivet. He would count a block of rivets and put a check mark in semi-waxed lumber chalk, so the rivets wouldn't be counted twice. When Kilroy went off duty, the riveters would erase the mark.\n> \n> Later on, an off-shift inspector would come through and count the rivets a second time, resulting in double pay for the riveters. \n> \n> One day Kilroy's boss called him into his office. The foreman was upset about all the wages being paid to riveters, and asked him to investigate. It was then he realized what had been going on. The tight spaces he had to crawl in to check the rivets didn't lend themselves to lugging around a paint can and brush, so Kilroy decided to stick with the waxy chalk. He continued to put his check mark on each job he inspected, but added 'KILROY WAS HERE' in king-sized letters next to the check, and eventually added the sketch of the chap with the long nose peering over the fence and that became part of the Kilroy message. \n> \n> Once he did that, the riveters stopped trying to wipe away his marks. Ordinarily the rivets and chalk marks would have been covered up with paint. With the war on, however, ships were leaving the Quincy Yard so fast that there wasn't time to paint them. As a result, Kilroy's inspection \"trademark\" was seen by thousands of servicemen who boarded the troopships the yard produced. \n> \n> His message apparently rang a bell with the servicemen, because they picked it up and spread it all over Europe and the South Pacific. \n> \n> Before war's end, \"Kilroy\" had been here, there, and everywhere on the long hauls to Berlin and Tokyo . To the troops outbound in those ships, however, he was a complete mystery; all they knew for sure was that someone named Kilroy had \"been there first.\" As a joke, U.S. servicemen began placing the graffiti wherever they landed, claiming it was already there when they arrived. \n> \n> Kilroy became the U.S. super-GI who had always \"already been\" wherever GIs went. It became a challenge to place the logo in the most unlikely places imaginable (it is said to be atop Mt. Everest , the Statue of Liberty , the underside of the Arc de Triomphe, and even scrawled in the dust on the moon. \n> \n> As the war went on, the legend grew. Underwater demolition teams routinely sneaked ashore on Japanese-held islands in the Pacific to map the terrain for coming invasions by U.S. troops (and thus, presumably, were the first GI's there). On one occasion, however, they reported seeing enemy troops painting over the Kilroy logo! \n> \n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\n{{About|the graffiti|}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Kilroy Was Here - Washington DC WWII Memorial.jpg|thumb|300px|Engraving of Kilroy on the [[National World War II Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[File:OPERATIONS CROSSROADS, ATOM BOMB TEST, BIKINI ATOLL 111-adc-7171 HD 2Mbps.webm|thumb|right|thumbtime=00:49|300px|\"Kilroy was here\" graffiti by [[Bikini Atoll]], film shot in 1946]]\n\n'''Kilroy was here''' is an [[United States|American]] symbol that became popular during [[World War II]], typically seen in graffiti. Its origin is debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle became associated with [[G.I.

The character of Chad may have been derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating \"Kilroy was here\".

The Didgori-3 is fitted with a self-recovery winch and can tow trailers or artillery pieces.<ref>{{cite-web|url=http://www.military-today.com/apc/didgori_3.htm|title=Didgori 3 - Mine resistant ambush protected vehicle|publisher=Military-today.com|accessdate=12 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Armor ==\nThe armour withstands impacts of [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] AP rounds, mine blasts from underneath in accordance to STANAG level 2 and direct grenade hits. Further details are unknown, since the composition of the material is classified. The [[monocoque]] steel [[v-hull]] provides protection against [[small arm]]s fire, [[artillery]] shell [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]], anti-personnel/tank [[Land mine|mines]] and [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]s. \n\nFront wheel arches are designed to be blown away to free blast pockets. The design is meant to follow the basic principle of US [[MRAP]] vehicles for peacekeeping missions.\n\n== Users ==\n<!-- READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

One day, Kaveri ([[Rupini (actress)|Rupini]]) comes to Ellaichami's village to find out the person who raped her but she didn't see the culprit's face. Ellaichami promises to not prepare any ceremony until he catches the rapist. In the meantime, Ellaichami's sister becomes pregnant. Ellaichami, worried to prepare her wedding as soon as possible, lies that he raped Kaveri. Ellaichami marries Kaveri and his sister gets married to her lover at the same time.\n\nThe villagers elect a new village chief because Ellaichami's image is deteriorated. Kaveri reveals to Ellaichami that she lied and nobody raped her. Kaveri turns out to be Minor Muthurasu's relative. In the past, Minor Muthurasu compelled her to marry her but she refused and fled.

While in the nearby village, Ellaichami ([[R. Sarathkumar]]) is a brave village chieftain and he protects the village. Ellaichami's sister (Gowri) and the village's veterinarian (Vetri Vigneshwar) are in love. One day, Kaveri ([[Rupini (actress)|Rupini]]) comes to Ellaichami's village to find out the person who raped her but she didn't see the culprit's face. Ellaichami promises to not prepare any ceremony until he catches the rapist. In the meantime, Ellaichami's sister becomes pregnant. Ellaichami, worried to prepare her wedding as soon as possible, lies that he raped Kaveri. Ellaichami gets married to Kaveri and his sister gets married to her lover at the same time.\n\nThe villagers elect a new village chief because Ellaichami's image is deteriorated. Kaveri reveals to Ellaichami that she lied and nobody raped her. Kaveri turns out to be Minor Muthurasu's relative. In the past, Minor Muthurasu compelled her to marry her but she refused and fled. Kaveri landed in Ellaichami's village and met his sister who gave her that idea.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[R.

These were collectively referred to as the \"Punjab Hill States\". These small states, ruled by [[Rajput|Rajput kings]], were variously independent, vassals of the [[Mughal Empire]] since the time of [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]] or sometimes controlled from [[Kangra State|Kangra state]] in the Himachal area. Following the decline of the Mughals, turbulence in Kangra and invasions of Gorkhas, the hill states fell successively under the control of the Sikhs under [[Ranjit Singh]].<ref name=\"HutchisonVogel1933\">{{cite book|last1=Hutchison|first1=J.|last2=Vogel|first2=Jean Philippe|title=History of the Panjab Hill States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uXgQwAACAAJ|accessdate=23 October 2011|year=1933|publisher=Superint., Gov.

In the [[Treaty of Lahore]] of 1846, the Sikhs were made to surrender the valuable region (the Jullundur Doab) between the [[Beas River]] and the [[Sutlej River]] and required to pay an indemnity of 1.2 million rupees. Because they could not readily raise this sum, the East India Company allowed the [[Dogra]] ruler [[Gulab Singh]] to acquire Kashmir from the Sikh kingdom in exchange for making a payment of 750,000 rupees to the Company.

The demand took a violent turn on the [[Direct Action Day]] (16 August 1946) and inter-communal violence between Hindus and Muslims became endemic. Consequently, a decision was taken on 3 June 1947 to divide [[British India]] into two separate states, the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] comprising the Muslim majority areas and the [[Union of India]] comprising the rest. The two provinces [[Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] with large Muslim-majority areas were to be divided between the two dominions. An estimated 11 million people eventually migrated between the two parts of Punjab, and possibly 1 million perished in the inter-communal violence. Jammu and Kashmir, being adjacent to the Punjab province, was directly affected by the happenings in Punjab.\n\n[[File:Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], Supreme Commander of Indian and Pakistani armed forces]]\nThe original target date for the transfer of power to the new dominions was June 1948. However, fearing the rise of inter-communal violence, the British Viceroy [[Lord Mountbatten]] advanced the date to 15 August 1947. This gave only 6 weeks to complete all the arrangements for partition.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&nbsp;320}} Mountbatten's original plan was to stay on the joint Governor General for both the dominions till June 1948. However, this was not accepted by the Pakistani leader [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]. In the event, Mountbatten stayed on as the Governor General of India, whereas Pakistan chose Jinnah as its Governor General.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&nbsp;329\u2013330}} It was envisaged that the nationalisation of the armed forces could not be completed by 15 August.{{efn|At the beginning of 1947, all the posts above the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army were held by British officers.{{sfn|Sarila, The Shadow of the Great Game|2007|p=324}} Pakistan had only four lieutenant colonels,{{sfn|Barua, Gentlemen of the Raj|2003|p=133}} two of whom were involved in the Kashmir conflict: Akbar Khan and Sher Khan.{{sfn|Nawaz, The First Kashmir War Revisited|2008}} At the beginning of the war, India had about 500 British officers and Pakistan over 1000.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|p=43}}}} Hence British officers stayed on after the transfer of power. The service chiefs were appointed by the Dominion governments and were responsible to them. The overall administrative control, but not operational control, was vested with Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], who was titled the 'Supreme Commander', answerable to a newly formed Joint Defence Council of the two dominions. India appointed General [[Rob Lockhart]] as its Army chief and Pakistan appointed General [[Frank Messervy]].{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=262\u2013265}}\n\nThe presence of the British commanding officers on both sides made the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 a strange war. The two commanding officers were in daily telephone contact and adopted mutually defensive positions. The attitude was that \"you can hit them so hard but not too hard, otherwise there will be all kinds of repercussions.\"{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|pp=54,&nbsp;56}} Both Lockhart and Messervy were replaced in the course of war, and their successors [[Roy Bucher]] and [[Douglas Gracey]] tried to exercise restraint on their respective governments. Roy Bucher was apparently successful in doing so in India, but Gracey yielded and let British officers be used in operational roles on the side of Pakistan. One British officer even died in action.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|pp=57\u201358}}\n\n==Developments in Jammu and Kashmir (August\u2013October 1947)==\n[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]]]\nWith the independence of the Dominions, the [[British Paramountcy]] over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an [[Instrument of Accession]]. [[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister [[Ram Chandra Kak]], decided not to accede to either dominion. The reasons cited were that the Muslim majority population of the State would not be comfortable with joining India, and that the Hindu and Sikh minorities would become vulnerable if the state joined Pakistan.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010|p=45}}\n\nIn 1947, the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir had a wide range of ethnic and religious communities. The [[Kashmir Division|Kashmir province]] consisting of the [[Kashmir Valley]] and the [[Muzaffarabad district]] had a majority Muslim population (over 90%). The [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]], consisting of 5 districts, had a roughly equal division of Hindus and Muslims in the eastern districts ([[Udhampur]], [[Jammu]] and [[Reasi]]) and Muslim majority in the western districts ([[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]]). The mountainous [[Ladakh]] district (''wazarat'') in the east had a significant Buddhist presence with a Muslim majority in [[Baltistan]]. The [[Gilgit Agency]] in the north was overwhelmingly Muslim and was directly governed by the British under an agreement with the Maharaja. Shortly before the transfer of power, the British returned the Gilgit Agency to the Maharaja, who appointed a [[Dogra]] governor for the district and a British commander for the local forces.\n\n\nThe predominant political movement in the Kashmir Valley, the [[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] led by [[Sheikh Abdullah]], believed in secular politics. It was allied with the [[Indian National Congress]] and was believed to favour joining India. On the other hand, the Muslims of the Jammu province supported the [[All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference|Muslim Conference]], which was allied to the [[All-India Muslim League]] and favoured joining Pakistan. The Hindus of the Jammu province favoured an outright merger with India.<ref>{{citation |first=Balraj |last=Puri |authorlink=Balraj Puri |title=The Question of Accession |journal=Epilogue |volume=4 |number=11 |pp=4\u20136 |date=November 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMxJzb7N_8wC&pg=PA4 |ref={{sfnref|Puri, The Question of Accession|2010}}}}</ref> In the midst of all the diverging views, the Maharaja's decision to remain independent was apparently a judicious one.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010}}\n{{clear left}}\n===Operation Gulmarg plan===\n{{Location map+\n|Pakistan\n|float      = right\n|width      = 250\n|caption    = Operation Gulmarg locations\n|nodiv      = 1\n|mini       = 1\n|places     =\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.36|N |long=73.47|E |label=Muzaffarabad |position=right |link=Muzaffarabad |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.76|N |long=74.09|E |label=Poonch |position=right |link=Poonch (town) |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.98|N |long=74.07|E |label=Bhimber |position=right |link=Bhimber |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.18|N |long=73.24|E |label=Abbottabad |position=left |link=Abbottabad |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.75|N |long=72.35|E |label=Swat |position=left |link=Swat (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.20|N |long=71.88|E |label=Dir |position=left |link=Dir (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.85|N |long=71.79|E |label=Chitral |position=left |link=Chitral (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.94|N |long=70.61|E |label=Bannu |position=right |link=Bannu |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.29|N |long=69.57|E |label=Wanna |position=right |link=Wanna, Pakistan |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.58|N |long=71.42|E |label=Kohat |position=right |link=Kohat |Red=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.37|N |long=70.55|E |label=Thall |position=right |link=Thall |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.01|N |long=71.98|E |label=Nowshera |position=right |link=Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.507284|N |long=73.35631334|E |label=Indus river |position=right |link=Indus River |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=31.712541|N |long=74.456148|E |label=Ravi river |position=river |link=Ravi River |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n}}\n\nAccording to Indian military sources, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called '''Operation Gulmarg''' and put it into action as early as 20 August, a few days after Pakistan's independence. The plan got accidentally revealed to an Indian officer, Major O. S. Kalkat serving with the [[Bannu Brigade]].{{efn|Major Kalkat was the [[Brigade Major]] at the [[Bannu Brigade]], who opened a Demi-Official letter marked \"Personal/Top Secret\" on 20 August 1947 signed by General [[Frank Messervy]], the then Commander in Chief of the Pakistan Army.

Poonch was originally an internal ''jagir'' (autonomous principality), governed by an alternative family line of Maharaja Hari Singh. The taxation is said to have been heavy. The Muslims of Poonch had long campaigned for the principality to be absorbed into the Punjab province of British India.

But the precisely what the two parties wanted, and if we could be sure that they spoke, collectively, for the Kashmiri people. But the intentions of the party leaders in 1947 are obscure and their representativeness questionable. To take the second point first, support for Pakistan in Kashmir was by no means co-extensive with support for the MC. On the one hand some Kashmiris appear to have adopted Abbas party' mainly out of respect for Jinnah and as a vehicle through which to 'express their sentiment about Pakistan and the Muslim League'. As Ghulam Muhammad noted in a letter to Jinnah: 'The people of Srinagar are League-struck even...though they neither had nor have any faith in Mirwaiz'.

Saraf remembers that it 'was a common sight in the 1940s to find the photographs of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and those of Allama Iqbal and Quaid-e-Azam hanging side by side in the houses or business premises of supporters of the National Conference; while League member Samseenuddin Khan, who visited Kashmir in 1945, found that the 'jewellers and ordinary folk' he spoke to regarded themselves as 'under the banner of the Muslim League' and staunch disciples of 'the Congress leader Sheikh Abdullah'.|access-date=26 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726214858/https://books.google.com/books?id=VaeuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219|archive-date=26 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Stages of the war==\n[[File:J&K01low.jpg|right|thumb|300px|State defence of the Kashmir Valley 22 October 1947&nbsp;\u2013 26 October 1947]]\n===Initial invasion===\n\nThe first clash occurred at [[Thorar]] on 3\u20134 October 1947.<ref name=\"reg history\"/>\nOn 22 October another attack was launched in the Muzaffarabad sector.

These were collectively referred to as the \"Punjab Hill States\". These small states, ruled by [[Rajput|Rajput kings]], were variously independent, vassals of the [[Mughal Empire]] since the time of [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]] or sometimes controlled from [[Kangra State|Kangra state]] in the Himachal area. Following the decline of the Mughals, turbulence in Kangra and invasions of Gorkhas, the hill states fell successively under the control of the Sikhs under [[Ranjit Singh]].<ref name=\"HutchisonVogel1933\">{{cite book|last1=Hutchison|first1=J.|last2=Vogel|first2=Jean Philippe|title=History of the Panjab Hill States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uXgQwAACAAJ|accessdate=23 October 2011|year=1933|publisher=Superint., Gov.

In the [[Treaty of Lahore]] of 1846, the Sikhs were made to surrender the valuable region (the Jullundur Doab) between the [[Beas River]] and the [[Sutlej River]] and required to pay an indemnity of 1.2 million rupees. Because they could not readily raise this sum, the East India Company allowed the [[Dogra]] ruler [[Gulab Singh]] to acquire Kashmir from the Sikh kingdom in exchange for making a payment of 750,000 rupees to the Company.

The demand took a violent turn on the [[Direct Action Day]] (16 August 1946) and inter-communal violence between Hindus and Muslims became endemic. Consequently, a decision was taken on 3 June 1947 to divide [[British India]] into two separate states, the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] comprising the Muslim majority areas and the [[Union of India]] comprising the rest. The two provinces [[Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] with large Muslim-majority areas were to be divided between the two dominions. An estimated 11 million people eventually migrated between the two parts of Punjab, and possibly 1 million perished in the inter-communal violence. Jammu and Kashmir, being adjacent to the Punjab province, was directly affected by the happenings in Punjab.\n\n[[File:Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], Supreme Commander of Indian and Pakistani armed forces]]\nThe original target date for the transfer of power to the new dominions was June 1948. However, fearing the rise of inter-communal violence, the British Viceroy [[Lord Mountbatten]] advanced the date to 15 August 1947. This gave only 6 weeks to complete all the arrangements for partition.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&nbsp;320}} Mountbatten's original plan was to stay on the joint Governor General for both the dominions till June 1948. However, this was not accepted by the Pakistani leader [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]. In the event, Mountbatten stayed on as the Governor General of India, whereas Pakistan chose Jinnah as its Governor General.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&nbsp;329\u2013330}} It was envisaged that the nationalisation of the armed forces could not be completed by 15 August.{{efn|At the beginning of 1947, all the posts above the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army were held by British officers.{{sfn|Sarila, The Shadow of the Great Game|2007|p=324}} Pakistan had only four lieutenant colonels,{{sfn|Barua, Gentlemen of the Raj|2003|p=133}} two of whom were involved in the Kashmir conflict: Akbar Khan and Sher Khan.{{sfn|Nawaz, The First Kashmir War Revisited|2008}} At the beginning of the war, India had about 500 British officers and Pakistan over 1000.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|p=43}}}} Hence British officers stayed on after the transfer of power. The service chiefs were appointed by the Dominion governments and were responsible to them. The overall administrative control, but not operational control, was vested with Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], who was titled the 'Supreme Commander', answerable to a newly formed Joint Defence Council of the two dominions. India appointed General [[Rob Lockhart]] as its Army chief and Pakistan appointed General [[Frank Messervy]].{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=262\u2013265}}\n\nThe presence of the British commanding officers on both sides made the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 a strange war. The two commanding officers were in daily telephone contact and adopted mutually defensive positions. The attitude was that \"you can hit them so hard but not too hard, otherwise there will be all kinds of repercussions.\"{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|pp=54,&nbsp;56}} Both Lockhart and Messervy were replaced in the course of war, and their successors [[Roy Bucher]] and [[Douglas Gracey]] tried to exercise restraint on their respective governments. Roy Bucher was apparently successful in doing so in India, but Gracey yielded and let British officers be used in operational roles on the side of Pakistan. One British officer even died in action.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945\u201366|2014|pp=57\u201358}}\n\n==Developments in Jammu and Kashmir (August\u2013October 1947)==\n[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]]]\nWith the independence of the Dominions, the [[British Paramountcy]] over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an [[Instrument of Accession]]. [[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister [[Ram Chandra Kak]], decided not to accede to either dominion. The reasons cited were that the Muslim majority population of the State would not be comfortable with joining India, and that the Hindu and Sikh minorities would become vulnerable if the state joined Pakistan.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010|p=45}}\n\nIn 1947, the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir had a wide range of ethnic and religious communities. The [[Kashmir Division|Kashmir province]] consisting of the [[Kashmir Valley]] and the [[Muzaffarabad district]] had a majority Muslim population (over 90%). The [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]], consisting of 5 districts, had a roughly equal division of Hindus and Muslims in the eastern districts ([[Udhampur]], [[Jammu]] and [[Reasi]]) and Muslim majority in the western districts ([[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]]). The mountainous [[Ladakh]] district (''wazarat'') in the east had a significant Buddhist presence with a Muslim majority in [[Baltistan]]. The [[Gilgit Agency]] in the north was overwhelmingly Muslim and was directly governed by the British under an agreement with the Maharaja. Shortly before the transfer of power, the British returned the Gilgit Agency to the Maharaja, who appointed a [[Dogra]] governor for the district and a British commander for the local forces.\n\n\nThe predominant political movement in the Kashmir Valley, the [[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] led by [[Sheikh Abdullah]], believed in secular politics. It was allied with the [[Indian National Congress]] and was believed to favour joining India. On the other hand, the Muslims of the Jammu province supported the [[All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference|Muslim Conference]], which was allied to the [[All-India Muslim League]] and favoured joining Pakistan. The Hindus of the Jammu province favoured an outright merger with India.<ref>{{citation |first=Balraj |last=Puri |authorlink=Balraj Puri |title=The Question of Accession |journal=Epilogue |volume=4 |number=11 |pp=4\u20136 |date=November 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMxJzb7N_8wC&pg=PA4 |ref={{sfnref|Puri, The Question of Accession|2010}}}}</ref> In the midst of all the diverging views, the Maharaja's decision to remain independent was apparently a judicious one.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010}}\n{{clear left}}\n===Operation Gulmarg plan===\n{{Location map+\n|Pakistan\n|float      = right\n|width      = 250\n|caption    = Operation Gulmarg locations\n|nodiv      = 1\n|mini       = 1\n|places     =\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.36|N |long=73.47|E |label=Muzaffarabad |position=right |link=Muzaffarabad |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.76|N |long=74.09|E |label=Poonch |position=right |link=Poonch (town) |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.98|N |long=74.07|E |label=Bhimber |position=right |link=Bhimber |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.18|N |long=73.24|E |label=Abbottabad |position=left |link=Abbottabad |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.75|N |long=72.35|E |label=Swat |position=left |link=Swat (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.20|N |long=71.88|E |label=Dir |position=left |link=Dir (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.85|N |long=71.79|E |label=Chitral |position=left |link=Chitral (princely state) |mark=Green pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.94|N |long=70.61|E |label=Bannu |position=right |link=Bannu |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=32.29|N |long=69.57|E |label=Wanna |position=right |link=Wanna, Pakistan |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.58|N |long=71.42|E |label=Kohat |position=right |link=Kohat |Red=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=33.37|N |long=70.55|E |label=Thall |position=right |link=Thall |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=34.01|N |long=71.98|E |label=Nowshera |position=right |link=Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa |mark=Red pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=0}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=35.507284|N |long=73.35631334|E |label=Indus river |position=right |link=Indus River |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n{{location map~ |Pakistan |lat=31.712541|N |long=74.456148|E |label=Ravi river |position=river |link=Ravi River |mark=Blue pog.svg |marksize=4 |label_size=70}}\n}}\n\nAccording to Indian military sources, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called '''Operation Gulmarg''' and put it into action as early as 20 August, a few days after Pakistan's independence.

He escaped and made his way to New Delhi on 18 October. However, the Indian military authorities and defence minister did not believe his information. He was recalled and debriefed on 24 October after the tribal invasion of Kashmir had started.{{sfn|Prasad & Pal, Operations in Jammu & Kashmir |1987 |p=17}}}} According to the plan, 20 ''lashkars'' (tribal militias), each consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribesmen, were to be recruited from among various Pashtun tribes, and armed at the brigade headquarters at [[Bannu]], [[Wanna, Pakistan|Wanna]], [[Peshawar]], [[Kohat]], [[Thall]] and [[Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]] by the first week of September. They were expected to reach the launching point of [[Abbottabad]] on 18 October, and cross into Jammu and Kashmir on 22 October. Ten lashkars were expected to attack the [[Kashmir Valley]] through [[Muzaffarabad]] and another ten lashkars were expected to join the rebels in [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]], [[Bhimber District|Bhimber]] and [[Rawalakot]] with a view to advance to [[Jammu]].

It might, if we knew precisely what the two parties wanted, and if we could be sure that they spoke, collectively, for the Kashmiri people. But the precisely what the two parties wanted, and if we could be sure that they spoke, collectively, for the Kashmiri people. But the intentions of the party leaders in 1947 are obscure and their representativeness questionable. To take the second point first, support for Pakistan in Kashmir was by no means co-extensive with support for the MC. On the one hand some Kashmiris appear to have adopted Abbas party' mainly out of respect for Jinnah and as a vehicle through which to 'express their sentiment about Pakistan and the Muslim League'. As Ghulam Muhammad noted in a letter to Jinnah: 'The people of Srinagar are League-struck even...though they neither had nor have any faith in Mirwaiz'. On the other hand, many NC followers seem to have divided up their allegiance, acknowledging Abdullah as their leader 'up to Kohala' \u2013 that is, locally- and Jinnah beyond.
