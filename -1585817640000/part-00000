First released in Japan on April 30, 1999, it was later released as the first ''Stadium'' title in Western regions the following year, and is a sequel to the Japanese-only 1998 Nintendo 64 release ''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium''. The gameplay revolves around a 3D turn-based battling system using the 151 Pok\u00e9mon from the [[Game Boy]] games ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red, Pok\u00e9mon Blue]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow]]''.\n\nThe game was originally intended for the [[64DD|Nintendo 64's DD add-on]], but ended up turning into a standard console game after the add-on failed. Using the [[Transfer Pak]] accessory that was bundled with the game, players are able to view, organize, store, trade, and battle their own Pok\u00e9mon uploaded from ''Pok\u00e9mon Red, Pok\u00e9mon Blue'', and ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''. One of the main focuses of the game is the completion of the four stadium cups, each of which is a series of three-on-three Pok\u00e9mon battles against an ordered lineup of opponents. Another battle mode called Gym Leader Castle allows battles against the eight Kanto gym leaders and the Elite Four. Other features of ''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium'' include mini-games, versus-style battles, a hall of fame, compatibility with the [[Game Boy Printer]], and a built-in emulation function for ''Pok\u00e9mon Red, Pok\u00e9mon Blue'', and ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium'' went on to become one of the Nintendo 64's best-selling titles, reaching one million copies sold before the end of 2000. Critical reception of the game was mixed, with critics praising the game's visuals but finding fault with the audio quality. A sequel, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2]]'', was released in 2000 and 2001 as a counterpart for the next-generation ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|Pok\u00e9mon Gold, Pok\u00e9mon Silver]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]]'' games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{See also|Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon}}\n\n[[File:DragoniteVsParasect.JPG|thumb|left|The player's [[Dragonite]] faces off against the opponent's [[Parasect]]. Pok\u00e9mon in this game may be rented or imported from [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'', or ''Yellow'']].]]\n\nUnlike the [[Game Boy]] games ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow|Yellow]]'', ''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium'' does not have a storyline or a well-defined world, meaning that it is not considered a [[role-playing video game]].<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Instead the game challenges the player to defeat trainers at the Stadium, a tournament consisting of 4 \"Cups\" and 80 battles in total, as well as the Gym Leader Castle, where the player battles the 8 [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters#Kanto Gym Leaders|Kanto Gym Leaders]], the [[Kanto Elite Four]], and the [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters#Champions|Champion]]. When all Cups have been won and the Gym Leader Castle is completed, a battle against [[Mewtwo]] will be unlocked. Defeating Mewtwo [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlocks]] another round of Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and the Mewtwo battle, but with higher [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] difficulty.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n\nIn Stadium mode, the player is challenged to earn trophies by winning the Pika Cup, Petit Cup, Pok\u00e9 Cup, and Prime Cup, each having its own set of rules and restrictions. In the Pok\u00e9 and Prime Cups, four trophies may be earned, one for each level of difficulty, but the Pika and Petit Cups only award one trophy each. After choosing a Cup to compete in, the player decides on a party of six Pok\u00e9mon, which may include available rental Pok\u00e9mon and/or Pok\u00e9mon imported from a Game Boy cartridge. In each battle, the player and the opponent are only allowed to use three of their six Pok\u00e9mon. The player wins a trophy after successfully completing all battles in a Cup. If certain conditions are met using imported Pok\u00e9mon from a Game Boy cartridge, the player will be awarded a [[Pikachu]] with the move Surf, which unlocks a mini-game in ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Snag a Surfing Pikachu|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/08/snag-a-surfing-pikachu|date=March 7, 2000|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=2018-12-19}}</ref>\n\nIn the Gym Leader Castle, the player initially challenges the eight Kanto Gym Leaders from the Game Boy games, followed by the Elite Four, and finally the Champion. Before battling a Gym Leader, however, the player must defeat a gym's three Pok\u00e9mon trainers. Like in the Stadium, the player has to pick a team of six Pok\u00e9mon and may only use three at a time for battling. Each time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of eight randomly selected prize Pok\u00e9mon will be awarded, which can be transferred to the player's ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'', or ''Yellow'' game using the [[Transfer Pak]]. The prize Pok\u00e9mon are [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], [[Squirtle]], [[Hitmonlee]], [[Hitmonchan]], [[Eevee]], [[Kabuto (Pok\u00e9mon)|Kabuto]], and [[Omanyte]].\n\n===Other features===\n''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium'' includes other features, such as mini-games, a Game Boy Tower (a way to play the Game Boy games on the console via emulation), the Victory Palace (a showcase of Pok\u00e9mon that have been present in the player's team once achieving victory), Oak's Lab (featuring connectivity to the Game Boy titles including a Pok\u00e9dex), Free Battle (a battle between two players with set rules), Battle Now (a battle with pre-determined teams), and Gallery.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/PokemonStadiumOfficialPlayersGuide/Pokemon%20Stadium%20Official%20Player%27s%20Guide_djvu.txt|title=Pokemon Stadium Official Player's Guide |date=2000 |website=Archive.org |publisher= |access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe video game can work with a Game Boy Pok\u00e9mon game cartridge, allowing people to play their Pokemon that are stored on their Game Boy cartridge on their television through the Nintendo 64 console.

First released in Japan on April 30, 1999, it was later released as the first ''Stadium'' title in Western regions the following year, and is a sequel to the Japanese-only 1998 Nintendo 64 release ''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium''. The gameplay revolves around a 3D turn-based battling system using the 151 Pok\u00e9mon from the [[Game Boy]] games ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red, Pok\u00e9mon Blue]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow]]''.\n\nThe game was originally intended for the Nintendo 64's DD add-on, but ended up turning into a standard console game after the add-on failed. Using the [[Transfer Pak]] accessory that was bundled with the game, players are able to view, organize, store, trade, and battle their own Pok\u00e9mon uploaded from ''Pok\u00e9mon Red, Pok\u00e9mon Blue'', and ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''. One of the main focuses of the game is the completion of the four stadium cups, each of which is a series of three-on-three Pok\u00e9mon battles against an ordered lineup of opponents. Another battle mode called Gym Leader Castle allows battles against the eight Kanto gym leaders and the Elite Four. Other features of ''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium'' include mini-games, versus-style battles, a hall of fame, compatibility with the [[Game Boy Printer]], and a built-in emulation function for ''Pok\u00e9mon Red, Pok\u00e9mon Blue'', and ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium'' went on to become one of the Nintendo 64's best-selling titles, reaching one million copies sold before the end of 2000. Critical reception of the game was mixed, with critics praising the game's visuals but finding fault with the audio quality. A sequel, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2]]'', was released in 2000 and 2001 as a counterpart for the next-generation ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|Pok\u00e9mon Gold, Pok\u00e9mon Silver]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]]'' games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{See also|Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon}}\n\n[[File:DragoniteVsParasect.JPG|thumb|left|The player's [[Dragonite]] faces off against the opponent's [[Parasect]]. Pok\u00e9mon in this game may be rented or imported from [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'', or ''Yellow'']].]]\n\nUnlike the [[Game Boy]] games ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow|Yellow]]'', ''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium'' does not have a storyline or a well-defined world, meaning that it is not considered a [[role-playing video game]].<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Instead the game challenges the player to defeat trainers at the Stadium, a tournament consisting of 4 \"Cups\" and 80 battles in total, as well as the Gym Leader Castle, where the player battles the 8 [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters#Kanto Gym Leaders|Kanto Gym Leaders]], the [[Kanto Elite Four]], and the [[List of Pok\u00e9mon characters#Champions|Champion]]. When all Cups have been won and the Gym Leader Castle is completed, a battle against [[Mewtwo]] will be unlocked. Defeating Mewtwo [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlocks]] another round of Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and the Mewtwo battle, but with higher [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] difficulty.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n\nIn Stadium mode, the player is challenged to earn trophies by winning the Pika Cup, Petit Cup, Pok\u00e9 Cup, and Prime Cup, each having its own set of rules and restrictions. In the Pok\u00e9 and Prime Cups, four trophies may be earned, one for each level of difficulty, but the Pika and Petit Cups only award one trophy each. After choosing a Cup to compete in, the player decides on a party of six Pok\u00e9mon, which may include available rental Pok\u00e9mon and/or Pok\u00e9mon imported from a Game Boy cartridge. In each battle, the player and the opponent are only allowed to use three of their six Pok\u00e9mon. The player wins a trophy after successfully completing all battles in a Cup. If certain conditions are met using imported Pok\u00e9mon from a Game Boy cartridge, the player will be awarded a [[Pikachu]] with the move Surf, which unlocks a mini-game in ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Snag a Surfing Pikachu|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/08/snag-a-surfing-pikachu|date=March 7, 2000|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=2018-12-19}}</ref>\n\nIn the Gym Leader Castle, the player initially challenges the eight Kanto Gym Leaders from the Game Boy games, followed by the Elite Four, and finally the Champion. Before battling a Gym Leader, however, the player must defeat a gym's three Pok\u00e9mon trainers. Like in the Stadium, the player has to pick a team of six Pok\u00e9mon and may only use three at a time for battling. Each time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of eight randomly selected prize Pok\u00e9mon will be awarded, which can be transferred to the player's ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'', or ''Yellow'' game using the [[Transfer Pak]]. The prize Pok\u00e9mon are [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], [[Squirtle]], [[Hitmonlee]], [[Hitmonchan]], [[Eevee]], [[Kabuto (Pok\u00e9mon)|Kabuto]], and [[Omanyte]].\n\n===Other features===\n''Pok\u00e9mon Stadium'' includes other features, such as mini-games, a Game Boy Tower (a way to play the Game Boy games on the console via emulation), the Victory Palace (a showcase of Pok\u00e9mon that have been present in the player's team once achieving victory), Oak's Lab (featuring connectivity to the Game Boy titles including a Pok\u00e9dex), Free Battle (a battle between two players with set rules), Battle Now (a battle with pre-determined teams), and Gallery.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/PokemonStadiumOfficialPlayersGuide/Pokemon%20Stadium%20Official%20Player%27s%20Guide_djvu.txt|title=Pokemon Stadium Official Player's Guide |date=2000 |website=Archive.org |publisher= |access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe video game can work with a Game Boy Pok\u00e9mon game cartridge, allowing people to play their Pokemon that are stored on their Game Boy cartridge on their television through the Nintendo 64 console.

{"title_page": "Acousmatic Room Orchestration System", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=October 2015}}\n{{Advert|date=December 2019}}\n}}\nThe '''Acousmatic Room Orchestration System''' (AROS) is a multichannel sound system design for the playback of  sound and music  using a multitude of speakers.\n\nAROS was developed by the Swiss company Idee und Klang in 2005.  Its underlying idea is based on the loudspeaker orchestra (or [[Acousmonium]]), which was established in the early 1970s by the \u201a[[Groupe de recherches musicales]]' of [[Radio France]], especially by the composer [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayle]].\n\n== Philosophy ==\nIn an [[orchestra]] the [[space|spatial]] experience results from the fact that each musician plays his own part in a specific spatial location and on an instrument with a specific [[timbre]] and [[Directivity|sound diffusion]]. The acoustic properties of the concert hall certainly have a great influence on the resulting sound experience as well. Based on this idea, in AROS each sound element or part of a composition has got its own speaker and distinct location within the room.\n\nUnlike other multichannel sound systems such as [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] or [[Ambisonics]], AROS does not generate or reproduce pre-recorded spatial information. Instead, it generates spatiality by incorporating the [[Acoustics|acoustic]] characteristics of the actual space.\n\n== Setup and Functionality ==\nContrary to other [[Surround sound|3D audio systems]] which usually rely on a circular or spherical speaker placement, in AROS the speakers are distributed across the whole space, i.e. mounted on walls, fixed to the ceiling, put on the floor or even inside objects. The wider the speakers are spread, the greater the spatial depth becomes. The parameter of physical distance is equally important as the direction or angle of a speaker. Moreover, the speakers need not point strictly towards the centre, they might deliberately be aimed at a wall to achieve a diffusion effect. \nDifferent speaker types can be applied, ranging from directional to 360-degree speakers and featuring different frequency ranges. Some of them might be just tweeters if they merely have to render the part of some high-frequency sounds within the composition. The need for the speakers to be integrated into the architecture, in some cases even hidden away, sometimes calls for flexible solutions such as flat panel loudspeaker mounted behind walls, and also transducers inside of objects or underneath the floor might be appropriate.\n\nEach speaker is driven individually and various panning methods have been implemented. In 2010, a stand-alone panning server called PS-1 was developed, based on the SPAT object of [[IRCAM]]. This allows to mix 128 sources to 128 outputs. The automation data of the panning can be recorded in any [[Digital audio workstation|DAW]] like [[Pro Tools]], so any production or compositional environment suitable for the project may be chosen. \n\nAlthough any AROS setup is custom-made throughout, there is a standard configuration called AROS II. The sole purpose of this standard is the fact that it facilitates the exchange of work-in-progress mixes between studios (the final mixes are always created in the actual venue), and it also provides a solid setup to demonstrate AROS-mixes in a studio environment. AROS II features three levels of distance and height, in the smallest possible configuration.\n[[File:AROS_Aufbau_2D.png|thumb|150x150px|Setup AROS II System]]\n\n== Applications ==\nWalking through a room that is orchestrated by AROS, each distinct position is offering a different sonic perspective. It is, therefore, one possible solution for listening applications where the listener is expected to move within the room, namely at exhibitions, fairs or in theme parks.\n\nThe first project in which the Acousmatic Room Orchestration System was applied on a big scale was at the [[BMW Museum]] in [[Munich]], which opened its gates in 2008. The museum was equipped with 600 speakers. Each area within the partially acoustically transparent exhibition space has its very specific sound architecture.  \nIn a similar fashion AROS was integrated in places such as the [[Imperial War Museum]] in [[London]], the [http://www.atelier-brueckner.com/en/projects/state-grid-pavilion State Grid Pavillon] at the [[Expo 2010]] in [[Shanghai]], or the [http://museum.governmentsummit.org/2015/ Museum of Future Government Services 2015] in [[Dubai]].\n[[File:AROS_Aufbau_3D.png|thumb|150x150px|Setup AROS II System (3D view)]]\n\n== Literature ==\n* ''[http://www.avedition.de/en/szenografie-atelier-brueckner-2002-2010.html Scenography \u2013 Making spaces talk].'' avedition publishers, 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-89986-136-5}}.\n* Peter Philippe Weiss - ''[http://www.immateriellesdesign.info/ Wenn Design die Materie verl\u00e4sst].
