First, when the NCAA placed severe restrictions on the fielding of Division I teams by Division II institutions in 2011, it grandfathered in all then-current D-I teams at D-II schools. Apart from this, Division II members are allowed to compete for Division I championships in sports in which a Division II national championship is not contested.\n\nIn some sports, the NCAA only sponsors championships open to all member schools regardless of division, with examples including beach volleyball, fencing, rifle, and water polo. In men's and women's ice hockey and men's volleyball, the NCAA holds Division III championships, but does not hold a separate D-II championship. The NCAA officially classifies all championship events that are open to schools from more than one division as \"National Collegiate\", except in men's ice hockey, in which the top-level championship is styled as a Division I championship (presumably due to the past existence of a Division II championship in that sport). Division II members are allowed to compete for National Collegiate championships as well as the Division I men's ice hockey championship; in all such sports, they are allowed to operate under the same rules and scholarship restrictions that apply to full Division I members in that sport.\n\nThe Northeast-10 sponsors men's ice hockey for its members who choose to remain in D-II, including a postseason tournament. The conference formerly sponsored a women's ice hockey postseason tournament for those teams remaining in D-II but competing as independents during the regular season, but that tournament has been superseded by the [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]] (NEWHA), which began play in 2017 as a scheduling agreement between all of the existing women's National Collegiate independents (including full D-I member Sacred Heart), organized as a full conference in 2018, and received official NCAA recognition in 2019. Because the NE-10 is the sole Division II hockey league, its postseason champion cannot compete for the NCAA national hockey championship. The Post University men's team competes as D-II and has a scheduling alliance with the NE-10 schools, while its women's team is a member of the NEWHA.\n\n*Future conference affiliations indicated in this list will take effect on July 1 of the stated year. In the case of spring sports, the first year of competition will take place in the calendar year after the conference move becomes official.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! School\n!

First, when the NCAA placed severe restrictions on the fielding of Division I teams by Division II institutions in 2011, it grandfathered in all then-current D-I teams at D-II schools. Apart from this, Division II members are allowed to compete for Division I championships in sports in which a Division II national championship is not contested.\n\nIn some sports, the NCAA only sponsors championships open to all member schools regardless of division, with examples including beach volleyball, fencing, rifle, and water polo. In men's and women's ice hockey and men's volleyball, the NCAA holds Division III championships, but does not hold a separate D-II championship. The NCAA officially classifies all championship events that are open to schools from more than one division as \"National Collegiate\", except in men's ice hockey, in which the top-level championship is styled as a Division I championship (presumably due to the past existence of a Division II championship in that sport). Division II members are allowed to compete for National Collegiate championships as well as the Division I men's ice hockey championship; in all such sports, they are allowed to operate under the same rules and scholarship restrictions that apply to full Division I members in that sport.\n\nThe Northeast-10 sponsors men's ice hockey for its members who choose to remain in D-II, including a postseason tournament. The conference formerly sponsored a women's ice hockey postseason tournament for those teams remaining in D-II but competing as independents during the regular season, but that tournament has been superseded by the [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]] (NEWHA), which began play in 2017 as a scheduling agreement between all of the existing women's National Collegiate independents (including full D-I member Sacred Heart), organized as a full conference in 2018, and received official NCAA recognition in 2019. Because the NE-10 is the sole Division II hockey league, its postseason champion cannot compete for the NCAA national hockey championship. The Post University men's team competes as D-II and has a scheduling alliance with the NE-10 schools, while its women's team is a member of the NEWHA.\n\n*Future conference affiliations indicated in this list will take effect on July 1 of the stated year. In the case of spring sports, the first year of competition will take place in the calendar year after the conference move becomes official.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! School\n!

He was the 9th Chief Justice of the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] and the 27th Speaker of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/cassill-castillo.html|title=The Political Graveyard: Index to Politicians: Cassie to Castka|first=Lawrence|last=Kestenbaum|website=politicalgraveyard.com}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\nBorn in [[Herkimer County, New York]], he moved with his widowed mother to [[Tioga County, Pennsylvania]], at age 3.  After one year at the [[University of Michigan]], he attended the [[Albany Law School]].  He moved to [[Janesville, Wisconsin]], in July 1857 and established a law practice.\n\nPolitically, Cassoday was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].

IRDS information}}</ref>\n\nIRDS is distinct from [[pulmonary hypoplasia]], another leading cause of neonatal death that involves respiratory distress.\n\n==Signs and symptoms ==\nIRDS begins shortly after birth and is manifested by [[tachypnea|fast breathing]] (more than 60 breaths per minute), a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], chest wall retractions (recession), expiratory grunting, nasal flaring and [[cyanosis|blue discoloration of the skin]] during breathing efforts.\n\nAs the disease progresses, the baby may develop ventilatory failure (rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood) and prolonged cessations of breathing (\"[[apnea]]\"). Whether treated or not, the clinical course for the acute disease lasts about two to three days. During the first day, the child worsens and requires more support. During the second day, the baby may be remarkably stable on adequate support and resolution is noted during the third day, heralded by a prompt [[diuresis]]. Despite huge advances in care, IRDS remains the most common single cause of death in the first month of life in the developed world. Complications include metabolic disorders (acidosis, [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]]), [[patent ductus arteriosus]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], chronic lung changes and [[intracranial hemorrhage|bleeding in the brain]]. The syndrome is frequently complicated by prematurity and its additional effect on other organ functions.\n=== Related disorders ===\n[[Acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS) has some similarities to IRDS. [[Transient tachypnea of the newborn]] presents with respiratory distress syndrome in the preterm child.\n\n== Histopathology ==\nThe characteristic [[histopathology]] seen in babies who die from RDS was the source of the name \"hyaline membrane disease\". Waxlike layers of [[hyaline]] membrane line the collapsed [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] of the lung. In addition, the lungs show bleeding, overdistention of airways and damage to the lining cells.\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nThe lungs of infants with respiratory distress syndrome are developmentally deficient in a material called [[pulmonary surfactant|surfactant]], which helps prevent collapse of the terminal air spaces (the future site of [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] development) throughout the normal cycle of inhalation and exhalation. This deficiency of surfactant is related to an inhibition from the insulin that is produced in the newborn, especially those of diabetic mothers.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 3549256 | doi=10.1210/endo-120-4-1250 | volume=120 | issue=4 | title=Insulin inhibits the accumulation of the major lung surfactant apoprotein in human fetal lung explants maintained in vitro |vauthors=Snyder JM, Mendelson CR | journal=Endocrinology | pages=1250\u20137 | year=1987}}</ref>\n\nPulmonary surfactant is a complex system of [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[glycoprotein]]s that is produced in specialized lung cells called Type II cells or [[Type II pneumocyte]]s. The surfactant is packaged by the cell in structures called [[lamellar bodies]], and extruded into the air spaces. The lamellar bodies then unfold into a complex lining of the air space. This layer reduces the [[surface tension]] of the fluid that lines the alveolar air space. Surface tension is responsible for approximately 2/3 of the [[Laplace pressure|inward elastic recoil]] forces. In the same way that a bubble will contract to give the smallest surface area for a given volume, so the air/water interface means that the liquid surface will tend toward being as small as possible, thereby causing the air space to contract. By reducing surface tension, surfactant prevents the air spaces from completely collapsing on exhalation. In addition, the decreased surface tension allows reopening of the air space with a lower amount of force. Therefore, without adequate amounts of surfactant, the air spaces collapse and are very difficult to expand.\n\nMicroscopically, a pulmonary surfactant-deficient lung is characterized by collapsed air spaces alternating with hyperexpanded areas, vascular congestion and, in time, [[hyaline]] membranes. Hyaline membranes are composed of [[fibrin]], cellular debris, [[red blood cell]]s, rare [[neutrophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s. They appear as an eosinophilic, amorphous material, lining or filling the air spaces and blocking gas exchange. As a result, blood passing through the lungs is unable to pick up oxygen and unload carbon dioxide. Blood oxygen levels fall and carbon dioxide rises, resulting in rising blood acid levels and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Structural immaturity, as manifested by a decreased number of gas-exchange units and thicker walls, also contributes to the disease process. Therapeutic oxygen and positive-pressure ventilation, while potentially life-saving, can damage the lung.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThe diagnosis is made by the clinical picture and the chest [[X-ray]], which demonstrates decreased [[lung volumes]] (bell-shaped chest), absence of the thymus (after about six hours), a small (0.5\u20131&nbsp;mm), discrete, uniform infiltrate (sometimes described as a \"ground glass\" appearance or \"diffuse airspace and interstitial opacities\") that involves all lobes of the lung and air-bronchograms (i.e. the infiltrate will outline the larger airways passages, which remain air-filled). In severe cases, this becomes exaggerated until the cardiac borders become indiscernable (a 'white-out' appearance).\n\n== Prevention ==\nGiving the baby's mother [[glucocorticoids]] speeds the production of surfactant. For very premature deliveries, a glucocorticoid is given without testing the fetal lung maturity. The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), Royal College of Medicine and other major organizations have recommended antenatal glucocorticoid treatment for women at risk for preterm delivery prior to 34 [[weeks of gestation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Antenatal use of glucocorticoids in women at risk for preterm delivery|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery|author=Men-Jean Lee, MD, Debra Guinn, MD, Charles J Lockwood, MD, Vanessa A Barss, MD|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref> Multiple courses of glucocorticoid administration, compared with a single course, do not seem to increase or decrease the risk of death or [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s of the child.<ref name=\"pmid24126948\">{{cite journal|last=Asztalos|first=EV|author2=Murphy, KE; Willan, AR; Matthews, SG; Ohlsson, A; Saigal, S; Armson, BA; Kelly, EN; Delisle, MF; Gafni, A; Lee, SK; Sananes, R; Rovet, J; Guselle, P; Amankwah, K; Saleem, M; Sanchez, J; MACS-5 Collaborative, Group|title=Multiple Courses of Antenatal Corticosteroids for Preterm Birth Study: Outcomes in Children at 5 Years of Age (MACS-5)|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|date=Dec 1, 2013|volume=167|issue=12|pages=1102\u201310|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.2764|pmid=24126948}}</ref>\n\nIn pregnancies of longer than 30 weeks, the fetal lung maturity may be tested by sampling the amount of surfactant in the amniotic fluid by [[amniocentesis]], wherein a needle is inserted through the mother's abdomen and uterus. Several tests are available that correlate with the production of surfactant. These include the [[lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio]] (\"[[L/S ratio]]\"), the presence of [[phosphatidylglycerol]] (PG), and, more recently, the [[surfactant-albumin ratio|surfactant/albumin (S/A) ratio]]. For the [[L/S ratio]], if the result is less than 2:1, the fetal lungs may be deficient in surfactant. The presence of PG usually indicates fetal lung maturity. For the S/A ratio, the result is given as milligrams of surfactant per gram of protein. An S/A ratio less than 35 indicates immature lungs, between 35-55 is indeterminate and greater than 55 indicates mature surfactant production (correlating with an L/S ratio of 2.2 or greater).\n\n== Treatment ==\nOxygen is given with a small amount of [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP), and intravenous fluids are administered to stabilize the blood sugar, blood salts and blood pressure. If the baby's condition worsens, an [[endotracheal tube]] (breathing tube) is inserted into the trachea and intermittent breaths are given by a mechanical device. An exogenous preparation of [[Pulmonary surfactant (medication)|pulmonary surfactant]], either synthetic or extracted from animal lungs, is given through the breathing tube into the lungs.

In the same way that a bubble will contract to give the smallest surface area for a given volume, so the air/water interface means that the liquid surface will tend toward being as small as possible, thereby causing the air space to contract. By reducing surface tension, surfactant prevents the air spaces from completely collapsing on exhalation. In addition, the decreased surface tension allows reopening of the air space with a lower amount of force. Therefore, without adequate amounts of surfactant, the air spaces collapse and are very difficult to expand.\n\nMicroscopically, a pulmonary surfactant-deficient lung is characterized by collapsed air spaces alternating with hyperexpanded areas, vascular congestion and, in time, [[hyaline]] membranes. Hyaline membranes are composed of [[fibrin]], cellular debris, [[red blood cell]]s, rare [[neutrophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s. They appear as an eosinophilic, amorphous material, lining or filling the air spaces and blocking gas exchange. As a result, blood passing through the lungs is unable to pick up oxygen and unload carbon dioxide. Blood oxygen levels fall and carbon dioxide rises, resulting in rising blood acid levels and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Structural immaturity, as manifested by a decreased number of gas-exchange units and thicker walls, also contributes to the disease process. Therapeutic oxygen and positive-pressure ventilation, while potentially life-saving, can damage the lung.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThe diagnosis is made by the clinical picture and the chest [[X-ray]], which demonstrates decreased [[lung volumes]] (bell-shaped chest), absence of the thymus (after about six hours), a small (0.5\u20131&nbsp;mm), discrete, uniform infiltrate (sometimes described as a \"ground glass\" appearance or \"diffuse airspace and interstitial opacities\") that involves all lobes of the lung and air-bronchograms (i.e. the infiltrate will outline the larger airways passages, which remain air-filled). In severe cases, this becomes exaggerated until the cardiac borders become indiscernable (a 'white-out' appearance).\n\n== Prevention ==\nGiving the baby's mother [[glucocorticoids]] speeds the production of surfactant. For very premature deliveries, a glucocorticoid is given without testing the fetal lung maturity. The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), Royal College of Medicine and other major organizations have recommended antenatal glucocorticoid treatment for women at risk for preterm delivery prior to 34 [[weeks of gestation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Antenatal use of glucocorticoids in women at risk for preterm delivery|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery|author=Men-Jean Lee, MD, Debra Guinn, MD, Charles J Lockwood, MD, Vanessa A Barss, MD|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref> Multiple courses of glucocorticoid administration, compared with a single course, do not seem to increase or decrease the risk of death or [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s of the child.<ref name=\"pmid24126948\">{{cite journal|last=Asztalos|first=EV|author2=Murphy, KE; Willan, AR; Matthews, SG; Ohlsson, A; Saigal, S; Armson, BA; Kelly, EN; Delisle, MF; Gafni, A; Lee, SK; Sananes, R; Rovet, J; Guselle, P; Amankwah, K; Saleem, M; Sanchez, J; MACS-5 Collaborative, Group|title=Multiple Courses of Antenatal Corticosteroids for Preterm Birth Study: Outcomes in Children at 5 Years of Age (MACS-5)|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|date=Dec 1, 2013|volume=167|issue=12|pages=1102\u201310|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.2764|pmid=24126948}}</ref>\n\nIn pregnancies of longer than 30 weeks, the fetal lung maturity may be tested by sampling the amount of surfactant in the amniotic fluid by [[amniocentesis]], wherein a needle is inserted through the mother's abdomen and uterus. Several tests are available that correlate with the production of surfactant. These include the [[lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio]] (\"[[L/S ratio]]\"), the presence of [[phosphatidylglycerol]] (PG), and, more recently, the [[surfactant-albumin ratio|surfactant/albumin (S/A) ratio]]. For the [[L/S ratio]], if the result is less than 2:1, the fetal lungs may be deficient in surfactant. The presence of PG usually indicates fetal lung maturity. For the S/A ratio, the result is given as milligrams of surfactant per gram of protein. An S/A ratio less than 35 indicates immature lungs, between 35-55 is indeterminate and greater than 55 indicates mature surfactant production (correlating with an L/S ratio of 2.2 or greater).\n\n== Treatment ==\nOxygen is given with a small amount of [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP), and intravenous fluids are administered to stabilize the blood sugar, blood salts and blood pressure. If the baby's condition worsens, an [[endotracheal tube]] (breathing tube) is inserted into the trachea and intermittent breaths are given by a mechanical device. An exogenous preparation of [[Pulmonary surfactant (medication)|pulmonary surfactant]], either synthetic or extracted from animal lungs, is given through the breathing tube into the lungs. Some of the most commonly used surfactants are [[Beractant|Survanta]] (or its generic form Beraksurf), derived from [[cow]] lungs, which can decrease the risk of death for very low-[[birth weight|birth-weight]] infants who are hospitalized by 30%.<ref name=\"pmid8164699\">{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=RM|author2=Luby, AM |author3=Scanlon, JW |author4= Kellogg, RJ |title=Effect of surfactant on morbidity, mortality, and resource use in newborn infants weighing 500 to 1500 g|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=May 26, 1994|volume=330|issue=21|pages=1476\u201380|doi=10.1056/NEJM199405263302102|pmid=8164699}}</ref> Such small premature infants may remain ventilated for months.

However, newborns cannot be placed on ECMO if they are under 4.5 pounds (2&nbsp;kg), because they have extremely small vessels for [[cannulation]], thus hindering adequate flow because of limitations from cannula size and subsequent higher resistance to blood flow (compare with [[vascular resistance]]). Furthermore, in infants aged less than 34 [[weeks of gestation]], several physiologic systems are not well-developed, especially the [[cerebral vasculature]] and [[germinal matrix]], resulting in high sensitivity to slight changes in [[pH]], [[PaO2|PaO<sub>2</sub>]] and intracranial pressure.

When in Wisconsin, he secured an investment of $33,000 for [[land speculation]] from three [[New Hampshire]] financiers: Senator [[Henry Hubbard]], [[Horace Hall]], and George Olcott. By the end of 1837, Strong had acquired thousands of acres of land throughout the state: forty lots in the future [[Madison, Wisconsin]]; land in [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]] on the [[Wisconsin River]] which he called \"St. Lawrence\"; and land in the village of [[Arena, Wisconsin|Arena]]. But when the [[Panic of 1837]] hit, it became impossible to resell any of the land at a profit, and the investors for the most part lost their money.\n\nIn February 1837, [[James Duane Doty]] hired Strong to survey Madison and stake out the land for the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]].\n\nIn June 1838, Strong was selected [[United States Attorney]] of the Territory of Wisconsin, and in December was appointed \"fiscal agent\" for the territory. In 1841, Strong was elected to the Council of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Wisconsin]], representing [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa County]]. He was reelected every year until 1846. His fellow councilmen elected him President of the Council in 1842 and 1845.<ref name=\"bench\"/>\n\nIn 1846, Strong was selected to represent Iowa County in the first convention to draft a constitution for the future state of Wisconsin.

Although Strong lived in Mineral Point, Kilbourn arranged to have him elected to the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] in 1857 as a representative for [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] so that Strong could help convince the state legislature to help out the effort.  In the end, Strong became very involved in efforts to bribe legislators.  When elected officials attempted to investigate in 1858, Strong refused to testify before legislative committees, and spent six days in jail.  The [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]], in ''In re Falvey'', 7 Wis. 630 (1858). rejected his argument that legislative committees do not have the power to issue subpoenas.\n\nIn the 1870s, Strong wrote a history of the [[Wisconsin Territory]] entitled ''History of the Territory of Wisconsin from 1836 to 1848''. He convinced the state legislature to publish the work in 1885.\n\nIn 1878, Strong helped to organize the [[State Bar of Wisconsin]], and was elected its first president.  He served in that role until 1893.<ref name=\"bench\"/>\n\nStrong died in Mineral Point in 1894.<ref name=\"Obit\"/> The ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' in 1955 judged that \"An independent attitude coupled with a love of gambling, excessive drinking, and a limited business ability combined to keep Strong from reaching his goals.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of United States Attorneys for Wisconsin]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cravens, Stanley H. \"[http://lrbdigital.legis.wisconsin.gov/digital/collection/p16831coll2/id/1813/rec/1 Capitals and Capitols in Early Wisconsin]\" in Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau.

When in Wisconsin, he secured an investment of $33,000 for [[land speculation]] from three [[New Hampshire]] financiers: Senator [[Henry Hubbard]], [[Horace Hall]], and George Olcott. By the end of 1837, Strong had acquired thousands of acres of land throughout the state: forty lots in the future [[Madison, Wisconsin]]; land in [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]] on the [[Wisconsin River]] which he called \"St. Lawrence\"; and land in the village of [[Arena, Wisconsin|Arena]]. But when the [[Panic of 1837]] hit, it became impossible to resell any of the land at a profit, and the investors for the most part lost their money.\n\nIn February 1837, [[James Duane Doty]] hired Strong to survey Madison and stake out the land for the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]].\n\nIn June 1838, Strong was selected [[United States Attorney]] of the Territory of Wisconsin, and in December was appointed \"fiscal agent\" for the territory. In 1841, Strong was elected to the Council of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Wisconsin]], representing [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa County]]. He was reelected every year until 1846. His fellow councilmen elected him President of the Council in 1842 and 1845.<ref name=\"bench\"/>\n\nIn 1846, Strong was selected to represent Iowa County in the first convention to draft a constitution for the future state of Wisconsin. (This draft was rejected by the people in 1847.)  The Constitutional Convention's journal recorded Strong's opposition to black suffrage, with Strong noting that he \"was a friend to females, and it was for that reason he did not wish to see them tacked on to negroes.\"<ref>{{cite web|author1=Wisconsin Constitutional Convention (1846)|title=Suffrage debates during first convention|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/tp/id/42079|accessdate=7 November 2014|pages=214}}</ref> Later in the debate, records show \"Strong came out in a violent speech in opposition to negro suffrage,\" saying \"that he was teetotally opposed to negro suffrage in any manner or form that could be devised.\"<ref>{{cite web|author1=Wisconsin Constitutional Convention (1846)|title=Suffrage debates during first convention|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/tp/id/42079|accessdate=7 November 2014|pages=215|date=21 October 1846}}</ref>  Strong was selected as the Democratic nominee for the election of a Wisconsin [[Delegate (United States Congress)|delegate]] to Congress.  He was defeated by [[John Hubbard Tweedy]] in the general election, 9,648 to 10,670.\n\nOnce Wisconsin became a state in 1848, Strong was elected to the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] for the 1850 session, where he served as [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]].<ref name=\"Obit\"/>\n\nIn the 1850s, Strong assisted [[Byron Kilbourn]] in his efforts to promote the proposed La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad.  Although Strong lived in Mineral Point, Kilbourn arranged to have him elected to the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] in 1857 as a representative for [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] so that Strong could help convince the state legislature to help out the effort.  In the end, Strong became very involved in efforts to bribe legislators.  When elected officials attempted to investigate in 1858, Strong refused to testify before legislative committees, and spent six days in jail.  The [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]], in ''In re Falvey'', 7 Wis. 630 (1858). rejected his argument that legislative committees do not have the power to issue subpoenas.\n\nIn the 1870s, Strong wrote a history of the [[Wisconsin Territory]] entitled ''History of the Territory of Wisconsin from 1836 to 1848''. He convinced the state legislature to publish the work in 1885.\n\nIn 1878, Strong helped to organize the [[State Bar of Wisconsin]], and was elected its first president.  He served in that role until 1893.<ref name=\"bench\"/>\n\nStrong died in Mineral Point in 1894.<ref name=\"Obit\"/> The ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' in 1955 judged that \"An independent attitude coupled with a love of gambling, excessive drinking, and a limited business ability combined to keep Strong from reaching his goals.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of United States Attorneys for Wisconsin]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cravens, Stanley H. \"[http://lrbdigital.legis.wisconsin.gov/digital/collection/p16831coll2/id/1813/rec/1 Capitals and Capitols in Early Wisconsin]\" in Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau.
