The UN was notified on 18 November 1949 of the formation of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China]]; however, the [[Government of the Republic of China]] continued to represent China at the UN, despite the small size of the ROC's jurisdiction of [[List of islands of the Republic of China|Taiwan and a number of smaller islands]] compared to the PRC's jurisdiction of mainland China. As both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of China, proposals to effect a change in the representation of China in the UN were discussed but rejected for the next two decades, as the ROC was still recognized as the sole legitimate representative of China by a majority of UN members.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN, based on the [[One-China policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/06/20-taiwan-un-winkler|title=Taiwan's UN Dilemma: To Be or Not To Be|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|first=Sigrid|last=Winkler|date=June 2012|accessdate=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s, a shift had occurred in international diplomatic circles and the PRC had gained the upper hand in international diplomatic relations and recognition count.

During the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]], and in response to the election of [[Malaysia]] as a [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council]], in a letter dated 20 January 1965, [[Indonesia]] informed the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] that it had decided \"at this stage and under the present circumstances\" to withdraw from the UN. However, following the overthrow of [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]], in a telegram dated 19 September 1966, Indonesia notified the Secretary-General of its decision \"to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twenty-first session of the General Assembly\".

The story focuses on a boy named K\u014dichi Sakakibara who, upon transferring into Yomiyama Middle School and meeting the curious Mei Misaki, finds himself in a mystery revolving around students and people related to his class falling victim to gruesome, senseless deaths.\n\nA [[manga]] adaptation by Hiro Kiyohara was serialized between May 2010 and January 2012 in the issues of Kadokawa Shoten's ''[[Young Ace]]''. Both the novel and the manga have been licensed in North America by [[Yen Press]].

Devastated by the loss, the students and teacher behaved like Misaki was still alive, leading to a strange presence on the graduation photo. In Spring 1998, K\u014dichi Sakakibara transfers into Yomiyama's class 3-3, where he meets Mei Misaki, a quiet student whom their classmates and teacher seemingly ignore. The class is soon caught up in a strange phenomenon, in which students and their relatives begin to die in often gruesome ways. Realizing that these deaths are related to the \"Misaki of 1972\", a yearly calamity that has struck most every class 3-3 since 1972, K\u014dichi and Mei seek to figure out how to stop it before it kills anymore of their classmates or them.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n<!-- only two main characters in live-action film -->\n;{{nihongo|{{va|K\u014dichi Sakakibara}}|\u698a\u539f \u6052\u4e00|Sakakibara K\u014dichi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Abe]]<ref name=\"ann jp cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-09/tv-anime-another-voice-cast-revealed|title=TV Anime Another's Voice Cast Revealed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 9, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref>|[[Greg Ayres]]<ref name=\"ann eng cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-18/sentai-filmworks-reveals-tsuritama-another-anime-dub-casts|title=Sentai Filmworks Reveals tsuritama, 'Another' Anime Dub Casts|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Kento Yamazaki]]<ref name=\"live cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kadokawa-pictures.jp/official/another/cast.shtml|title=Another|publisher=Kadokawa Pictures|accessdate=November 7, 2017|language=Japanese}}</ref> (live-action film)\n:A 15-year-old boy who transferred to Yomiyama North Middle's Class 3-3 from Tokyo in 1998, but was hospitalized due to  [[pneumothorax]] before the school year began.

The story focuses on a boy named K\u014dichi Sakakibara who, upon transferring into Yomiyama Middle School and meeting the curious Mei Misaki, finds himself in a mystery revolving around students and people related to his class falling victim to gruesome, senseless deaths.\n\nA [[manga]] adaptation by Hiro Kiyohara was serialized between May 2010 and January 2012 in the issues of Kadokawa Shoten's ''[[Young Ace]]''. Both the novel and the manga have been licensed in North America by [[Yen Press]]. A 12-episode [[anime]] television series produced by [[P.A.Works]] aired in Japan between January 10 and March 27, 2012, with an [[original video animation]] episode released on May 26, 2012, and a live-action film [[Another (film)|of the same name]] was released in Japanese theatres on August 4, 2012.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1972, Misaki, a popular student of Yomiyama North Middle School's class 3-3, suddenly died partway through the school year. Devastated by the loss, the students and teacher behaved like Misaki was still alive, leading to a strange presence on the graduation photo. In Spring 1998, K\u014dichi Sakakibara transfers into Yomiyama's class 3-3, where he meets Mei Misaki, a quiet student whom their classmates and teacher seemingly ignore. The class is soon caught up in a strange phenomenon, in which students and their relatives begin to die in often gruesome ways. Realizing that these deaths are related to the \"Misaki of 1972\", a yearly calamity that has struck most every class 3-3 since 1972, K\u014dichi and Mei seek to figure out how to stop it before it kills anymore of their classmates or them.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n<!-- only two main characters in live-action film -->\n;{{nihongo|{{va|K\u014dichi Sakakibara}}|\u698a\u539f \u6052\u4e00|Sakakibara K\u014dichi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Abe]]<ref name=\"ann jp cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-09/tv-anime-another-voice-cast-revealed|title=TV Anime Another's Voice Cast Revealed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 9, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref>|[[Greg Ayres]]<ref name=\"ann eng cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-18/sentai-filmworks-reveals-tsuritama-another-anime-dub-casts|title=Sentai Filmworks Reveals tsuritama, 'Another' Anime Dub Casts|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref>}}\n:Played by: [[Kento Yamazaki]]<ref name=\"live cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kadokawa-pictures.jp/official/another/cast.shtml|title=Another|publisher=Kadokawa Pictures|accessdate=November 7, 2017|language=Japanese}}</ref> (live-action film)\n:A 15-year-old boy who transferred to Yomiyama North Middle's Class 3-3 from Tokyo in 1998, but was hospitalized due to  [[pneumothorax]] before the school year began.

These combinations provide greater pain relief than either agent alone (drug [[synergy]]).\n\nCodeine is also commonly marketed in products containing codeine with other pain killers or muscle relaxers, as well as codeine mixed with [[phenacetin]] (Emprazil with codeine No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), [[naproxen]], [[indomethacin]], [[diclofenac]], and others, as well as more complex mixtures, including such mixtures as aspirin + paracetamol + codeine \u00b1 caffeine \u00b1 antihistamines and other agents, such as those mentioned above.\n\nCodeine-only products can be obtained with a prescription as a time release tablet. Codeine is also marketed in cough syrups with zero to a half-dozen other active ingredients, and a [[linctus]] (''e.g.,'' Paveral) for all of the uses for which codeine is indicated.\n\nInjectable codeine is available for subcutaneous or intramuscular injection only; intravenous injection is contraindicated, as this can result in nonimmune mast-cell degranulation and resulting [[anaphylactoid]] reaction. Codeine suppositories are also marketed in some countries.\n\n==Side effects==\nCommon adverse effects associated with the use of codeine include [[drowsiness]] and [[constipation]]. Less common are [[itching]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[dry mouth]], [[miosis]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[urinary retention]], [[euphoria]], and [[dysphoria]]. Rare adverse effects include [[anaphylaxis]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]], [[acute pancreatitis]], and [[Hypoventilation|respiratory depression]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=WebMD LLC.|title=Codeine \u2013 adverse effects|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/codeine-343310#4|work=Medscape reference \u2013 Drugs, Diseases & Procedures|accessdate=27 September 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818214647/http://reference.medscape.com/drug/codeine-343310#4|archivedate=18 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As with all opiates, long-term effects can vary, but can include diminished libido, apathy, and memory loss. Some people may have allergic reactions to codeine, such as the swelling of skin and rashes.<ref name=AHFS2016/>\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of codeine, including its therapeutic effects, develops with prolonged use. This occurs at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance.\n\nA potentially serious adverse drug reaction, as with other opioids, is [[respiratory depression]]. This depression is dose-related and is a mechanism for the potentially fatal consequences of overdose. As codeine is metabolized to morphine, morphine can be passed through breast milk in potentially lethal amounts, fatally depressing the respiration of a breastfed baby.<ref>CTV News, [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080820/tylenol_3_breastfeeding_080820/20080820?hub=Canada Codeine use while breastfeeding may be dangerous] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901210431/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080820/tylenol_3_breastfeeding_080820/20080820?hub=Canada |date=1 September 2008 }}, Wed. 20 August 2008</ref><ref name=\"koren etal\">{{Cite journal |pmid=16920476 |vauthors=Koren G, Cairns J, Chitayat D, Gaedigk A, Leeder SJ |title=Pharmacogenetics of morphine poisoning in a breastfed neonate of a codeine-prescribed mother |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9536 |page=704 |date=August 2006 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69255-6}}</ref>\nIn August 2012, the United States Federal Drug Administration issued a warning about deaths in pediatric patients less than 6 years old after ingesting \"normal\" doses of paracetamol with codeine after tonsillectomy; this warning was upgraded to a black box warning in February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safety review update of codeine use in children; new Boxed Warning and Contraindication on use after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm339112.htm|publisher=FDA|date=February 20, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904133820/https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm339112.htm|archivedate=4 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSome patients are very effective converters of codeine to its active form, morphine, resulting in lethal blood levels. The FDA is presently recommending very cautious use of codeine in young tonsillectomy patients; the drug should be used in the lowest amount that can control the pain,  \"as needed\" and not \"around the clock\", and immediate medical attention is needed if the user responds negatively.\n\n===Withdrawal and dependence===\nAs with other opiate-based pain killers, chronic use of codeine can cause [[physical dependence]].

The most well-known of these are two of the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s, [[paroxetine]] (Paxil) and [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) as well as the antihistamine [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), and the antidepressant [[bupropion]] (Wellbutrin, also known as Zyban). Other drugs, such as [[rifampicin]] and [[dexamethasone]], induce CYP450 isozymes and thus increase the conversion rate.\n\nCYP2D6 converts codeine into morphine, which then undergoes glucuronidation.

In general, the various classes of morphine derivatives such as ketones, semisynthetics like [[dihydromorphine]], halogeno-morphides, esters, ethers, and others have codeine, dihydrocodeine, and isocodeine analogues.<ref>Report of Committee on drug addiction, 1929-1941\". National Research Council (US).</ref> The codeine ester [[acetylcodeine]] is a common active impurity in street [[heroin]] as some codeine tends to dissolve with the morphine when it is extracted from [[opium]] in underground heroin and morphine base labs.\n\nAs an analgesic, codeine [[opiate comparison|compares weakly to other opiates]]. Related to codeine in other ways are [[codoxime]], [[thebacon]], [[codeine-N-oxide|codeine-''N''-oxide]] (genocodeine), related to the nitrogen morphine derivatives as is codeine methobromide, and [[heterocodeine]], which is a drug six times stronger than morphine and 72 times stronger than codeine due to a small re-arrangement of the molecule, viz. moving the methyl group from the 3 to the 6 position on the morphine carbon skeleton.\n\nDrugs bearing resemblance to codeine in effects due to close structural relationship are variations on the methyl groups at the 3 position including [[ethylmorphine]] a.k.a. codethyline (Dionine) and [[benzylmorphine]] (Peronine). While having no narcotic effects of its own, the important opioid precursor [[thebaine]] differs from codeine only slightly in structure. Pseudocodeine and some other similar alkaloids not currently used in medicine are found in trace amounts in opium as well.\n\n==History==\nCodeine, or 3-methylmorphine, is an [[alkaloid]] found in the [[opium poppy]], ''Papaver somniferum'' var. ''album'', a plant in the family [[Papaveraceae]]. Opium poppy has been cultivated and utilized throughout human history for a variety of medicinal (analgesic, [[anti-tussive]] and [[anti-diarrheal]]) and hypnotic properties linked to the diversity of its active components, which include morphine, codeine and [[papaverine]].\n\nCodeine is found in concentrations of 1% to 3% in opium prepared by the latex method from unripe pods of ''Papaver somniferum''. The name codeine is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03ce\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|k\u1e53deia}}, \"poppy head\"). The relative proportion of codeine to morphine, the most common opium alkaloid at 4% to 23%, tends to be somewhat higher in the [[poppy straw]] method of preparing opium alkaloids.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 19th century, raw opium was used in diverse preparations known as [[laudanum]] (see [[Thomas de Quincey]]'s ''[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]'', 1821) and [[paregoric]] [[elixir]]s, a number of which were popular in England since the beginning of the 18th century; the original preparation seems to have been elaborated in [[Leiden]], the [[Netherlands]] around 1715 by a chemist named Lemort; in 1721 the ''London Pharmacopoeia'' mentions an Elixir Asthmaticum, replaced by the term Elixir Paregoricum (\"pain soother\") in 1746.\n\nThe progressive isolation of opium's several active components opened the path to improved selectivity and safety of the opiates-based pharmacopeia.\n\n[[Morphine]] had already been isolated in Germany by {{lang|de|[[Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner]]|italic=no}} in 1804.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MtOiLVWBn8cC&pg=PA20|page=20|title=Molecular, clinical and environmental toxicology|author=Andreas Luch|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-3-7643-8335-0}}</ref> Codeine was first isolated in 1832 in France by {{lang|fr|[[Pierre Jean Robiquet|Pierre Robiquet]]|italic=no}}, already famous for the discovery of [[alizarin]], the most widespread red dye, while working on refined morphine extraction processes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2013-03-01|title=Pierre-Jean Robiquet|url= |journal=Educaci\u00f3n Qu\u00edmica|language=en|volume=24|pages=139\u2013149|doi=10.1016/S0187-893X(13)72507-2|issn=0187-893X|last1=Wisniak|first1=Jaime}}</ref> Robiquet is also credited with discovering [[caffeine]] independently of Pelletier, Caventou, and Runge.<ref name=\":0\" /> This paved the way for the elaboration of a new generation of safer, codeine-based specific antitussive and antidiarrheal formulations.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nCodeine is the most widely used opiate in the world,<ref name=\"sciencedaily\">{{cite web |title=Unlocking the opium poppy's biggest secret: Genes that make codeine, morphine |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100314150916.htm |website=ScienceDaily |accessdate=29 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref> and is one of the most commonly used drugs overall according to numerous reports by organizations including the World Health Organization and its [[League of Nations]] predecessor agency.

[[Drug abuse]] screening programs generally test [[urine]], [[hair]], [[sweat]] or [[saliva]]. Many commercial opiate screening tests directed at morphine cross-react appreciably with codeine and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish codeine from other opiates and opioids. It is important to note that codeine usage results in significant amounts of morphine as an excretion product. Furthermore, [[heroin]] contains codeine (or acetyl codeine) as an impurity and its use will result in excretion of small amounts of codeine. [[Poppy seed]] foods represent yet another source of low levels of codeine in one's [[biofluids]].

Codeine linctus of 15&nbsp;mg per 5&nbsp;ml is also available at some pharmacies, although a purchaser would have to request it specifically from the pharmacist.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nUnder the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 codeine is a Class B controlled substance or a Class A drug when prepared for injection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/schedule/2 |title=Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=12 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108014958/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/schedule/2 |archivedate=8 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=List of most commonly encountered drugs currently controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation | website=GOV.UK | date=20 October 2016 | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation | access-date=7 February 2020}}</ref> The possession of controlled substances without a prescription is a criminal offence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents |title=Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=12 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128042930/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents |archivedate=28 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, certain preparations of codeine are exempt from this restriction under Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001.

The exemptions do not to apply to any preparation of codeine designed for injection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/3998/schedule/5/made |title=The Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129223606/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/3998/schedule/5/made |archivedate=29 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nIn the United States, codeine is regulated by the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. Federal law dictates that codeine be a Schedule II controlled substance when used in products for pain-relief that contain codeine alone or more than 80&nbsp;mg per dosage unit. Codeine without aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol) is very rarely available or prescribed in order to discourage abuse. Tablets of codeine in combination with aspirin or acetaminophen ([[paracetamol]]) and intended for pain relief are listed as Schedule III, allowing electronic fills and refills without a physical paper-copy of the physician ordered prescription.\n\nCough syrups are classed as Schedule III, IV or V, depending on formulation. For example, the acetaminophen/codeine antitussive liquid is a Schedule IV controlled substance.<ref name=\"Valeant Pharmaceuticals Prescribing Information for Capital with Codeine Oral Suspension\">{{cite web | author =Valeant Pharmaceuticals | authorlink =Valeant Pharmaceuticals | url =http://www.valeant.com/fileRepository/products/PI/Capital_with_Codeine_Suspension_120mg_PI_Aug04.pdf | title =Prescribing Information for Capital with Codeine (paracetamol with codeine) showing Schedule V designation | accessdate =25 February 2011 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110717183303/http://www.valeant.com/fileRepository/products/PI/Capital_with_Codeine_Suspension_120mg_PI_Aug04.pdf | archivedate =17 July 2011 | df =dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome states have chosen to reclassify codeine preparations at a more restrictive schedule in order to lower the instances of its abuse.

These combinations provide greater pain relief than either agent alone (drug [[synergy]]).\n\nCodeine is also commonly marketed in products containing codeine with other pain killers or muscle relaxers, as well as codeine mixed with [[phenacetin]] (Emprazil with codeine No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), [[naproxen]], [[indomethacin]], [[diclofenac]], and others, as well as more complex mixtures, including such mixtures as aspirin + paracetamol + codeine \u00b1 caffeine \u00b1 antihistamines and other agents, such as those mentioned above.\n\nCodeine-only products can be obtained with a prescription as a time release tablet. Codeine is also marketed in cough syrups with zero to a half-dozen other active ingredients, and a [[linctus]] (''e.g.,'' Paveral) for all of the uses for which codeine is indicated.\n\nInjectable codeine is available for subcutaneous or intramuscular injection only; intravenous injection is contraindicated, as this can result in nonimmune mast-cell degranulation and resulting [[anaphylactoid]] reaction. Codeine suppositories are also marketed in some countries.\n\n==Side effects==\nCommon adverse effects associated with the use of codeine include [[drowsiness]] and [[constipation]]. Less common are [[itching]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[dry mouth]], [[miosis]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[urinary retention]], [[euphoria]], and [[dysphoria]]. Rare adverse effects include [[anaphylaxis]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]], [[acute pancreatitis]], and [[Hypoventilation|respiratory depression]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=WebMD LLC.|title=Codeine \u2013 adverse effects|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/codeine-343310#4|work=Medscape reference \u2013 Drugs, Diseases & Procedures|accessdate=27 September 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818214647/http://reference.medscape.com/drug/codeine-343310#4|archivedate=18 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As with all opiates, long-term effects can vary, but can include diminished libido, apathy, and memory loss. Some people may have allergic reactions to codeine, such as the swelling of skin and rashes.<ref name=AHFS2016/>\n\nTolerance to many of the effects of codeine, including its therapeutic effects, develops with prolonged use. This occurs at different rates for different effects, with tolerance to the constipation-inducing effects developing particularly slowly for instance.\n\nA potentially serious adverse drug reaction, as with other opioids, is [[respiratory depression]]. This depression is dose-related and is a mechanism for the potentially fatal consequences of overdose. As codeine is metabolized to morphine, morphine can be passed through breast milk in potentially lethal amounts, fatally depressing the respiration of a breastfed baby.<ref>CTV News, [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080820/tylenol_3_breastfeeding_080820/20080820?hub=Canada Codeine use while breastfeeding may be dangerous] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901210431/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080820/tylenol_3_breastfeeding_080820/20080820?hub=Canada |date=1 September 2008 }}, Wed. 20 August 2008</ref><ref name=\"koren etal\">{{Cite journal |pmid=16920476 |vauthors=Koren G, Cairns J, Chitayat D, Gaedigk A, Leeder SJ |title=Pharmacogenetics of morphine poisoning in a breastfed neonate of a codeine-prescribed mother |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9536 |page=704 |date=August 2006 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69255-6}}</ref>\nIn August 2012, the United States Federal Drug Administration issued a warning about deaths in pediatric patients less than 6 years old after ingesting \"normal\" doses of paracetamol with codeine after tonsillectomy; this warning was upgraded to a black box warning in February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safety review update of codeine use in children; new Boxed Warning and Contraindication on use after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm339112.htm|publisher=FDA|date=February 20, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904133820/https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm339112.htm|archivedate=4 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSome patients are very effective converters of codeine to its active form, morphine, resulting in lethal blood levels.

In general, the various classes of morphine derivatives such as ketones, semisynthetics like [[dihydromorphine]], halogeno-morphides, esters, ethers, and others have codeine, dihydrocodeine, and isocodeine analogues.<ref>Report of Committee on drug addiction, 1929-1941\". National Research Council (US).</ref> The codeine ester [[acetylcodeine]] is a common active impurity in street [[heroin]] as some codeine tends to dissolve with the morphine when it is extracted from [[opium]] in underground heroin and morphine base labs.\n\nAs an analgesic, codeine [[opiate comparison|compares weakly to other opiates]]. Related to codeine in other ways are [[codoxime]], [[thebacon]], [[codeine-N-oxide|codeine-''N''-oxide]] (genocodeine), related to the nitrogen morphine derivatives as is codeine methobromide, and [[heterocodeine]], which is a drug six times stronger than morphine and 72 times stronger than codeine due to a small re-arrangement of the molecule, viz. moving the methyl group from the 3 to the 6 position on the morphine carbon skeleton.\n\nDrugs bearing resemblance to codeine in effects due to close structural relationship are variations on the methyl groups at the 3 position including [[ethylmorphine]] a.k.a. codethyline (Dionine) and [[benzylmorphine]] (Peronine). While having no narcotic effects of its own, the important opioid precursor [[thebaine]] differs from codeine only slightly in structure. Pseudocodeine and some other similar alkaloids not currently used in medicine are found in trace amounts in opium as well.\n\n==History==\nCodeine, or 3-methylmorphine, is an [[alkaloid]] found in the [[opium poppy]], ''Papaver somniferum'' var. ''album'', a plant in the [[papaveraceae]] family. Opium poppy has been cultivated and utilized throughout human history for a variety of medicinal (analgesic, [[anti-tussive]] and [[anti-diarrheal]]) and hypnotic properties linked to the diversity of its active components, which include morphine, codeine and [[papaverine]].\n\nCodeine is found in concentrations of 1% to 3% in opium prepared by the latex method from unripe pods of ''Papaver somniferum''. The name codeine is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03ce\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|k\u1e53deia}}, \"poppy head\"). The relative proportion of codeine to morphine, the most common opium alkaloid at 4% to 23%, tends to be somewhat higher in the [[poppy straw]] method of preparing opium alkaloids.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 19th century, raw opium was used in diverse preparations known as [[laudanum]] (see [[Thomas de Quincey]]'s ''[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]'', 1821) and [[paregoric]] [[elixir]]s, a number of which were popular in England since the beginning of the 18th century; the original preparation seems to have been elaborated in [[Leiden]], the [[Netherlands]] around 1715 by a chemist named Lemort; in 1721 the ''London Pharmacopoeia'' mentions an Elixir Asthmaticum, replaced by the term Elixir Paregoricum (\"pain soother\") in 1746.\n\nThe progressive isolation of opium's several active components opened the path to improved selectivity and safety of the opiates-based pharmacopeia.\n\n[[Morphine]] had already been isolated in Germany by {{lang|de|[[Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner]]|italic=no}} in 1804.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MtOiLVWBn8cC&pg=PA20|page=20|title=Molecular, clinical and environmental toxicology|author=Andreas Luch|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-3-7643-8335-0}}</ref> Codeine was first isolated in 1832 in France by {{lang|fr|[[Pierre Jean Robiquet|Pierre Robiquet]]|italic=no}}, already famous for the discovery of [[alizarin]], the most widespread red dye, while working on refined morphine extraction processes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2013-03-01|title=Pierre-Jean Robiquet|url= |journal=Educaci\u00f3n Qu\u00edmica|language=en|volume=24|pages=139\u2013149|doi=10.1016/S0187-893X(13)72507-2|issn=0187-893X|last1=Wisniak|first1=Jaime}}</ref> Robiquet is also credited with discovering [[caffeine]] independently of Pelletier, Caventou, and Runge.<ref name=\":0\" /> This paved the way for the elaboration of a new generation of safer, codeine-based specific antitussive and antidiarrheal formulations.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nCodeine is the most widely used opiate in the world,<ref name=\"sciencedaily\">{{cite web |title=Unlocking the opium poppy's biggest secret: Genes that make codeine, morphine |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100314150916.htm |website=ScienceDaily |accessdate=29 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref> and is one of the most commonly used drugs overall according to numerous reports by organizations including the World Health Organization and its [[League of Nations]] predecessor agency.

Many commercial opiate screening tests directed at morphine cross-react appreciably with codeine and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish codeine from other opiates and opioids. It is important to note that codeine usage results in significant amounts of morphine as an excretion product. Furthermore, [[heroin]] contains codeine (or acetyl codeine) as an impurity and its use will result in excretion of small amounts of codeine.

Codeine linctus of 15&nbsp;mg per 5&nbsp;ml is also available at some pharmacies, although a purchaser would have to request it specifically from the pharmacist.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nUnder the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 codeine is a Class B controlled substance or a Class A drug when prepared for injection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/schedule/2 |title=Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=12 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108014958/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/schedule/2 |archivedate=8 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=List of most commonly encountered drugs currently controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation | website=GOV.UK | date=20 October 2016 | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation | access-date=7 February 2020}}</ref> The possession of controlled substances without a prescription is a criminal offence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents |title=Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=12 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128042930/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents |archivedate=28 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, certain preparations of codeine are exempt from this restriction under Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. It is thus legal to possess codeine without a prescription, provided that it is compounded with at least one other active or inactive ingredient and that the dosage of each tablet, capsule, etc. does not exceed 100&nbsp;mg or 2.5% [[concentration]] in the case of liquid preparations. The exemptions do not to apply to any preparation of codeine designed for injection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/3998/schedule/5/made |title=The Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129223606/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/3998/schedule/5/made |archivedate=29 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nIn the United States, codeine is regulated by the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. Federal law dictates that codeine be a Schedule II controlled substance when used in products for pain-relief that contain codeine alone or more than 80&nbsp;mg per dosage unit. Codeine without aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol) is very rarely available or prescribed in order to discourage abuse. Tablets of codeine in combination with aspirin or acetaminophen ([[paracetamol]]) and intended for pain relief are listed as Schedule III, allowing electronic fills and refills without a physical paper-copy of the physician ordered prescription.\n\nCough syrups are classed as Schedule III, IV or V, depending on formulation. For example, the acetaminophen/codeine antitussive liquid is a Schedule IV controlled substance.<ref name=\"Valeant Pharmaceuticals Prescribing Information for Capital with Codeine Oral Suspension\">{{cite web | author =Valeant Pharmaceuticals | authorlink =Valeant Pharmaceuticals | url =http://www.valeant.com/fileRepository/products/PI/Capital_with_Codeine_Suspension_120mg_PI_Aug04.pdf | title =Prescribing Information for Capital with Codeine (paracetamol with codeine) showing Schedule V designation | accessdate =25 February 2011 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110717183303/http://www.valeant.com/fileRepository/products/PI/Capital_with_Codeine_Suspension_120mg_PI_Aug04.pdf | archivedate =17 July 2011 | df =dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome states have chosen to reclassify codeine preparations at a more restrictive schedule in order to lower the instances of its abuse. Minnesota, for instance, has chosen to reclassify Schedule V some codeine preparations (e.g. [[Cheratussin]]) as a Schedule II controlled substance.<ref name=\"Minnesota; Schedules of controlled substances\">{{cite web|title=152.02 Schedules Of Controlled Substances|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=152.02|publisher=State of Minnesota|accessdate=30 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730103623/https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=152.02|archivedate=30 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn some jurisdictions where codeine is a Schedule V substance, it is available as an antitussive liquid, combined with paracetamol, aspirin or [[terpin hydrate]], in limited strengths and quantities without a prescription (at the discretion of the dispensing pharmacist). In most jurisdictions such sales are entered into a dispensed-narcotics database, requiring customer signature, to limit excessive use.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | title=Medical Genetics Summaries | chapter=Codeine Therapy and CYP2D6 Genotype | chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK100662/ | veditors=Pratt VM, McLeod HL, Rubinstein WS, Scott SA, Dean LC, Kattman BL, Malheiro AJ | display-editors=3 | publisher=[[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI) | year=2012 | pmid=28520350 | id=Bookshelf ID: NBK100662 | vauthors=Dean L | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK61999/ }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Codeine}}\n* {{cite web| url = https://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/rn/76-57-3 | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine| work = Drug Information Portal | title = Codeine }}\n\n{{Components of Opium}}\n{{Analgesics}}\n{{Antidiarrheals, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective agents}}\n{{Cough and cold preparations}}\n{{Opioid receptor modulators}}\n{{Glycine receptor modulators}}\n{{Portal bar|Pharmacy and pharmacology|Medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Alkaloids]]\n[[Category:Antidiarrhoeals]]\n[[Category:Antitussives]]\n[[Category:Catechol ethers]]\n[[Category:Cyclohexenols]]\n[[Category:Glycine receptor antagonists]]\n[[Category:Morphinans]]\n[[Category:Natural opium alkaloids]]\n[[Category:Opiates]]\n[[Category:Prodrugs]]\n[[Category:Secondary metabolites]]\n[[Category:World Health Organization essential medicines]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeine"}
