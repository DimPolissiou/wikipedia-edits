{"title_page": "List of Pixar film references", "text_new": "{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{Update|date=March 2019}}\n{{primary sources|date=August 2013}}\nBeginning with ''[[Red's Dream]]'' and its references to previous [[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]] short films, Pixar has included references in its films to other works produced by the studio.<ref name=\"pixarpedia\" /> These have included [[cameo appearance]]s, references to characters, objects, and titles of works. Additionally, such [[easter eggs]] or in-jokes can refer to Pixar staff, associates, or places or events from the company's past.

Officially, the [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] network retains its own sports division; however, for all practical purposes, ABC's sports division has been merged into [[ESPN Inc.]], the parent subsidiary of [[cable television|cable]] sports network [[ESPN]] that is majority owned by ABC's corporate parent, [[The Walt Disney Company]], in partnership with [[Hearst Communications]].\n\nABC broadcasts use ESPN's production and announcing staff, and incorporate elements such as ESPN-branded on-screen graphics, ''[[SportsCenter]]'' in-game updates, and the [[ESPN BottomLine|BottomLine]] [[news ticker|ticker]]. The ABC logo is used for identification purposes as a [[digital on-screen graphic]] during sports broadcasts on the network, and in promotions to disambiguate events airing the broadcast network from those shown on the ESPN cable channel.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Deitsch|first=Richard|title=Worldwide leader expands|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/richard_deitsch/08/10/media.circus/|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=August 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823164614/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/richard_deitsch/08/10/media.circus/|archivedate=August 23, 2006|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe broadcast network's sports event coverage carried the ABC Sports brand prior to September 2, 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title='ESPN on ABC' to debut during college football season|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2545817&type=story|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=[[ESPN]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|date=August 10, 2006}}</ref> When ABC acquired a controlling interest in ESPN in 1984, it operated the cable network separately from its network sports division. The integration of ABC Sports with ESPN began after [[The Walt Disney Company]] bought ABC in 1996. The branding change to ''ESPN on ABC'' was made to better orient ESPN viewers with event telecasts on ABC and provide consistent branding for all sports broadcasts on [[Disney\u2013ABC Television Group|Disney-owned channels]] (shortly thereafter, [[ESPN2]]'s in-game graphics were likewise altered to simply use the main \"ESPN\" brand). Despite its name, ABC's sports coverage is supplemental to ESPN and (with occasional exceptions) not a [[simulcast]] of programs aired by the network, although ESPN and ESPN2 will often carry ABC's regional broadcasts that otherwise would not air in certain [[media market|market]]s.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Disney/ESPN===\nLike its longtime competitors [[CBS Sports]] and [[NBC Sports]], ABC Sports was originally part of the [[ABC News|news division]] of the ABC network, and, after 1961, was spun off into its own independent division.\n\nWhen [[Roone Arledge]] came to ABC Sports as a producer of [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] [[college football|football]] games in 1960, the network was in financial shambles. The [[International Olympic Committee]] even wanted a bank to guarantee ABC's contract to broadcast the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]]. At the time, [[Edgar Scherick]] served as the de facto head of ABC Sports. Scherick had joined the fledgling ABC television network when he persuaded it to purchase Sports Programs, Inc., in exchange for the network acquiring shares in the company.{{Sfn|Ford|2004|p=468}} Scherick had formed the company after he left [[CBS]], when the network would not make him the head of its sports programming unit (choosing to instead appoint former baseball [[public relations]] agent William C. McPhail). Before ABC Sports even became a formal division of the network, Scherick and ABC programming chief Tom Moore pulled off many programming deals involving the most popular American sporting events.\n\nWhile Scherick was not interested in \"For Men Only,\" he recognized the talent that Arledge had. Arledge realized ABC was the organization he was looking to become part of. The lack of a formal organization would offer him the opportunity to claim real power when the network matured. With this, he signed on with Scherick as an assistant producer, with Arledge eventually ascending to a role as executive producer of its sports telecasts.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=182}}\n\nSeveral months before ABC began broadcasting NCAA college football games, Arledge sent Scherick a remarkable memo, filled with youthful exuberance, and television production concepts which sports broadcasts have adhered to since. Network broadcasts of sporting events had previously consisted of simple set-ups and focused on the game itself. In his memo, Arledge not only offered another way to broadcast the game to the sports fan, but recognized that television had to take fans to the game. In addition, he had the forethought to realize that the broadcasts needed to attract, and hold the attention of female viewers, as well as males. On September 17, 1960, the then-29-year-old Arledge put his vision into reality with ABC's first NCAA college football broadcast from [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama, between the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] and the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia Bulldogs]] which Alabama won, 21\u20136.\n\nDespite the production values he brought to NCAA college football, Scherick wanted low-budget sports programming (as in inexpensive broadcasting rights) that could attract and retain an audience. He hit upon the idea of broadcasting [[track and field]] events sponsored by the [[Amateur Athletic Union]]. While Americans were not exactly fans of track and field events, Scherick figured that Americans understood games.\n\nIn January 1961, Scherick called Arledge into his office, and asked him to attend the annual AAU board of governors meeting. While he was shaking hands, Scherick said, \"if the mood seemed right, might he cut a deal to broadcast AAU events on ABC?\" It seemed like a tall assignment, however as Scherick said years later, \"Roone was a gentile and I was not.\" Arledge came back with a deal for ABC to broadcast all AAU events for $50,000 per year. Next, Scherick and Arledge divided up their NCAA college football sponsor list. They then telephoned their sponsors and said in so many words, \"Advertise on our new sports show coming up in April, or forget about buying commercials on NCAA college football this fall.\" The two persuaded enough sponsors to advertise on the broadcasts, though it took them to the last day of a deadline imposed by ABC's programming operations to do it.\n\n''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' \u2013 an [[anthology series]] featuring a different sporting event each broadcast, which premiered on the network on April 29, 1961<ref>{{cite web|title=Arledge Created Monday Night Football|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/arledgeobit.html|author=Mike Meserole|website=[[ESPN Classic]]|publisher=ESPN Inc.|date=December 6, 2002|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>{{Sfn|Ford|2004|p=466}} \u2013 suited Scherick's plans exactly. By exploiting the speed of jet transportation and flexibility of [[videotape]], Scherick was able to undercut [[NBC]] and CBS's advantages in broadcasting live sporting events. In that era, with communications nowhere near as universal as they are in the present day, ABC was able to safely record events on videotape for later broadcast without worrying about an audience finding out the results. Arledge, his colleague [[Chuck Howard]], and [[Jim McKay]] (who left CBS for this opportunity) made up the show on a week-by-week basis during the first year of ''Wide World''{{'}}s run. Arledge had a genius for the dramatic storyline that unfolded in the course of a game or event. McKay's honest curiosity and reporter's bluntness gave the show an emotional appeal which attracted viewers who might not have otherwise watched a sporting event. More importantly from Arledge's perspective, ''Wide World of Sports'' allowed him to demonstrate his ability as an administrator as well as a producer.\n\nHis ability to provide prime sports content was solidified in 1964, when ABC appointed Arledge as the vice president of ABC Sports.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roone Arledge at the Encyclopedia of Television|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/arledgeroon.htm|website=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=March 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224639/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/arledgeroon.htm|archive-date=December 2, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> That same year, Scherick left the sports division to become ABC's vice president of programming \u2013 leaving Arledge as the top executive at ABC Sports, although he would not gain a formal title as president for four years.\n\nIn 1968, Arledge was formally appointed as president of ABC Sports. As the sports division's president for the succeeding 18 years, his job was his hobby; as he described it, it was good because he watched sports for work rather than leisure, but had a downside as he had no time left for leisure activities. He made sportsmen into stars, a trend he would later bring to the news division where he lured established anchors and correspondents such as [[David Brinkley]] and [[Diane Sawyer]] and paid unheard-of salaries, including the first million-dollar contract to [[Barbara Walters]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Roone Arledge|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/win99/18_fr.html|website=[[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]]|date=June 18, 2008|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nArledge personally produced all ten of ABC's [[Olympic Games]] broadcasts, created the primetime ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and coined the famous \"thrill of victory, agony of defeat\" tagline first used on ''Wide World of Sports'' \u2013 although ABC insiders of that era attribute the authorship to legendary sports broadcaster Jim McKay. Over the next few years, the look of the network's sports telecasts became more intimate and entertaining as under Arledge, ABC introduced techniques such as [[slow motion]] replay, [[freeze-frame shot|freeze frame]], [[instant replay]], split-screen, hand-held cameras, endzone cameras, underwater cameras and cameras on cranes.\n\nAs part of an agreement with the [[National Football League]] (which completed its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] with the [[American Football League]] that year), ''Monday Night Football'' debuted on ABC in September 1970,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=210}} which served as the NFL's premier game of the week until 2006, when ''[[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'', which moved to [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] that year as part of a broadcast deal that in turn saw ''MNF'' move to ESPN, took over as the league's marquee game. Although it suffered a decline in ratings toward the end of its ABC run, the program was a hit for the network; according to ABC president [[Leonard Goldenson]], ''Monday Night Football'' helped regularly score ABC an audience share of 15%\u201316%.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=211}}\n\nWith the creation of ''Monday Night Football'', Arledge not only anchored ABC's primetime programming, but created a national pastime. At first, nobody \u2013 including the affiliates and the advertisers \u2013 supported the idea of primetime football games at the beginning of the week. Arledge said regarding this skepticism, \"But I thought there was something special about football, because there are so few games, and relatively few teams. Also, there is something about the look of a night game, with the lights bouncing off the helmets.\"\n\nIt was not only the lights that made watching Arledge-style football on ABC an event in itself. The games were transformed into events through the technical innovations envisioned by Arledge and through a new style of sportscaster embodied in [[Howard Cosell]]. ABC was the first network not to allow announcer approval by the league from which it was purchasing broadcast rights. Arledge said, \"[[NFL on CBS|CBS]] had been the basic football network. They treated it like a religion and would almost never criticize it. But if you screwed up on ''Monday Night Football'', Cosell would let everyone know about it.\" Arledge proudly pointed out that the program \"changed the habits of the nation.\"\n\nIn 1977, Arledge's executive responsibilities at ABC were expanded, and he was made president of ABC News while remaining as head of ABC Sports.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===1980s and 1990s: Disney purchase and ESPN integration===\n[[File:ABCSportsAt1993Indy500.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The ABC Sports broadcasting complex at the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]].]]\nThe seeds of its eventual integration with ESPN occurred when ABC acquired a controlling interest in ESPN from [[Getty Oil]] in 1984. One year later, [[Capital Cities Communications]] purchased ABC for [[United States dollar|US$]]3.5&nbsp;billion. Although some ESPN sportscasters such as [[John Saunders (journalist)|John Saunders]] and [[Dick Vitale]] began to also appear on ABC Sports telecasts and shared some sports content (particularly the [[United States Football League|USFL]]), ESPN and ABC Sports continued to operate as separate entities.\n\nAfter [[The Walt Disney Company]] bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, Disney started to slowly integrate ESPN and ABC Sports. ESPN personalities like [[Chris Berman]], [[Mike Tirico]] and [[Brad Nessler]] also began working on ABC Sports broadcasts. In 1998, ESPN adopted the graphics and music package used by ABC Sports for ''Monday Night Football'' for the network's ''Sunday Night Football'' broadcasts. ESPN graphics were also utilized on ABC's motorsports telecasts, including [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar]] and [[NASCAR]] events, during this period.\n\nThat same year, ESPN signed a five-year contract to televise [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) games, whereby the cable network essentially purchased time on ABC to air selected NHL games on the broadcast network. This was noted in [[copyright]] tags at the conclusion of the telecasts (i.e., ''\"The preceding program has been paid for by ESPN, Inc.\"''). ESPN later signed a similar television rights contract with the [[National Basketball Association]] in 2002, allowing it to produce and broadcast NBA games on ABC under a similar time buy on the broadcast network.<ref>{{cite news|title=Without Showing Games, ESPN Leaves a Mark on the N.B.A. Finals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/sports/basketball/without-showing-games-espn-leaves-a-mark-on-the-nba-finals.html?_r=0|author=[[Richard Sandomir]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132005: Continued integration===\n[[File:Abcsports06.png|thumb|right|300px|Alternate ABC Sports logo, used from 2001 to 2006.]]\nBetween 2000 and 2002, many ABC Sports programs utilized graphics almost identical to those used on ESPN. One notable exception was ''Monday Night Football'', which switched to a different graphics package as part of then-new producer [[Don Ohlmeyer]]'s attempt to provide some renewed vigor into those telecasts. Subsequently, ABC changed graphics packages each fall from 2002 to 2005, while ESPN's basically remained consistent.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney continued to consolidate the corporate structure of ESPN and ABC Sports. [[Steve Bornstein]] was given the title as president of ''both'' ESPN and ABC Sports in 1996. The sales, marketing, and production departments of both divisions were eventually merged. As a result, ESPN uses some union production crews for its coverage (as the networks normally do), whereas non-union personnel are quite common in cable sports broadcasting.\n\n===2006\u2013present: The end of ABC Sports and introduction of ESPN on ABC===\nIn August 2006, it was announced that ABC Sports would be totally integrated into ESPN, incorporating the graphics and music used by the cable channel and its related television properties, and production staff. The brand integration does not directly affect whether the ESPN cable channel or ABC carries a particular event, as in most cases this is governed by contracts with the applicable league or organization. Perhaps confusingly, this means that some events are broadcast with ESPN branding during ABC coverage, even though another channel owns the cable rights. For example, [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] held the cable television rights to the [[The Open Championship|British Open]] from 2003 to 2009 (with ABC carrying the tournament's weekend coverage); in addition, since 2009, ABC has shared the rights to IndyCar Series with [[NBCSN]]. IndyCar fans who have criticized ESPN on ABC's race broadcasts have used \"Always Bad Coverage\" as a derisive [[backronym]] pertaining to the quality of the telecasts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Miller's Mailbag, 7.12|url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/indycar-millers-mailbag-712/P3/|author=Robin Miller|website=[[Speed (TV network)|Speed]]|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports Media Group]]|date=July 12, 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, ESPN airs [[Major League Baseball]] games; however, ABC does not as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] holds the broadcast television rights to the league's game telecasts.\n\nThe last live sporting event televised under the ABC Sports banner was the United States Championship Game in the [[2006 Little League World Series|Little League World Series]] on Saturday, August 26, 2006 (ABC was slated to carry the Little League World Series Championship Game on Sunday, August 27, however [[rainout|rain forced the postponement of the game]] to the following Monday, August 28, with that game subsequently airing on [[ESPN2]]). The changeover took effect the following weekend to coincide with the start of the college football season, with [[NBA on ABC|NBA]], [[IndyCar Series on ABC|IndyCar Series]] and [[NASCAR on ABC|NASCAR]] coverage eventually following suit.\n\nHowever, ABC used a separate graphics package (incorporating the network's own logo) during its coverage of the final round of the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]], which were similar to the older-styled ESPN graphics but with a yellow base. In 2008, though, it utilized the newer yellow and red ESPN graphics which had been used on other recent telecasts, but with the ABC logo. These graphics were used through 2010. In 2011, the Bee was moved off of network TV and the telecast began to be produced by Scripps Television, which uses its own graphics.\n\n====Limited re-emphasis on ABC brand since 2015====\nAs ESPN has signed new contracts with various conferences to produce college football coverage, the network has begun branding its coverage of select conferences to which it has rights. This branding was first seen on SEC broadcasts in 2011, which became the \"SEC on ESPN\". ACC broadcasts followed suit in 2012 becoming the \"ACC on ESPN\". Despite the fact that ACC games also air on ABC, the games remain branded as the \"ACC on ESPN\" regardless of network. In 2016, a new contract brought conference branding to Big Ten telecasts as well, which air on both ESPN and ABC. While Big Ten games that air on ESPN cable channels are branded as the \"Big Ten on ESPN\", games airing on ABC are now branded as the \"Big Ten on ABC\". The next year, in 2017, the Pac-12 Conference began branding their games under the title, \"Pac-12 on ESPN\". While the program is still officially part of ''ESPN College Football'' which is reflected when talent appears on screen, the Big Ten on ABC logo and branding is used for intro, program IDs, and replay wipes. This is the first time any regularly scheduled sporting event outside of the National Spelling Bee has carried any ABC branding since 2006.\n\nAlso starting with ''Saturday Primetime'' in 2017, live NBA game action no longer shows the ESPN identification on screen. Previously under ESPN on ABC (since 2006\u201307), the ESPN logo was part of the score banner, while the ABC logo was separately floating on the right side of the screen, remaining on screen during replays. The version of the new 2016\u201317 graphics package used on ABC replaces the ESPN logo in the score banner with several stars, while the ABC logo (still constantly on screen) anchors the right side of the banner; however for the 2017\u201318 season, the ESPN logo was reintroduced onto a revised version of the score banner with the ABC logo still located to the right. In addition, commercial transitions for ABC games now contain the ABC logo. It is the first time NBA games on ABC don't have ESPN identification during live action since the 2006 NBA Finals.\n\n===ESPN, ABC Sports, and Hearst===\n[[File:ESPN on ABC.png|thumb|ESPN on ABC logo, used from its introduction in 2006 until 2012.]]\nDespite the rebranding, ABC Sports continues to exist, at least nominally, as a division of the ABC network. One indication of this was the retention of [[George Bodenheimer]]'s official title as \"President, ESPN Inc. and ABC Sports\" even after the rebranding \u2013 the second part of the title would presumably be unnecessary if ESPN had fully absorbed ABC's sports operations \u2013 though following Bodenheimer's retirement and the subsequent appointment of [[John Skipper]] at the end of 2011, the title was shortened to \"President, ESPN Inc.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney Promotes a New Leader at ESPN|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/disney-promotes-a-new-leader-at-espn/?pagewanted=all|author=Michael Cieply|author2=[[Brian Stelter]]|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 22, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}</ref> In addition, ABC itself maintains the copyright over many of the ESPN-branded broadcasts, if they are not contractually assigned to the applicable league or organizer, suggesting that ESPN has merely \"loaned\" usage of its [[brand licensing|brand name]], staff and infrastructure to ABC, rather than having acquired ABC Sports outright. [[ABC News Radio]] also continues to brand its short-form sports updates as ABC Sports Radio;<ref>[http://abcradio.com/programming/sports/sports-radio/ ABC Sports Radio] - [[ABC Radio (United States)|ABC Radio]] (accessed August 10, 2018)</ref> this service is separate from the [[ESPN Radio]] network.\n\nThis is likely a minor technicality stemming from ESPN being technically a joint venture between Disney (which owns an 80% controlling interest) and the [[Hearst Corporation]] (which owns the remaining 20%). Disney has long exercised operational control of the network, while Hearst is believed to be more of a [[Partnership|silent partner]] rather than an active participant in ESPN's management. However, this relationship does mean that Hearst's ABC-affiliated stations \u2013 such as [[WCVB-TV]] in [[Boston]]; [[WMUR-TV]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], New Hampshire; [[WTAE-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]]; [[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]]; [[WPBF-TV]] in [[West Palm Beach]]; and [[KMBC-TV]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] \u2013 have [[right of first refusal]] to local simulcasts of ESPN-televised [[Monday Night Football]] games involving home-market teams, which are very rarely waived to other stations within their markets. Equally, other Hearst-owned stations such as NBC affiliates [[WLWT-TV]] in [[Cincinnati]],  [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]], and [[WDSU|WDSU-TV]] in [[New Orleans]] have been able to air NFL games from ESPN for the same reason ([[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WMOR-TV]] in the [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] market is also eligible to air these games, but rarely if ever does so).<ref>[http://www.wbaltv.com/r/20348985/detail.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315222841/http://www.wbaltv.com/r/20348985/detail.html |date=March 15, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nUnder NFL broadcasting rules, the league's cable-televised games must be simulcast on broadcast television in the local markets of the teams playing in the broadcast, though the game is not permitted to air in the home team's market if tickets do not sell out 72 hours before kickoff \u2013 games that are not sold out must be [[National Football League television blackout policies|blacked out in the market of origin]] (due to the league's March 2015 decision to suspend its blackout policies, all NFL games televised by ESPN during the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]] are allowed to air on broadcast television in the originating market of the game and the home markets of both participating teams). Similar rules and rights were previously in place for ESPN-televised [[Major League Baseball]] playoff games, except in that non-sellout games were not blacked out (Major League Baseball does not black out games based on attendance, but rather to protect local broadcasters). ABC [[owned-and-operated station]]s also have right of first refusal for NFL (and previously [[Major League Baseball postseason]]) simulcasts from ESPN, though in recent years the stations have passed on airing the game telecasts in favor of carrying ABC's Monday night schedule, which includes the popular reality competition series ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.<ref name=chidal>{{cite news|title=WGN-TV To Carry Monday Night's Bears/Cowboys Game, Plus Local Pre-Game Show|url=http://chicagoradioandmedia.com/news/2818-wgn-tv-to-carry-monday-nights-bearscowboys-game-plus-local-pre-game-show|website=Chicagoland Radio and Media|date=October 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Siphoning===\n{{See also|Criticism of ESPN|Criticism of The Walt Disney Company}}\n\nESPN and The Walt Disney Company have been criticized for decreasing the amount of sports programming televised on ABC. Several ABC affiliates have also voiced opposition regarding the increasing migration of live sporting event telecasts from ABC to ESPN.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC affiliates upset about losing sports to ESPN|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/09/us-abc-idUSTRE6180JF20100209|author=Jon Consoli|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=February 9, 2010|access-date=September 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAn example was in regards to NASCAR race broadcasts: from 2007 to 2009, ABC aired all of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup races, along with one other race. From 2010 to 2014, only three Sprint Cup races and one Chase race ([[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]]) were shown on ABC, to the outrage of many NASCAR fans and sponsors. Several other events such as college football's [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] and [[Capital One Bowl]] games, and the British Open golf tournament have also been transferred from ABC to ESPN (although the Capital One Bowl would return to ABC in 2013). This, however, is not entirely the fault of ESPN, as ABC in general has attracted a primarily female viewership in recent years, with sports largely attracting a male-dominated \u2013though not exclusive \u2013 audience.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC adds 14 new shows for next season|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/05/abc-adds-14-new-shows-for-next-season-88787.html|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=[[WJLA-TV]]|publisher=[[Allbritton Communications Company]]|date=May 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe decrease in sports events televised by ABC has resulted in the network having a very inconsistent weekend afternoon sports schedule similar \u2013 if not somewhat equal \u2013 to Fox in previous years (and to some extent, to this day,{{When|date=February 2017}} even with the expansion of sports coverage on Fox since 2011); [[ESPN Sports Saturday|ESPN-produced sports specials]] (aired as part of the ''[[30 for 30]]'' and ''[[E:60]]'' anthology series) and/or more recently, [[figure skating]] and [[gymnastics]] specials supplied by Disson Skating (a subsidiary of independent production company Disson Sports & Entertainment) as well as syndicated programs or [[infomercial]]s scheduled by the network's owned-and-operated stations and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] fill the weekend afternoon schedule on days when the network is not scheduled to air a sporting event; until 2014, ABC-supplied [[rerun]] blocks of certain prime-time network shows and occasional theatrical film telecasts have also filled the schedule on weekend afternoons without a scheduled sports event. As a consequence of this, ABC turned over an hour of its then-existing two-hour Sunday afternoon block (from 4 to 5 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]) to its affiliates on June 21, 2015, reducing its Sunday schedule on weeks without major sporting events to one hour; the 5 p.m. (Eastern) hour that was retained is usually reserved for rebroadcasts of ESPN sports documentaries. However, as of January 2016, ABC rescinded the remaining hour of its Sunday afternoon schedule (5\u20136pm Eastern Time) back to its affiliates thus leaving ABC without a Sunday afternoon block (save for major sporting events). This exclusively relegated ABC's sports schedule to Saturday afternoons (and by extension, ABC's non-news weekend schedule to 3 to 6 pm and 8 to 11 pm on Saturdays and 7:00 to 11:00&nbsp;pm on Sundays). ABC's in-house network-programmed Sunday schedule not counting news-related programming as a result of this is now exclusively relegated to its four-hour prime time block (from 7 to 11 pm).\n\nIn the past few years,{{When|date=February 2017}} ABC has lost several lucrative sports contracts. It lost the rights for the American Le Mans Series in 2013 when it merged with the [[Rolex Grand Am Series]] to form the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] and subsequently moved to Fox in 2014, later moving to NBC Sports in 2019. It also ended its FIFA coverage after the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] with Fox acquiring the rights starting in 2015. It then lost its NASCAR broadcast rights the same year with rights being picked up by NBC in 2015. Also, it phased out the last of its college basketball coverage also in the same year (the [[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]]) with the tournament being moved to the ESPN cable networks, although college basketball would later return to the network in 2019. It also gave up its highlights show relating to the [[British Open]] golf tournament in 2015, as ESPN later sold the rights to NBC in 2016. In 2016, ABC ended its regularly scheduled doubleheaders for its NBA Sunday Showcase, opting to opening up a window for Saturday night games and leaving single games on Sunday afternoons in most cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=NBA on ABC Broadcast Schedule|url=http://www.nba.com/schedules/national_tv_schedule/ABC/index.html|website=National Basketball Association|access-date=January 4, 2016}}</ref> In addition, ABC discontinued airing [[Grantland]]-related programming when the brand shut down operations in October. The network also lost rights to broadcast the [[IndyCar Series]], including the [[Indianapolis 500]], in 2018 with the rights moving to NBC Sports, which has already been the series' cable partner (moving the race away from ABC after 54 years); coincidentally in that same year, ABC will air several Formula One races a year after ESPN acquired the F1 rights from NBC Sports.\n\nESPN began simulcasting an NFL Wild Card Playoff game on ABC starting in 2016, marking the first time ABC had an NFL game since [[Super Bowl XL]]; this was later followed by the Pro Bowl starting in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL Wild Card Playoff Game Will Return to ESPN \u2013 and Be Simulcast for the First Time on ABC|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2015/05/nfl-wild-card-playoff-game-will-return-espn-simulcast-first-time-abc/|access-date=January 4, 2016|agency=ESPN}}</ref> Additionally, ABC simulcast ESPN's coverage of rounds 4-7 of the [[2018 NFL Draft]]. Then, starting in 2019, ABC aired all three days of the draft.\n\nOn May 6, 2019, the [[XFL (2020)|XFL]] announced that [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Sports]] have acquired the rights to broadcast the league's return, with the broadcasts airing on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[ESPN]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[Fox Sports 1|FS1]].\n\n==Picture format differences from ESPN cable outlets==\nUnlike other ESPN networks, ESPN on ABC events were still produced with graphics and a BottomLine framed for the [[4:3]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] \u2013 as opposed to the [[16:9]] formatting used for the ticker and graphics on the ESPN family of networks, as well as CBS, Fox, and NBC's sports telecasts. However, beginning during the [[2016 Little League World Series]] in August 2016, ABC migrated to a 16:9 presentation for ESPN on ABC broadcasts, similar to the ESPN cable networks, as ABC's entertainment programming also switched to a 16:9 presentation in September.<ref name=\"wbrz-169\">{{cite web|title=Picture perfect: ABC now full 16:9; TVs might need to be updated|url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/picture-perfect-abc-now-full-16-9-tvs-might-need-to-be-updated/|website=WBRZ.com|publisher=Louisiana Television Broadcasting, LLC|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Taglines==\nUntil 2001, ABC Sports programs ended with the line \"This has been a presentation of ABC Sports. Recognized around the world as the leader in sports television.\" Beginning in 2001, ABC changed the tagline to \"ABC Sports: Championship Television,\" in regards to ABC's sports lineup (which included the BCS Championship Game, the Stanley Cup Finals, rights to Super Bowl coverage, and would later include the NBA Finals). Ever since the ESPN on ABC integration, the ESPN tagline \u2013 \"This has been a presentation of ESPN, The Worldwide Leader in Sports\" \u2013 has been used at the end of each broadcast on ABC. At the start of every broadcast, the tagline \"The following is a presentation/special presentation of ESPN on ABC\" is used, while ending with the tagline, \"This has been a presentation/special presentation of ESPN on ABC\"\n\nFor ABC's primetime college football games in 2018, every broadcast had the tagline, \"This is ESPN on ABC, brought to you in part by Samsung QLED TV, the official TV of [[ESPN College Football]]\", while every afternoon college football game had the regular tagline. This tagline became permanent for every college football game aired on ABC in 2019, except the [[2019 Pac-12 Football Championship Game|Pac-12 Championship Game]], as well as the, [[2019 Celebration

The ABC logo is used for identification purposes as a [[digital on-screen graphic]] during sports broadcasts on the network, and in promotions to disambiguate events airing the broadcast network from those shown on the ESPN cable channel.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Deitsch|first=Richard|title=Worldwide leader expands|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/richard_deitsch/08/10/media.circus/|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=August 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823164614/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/richard_deitsch/08/10/media.circus/|archivedate=August 23, 2006|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe broadcast network's sports event coverage carried the ABC Sports brand prior to September 2, 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title='ESPN on ABC' to debut during college football season|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2545817&type=story|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=[[ESPN]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|date=August 10, 2006}}</ref> When ABC acquired a controlling interest in ESPN in 1984, it operated the cable network separately from its network sports division. The integration of ABC Sports with ESPN began after [[The Walt Disney Company]] bought ABC in 1996. The branding change to ''ESPN on ABC'' was made to better orient ESPN viewers with event telecasts on ABC and provide consistent branding for all sports broadcasts on [[Disney\u2013ABC Television Group|Disney-owned channels]] (shortly thereafter, [[ESPN2]]'s in-game graphics were likewise altered to simply use the main \"ESPN\" brand). Despite its name, ABC's sports coverage is supplemental to ESPN and (with occasional exceptions) not a [[simulcast]] of programs aired by the network, although ESPN and ESPN2 will often carry ABC's regional broadcasts that otherwise would not air in certain [[media market|market]]s.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Disney/ESPN===\nLike its longtime competitors [[CBS Sports]] and [[NBC Sports]], ABC Sports was originally part of the [[ABC News|news division]] of the ABC network, and, after 1961, was spun off into its own independent division.\n\nWhen [[Roone Arledge]] came to ABC Sports as a producer of [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] [[college football|football]] games in 1960, the network was in financial shambles. The [[International Olympic Committee]] even wanted a bank to guarantee ABC's contract to broadcast the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]]. At the time, [[Edgar Scherick]] served as the de facto head of ABC Sports. Scherick had joined the fledgling ABC television network when he persuaded it to purchase Sports Programs, Inc., in exchange for the network acquiring shares in the company.{{Sfn|Ford|2004|p=468}} Scherick had formed the company after he left [[CBS]], when the network would not make him the head of its sports programming unit (choosing to instead appoint former baseball [[public relations]] agent William C. McPhail). Before ABC Sports even became a formal division of the network, Scherick and ABC programming chief Tom Moore pulled off many programming deals involving the most popular American sporting events.\n\nWhile Scherick was not interested in \"For Men Only,\" he recognized the talent that Arledge had. Arledge realized ABC was the organization he was looking to become part of. The lack of a formal organization would offer him the opportunity to claim real power when the network matured. With this, he signed on with Scherick as an assistant producer, with Arledge eventually ascending to a role as executive producer of its sports telecasts.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=182}}\n\nSeveral months before ABC began broadcasting NCAA college football games, Arledge sent Scherick a remarkable memo, filled with youthful exuberance, and television production concepts which sports broadcasts have adhered to since. Network broadcasts of sporting events had previously consisted of simple set-ups and focused on the game itself. In his memo, Arledge not only offered another way to broadcast the game to the sports fan, but recognized that television had to take fans to the game. In addition, he had the forethought to realize that the broadcasts needed to attract, and hold the attention of female viewers, as well as males. On September 17, 1960, the then-29-year-old Arledge put his vision into reality with ABC's first NCAA college football broadcast from [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama, between the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] and the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia Bulldogs]] which Alabama won, 21\u20136.\n\nDespite the production values he brought to NCAA college football, Scherick wanted low-budget sports programming (as in inexpensive broadcasting rights) that could attract and retain an audience. He hit upon the idea of broadcasting [[track and field]] events sponsored by the [[Amateur Athletic Union]]. While Americans were not exactly fans of track and field events, Scherick figured that Americans understood games.\n\nIn January 1961, Scherick called Arledge into his office, and asked him to attend the annual AAU board of governors meeting. While he was shaking hands, Scherick said, \"if the mood seemed right, might he cut a deal to broadcast AAU events on ABC?\" It seemed like a tall assignment, however as Scherick said years later, \"Roone was a gentile and I was not.\" Arledge came back with a deal for ABC to broadcast all AAU events for $50,000 per year. Next, Scherick and Arledge divided up their NCAA college football sponsor list. They then telephoned their sponsors and said in so many words, \"Advertise on our new sports show coming up in April, or forget about buying commercials on NCAA college football this fall.\" The two persuaded enough sponsors to advertise on the broadcasts, though it took them to the last day of a deadline imposed by ABC's programming operations to do it.\n\n''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' \u2013 an [[anthology series]] featuring a different sporting event each broadcast, which premiered on the network on April 29, 1961<ref>{{cite web|title=Arledge Created Monday Night Football|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/arledgeobit.html|author=Mike Meserole|website=[[ESPN Classic]]|publisher=ESPN Inc.|date=December 6, 2002|accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>{{Sfn|Ford|2004|p=466}} \u2013 suited Scherick's plans exactly. By exploiting the speed of jet transportation and flexibility of [[videotape]], Scherick was able to undercut [[NBC]] and CBS's advantages in broadcasting live sporting events. In that era, with communications nowhere near as universal as they are in the present day, ABC was able to safely record events on videotape for later broadcast without worrying about an audience finding out the results. Arledge, his colleague [[Chuck Howard]], and [[Jim McKay]] (who left CBS for this opportunity) made up the show on a week-by-week basis during the first year of ''Wide World''{{'}}s run. Arledge had a genius for the dramatic storyline that unfolded in the course of a game or event. McKay's honest curiosity and reporter's bluntness gave the show an emotional appeal which attracted viewers who might not have otherwise watched a sporting event. More importantly from Arledge's perspective, ''Wide World of Sports'' allowed him to demonstrate his ability as an administrator as well as a producer.\n\nHis ability to provide prime sports content was solidified in 1964, when ABC appointed Arledge as the vice president of ABC Sports.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roone Arledge at the Encyclopedia of Television|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/arledgeroon.htm|website=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=March 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224639/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/arledgeroon.htm|archive-date=December 2, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> That same year, Scherick left the sports division to become ABC's vice president of programming \u2013 leaving Arledge as the top executive at ABC Sports, although he would not gain a formal title as president for four years.\n\nIn 1968, Arledge was formally appointed as president of ABC Sports. As the sports division's president for the succeeding 18 years, his job was his hobby; as he described it, it was good because he watched sports for work rather than leisure, but had a downside as he had no time left for leisure activities. He made sportsmen into stars, a trend he would later bring to the news division where he lured established anchors and correspondents such as [[David Brinkley]] and [[Diane Sawyer]] and paid unheard-of salaries, including the first million-dollar contract to [[Barbara Walters]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Roone Arledge|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/win99/18_fr.html|website=[[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]]|date=June 18, 2008|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nArledge personally produced all ten of ABC's [[Olympic Games]] broadcasts, created the primetime ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and coined the famous \"thrill of victory, agony of defeat\" tagline first used on ''Wide World of Sports'' \u2013 although ABC insiders of that era attribute the authorship to legendary sports broadcaster Jim McKay. Over the next few years, the look of the network's sports telecasts became more intimate and entertaining as under Arledge, ABC introduced techniques such as [[slow motion]] replay, [[freeze-frame shot|freeze frame]], [[instant replay]], split-screen, hand-held cameras, endzone cameras, underwater cameras and cameras on cranes.\n\nAs part of an agreement with the [[National Football League]] (which completed its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] with the [[American Football League]] that year), ''Monday Night Football'' debuted on ABC in September 1970,{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=210}} which served as the NFL's premier game of the week until 2006, when ''[[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'', which moved to [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] that year as part of a broadcast deal that in turn saw ''MNF'' move to ESPN, took over as the league's marquee game. Although it suffered a decline in ratings toward the end of its ABC run, the program was a hit for the network; according to ABC president [[Leonard Goldenson]], ''Monday Night Football'' helped regularly score ABC an audience share of 15%\u201316%.{{Sfn|Goldenson|Wolf|1991\u20131993|p=211}}\n\nWith the creation of ''Monday Night Football'', Arledge not only anchored ABC's primetime programming, but created a national pastime. At first, nobody \u2013 including the affiliates and the advertisers \u2013 supported the idea of primetime football games at the beginning of the week. Arledge said regarding this skepticism, \"But I thought there was something special about football, because there are so few games, and relatively few teams. Also, there is something about the look of a night game, with the lights bouncing off the helmets.\"\n\nIt was not only the lights that made watching Arledge-style football on ABC an event in itself. The games were transformed into events through the technical innovations envisioned by Arledge and through a new style of sportscaster embodied in [[Howard Cosell]]. ABC was the first network not to allow announcer approval by the league from which it was purchasing broadcast rights. Arledge said, \"[[NFL on CBS|CBS]] had been the basic football network. They treated it like a religion and would almost never criticize it. But if you screwed up on ''Monday Night Football'', Cosell would let everyone know about it.\" Arledge proudly pointed out that the program \"changed the habits of the nation.\"\n\nIn 1977, Arledge's executive responsibilities at ABC were expanded, and he was made president of ABC News while remaining as head of ABC Sports.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===1980s and 1990s: Disney purchase and ESPN integration===\n[[File:ABCSportsAt1993Indy500.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The ABC Sports broadcasting complex at the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]].]]\nThe seeds of its eventual integration with ESPN occurred when ABC acquired a controlling interest in ESPN from [[Getty Oil]] in 1984. One year later, [[Capital Cities Communications]] purchased ABC for [[United States dollar|US$]]3.5&nbsp;billion. Although some ESPN sportscasters such as [[John Saunders (journalist)|John Saunders]] and [[Dick Vitale]] began to also appear on ABC Sports telecasts and shared some sports content (particularly the [[United States Football League|USFL]]), ESPN and ABC Sports continued to operate as separate entities.\n\nAfter [[The Walt Disney Company]] bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, Disney started to slowly integrate ESPN and ABC Sports. ESPN personalities like [[Chris Berman]], [[Mike Tirico]] and [[Brad Nessler]] also began working on ABC Sports broadcasts. In 1998, ESPN adopted the graphics and music package used by ABC Sports for ''Monday Night Football'' for the network's ''Sunday Night Football'' broadcasts. ESPN graphics were also utilized on ABC's motorsports telecasts, including [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar]] and [[NASCAR]] events, during this period.\n\nThat same year, ESPN signed a five-year contract to televise [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) games, whereby the cable network essentially purchased time on ABC to air selected NHL games on the broadcast network. This was noted in [[copyright]] tags at the conclusion of the telecasts (i.e., ''\"The preceding program has been paid for by ESPN, Inc.\"''). ESPN later signed a similar television rights contract with the [[National Basketball Association]] in 2002, allowing it to produce and broadcast NBA games on ABC under a similar time buy on the broadcast network.<ref>{{cite news|title=Without Showing Games, ESPN Leaves a Mark on the N.B.A. Finals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/sports/basketball/without-showing-games-espn-leaves-a-mark-on-the-nba-finals.html?_r=0|author=[[Richard Sandomir]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132005: Continued integration===\n[[File:Abcsports06.png|thumb|right|300px|Alternate ABC Sports logo, used from 2001 to 2006.]]\nBetween 2000 and 2002, many ABC Sports programs utilized graphics almost identical to those used on ESPN. One notable exception was ''Monday Night Football'', which switched to a different graphics package as part of then-new producer [[Don Ohlmeyer]]'s attempt to provide some renewed vigor into those telecasts. Subsequently, ABC changed graphics packages each fall from 2002 to 2005, while ESPN's basically remained consistent.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney continued to consolidate the corporate structure of ESPN and ABC Sports. [[Steve Bornstein]] was given the title as president of ''both'' ESPN and ABC Sports in 1996. The sales, marketing, and production departments of both divisions were eventually merged. As a result, ESPN uses some union production crews for its coverage (as the networks normally do), whereas non-union personnel are quite common in cable sports broadcasting.\n\n===2006\u2013present: The end of ABC Sports and introduction of ESPN on ABC===\nIn August 2006, it was announced that ABC Sports would be totally integrated into ESPN, incorporating the graphics and music used by the cable channel and its related television properties, and production staff. The brand integration does not directly affect whether the ESPN cable channel or ABC carries a particular event, as in most cases this is governed by contracts with the applicable league or organization. Perhaps confusingly, this means that some events are broadcast with ESPN branding during ABC coverage, even though another channel owns the cable rights. For example, [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] held the cable television rights to the [[The Open Championship|British Open]] from 2003 to 2009 (with ABC carrying the tournament's weekend coverage); in addition, since 2009, ABC has shared the rights to IndyCar Series with [[NBCSN]]. IndyCar fans who have criticized ESPN on ABC's race broadcasts have used \"Always Bad Coverage\" as a derisive [[backronym]] pertaining to the quality of the telecasts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Miller's Mailbag, 7.12|url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/indycar-millers-mailbag-712/P3/|author=Robin Miller|website=[[Speed (TV network)|Speed]]|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports Media Group]]|date=July 12, 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, ESPN airs [[Major League Baseball]] games; however, ABC does not as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] holds the broadcast television rights to the league's game telecasts.\n\nThe last live sporting event televised under the ABC Sports banner was the United States Championship Game in the [[2006 Little League World Series|Little League World Series]] on Saturday, August 26, 2006 (ABC was slated to carry the Little League World Series Championship Game on Sunday, August 27, however [[rainout|rain forced the postponement of the game]] to the following Monday, August 28, with that game subsequently airing on [[ESPN2]]). The changeover took effect the following weekend to coincide with the start of the college football season, with [[NBA on ABC|NBA]], [[IndyCar Series on ABC|IndyCar Series]] and [[NASCAR on ABC|NASCAR]] coverage eventually following suit.\n\nHowever, ABC used a separate graphics package (incorporating the network's own logo) during its coverage of the final round of the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]], which were similar to the older-styled ESPN graphics but with a yellow base. In 2008, though, it utilized the newer yellow and red ESPN graphics which had been used on other recent telecasts, but with the ABC logo. These graphics were used through 2010. In 2011, the Bee was moved off of network TV and the telecast began to be produced by Scripps Television, which uses its own graphics.\n\n====Limited re-emphasis on ABC brand since 2015====\nAs ESPN has signed new contracts with various conferences to produce college football coverage, the network has begun branding its coverage of select conferences to which it has rights. This branding was first seen on SEC broadcasts in 2011, which became the \"SEC on ESPN\". ACC broadcasts followed suit in 2012 becoming the \"ACC on ESPN\". Despite the fact that ACC games also air on ABC, the games remain branded as the \"ACC on ESPN\" regardless of network. In 2016, a new contract brought conference branding to Big Ten telecasts as well, which air on both ESPN and ABC. While Big Ten games that air on ESPN cable channels are branded as the \"Big Ten on ESPN\", games airing on ABC are now branded as the \"Big Ten on ABC\". The next year, in 2017, the Pac-12 Conference began branding their games under the title, \"Pac-12 on ESPN\". While the program is still officially part of ''ESPN College Football'' which is reflected when talent appears on screen, the Big Ten on ABC logo and branding is used for intro, program IDs, and replay wipes. This is the first time any regularly scheduled sporting event outside of the National Spelling Bee has carried any ABC branding since 2006.\n\nAlso starting with ''Saturday Primetime'' in 2017, live NBA game action no longer shows the ESPN identification on screen. Previously under ESPN on ABC (since 2006\u201307), the ESPN logo was part of the score banner, while the ABC logo was separately floating on the right side of the screen, remaining on screen during replays. The version of the new 2016\u201317 graphics package used on ABC replaces the ESPN logo in the score banner with several stars, while the ABC logo (still constantly on screen) anchors the right side of the banner; however for the 2017\u201318 season, the ESPN logo was reintroduced onto a revised version of the score banner with the ABC logo still located to the right. In addition, commercial transitions for ABC games now contain the ABC logo. It is the first time NBA games on ABC don't have ESPN identification during live action since the 2006 NBA Finals.\n\n===ESPN, ABC Sports, and Hearst===\n[[File:ESPN on ABC.png|thumb|ESPN on ABC logo, used from its introduction in 2006 until 2012.]]\nDespite the rebranding, ABC Sports continues to exist, at least nominally, as a division of the ABC network. One indication of this was the retention of [[George Bodenheimer]]'s official title as \"President, ESPN Inc. and ABC Sports\" even after the rebranding \u2013 the second part of the title would presumably be unnecessary if ESPN had fully absorbed ABC's sports operations \u2013 though following Bodenheimer's retirement and the subsequent appointment of [[John Skipper]] at the end of 2011, the title was shortened to \"President, ESPN Inc.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney Promotes a New Leader at ESPN|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/disney-promotes-a-new-leader-at-espn/?pagewanted=all|author=Michael Cieply|author2=[[Brian Stelter]]|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 22, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}</ref> In addition, ABC itself maintains the copyright over many of the ESPN-branded broadcasts, if they are not contractually assigned to the applicable league or organizer, suggesting that ESPN has merely \"loaned\" usage of its [[brand licensing|brand name]], staff and infrastructure to ABC, rather than having acquired ABC Sports outright. [[ABC News Radio]] also continues to brand its short-form sports updates as ABC Sports Radio;<ref>[http://abcradio.com/programming/sports/sports-radio/ ABC Sports Radio] - [[ABC Radio (United States)|ABC Radio]] (accessed August 10, 2018)</ref> this service is separate from the [[ESPN Radio]] network.\n\nThis is likely a minor technicality stemming from ESPN being technically a joint venture between Disney (which owns an 80% controlling interest) and the [[Hearst Corporation]] (which owns the remaining 20%). Disney has long exercised operational control of the network, while Hearst is believed to be more of a [[Partnership|silent partner]] rather than an active participant in ESPN's management. However, this relationship does mean that Hearst's ABC-affiliated stations \u2013 such as [[WCVB-TV]] in [[Boston]]; [[WMUR-TV]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], New Hampshire; [[WTAE-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]]; [[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]]; [[WPBF-TV]] in [[West Palm Beach]]; and [[KMBC-TV]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] \u2013 have [[right of first refusal]] to local simulcasts of ESPN-televised [[Monday Night Football]] games involving home-market teams, which are very rarely waived to other stations within their markets. Equally, other Hearst-owned stations such as NBC affiliates [[WLWT-TV]] in [[Cincinnati]],  [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]], and [[WDSU|WDSU-TV]] in [[New Orleans]] have been able to air NFL games from ESPN for the same reason ([[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WMOR-TV]] in the [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] market is also eligible to air these games, but rarely if ever does so).<ref>[http://www.wbaltv.com/r/20348985/detail.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315222841/http://www.wbaltv.com/r/20348985/detail.html |date=March 15, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nUnder NFL broadcasting rules, the league's cable-televised games must be simulcast on broadcast television in the local markets of the teams playing in the broadcast, though the game is not permitted to air in the home team's market if tickets do not sell out 72 hours before kickoff \u2013 games that are not sold out must be [[National Football League television blackout policies|blacked out in the market of origin]] (due to the league's March 2015 decision to suspend its blackout policies, all NFL games televised by ESPN during the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]] are allowed to air on broadcast television in the originating market of the game and the home markets of both participating teams). Similar rules and rights were previously in place for ESPN-televised [[Major League Baseball]] playoff games, except in that non-sellout games were not blacked out (Major League Baseball does not black out games based on attendance, but rather to protect local broadcasters). ABC [[owned-and-operated station]]s also have right of first refusal for NFL (and previously [[Major League Baseball postseason]]) simulcasts from ESPN, though in recent years the stations have passed on airing the game telecasts in favor of carrying ABC's Monday night schedule, which includes the popular reality competition series ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.<ref name=chidal>{{cite news|title=WGN-TV To Carry Monday Night's Bears/Cowboys Game, Plus Local Pre-Game Show|url=http://chicagoradioandmedia.com/news/2818-wgn-tv-to-carry-monday-nights-bearscowboys-game-plus-local-pre-game-show|website=Chicagoland Radio and Media|date=October 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Siphoning===\n{{See also|Criticism of ESPN|Criticism of The Walt Disney Company}}\n\nESPN and The Walt Disney Company have been criticized for decreasing the amount of sports programming televised on ABC.

From 2010 to 2014, only three Sprint Cup races and one Chase race ([[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]]) were shown on ABC, to the outrage of many NASCAR fans and sponsors. Several other events such as college football's [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] and [[Capital One Bowl]] games, and the British Open golf tournament have also been transferred from ABC to ESPN (although the Capital One Bowl would return to ABC in 2013). This, however, is not entirely the fault of ESPN, as ABC in general has attracted a primarily female viewership in recent years, with sports largely attracting a male-dominated \u2013though not exclusive \u2013 audience.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC adds 14 new shows for next season|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/05/abc-adds-14-new-shows-for-next-season-88787.html|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=[[WJLA-TV]]|publisher=[[Allbritton Communications Company]]|date=May 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe decrease in sports events televised by ABC has resulted in the network having a very inconsistent weekend afternoon sports schedule similar \u2013 if not somewhat equal \u2013 to Fox in previous years (and to some extent, to this day,{{When|date=February 2017}} even with the expansion of sports coverage on Fox since 2011); [[ESPN Sports Saturday|ESPN-produced sports specials]] (aired as part of the ''[[30 for 30]]'' and ''[[E:60]]'' anthology series) and/or more recently, [[figure skating]] and [[gymnastics]] specials supplied by Disson Skating (a subsidiary of independent production company Disson Sports & Entertainment) as well as syndicated programs or [[infomercial]]s scheduled by the network's owned-and-operated stations and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] fill the weekend afternoon schedule on days when the network is not scheduled to air a sporting event; until 2014, ABC-supplied [[rerun]] blocks of certain prime-time network shows and occasional theatrical film telecasts have also filled the schedule on weekend afternoons without a scheduled sports event. As a consequence of this, ABC turned over an hour of its then-existing two-hour Sunday afternoon block (from 4 to 5 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]) to its affiliates on June 21, 2015, reducing its Sunday schedule on weeks without major sporting events to one hour; the 5 p.m. (Eastern) hour that was retained is usually reserved for rebroadcasts of ESPN sports documentaries. However, as of January 2016, ABC rescinded the remaining hour of its Sunday afternoon schedule (5\u20136pm Eastern Time) back to its affiliates thus leaving ABC without a Sunday afternoon block (save for major sporting events). This exclusively relegated ABC's sports schedule to Saturday afternoons (and by extension, ABC's non-news weekend schedule to 3 to 6 pm and 8 to 11 pm on Saturdays and 7:00 to 11:00&nbsp;pm on Sundays). ABC's in-house network-programmed Sunday schedule not counting news-related programming as a result of this is now exclusively relegated to its four-hour prime time block (from 7 to 11 pm).\n\nIn the past few years,{{When|date=February 2017}} ABC has lost several lucrative sports contracts. It lost the rights for the American Le Mans Series in 2013 when it merged with the [[Rolex Grand Am Series]] to form the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] and subsequently moved to Fox in 2014, later moving to NBC Sports in 2019. It also ended its FIFA coverage after the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] with Fox acquiring the rights starting in 2015. It then lost its NASCAR broadcast rights the same year with rights being picked up by NBC in 2015. Also, it phased out the last of its college basketball coverage also in the same year (the [[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]]) with the tournament being moved to the ESPN cable networks, although college basketball would later return to the network in 2019. It also gave up its highlights show relating to the [[British Open]] golf tournament in 2015, as ESPN later sold the rights to NBC in 2016. In 2016, ABC ended its regularly scheduled doubleheaders for its NBA Sunday Showcase, opting to opening up a window for Saturday night games and leaving single games on Sunday afternoons in most cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=NBA on ABC Broadcast Schedule|url=http://www.nba.com/schedules/national_tv_schedule/ABC/index.html|website=National Basketball Association|access-date=January 4, 2016}}</ref> In addition, ABC discontinued airing [[Grantland]]-related programming when the brand shut down operations in October. The network also lost rights to broadcast the [[IndyCar Series]], including the [[Indianapolis 500]], in 2018 with the rights moving to NBC Sports, which has already been the series' cable partner (moving the race away from ABC after 54 years); coincidentally in that same year, ABC will air several Formula One races a year after ESPN acquired the F1 rights from NBC Sports.\n\nESPN began simulcasting an NFL Wild Card Playoff game on ABC starting in 2016, marking the first time ABC had an NFL game since [[Super Bowl XL]]; this was later followed by the Pro Bowl starting in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL Wild Card Playoff Game Will Return to ESPN \u2013 and Be Simulcast for the First Time on ABC|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2015/05/nfl-wild-card-playoff-game-will-return-espn-simulcast-first-time-abc/|access-date=January 4, 2016|agency=ESPN}}</ref> Additionally, ABC simulcast ESPN's coverage of rounds 4-7 of the [[2018 NFL Draft]].

However, beginning during the [[2016 Little League World Series]] in August 2016, ABC migrated to a 16:9 presentation for ESPN on ABC broadcasts, similar to the ESPN cable networks, as ABC's entertainment programming also switched to a 16:9 presentation in September.<ref name=\"wbrz-169\">{{cite web|title=Picture perfect: ABC now full 16:9; TVs might need to be updated|url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/picture-perfect-abc-now-full-16-9-tvs-might-need-to-be-updated/|website=WBRZ.com|publisher=Louisiana Television Broadcasting, LLC|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Taglines==\nUntil 2001, ABC Sports programs ended with the line \"This has been a presentation of ABC Sports.

Ever since the ESPN on ABC integration, the ESPN tagline \u2013 \"This has been a presentation of ESPN, The Worldwide Leader in Sports\" \u2013 has been used at the end of each broadcast on ABC. At the start of every broadcast, the tagline \"The following is a presentation/special presentation of ESPN on ABC\" is used, while ending with the tagline, \"This has been a presentation/special presentation of ESPN on ABC\"\n\nFor ABC's primetime college football games in 2018, every broadcast had the tagline, \"This is ESPN on ABC, brought to you in part by Samsung QLED TV, the official TV of [[ESPN College Football]]\", while every afternoon college football game had the regular tagline.

To be selected as Secretary-General, a candidate must receive the votes of at least 9 members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], with no vetoes from permanent members. The Secretary-General is then appointed by a majority vote of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].\n\nAlthough the process is informally called an election,<ref>{{cite news|title=Portugal's Antonio Guterres elected UN secretary-general|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-37648265|work=BBC News|date=14 October 2016}}</ref> the United Nations refers to it as the \"procedure of selecting and appointing the next United Nations Secretary-General.\"<ref name=\"un2016\">{{cite web|title=Procedure of Selecting and Appointing the next UN Secretary-General|url=https://www.un.org/pga/71/sg/|publisher=United Nations}}</ref> Since the General Assembly has never refused to appoint the person recommended by the Security Council, it is the selection of the Security Council that determines the next Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\n== History ==\n\nFew formal rules govern the selection of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. The only guiding text, Article 97 of the [[United Nations Charter]], states \"The Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.\" The Charter's minimal language has since been supplemented by other procedural rules and accepted practices. In 1946, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted a resolution stating it was \"desirable for the Security Council to proffer one candidate only for the consideration of the General Assembly, and for debate on the nomination in the General Assembly to be avoided.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=A/RES/11(I) Terms of Appointment of the Secretary-General |url=https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/11(I) |website=UN Docs |publisher=United Nations}}</ref>\n\nThe selection is subject to the veto of any of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].<ref>{{cite book |first= Simon |last= Chesterman |contributor-link= Simon Chesterman |contribution= Introduction |editor-first= Simon |editor-last= Chesterman |title= Secretary or General?

To break the deadlocked selection of 1981, the Security Council began to take [[straw poll]]s by [[secret ballot]].<ref name=\"sievers2014\">{{cite book|last1=Sievers|first1=Loraine|last2=Davis|first2=Sam|title=The Procedure of the UN Security Council|date=2014|publisher=Oxford Univ Press|isbn=9780199685295|edition=4}}</ref>{{rp|411}} The system of straw polls was set down on paper in 1996 as the Wisnumurti Guidelines.<ref name=\"wisnumurti\">{{cite web|title=The 'Wisnumurti Guidelines' for Selecting a Candidate for Secretary-General|url=http://www.unelections.org/files/WisnumurtiGuidelinesSelectingCandidateSecretary-General.pdf|publisher=UNElections.org}}</ref>\n\n== Procedure ==\n\nSeveral months before the current Secretary-General's term ends, a [[straw poll]] is taken by [[secret ballot]] among the members of the Security Council. Votes are cast to \"encourage\" or \"discourage\" a particular candidate, or express \"no opinion.\"<ref name=\"wisnumurti\"/> The votes of the permanent members are mixed in with the votes of the rotating members, so any vetoes are not yet revealed. Based on the results of the straw poll, candidates may withdraw, and new candidates may be nominated. Additional rounds of polling are conducted until a likely winner emerges.\n\nThe next round of straw polling reveals the existence of any vetoes. The permanent members vote on red paper, and the rotating members vote on white paper.<ref name=\"wisnumurti\"/> If any permanent members vote \"discourage,\" this is treated as a likely veto. Straw polling continues until a candidate has no vetoes and more \"encourage\" votes than the other candidates. The Security Council then votes to recommend the candidate to the General Assembly. Since 1996, the vote has been taken by acclamation so that the Secretary-General is recommended unanimously.<ref>{{cite web|title=Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council|url=https://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/2000-2003/00-03_6.pdf|page=224}}</ref>\n\nIn the last stage, the General Assembly formally appoints the recommended candidate as Secretary-General. In every selection except 1950, the General Assembly has voted by acclamation so that the Secretary-General is appointed unanimously.<ref name=\"sievers2014\"/>{{rp|404}} No candidate recommended by the Security Council has ever been rejected by the General Assembly. However, the threat of a negative vote in the General Assembly hangs over the deliberations of the Security Council.\n\nThe process of selecting a Secretary-General is often compared to a [[papal conclave]].<ref name=\n\"nytimes20160722\">{{cite news|last1=Sengupta|first1=Somini|title=Secrecy Reigns as U.N.

However, some qualifications have been established through precedent and are supported by the veto power of China and France. The United States and the United Kingdom do not accept the Sino-French qualifications and have supported candidates who do not meet the requirements.\n\nNo candidate from the [[permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|Permanent Five]] has ever been nominated for the position of Secretary-General, as it would increase the concentration of power in the United Nations.<ref name=\"scr\">{{cite web|title=Selecting the UN Secretary-General: Vetoes, Timing and Regional Rotation|url=http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/images/homepage/September%202015%20Insert.pdf|publisher=Security Council Report|accessdate=30 December 2016|date=20 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Term limit ===\nThe office is subject to a [[term limit]] of two full terms. [[U&nbsp;Thant]] served three terms, but his first two terms were partial terms that added up to one full term. In 1981, China cast 16 vetoes against [[Kurt Waldheim]]\u2019s selection for a third term, and Waldheim eventually suspended his candidacy. Since 1981, no Secretary-General has attempted to run for a third term.\n\n=== Regional rotation ===\n\nThe office of Secretary-General is rotated among the [[United Nations Regional Groups|regional groups]] of the UN. Each region gets two or three consecutive terms as Secretary-General.

Votes are cast to \"encourage\" or \"discourage\" a particular candidate, or express \"no opinion.\"<ref name=\"wisnumurti\"/> The votes of the permanent members are mixed in with the votes of the rotating members, so any vetoes are not yet revealed. Based on the results of the straw poll, candidates may withdraw, and new candidates may be nominated. Additional rounds of polling are conducted until a likely winner emerges.\n\nThe next round of straw polling reveals the existence of any vetoes. The permanent members vote on red paper, and the rotating members vote on white paper.<ref name=\"wisnumurti\"/> If any permanent members vote \"discourage,\" this is treated as a likely veto. Straw polling continues until a candidate has no vetoes and more \"encourage\" votes than the other candidates. The Security Council then votes to recommend the candidate to the General Assembly. Since 1996, the vote has been taken by acclamation so that the Secretary-General is recommended unanimously.<ref>{{cite web|title=Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council|url=https://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/2000-2003/00-03_6.pdf|page=224}}</ref>\n\nIn the last stage, the General Assembly formally appoints the recommended candidate as Secretary-General. In every selection except 1950, the General Assembly has voted by acclamation so that the Secretary-General is appointed unanimously.<ref name=\"sievers2014\"/>{{rp|404}} No candidate recommended by the Security Council has ever been rejected by the General Assembly.

Since then, the Soviet Union had ignored Lie, addressing all communications to \"The Secretariat\" rather than the Secretary-General.  With negotiations for a [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] in progress, Lie felt that a new Secretary-General could restore a working relationship with the Soviet Union.  Both superpowers experienced a change of government during the selection, with [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s inauguration in January 1953 and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in March 1953.\n\nThe United Kingdom campaigned vigorously for [[Lester B.

Boutros-Ghali was selected by a vote of 11-0-4.<ref name=\"sievers2014\"/>{{rp|411\u2013412}}<ref name=\"nytimes19911122\"/>\n\n=== 1996 and 2001 ===\n\n{{Main|United Nations Secretary-General selection, 1996}}\n\nThe elderly Boutros-Ghali initially intended to serve only one term, but he ran unopposed for a second term in 1996. The Security Council voted 14-1-0 in favour of his re-selection, but the single negative vote was a veto from the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Crossette|first1=Barbara|title=Round One in the U.N.

Over multiple rounds, the United States and the United Kingdom vetoed all candidates from French-speaking countries, while France vetoed all candidates from English-speaking countries. The deadlock was broken when France abstained in the final round, allowing [[Kofi Annan]] of Ghana to win with a vote of 14-0-1.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Crossette|first1=Barbara|title=Ghanaian Chosen to Head the U.N., Ending Standoff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/14/world/ghanaian-chosen-to-head-the-un-ending-standoff.html|work=The New York Times|date=14 December 1996}}</ref>\n\nKofi Annan ran unopposed in 2001 and was re-selected unanimously by the Security Council.\n\n=== 2006 and 2011 ===\n\n{{Main|United Nations Secretary-General selection, 2006}}\n\nIn 2006, [[Ban Ki-moon]] of South Korea led the polling from the first round. In the final straw poll, Ban received a vote of 14-0-1. [[Shashi Tharoor]] of India came in second with a vote of 10-3-2, with 1 veto by the United States.\n\nBan Ki-moon ran unopposed in 2011 and was re-selected unanimously by the Security Council.\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n{{Main|United Nations Secretary-General selection, 2016}}\n\nIn 2016, Eastern Europe was favoured for Secretary-General, as it was the only regional grouping that had not yet held the office. There was also a campaign to select the first female Secretary-General. Of the 13 candidates, 9 were from Eastern Europe, and 7 were women.\n\nInstead of collaborating to select an Eastern European woman, the two campaigns both failed. [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]], a man from Portugal, led the polling from the first round and never lost the lead. Guterres won the final round with a vote of 13-0-2 and was the only candidate not to be vetoed. Therefore, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres became the next Secretary-General, the first Western European to hold the post since 1981.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation|title=United Nations, 1961\u20131963 |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v25 |series=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961\u20131963 |volume=Volume XXV |editor-last1=Claussen |editor-first1=Paul |editor-last2=Duncan |editor-first2=Evan M. |editor-last3=Soukup |editor-first3=Jeffrey A. |year=2001 |location=Washington |publisher=United States Government Printing Office | ref=CITEREFFRUS 1961\u20131963 XXV}}\n\n{{United Nations Secretary-General selections}}\n\n[[Category:United Nations Secretariat]]\n[[Category:Secretaries-General of the United Nations]]\n", "name_user": "Tozar80", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed broken link.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretary-General_selection"}
